How should you manage a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis despite taking oral metronidazole?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to manage recurrent bacterial vaginosis despite taking oral metronidazole. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and distinguishing persistence versus true recurrence. Then, I should verify adherence and whether the initial regimen was optimal. Next, I will review modifiable risk factors and microbiologic predictors of recurrence. After that, I need to select evidence-based re-treatment and suppressive strategies, consider the evolving evidence on partner treatment, and evaluate adjunctive probiotic and biofilm-directed options. Finally, I should plan follow-up, monitoring, and counseling points, and reconcile any apparent contradictions in the literature before recommending a practical algorithm [^116ecoQF] [^114yUGwt] [^114h7Zfb].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and clinical trajectory. I need to ensure the original diagnosis met Amsel criteria or had a Nugent score consistent with BV, and that alternative or concomitant infections were excluded, since trichomoniasis, candidiasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea can mimic or complicate BV and should be ruled out at baseline and if symptoms persist or recur [^114gb27d] [^116ecoQF]. I should also verify whether symptoms resolved after treatment and then returned after at least a month, consistent with recurrence, versus persistence or early failure within the first month, which has different implications for management and may reflect biofilm-protected organisms or suboptimal regimen selection [^114yUGwt] [^1131FLM7].

> Wait, let me verify the initial regimen details and adherence before I change therapy. The standard oral metronidazole regimen is 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, and an approved extended-release option is 750 mg daily for 7 days; confirmation of completion, correct dosing, and absence of interacting illnesses or medications is essential [^116ecoQF] [^112TbC18] [^115sVzxC]. Historically, patients were advised to avoid alcohol because of a presumed disulfiram-like reaction, but I should double-check the latest evidence; recent CDC evidence review suggests that the rationale for strict alcohol abstinence with nitroimidazoles is weaker than once thought, so lack of abstinence is unlikely to explain nonresponse, although counseling on moderation remains reasonable while data evolve [^114yUGwt].

> Next, I should review risk factors for recurrence and mechanistic predictors so I can target modifiable drivers. Sexual re-exposure to an untreated regular partner and inconsistent condom use are associated with higher recurrence, while partner change also increases incident BV; these observations support a role for sexual exchange of BV-associated bacteria and reinoculation after treatment [^115p1hzt] [^1134Gz6r]. Mechanistically, BV-associated biofilms dominated by Gardnerella and partners such as Prevotella and Atopobium can persist after antibiotics and seed relapse, which explains frequent early recurrence and underscores why single short courses may be insufficient in high-risk patients [^1131FLM7] [^113yDc2c].

> I should confirm whether pretreatment and immediate posttreatment microbiota predictors were present, because they change the probability of recurrence. Higher pretreatment Prevotella abundance and persistence of Gardnerella immediately after antibiotics increase recurrence risk at one month, whereas higher posttreatment Lactobacillus, especially L. crispatus, tracks with sustained cure; these data support intensification or adjunctive measures if these signatures are suspected or documented [^116c6dEb] [^116zjz7h] [^1125B53B]. But wait, what if I cannot obtain sequencing? Pragmatically, prior early relapse and rapid symptom return despite standard therapy are clinical proxies for biofilm-persistence and unfavorable posttreatment microbiota, prompting escalated regimens and maintenance strategies [^114yUGwt] [^114h7Zfb].

> Now I will examine evidence-based re-treatment approaches. Extending nitroimidazole therapy improves short-term cure in RCTs; metronidazole 14 days outperformed 7 days at the first posttreatment visit, although differences attenuated by three weeks, suggesting relapse or reinfection, so extension helps but may not be sufficient alone [^116XWrAk]. If oral therapy was used initially, switching route or agent can be reasonable; clindamycin 300 mg BID for 7 days, tinidazole regimens, or single-dose secnidazole are CDC-listed alternatives that can be employed, particularly when metronidazole intolerance or suspected resistance is present, though I should remember clindamycin may select for resistant Prevotella subpopulations [^114fsSas] [^116ecoQF] [^117N2d2f].

> Hold on, I should not jump to conclusions about "more drug solves everything". For patients with frequent recurrences, intravaginal metronidazole gel for an initial 10-day course followed by twice-weekly suppressive dosing for 16 weeks reduced recurrence substantially compared with placebo in a randomized trial, though the benefit waned after stopping and candidiasis was more common, so I need to counsel and consider antifungal management if needed [^114xe75Z]. A small pilot suggested higher-dose intravaginal metronidazole might improve medium-term cure in refractory cases, but sample sizes were limited and confirmatory trials are lacking, so I should reserve this for select cases after shared decision-making [^112Wq5jB].

> Partner management is where I need to be careful and verify the evolving evidence. Earlier double-blind RCT data showed no overall benefit of treating male partners with oral metronidazole alone, although exploratory analyses suggested that when male adherence was 100%, female recurrence was modestly lower, raising the possibility that oral therapy by itself was insufficient rather than ineffective per se [^112CQfWe] [^116DDyx9]. But wait, a newer open-label NEJM trial tested combined male partner therapy with oral metronidazole plus topical clindamycin to the penile skin and showed a significant reduction in female recurrence at 12 weeks, suggesting that adding topical therapy to target penile microbiota and biofilm niches may be the key difference from prior negative trials; I should discuss this option, its off-label nature in many settings, and the need for condom use or abstinence during treatment, while noting that formal guidelines may not yet reflect these 2025 data [^113w88z1] [^116ecoQF]. Let me reconsider the adherence detail I mentioned earlier; the 73% vs 97% recurrence figure tied to perfect male adherence comes from post hoc analyses and should be framed as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive, so I will present it cautiously in counseling [^116DDyx9].

> I should double-check adjunctive microbiome-directed options. After antibiotic therapy, vaginal Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 (Lactin-V) for 11 weeks reduced 12-week recurrence versus placebo in a phase 2b NEJM trial, with benefits persisting to week 24; although availability may be limited, this is a compelling option when accessible and fits a strategy of restoring a protective Lactobacillus-dominant state [^1146PqoV]. Smaller studies of vaginal L. rhamnosus and broader probiotic reviews suggest potential benefit, but variability in strains, dosing, and trial design limit generalizability, so I should prioritize L. crispatus products with high-quality evidence when possible [^115pUoBm] [^116cUDt9].

> Next, I need to consider biofilm-disrupting strategies. Reviews emphasize that BV biofilm biology likely drives recalcitrance, and multiple classes of antibiofilm agents are under investigation; however, most data are preclinical, and no specific agent has definitive clinical efficacy in BV yet, so my actionable step here is to consider clinical trials when available and to use suppressive regimens that may indirectly mitigate biofilm resurgence until targeted agents mature [^1131FLM7] [^1113DUBd] [^114Cnv2i] [^1114nKdN].

> For patients with three or more recurrences yearly, I need to ensure a maintenance plan. Twice-weekly metronidazole gel for 16 weeks following an initial induction course reduces on-treatment recurrences, with some residual protection off therapy, but at the cost of increased vulvovaginal candidiasis; this risk-benefit profile should be reviewed, and preventive antifungal strategies can be considered for those with frequent yeast overgrowth [^114xe75Z]. Guideline summaries also support extended or repeated courses for documented reBV, emphasizing individualized regimens and close follow-up for response and tolerability [^114BG31p] [^114h7Zfb].

> I will now examine behavioral counseling that meaningfully affects outcomes. Consistent condom use and avoidance of sexual exposure during the immediate posttreatment period improve short-term cure, and cohort and meta-analytic data associate consistent condom use with lower BV risk; these points should be incorporated into shared plans, together with advising against douching given its association with dysbiosis and relapse, even if precise effect estimates for douching avoidance are less well quantified in randomized settings [^116XWrAk] [^115p1hzt]. I need to ensure both partners understand and commit to these measures during and after therapy to minimize reinoculation and support microbiome recovery [^1134Gz6r].

> Next, I should review follow-up and monitoring. A practical approach is reassessment at about one month with Amsel or Nugent to confirm response, and consideration of prognostic testing shortly after therapy where available, since a Lactobacillus Relative Composition assay or early Nugent scores can predict recurrence in highly recurrent populations, enabling earlier initiation of suppressive strategies for those at highest risk [^114KC3PS]. If symptoms persist or recur, I should re-evaluate for other causes of vaginitis and STIs and reassess the partner management plan, given how often coinfections and reinoculation cloud the clinical picture [^114gb27d] [^116ecoQF] [^115kcTLF].

> Putting this together, my stepwise algorithm is as follows, but let me double-check coherence with the data before finalizing it. First, reconfirm BV by accepted criteria and exclude coinfections; second, if the initial course was standard 7-day oral metronidazole, escalate to a 10–14-day nitroimidazole regimen or an alternative agent per CDC, then follow with suppressive intravaginal metronidazole gel for 3–4 months in those with frequent recurrences; third, discuss and consider male partner treatment using combined oral metronidazole plus topical clindamycin to penile skin with condom use or abstinence during therapy in light of new RCT data, acknowledging guideline lag and engaging in shared decision-making; fourth, add an evidence-based probiotic such as Lactin-V when available; fifth, reinforce behavioral risk reduction and plan close follow-up at one month and periodically thereafter, with early prognostic testing where feasible; and sixth, consider clinical trial referral for investigational antibiofilm strategies in refractory cases [^116ecoQF] [^116XWrAk] [^114xe75Z] [^113w88z1] [^1146PqoV] [^114KC3PS]. Hold on, I should emphasize one caveat in closing: while intensification and partner-inclusive strategies have the strongest aggregate signal for reducing near-term recurrence, sustained cure remains challenging, so setting expectations and planning proactive maintenance are integral to care, not an afterthought [^114h7Zfb] [^1131FLM7].

---

For recurrent BV after oral metronidazole, switch to **intravaginal metronidazole gel 0.75% nightly for 5 days** [^116ecoQF] or **clindamycin 300 mg orally twice daily for 7 days** [^114fsSas]. If recurrence persists, initiate **suppressive metronidazole gel 0.75% twice weekly for 4–6 months** [^114xe75Z] [^114h7Zfb]. Consider **tinidazole or secnidazole** as alternatives [^114fsSas], and add **Lactobacillus probiotics** to help restore vaginal flora [^1146PqoV]. Advise **consistent condom use** [^115p1hzt], **avoid douching** [^116XWrAk], and **treat sexual partners** [^113w88z1] if recurrences continue [^1134Gz6r]. If refractory, **refer to a specialist** for further evaluation and management.

---

## Alternative antibiotic regimens

When oral metronidazole fails, **alternative antibiotics** are recommended:

- **Intravaginal metronidazole gel 0.75%**: One full applicator (5 g) intravaginally once daily for 5 days [^116ecoQF] [^114gb27d].

- **Clindamycin 300 mg orally**: Twice daily for 7 days [^114fsSas].

- **Clindamycin ovules 100 mg intravaginally**: Once at bedtime for 3 days [^114fsSas].

- **Secnidazole 2 g orally**: Single-dose granules [^114fsSas].

- **Tinidazole 2 g orally**: Once daily for 2 days, or 1 g orally once daily for 5 days [^114fsSas].

---

## Suppressive therapy

Suppressive therapy reduces recurrence [^114xe75Z]; use **metronidazole gel 0.75%** twice weekly for 4–6 months [^114h7Zfb].

---

## Adjunctive therapies

Adjunctive therapies help restore normal vaginal flora and reduce recurrence. Probiotics, such as **Lactobacillus crispatus (Lactin-V)** [^1146PqoV] or **Lactobacillus rhamnosus** [^116cUDt9], may be administered vaginally or orally. **Boric acid suppositories** 600 mg intravaginally nightly for 14 days may be followed by twice-weekly maintenance.

---

## Behavioral and lifestyle modifications

Behavioral changes can significantly **reduce recurrence**:

- **Consistent condom use**: Reduces recurrence risk [^1134Gz6r] [^115p1hzt].

- **Avoid douching**: Prevents disruption of normal vaginal flora [^116XWrAk].

- **Treat sexual partners**: Male partner treatment reduces recurrence [^113w88z1].

---

## Partner treatment

Partner treatment is recommended for recurrent cases. Male partners should receive oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days plus topical clindamycin 2% cream applied to the penile skin twice daily for 7 days [^113w88z1].

---

## Clinical follow-up

Regular follow-up is essential; schedule visits at 1, 3, and 6 months post-treatment to monitor recurrence and adherence.

---

## Referral to specialist

Referral to a specialist is indicated for persistent recurrence despite multiple antibiotic regimens and suppressive therapy, or for complicated cases such as suspected biofilm formation [^1131FLM7] or antibiotic resistance.

### Randomized trial of Lactin-V to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^1146PqoV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects 15 to 50% of women of reproductive age, and recurrence is common after treatment with an antibiotic agent. The high incidence of recurrence suggests the need for new treatments to prevent bacterial vaginosis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial to evaluate the ability of *Lactobacillus crispatus* CTV-05 (Lactin-V) to prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis. Women 18 to 45 years of age who had received a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and who had completed a course of vaginal metronidazole gel as part of the eligibility requirements were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive vaginally administered Lactin-V or placebo for 11 weeks; follow-up occurred through week 24. The primary outcome was the percentage of women who had a recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12.

- **Results**: A total of 228 women underwent randomization: 152 to the Lactin-V group and 76 to the placebo group; of these participants, 88% in the Lactin-V group and 84% in the placebo group could be evaluated for the primary outcome. In the intention-to-treat population, recurrence of bacterial vaginosis by week 12 occurred in 46 participants (30%) in the Lactin-V group and in 34 participants (45%) in the placebo group (risk ratio after multiple imputation for missing responses, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.87; P = 0.01). The risk ratio for recurrence by week 24 (also calculated with multiple imputation for missing responses) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.92).

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^1134Gz6r]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The relationship between recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) and sexual practices is complex. While new sexual partnerships can lead to bacterial vaginosis (BV) acquisition, the risk of BV recurrence following re-exposure to the same sexual partner after treatment increases threefold. This increased risk was not diminished after adjusting for the frequency of sexual activity or condom use. This suggests that sexual exposure results in the exchange of organisms rather than 'enhancing' or 're-activating' existing BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). Subsequent microbial sequencing has shown that women resuming sexual activity with their ongoing partner after antibiotic treatment were more likely to have a vaginal microbiota colonized with BVAB than women without an ongoing partner.

Inconsistent condom use is another risk factor for BV recurrence; however, the effectiveness of condom use in preventing alterations to the composition of the vaginal microbiota requires further examination. One study indicated that women with inconsistent condom use had a similar relative abundance of BVAB as women reporting consistent use. Further research is needed to understand the key microbial drivers of recurrent BV, especially in the context of an ongoing partner who may harbor and reintroduce specific BVAB.

### Male-partner treatment to prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^113w88z1]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis affects one-third of reproductive-aged women, and recurrence is common. Evidence of sexual exchange of bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms between partners suggests that male-partner treatment may increase the likelihood of cure.

- **Methods**: This open-label, randomized controlled trial involved couples in which a woman had bacterial vaginosis and was in a monogamous relationship with a male partner. In the partner-treatment group, the woman received first-line recommended antimicrobial agents, and the male partner received oral and topical antimicrobial treatment (metronidazole 400-mg tablets and 2% clindamycin cream applied to penile skin, both twice daily for 7 days). In the control group, the woman received first-line treatment, and the male partner received no treatment (standard care). The primary outcome was the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis within 12 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 81 couples were assigned to the partner-treatment group, and 83 couples were assigned to the control group. The trial was stopped by the data and safety monitoring board after 150 couples had completed the 12-week follow-up period because treatment of the woman only was inferior to treatment of both the woman and her male partner. In the modified intention-to-treat population, recurrence occurred in 24 of 69 women (35%) in the partner-treatment group (recurrence rate, 1.6 per person-year; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.4) and in 43 of 68 women (63%) in the control group (recurrence rate, 4.2 per person-year; 95% CI, 3.2 to 5.7).

### Characterization and treatment of recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114h7Zfb]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common but treatable condition with a number of effective treatments available, including oral and intravaginal metronidazole, clindamycin, and oral tinidazole. However, as many as 50% of women with BV experience recurrence within one year of treatment for the initial incident of the disease. Some reasons for recurrence include the persistence of residual infection, resistance, and possibly reinfection from either male or female partners. Persistence may occur due to the formation of a biofilm that protects BV-causing bacteria from antimicrobial therapy. Poor adherence to treatment among patients with genitourinary infections may lead to resistance. However, the underlying mechanisms of re-etiology of BV are not known.

The recommended treatment for recurrent BV consists of an extended course of metronidazole treatment (500 mg twice daily for 10–14 days). If ineffective, metronidazole vaginal gel 0.75% for 10 days, followed by twice weekly applications for 3–6 months, is an alternate treatment regimen. Past studies of clindamycin and tinidazole in the treatment of recurrent BV have focused on patients with evidence of metronidazole resistance. Secnidazole may be an attractive new option due to its one-time dosing. Initial studies on biofilm disruption, use of probiotics and prebiotics, and botanical treatments have shown some promise but must be studied further before clinical use. Despite these limitations, antimicrobial therapy will remain the mainstay of treatment for recurrent BV for the foreseeable future.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^111fm2df]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Partner treatment trials targeting female partners

Despite bacterial vaginosis (BV) being common among women who have sex with women (WSW), no partner treatment trials enrolling female couples have been conducted. As mentioned above, the majority (74–95%) of female couples have been shown to be concordant for the presence or absence of BV. If a female index case is enrolled in a partner treatment trial, it is highly likely that her female partner will be concordant for the presence of BV. Enrolling female couples would therefore provide an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of partner treatment in both members of the partnership.

However, female-partner treatment brings a unique set of additional challenges. Enrolling BV-concordant couples in a blinded randomized partner treatment trial would mean that only half of the female partners would be treated for BV at enrollment, as the rest would be randomized to placebo. The concept of a placebo arm for women may not be accepted by participants or clinicians. Apprehension surrounding the ethics of non-treatment could be mitigated by considering, firstly, that it has not been shown that treating BV prevents adverse outcomes, only symptoms. If one of the partners has asymptomatic BV at enrollment, treatment would not currently be recommended. FDA guidance around BV treatment trials also states that a placebo can be used as a comparator for the control arm, and recent BV treatment trials have done so.

Even if partner treatment was accepted, in order to measure clinically meaningful cure, follow-up to 3–4 months is required. It is quite likely that concerns around possible…

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^112sKbdx]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Recent studies evaluating pre-treatment vaginal microbiota composition on MNZ efficacy have reported inconsistent results, likely due to differences in patient exclusion criteria, time point of treatment outcome assessment, drug regimen, and methods to collect and quantify the vaginal microbiota. One study that employed a similar drug regimen (oral MNZ) and sample collection methods to the clinical cohorts evaluated here supported our results, finding higher pre-treatment loads of antibiotic-target species, Gv and A. vaginae, associated with BV treatment efficacy. Other studies that used different sample collection methods and antibiotic regimens did not explicitly evaluate the pre-treatment ratio of BV-associated bacteria to Lactobacillus spp.; they generally suggested there was an association between total Lactobacillus relative abundance and successful treatment. Notably, some of these studies focused on analyzing treatment outcomes immediately after antibiotic therapy was completed, and in some cases, treatment failure was due to no response to therapy.

We propose that recurrence and failure to respond to therapy likely arise from different factors: recurrence is due to a collective bacterial population's resilience to antibiotic therapy, and failure to respond is due to the inherent resistance of BV-associated bacteria. Studies that have associated higher Gv loads with treatment failure correspond with the latter and could be due to the formation of biofilms or other resistance mechanisms. As our model predicts immediate post-therapy Lactobacillus spp. relative abundance.

### High-dose vaginal metronidazole for recurrent bacterial vaginosis — a pilot study [^112Wq5jB]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate high-dose intravaginal metronidazole, with or without miconazole, in enhancing cure rates in women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV).

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 43 women with symptomatic reBV were enrolled in a 4-arm study comparing 500 mg versus 750 mg of metronidazole, with or without miconazole, intravaginally for 7 days. Test of cure by saline wet mount and 10% potassium chloride microscopy, pH, Gram stain for Nugent score, and yeast culture were performed 3 times after treatment: 3 to 7 days, 30 to 35 days, and 60 to 70 days.

- **Results**: Overall cure rate for the entire group was 92.6% at visit 2, 62.1% at visit 3, and 51.4% at visit 4. At visit 2, there was no difference in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (90.5%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (85%). At visit 3, there was a significant improvement in cure rates among patients who received metronidazole 750 mg ± miconazole daily (78.9%) compared with metronidazole 500 mg ± miconazole daily (44.4%). A pH ≥ 4.4 and presence of clue cells (Nugent score ≥ 4 or pH > 4.4) at the first visit after treatment predicted recurrence. The addition of miconazole did not enhance BV response rates.

- **Conclusions**: Cure rates for BV were high in this refractory cohort and seemed dose-dependent.

### Microbiologic response to treatment of bacterial vaginosis with topical clindamycin or metronidazole [^117N2d2f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

The study aimed to compare the frequencies, concentrations, and antimicrobial susceptibilities of vaginal microbes isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (BV) before and after therapy. A total of 119 nonpregnant women aged 18 to 45, with clinical and Gram stain evidence of BV, were randomized to receive either intravaginal clindamycin or metronidazole. Vaginal swabs were collected at baseline, and subsequently at 7 to 12 days, 35 to 45 days, and 70 to 90 days following therapy for quantitative vaginal culture.

For the 99 women who completed all four visits, statistical analyses were conducted to compare differences in vaginal microflora between the two treatment arms and between visits within the same treatment group. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the agar dilution method was performed for anaerobic gram-negative rods.

Both therapies led to decreased colonization by Gardnerella vaginalis and Mycoplasma hominis. However, only metronidazole treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency and concentration of Prevotella bivia and black-pigmented Prevotella species. Of the 865 anaerobic gram-negative rods evaluated for susceptibility, only 3 (0.3%) were resistant to metronidazole, whereas resistance to clindamycin increased significantly for P. bivia and black-pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods persisting after clindamycin therapy. Clindamycin-resistant subpopulations of P. bivia and black-pigmented Prevotella species emerged 7 to 12 days after therapy, even among women initially colonized by clindamycin-susceptible strains. These resistant subpopulations persisted at high frequencies (42 to 50%).

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^114Cnv2i]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

This review is the first to detail research evidence on different anti-bacterial vaginosis (BV) biofilm treatments. These findings inform clinicians about developments in the field and offer their patients hope of a long-term cure.

- **Strengths and limitations of this review**: Several limitations should be acknowledged. While publication bias was not specifically assessed, it was noted that the majority of publications reported on effective compounds. It is likely that significant research identifying investigative compounds as ineffective remains unpublished and was consequently not captured by this review. Additionally, the heterogeneity of study designs made comparisons among findings difficult, as observations in laboratory cultures and animal models are not often reflected in human subject research.

### Vulvovaginitis: Screening for and management of trichomoniasis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis [^112MoFA8]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2015). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bacterial vaginosis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, the SOGC 2015 guidelines recommend offering oral metronidazole 500 mg BID for 7 days in patients with symptomatic BV. Offer vaginal metronidazole gel and oral or vaginal clindamycin cream as alternatives.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1114nKdN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

The ongoing search for new therapeutics against bacterial vaginosis (BV) has been complicated by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and the role of biofilms. Numerous promising agents are being investigated, and findings suggest that the application of anti-BV biofilm agents could potentially lead to a breakthrough in BV treatment; however, this is still an evolving field predominantly in the preclinical stages of research. With concerns about antibiotic resistance, there is an urgent need to progress the study of these diverse antibiofilm agents into animal and human trials, although the absence of optimal animal models for BV is hindering the momentum of this critical development.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^115cZtpP]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

This study adds to the knowledge on the dismal effect of antibiotic use on vaginal dysbiosis. We suggest medical professionals take this into account when counselling patients known to have recurring bacterial vaginosis (reBV) when they need antibiotics for another condition.

Furthermore, we suggest that general practitioners (GPs) prioritize in-person consultations over repeat prescriptions in patients with recurrent complaints. Critical evaluation of the previous diagnosis is justified using standardized criteria, such as Amsel criteria, and warrants microbiological testing before treatment is reinitiated to prevent unnecessary prescriptions and further development of antibiotic resistance.

In conclusion, the present study provides tools for GPs to better recognize patients at risk of developing recurrent complaints and to re-evaluate their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of reBV.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115p1hzt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What is clear now is that there is a substantial body of epidemiological and microbiological data to support the role of sexual transmission in the BV syndrome. As is the case for established STIs, prevalent BV is associated with an earlier age of sexual debut and is uncommon in women reporting no sexual activity. In a 12-month cohort study, young women engaging in penile-vaginal sex were more likely to have a vaginal microbiota dominated by Gardnerella spp. than women reporting no sex, and in a cross-sectional study of 17- and 18-year-old women, the presence and abundance of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and P. bivia was associated with a history of penile-vaginal sex. Furthermore, a meta-analysis showed a positive association between an increased number of male sexual partners or a recent change of male partner and the risk of BV (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95% CI 1.5–1.8). Conversely, consistent condom use was associated with a decreased risk of BV (RR = 0.8, 95% CI 0.8–0.9). The estimated protective effect of condom usage highlights an area for further exploration and potential clinical guidance.

Regarding the medical management of bacterial vaginosis and specifically antibiotic therapy, the IUSTI/WHO 2018 guidelines recommend offering topical or oral metronidazole for 5–7 days or intravaginal clindamycin for 7 days to patients with uncomplicated BV, depending on personal choice and circumstances.

### Prevotella and Gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116c6dEb]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal dysbiosis that often recurs following first-line antibiotics. We investigated if vaginal microbiota composition was associated with BV recurrence.

- **Methods**: We analyzed samples and data from 121 women who participated in three published trials evaluating novel interventions for improving BV cure, including antibiotic treatment of regular sexual partners (RSPs). Women diagnosed with BV received first-line antibiotics and self-collected vaginal swabs pretreatment and the day after finishing antibiotics (immediately posttreatment). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on vaginal samples. Logistic regression explored associations between BV recurrence and features of the vaginal microbiota pre- and posttreatment.

- **Results**: Sixteen women (13% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 8%-21%]) experienced BV recurrence within one month of treatment. Women with an untreated RSP were more likely to experience recurrence than women with no RSP (P = 0.008) or an RSP who received treatment (P = 0.011). A higher abundance of Prevotella pretreatment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.35 [95% CI, 1.05–1.91]) and Gardnerella immediately posttreatment (AOR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.03–1.49]) were associated with increased odds of BV recurrence.

- **Conclusions**: Having specific Prevotella spp prior to recommended treatment and persistence of Gardnerella immediately posttreatment may contribute to the high rates of BV recurrence. Interventions that target these taxa are likely required to achieve sustained BV cure.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1131FLM7]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is difficult to eradicate due to BV biofilms protecting BV bacteria such as Gardnerella, Prevotella, and other genera. With the growing understanding of biofilms, we systematically reviewed the knowledge on the efficacy of anti-BV biofilm agents.

We searched literature in the Scopus, Medline, and Embase databases for empirical studies investigating substances for the treatment of BV biofilms or prevention of their recurrence, and their efficacy and/or safety. Of 201 unique titles, 35 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Most studies (89%) reported on preclinical laboratory research on the efficacy of experimental antibiofilm agents (80%) rather than their safety. Over 50% were published within the past 5 years.

- **Agent classification**: Agents were classified into seven groups: antibiotics, antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants/surfactant components. Enzymes and probiotics were most commonly investigated. Earlier reports of antibiotics having anti-BV biofilm activity have not been confirmed. Some compounds from other classes demonstrated promising anti-BV biofilm efficacy in early studies.

Further research is anticipated on successful antibiofilm agents. If confirmed as effective and safe in human clinical trials, they may offer a breakthrough in BV treatment. With rising antibiotic resistance, antibiofilm agents will significantly improve the standard of care for BV management.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynecological and obstetric sequelae including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those that do, it is the symptoms themselves, including malodour and vaginal discharge, that cause significant distress to women and impact on their quality of life and relationships.

Evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterized by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli, and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp., and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). While the exact pathogens responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesized that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116DDyx9]. BMC Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Since these two systematic reviews were published, we have the results from a recently conducted RCT. Schwebke et al. treated women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) using the first-line regimen of 7-day oral metronidazole 500mg BID. Their male sexual partners were randomized to concurrent treatment with the same regimen or an oral placebo. This trial was the most thoroughly designed and addressed the limitations of prior trials, with sufficient sample size, clear power calculations, appropriate randomization methods, blinding, and inclusion of data on antibiotic adherence.

However, the trial was stopped early due to futility, as the primary intention-to-treat analysis showed partner treatment did not improve the cure by 16 weeks post-randomization. Even though these findings appear to be yet another notch against male-partner treatment, there are important considerations to note. The overall recurrence rate was 80% in women in both groups, which is higher than prior studies and may suggest the study population had underlying risk factors that placed them at high risk of recurrence, or persistent BV biofilm that is refractory to oral metronidazole.

- **Post hoc analyses**: Among couples where the man was 100% adherent to metronidazole treatment, the female partners were significantly less likely to recur (73% vs. 97% recurrence in women whose partners were 100% vs. < 100% adherent, respectively, p < 0.001). These findings suggest a modest effect of oral treatment in highly adherent males, but it is important to consider that oral therapy alone may also not be entirely sufficient.

### Changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations with intravaginal metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis as assessed by quantitative PCR [^111rNdf2]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2009). Low credibility.

Several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) using broad-range bacterial PCR methods such as consensus sequence 16S rRNA gene PCR, but their role in BV remains poorly defined. We describe changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations following metronidazole therapy for BV. Vaginal swabs were collected from women with BV diagnosed using Amsel clinical criteria, and vaginal fluid was assessed by Gram stain to generate Nugent scores.

Follow-up swabs were collected one month following a 5-day course of vaginal 0.75% metronidazole gel and analyzed for 24 subjects with cured BV and 24 subjects with persistent BV. Changes in bacterial concentrations were measured using eight bacterium-specific 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assays. DNA from several fastidious BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) were present at high concentrations in the vagina prior to treatment.

Successful antibiotic therapy resulted in 3- to 4-log reductions in median bacterial loads of BVAB1 (P = 0.02), BVAB2 (P = 0.0004), BVAB3 (P = 0.03), a Megasphaera-like bacterium (P < 0.0001), Atopobium species (P < 0.0001), Leptotrichia/Sneathia species (P = 0.0002), and Gardnerella vaginalis (P < 0.0001). Median post-treatment bacterial levels did not change significantly in subjects with persistent BV except for a decline in levels of BVAB3.

The presence or absence of BV is reflected by vaginal concentrations of BV-associated bacteria such as BVAB1, BVAB2, Leptotrichia/Sneathia species, Atopobium species, Gardnerella vaginalis, and a Megasphaera-like bacterium, suggesting that these bacteria play an important role.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^116fi3mr]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Optimal MNZ doses are dependent on pre-treatment microbiome. We used the model to determine specific combinations of MNZ concentrations and initial Gv:Li ratios that resulted in an optimal final Li proportion after 48 hours of MNZ exposure. Notably, the initial Gv:Li ratio was highly associated with the final Gv:Li ratio for doses of MNZ greater than 250 µg/ml (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, cultures that were initially Li dominant (0.001× Gv:Li) were nearly insensitive to any dose of MNZ, consistently resulting in more than 50% Gv (Fig. 3a). This result implies a surprising likelihood of recurrence in women with Li-dominant vaginal microbiomes at treatment initiation, regardless of MNZ dose.

Cultures that were originally Gv dominant (Gv:Li > 1) were most likely to be Li dominated after 48 hours of MNZ exposure. Experimental data supported these trends, as the simulation predictions did not significantly differ from the final proportion of Li at 500 µg/ml for 1000× (p = 0.680, t = 0.420, df = 17). However, the model overestimated the final proportion of Li at the 0.001× Gv:Li ratio, predicting a 44.1% proportion of Li compared to 14.2% ± 7.16% obtained experimentally. This result suggests a more significant reduction in Li proportion when Gv is initially dominant (p = 0.008, t = 4.06, df = 17).

### Recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^117MQmW7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a common condition that recurs frequently, adversely affecting women's lives and is associated with complications including an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

- **Recent findings**: New molecular techniques have increased our understanding of the numerous bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis, and a biofilm containing mostly Gardnerella and Atopobium vaginae, which can persist after treatment, has been described. Suppressive treatment with metronidazole gel can suppress recurrence. Physiological approaches such as acidification and probiotics have been investigated with variable results.

- **Summary**: Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis allow the opportunity to improve treatments to prevent recurrence, which may require a combination of modalities. We must find ways to help affected women and reduce the complications associated with bacterial vaginosis.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zjz7h]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

ANCOM-BC was used to identify bacterial taxa that were differentially abundant pre- and posttreatment between recurrence and cure cases. Pretreatment, the mean abundance of Prevotella spp (representing Prevotella amplicon sequence variants that were not able to be classified at the species level) was significantly higher in women who experienced recurrence compared to those who were cured at 1 month posttreatment (log fold change [LFC] = 1.44, standard error [SE] = 0.56, P = 0.011).

Immediately posttreatment, the mean abundance of Gardnerella was increased in recurrence versus cure cases (LFC = 1.90, SE = 0.86, P = 0.028). Conversely, the mean abundance of both L. crispatus and Lactobacillus fornicalis was decreased in women who experienced recurrence compared to those who did not (L. crispatus LFC = −1.55, SE = 0.40, P = 0.0001; L. fornicalis LFC = −1.19, SE = 0.34, P = 0.0006).

There was no significant difference in the abundance of L. iners between recurrence and cure cases at day 0 (LFC = 0.08, SE = 0.71, P > .05) or day 8 (LFC = −1.60, SE = 1.02, P > .05). ANCOM-BC findings were mostly consistent with findings from a second differential abundance analysis method. Supplementary Table 2 presents the prevalence and relative abundance of taxa identified as differentially abundant by ANCOM-BC. Of note, L. crispatus was present in low relative abundance both pretreatment and immediately posttreatment in most participants, except for eight cure cases who had a L. crispatus relative abundance > 50% at day 8.

### Long-term vaginal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus as a complementary approach to management of bacterial vaginosis [^115pUoBm]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate the advantages of long-term vaginal administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus after oral treatment with metronidazole to prevent the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis (BV).

- **Methods**: A total of 49 women with a diagnosis of BV were randomized into two groups. Group A was treated with a twice daily dose of 500 mg oral metronidazole for 7 days. Group B received the same schedule followed by a once-weekly vaginal application of 40 mg of Lactobacillus rhamnosus for 6 months. A non-parametric analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to test whether there were significant changes in the vaginal ecosystems in the two groups.

- **Results**: During the first 6 months of follow-up, a constant percentage (96%) of patients in group B had a balanced vaginal ecosystem. Follow-up over 12 months showed no statistically significant difference among vaginal ecosystems in patients in group B (P = 0.40), whereas in group A, there was a significant increase in the number of women with abnormal flora over time (P = 0.01).

The conclusion drawn was that the vaginal administration of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus stabilizes the vaginal ecosystem and reduces the recurrence of BV.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^115kcTLF]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

We screened 176 women, and 68 women completed metronidazole treatment. Ineligibility reasons are detailed in Appendix A, Figure A.1. Among these, 82.4% had bacterial vaginosis (BV) alone, 2.9% had Trichomonas vaginalis alone, and 14.7% had both BV and T. vaginalis. The median age was 31 years (range 19–42), and most participants were sex workers. Thirteen women (26.5%) reported unusual vaginal discharge at the pretreatment visit, although none had proactively sought care for these symptoms before joining the study.

Furthermore, 26.5% of participants received another antibiotic in addition to metronidazole for a different condition, or had an ongoing Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection during metronidazole treatment (38.2%). At the posttreatment visit, all women were BV-negative by modified Amsel criteria and T. vaginalis-negative by culture and wet mount. No women reported urogenital symptoms, including unusual vaginal discharge, adverse events such as vomiting, or social harms.

Of the 56 women with Nugent scores of 7–10 pretreatment, 30 (54.5%) had Nugent scores of 0–3, 11 (20.0%) had scores of 4–6, and 14 remained with scores of 7–10 posttreatment.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^1165g122]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

What we can learn from past male-partner treatment trials

More than 60 years ago, researchers and clinicians held the view that the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis (BV) was sexually transmitted, or at least, associated with sex. The findings from the six male-partner treatment trials conducted in the 1980s and 1990s have been extensively reviewed, but we briefly summarise the findings, with the aim of understanding the outcomes.

One of the challenges when assessing the effectiveness of partner treatment is that the trials utilised very different combinations of antibiotic treatments for differing durations, and there was no published data to inform what treatments may be optimal for men. These trials had major trial-related limitations including small sample sizes, absence of power calculations, inconsistent and non-standard methods to diagnose BV in women, use of single-dose and non-standard treatments for women (which we now know are suboptimal), lack of data on treatment adherence, and high attrition. Another key difference between the trials was that the clinical endpoints were measured anywhere from 7 to 10 days to 12 weeks post-randomisation. The timing of the endpoint may be critical in determining if an intervention is efficacious.

Among couples counselled to abstain from sex, BV endpoints measured immediately post-treatment are more likely to reflect the efficacy of female-only treatment rather than the effect of treating the male on BV. In contrast, endpoints measured following a longer period of time post-treatment may be undermined by the introduction of u.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^111nhBpc]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

We conducted a secondary analysis of vaginal microbiota data and accompanying clinical and behavioral data collected from women who participated in three clinical trials conducted at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre (MSHC), Australia, that evaluated new interventions for improving bacterial vaginosis (BV) cure: Strategies to prevent BV (SToPBV), StepUp-1, and StepUp-2. The parent trials have been described elsewhere.

In brief, SToPBV was an open-label, randomized controlled trial of combined oral contraceptive pill use following first-line antibiotic treatment to prevent BV recurrence. StepUp-1 and StepUp-2 were open-label, single-arm pilot studies that assessed the acceptability and tolerability of concurrent male partner treatment for BV and its impact on the genital microbiota of couples. The supplementary material details the interventions assessed in the parent studies.

Across the three studies, women presenting to MSHC were eligible to participate if they were diagnosed with BV (defined as ≥ 3 Amsel criteria and Nugent score [NS] = 4–10) and received first-line treatment (oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 7 days, or if contraindicated, clindamycin 2% vaginal cream applied intravaginally nocte for 7 nights or metronidazole 0.75% gel applied intravaginally nocte for 5 nights). Additional study-specific eligibility criteria were applied. Of note, women were eligible for SToPBV if they were not currently using hormonal contraception and had no combined oral contraceptive pill–related contraindications. Women were eligible for the StepUp studies.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^1113DUBd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In recent years, the increased understanding of BV biofilms has stimulated research on how to improve the standard of care through the development of antibiofilm agents. Currently, a range of antibiofilm agents is being actively explored, including various antiseptics, cationic peptides, enzymes, plant extracts, probiotics, and surfactants that could assist in penetrating the biofilm structure. However, there are no literature reviews summarizing the existing evidence from anti-BV biofilm research.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^115BEA6z]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis affecting women globally. However, an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within 6 months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence. This has been attributed to the possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners.

There is a robust body of evidence supporting the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity. While the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, the failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, antimicrobial regimens directed at women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure, justifying the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection. In this manuscript, we present the molecular and epidemiological evidence underlying the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted and summarize why research that continues to consider sexual partnerships is necessary. We also outline the significant barriers and challenges identified during partner treatment studies and discuss the factors impacting our ability to determine their effectiveness.

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^116zQFCV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal condition that affects approximately 30% of reproductive-aged women globally. While the etiology of BV has not been established, the vaginal microbiota of women with BV is typically deficient in optimal Lactobacillus spp (e.g. Lactobacillus crispatus) and exhibits high diversity and high abundance of anaerobes. Recommended treatment for BV involves antibiotic therapy with metronidazole or clindamycin, both of which provide broad coverage of anaerobes. One-month cure posttreatment is approximately 70%–85%; however, up to 50% of women experience BV recurrence within 12 weeks following antibiotics. BV recurrences are distressing for women and result in repeat presentations to clinical services and repeated antibiotic use. Furthermore, the sequelae associated with BV carry significant implications for a woman's reproductive and sexual health and impose a large economic burden.

Little progress has been made toward improving long-term BV cure, partly because the mechanisms driving BV recurrence are multifactorial and incompletely understood. Prior studies exploring the association between microbial signatures of the vaginal microbiota (i.e. diversity metrics, community types, and individual taxa) and BV treatment outcomes have produced mixed results regarding the contribution of bacterial diversity to treatment failure. Interestingly, a number of studies have reported a positive association between BV recurrence and a high relative and absolute abundance of Gardnerella (or individual Gardnerella spp) pretreatment.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^11624rHq]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

We also evaluated model findings in a second clinical cohort, the CONRAD BV study, which consisted of 33 women whose vaginal microbiome was sampled at enrollment in the study, one week after MNZ treatment, and one month after MNZ treatment. Relative abundances were determined by sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA. Women were excluded from this subset analysis if they failed to finish the antibiotic regimen, contracted a secondary vaginal infection, did not respond, or had a delayed response to treatment. Of the 33 women, 21 met inclusion criteria and were evaluated by molecular-BV criteria (dominance of Lactobacillus spp.) at one week and one month. Women exhibiting a vaginal microbiota composition of less than 50% Lactobacillus spp. were classified as BV positive. The group analyzed consisted of women who were cured (n = 10) or were determined to have reBV (n = 11; Lactobacillus was dominant at one week, but molecular-BV returned after one month, Supplementary Table 5).

Like the previous study, we found that women who experienced recurrence had higher levels of Lactobacillus spp. relative to BV-associated bacteria (lower BV:LB ratio, p = 0.0242, Fig. 5c). Comparison of CLR-transformed relative abundance did not result in statistically significant differences for Li or Gv, but tended to support the trend of reWomen having higher Li and lower Gv (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d; p = 0.521, p = 0.694). Similarly, analysis of the Gv:Li ratio supported that higher pre-treatment Gv relative to Li was associated with better treatment outcomes (Fig. 5d; p = 0.0338).

### Treatment of male sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112CQfWe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

We aimed to determine if the treatment of male sexual partners of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (BV) using oral metronidazole two times per day for 7 days (i.e. multidose metronidazole) significantly decreased BV recurrence rates in the female partners.

- **Methods**: This was a multicenter, two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Women diagnosed with recurrent BV by Amsel and Nugent criteria were enrolled. Multidose metronidazole for 7 days was administered to these women. Male partners were randomized to receive either placebo or multidose metronidazole for 7 days and were asked to refrain from unprotected sex for 14 days. Female follow-up visits were conducted at days 21, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks, while male follow-up visits occurred between days 14 and 21. BV cure was defined as meeting 0–2 of Amsel criteria and having a Nugent score of 0–6 in the female partner, with the primary endpoint assessed at 16 weeks.

- **Results**: A total of 214 couples were enrolled in the study. In the intent-to-treat population, there was no significant difference between treatment arms for the primary outcome. BV treatment failure occurred in 81% and 80% of women in the metronidazole and placebo arms, respectively, through the third follow-up visit (P > .999). However, women whose male partners adhered to the study medication were less likely to experience treatment failure (adjusted relative risk, .85; 95% CI, .73-.99; p = 0.035). This finding persisted in post hoc comparisons in the metronidazole arm.

- **Conclusions**: Overall, this study did not find that the treatment of male partners with multidose metronidazole significantly reduces BV recurrence in female partners, although women whose partners adhered to multidose metronidazole were less likely to experience treatment failure.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^114eScta]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

Oral metronidazole treatment alone may not be sufficient for women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) or for women at risk of complications caused by pathobionts, such as pregnant women. Additional treatments are urgently needed, including biofilm-disrupting treatments and drugs that specifically target all G. vaginalis clades or pathobionts.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^113xwtWb]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

- **Interspecies interaction terms**: Gausenoted the calculation for interaction terms for a generalized Lotka–Volterra model describing competitive exclusion (Eqs. (1) and (2)). In our model, we generalized the interaction terms further to be able to capture many different interactions, specifically amensal behavior where Lactobacillus spp. can inhibit BV-associated bacterial growth with no effect of BV-associated bacteria on Lactobacillus species growth (−/0) as well as mutualistic (both species benefit from the other +/+) and commensal behaviors (one species benefits 0/+) between BV-associated bacteria or within the Lactobacillus population.

The amensal behavior between Lactobacillus species has been documented experimentally in co-culture, and we calculated the interaction term for many different species and strains of Lactobacillus on G. vaginalis and Prevotella bivia from Atassi et al. It is largely believed that D-lactic acid produced by many Lactobacillus species inhibits the growth of BV-associated bacteria; however, L. iners does not produce this isomer of lactic acid, which is the reasoning behind not including an interaction term between L. iners and the BV-associated bacteria. It is believed that commensal behavior exists between G. vaginalis and P. bivia in the form of cross-feeding, so we allowed the model to simulate this behavior. In addition, G. vaginalis is associated with promoting the growth of other BV-associated bacteria like A. vaginae. Calculations were completed assuming the reported mono and co-cultures were at steady state to derive Eqs. (3) and (4).

### Suppressive antibacterial therapy with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114xe75Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

This study evaluates the efficacy of suppressive vaginal metronidazole in reducing symptomatic episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

- **Study design**: A multicenter prospective study was conducted, starting with a 10-day open-label metronidazole gel treatment. Asymptomatic responders were then randomly assigned to receive either twice-weekly metronidazole vaginal gel or placebo for 16 weeks, followed by 12 weeks off therapy.

- **Results**: Of 157 eligible women with bacterial vaginosis, 112 out of 127 returning evaluable women (88.2%) responded clinically and were randomly assigned. During suppressive therapy, bacterial vaginosis recurred in 13 women (25.5%) receiving metronidazole and 26 (59.1%) receiving placebo (MITT analysis, relative risk [RR] 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.73, P = 0.001). During the 28-week follow-up, recurrence occurred in 26 (51.0%) on treatment compared with 33 (75%) on placebo (RR 0.68, CI = 0.49–0.93, P = 0.02). The probability of remaining cured was 70% for metronidazole compared to 39% for placebo, declining to 34% and 18%, respectively, by the 28-week follow-up. Adverse effects were rare, but secondary vaginal candidiasis occurred significantly more often in metronidazole-treated women (P = 0.02).

- **Conclusion**: Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel significantly reduces the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis is common.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^115jtbu2]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

In this work, we use an ordinary differential equation-based (ODE) model and experimentally measure parameters — such as MNZ internalization by bacteria, metabolism, and bacterial antibiotic susceptibility — to predict Li and Gv growth dynamics with MNZ treatment. The model demonstrates that a critical factor in MNZ efficacy may be the sequestration of MNZ by Li. It also predicts that MNZ efficacy decreases in individuals with higher pre-treatment amounts of the non-target species, Li, relative to the target species, Gv. We validate this finding with in vitro co-cultures and extend our analysis to more representative models. These models illustrate that this behavior is also expected in microbial environments with additional species, interspecies interactions, and strain variability.

By analyzing cervicovaginal samples from BV-infected women treated with MNZ in two distinct cohorts, we demonstrate that our initial findings have clinical relevance in characterizing BV treatment outcomes. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of leveraging quantitative models that evaluate interactions of target bacteria and non-target Lactobacillus spp. with MNZ. This approach improves insight into personalized differences in BV recurrence and treatment failure.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117GrdDi]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The relationship between BV acquisition and sexual practices is significant. Incident BV has been strongly associated with sexual practices, with women reporting a new sexual partner being more likely to acquire BV. Among women with male partners, penile-vaginal sex, inconsistent condom use, and semen exposure have been associated with BV acquisition. However, BV transmission can occur without semen, and women engaging in sexual activities with women also acquire BV. Studies of women who have sex with women (WSW) have confirmed the relationship between BV acquisition and a number of sexual practices, including sex with a new partner, and oral, digital-vaginal, and digital-anal sex.

In one 2-year cohort study, WSW who reported a new sexual partner had a more diverse and unstable vaginal microbiota, characterized by Gardnerella spp. or other BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). Specific clades of Gardnerella were associated with different sexual practices. However, the timing between sampling and BV acquisition could not be accurately determined, as sampling only occurred at 3-month intervals. To further pinpoint the incubation period between exposure to BVAB and onset of BV, a cohort of WSW providing daily vaginal specimens was followed for up to 90 days. Among this cohort, an increase in the relative abundance of Gardnerella spp. P. bivia, and A. vaginae, as well as the onset of the BV syndrome, occurred within approximately 4 days of sex. This incubation period is analogous to that of other bacterial sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.

Female couples provide additional proof of sexual exchange and sharing of the vaginal microbiota, evidenced by concordance in…

### Metronidazole vaginal [^114gb27d]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Metronidazole vaginal gel is indicated in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (formerly referred to as Haemophilus vaginitis, Gardnerella vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis, Corynebacterium vaginitis, or anaerobic vaginosis).

- **Indications and usage**: For purposes of this indication, a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually defined by the presence of a homogeneous vaginal discharge that (a) has a pH of greater than 4.5, (b) emits a "fishy" amine odor when mixed with a 10% KOH solution, and (c) contains clue cells on microscopic examination. Gram's stain results consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis include (a) markedly reduced or absent Lactobacillus morphology, (b) predominance of Gardnerella morphotype, and (c) absent or few white blood cells.

Other pathogens commonly associated with vulvovaginitis, e.g. Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, Candida albicans, and Herpes simplex virus, should be ruled out.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^117LZJpY]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis is a condition associated with adverse reproductive outcomes and is characterized by a shift from a Lactobacillus-dominant vaginal microbiota to a polymicrobial microbiota consistently colonized by strains of Gardnerella vaginalis. Metronidazole is the first-line treatment; however, treatment failure and recurrence rates remain high. To understand complex interactions between Gardnerella vaginalis and Lactobacillus involved in efficacy, we developed an ordinary differential equation model that predicts bacterial growth as a function of metronidazole uptake, sensitivity, and metabolism. The model shows that a critical factor in efficacy is the Lactobacillus sequestration of metronidazole, and efficacy decreases when the relative abundance of Lactobacillus is higher pre-treatment. We validated the results in Gardnerella and Lactobacillus co-cultures and in two clinical cohorts, finding that women with recurrence have significantly higher pre-treatment levels of Lactobacillus relative to bacterial vaginosis–associated bacteria. Overall, the results provide mechanistic insight into how personalized differences in microbial communities influence vaginal antibiotic efficacy.

### Diagnosis and management of bacterial vaginosis: Summary of evidence reviewed for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114yUGwt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

In preparation for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines, the CDC convened an advisory group in 2019 to examine recent literature addressing updates in the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of STIs. This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### Impact of oral metronidazole treatment on the vaginal microbiota and correlates of treatment failure [^114SqwZ6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Research and clinical implications**: Our study has several implications. Women with persistent or recurrent bacterial vaginosis (reBV) might benefit from vaginal biofilm-disrupting treatment, adjuvant therapy with lactobacilli-based live biotherapeutics, or treatment with drugs that specifically target all G. vaginalis clades. The former two are actively researched, but the latter are not yet available. Whether these strategies are efficacious in real life would have to be evaluated in clinical trials. Furthermore, diagnostic tests to determine the presence of a biofilm or concentrations of G. vaginalis are not yet available to clinicians. Women at risk of complications caused by vaginal pathobionts (not just Group B streptococci), such as pregnant women, might benefit from targeted screening and treatment. We encourage the incorporation of quantitative molecular characterization of both key individual bacteria with pathogenic potential, as well as bacterial communities and biofilms, in future intervention studies.

- **Strengths and limitations of the study**: Limitations of our study include potentially limited generalizability of the results to lower-risk and non-African populations, and the lack of vaginal biofilm detection and characterization pre- and post-treatment. Recent studies have shown good correlations between the method that we used to quantify relative abundance data and species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction results of non-minority species, but additional validation studies are desirable. Although Nugent-based studies have shown that oral and vaginal metronidazole of similar efficacy can be used for treatment, further research is needed to establish the optimal treatment protocols.

### Patient characteristics and factors contributing to recurrence of bacterial vaginosis presented in primary care [^112C41md]. Family Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common problem in primary care. BV symptoms often have a negative impact on patients' quality of life and may predispose individuals to gynecological problems. Some patients experience recurring episodes of BV. This study's objective is to identify possible factors that may be associated with BV recurrence and describe the characteristics of these patients and interventions performed by general practitioners.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from a primary care registration network in the Netherlands from 2015 to 2020. We analyzed differences between patients with recurrent BV and patients with a single episode of BV in terms of characteristics and interventions performed by general practitioners.

- **Results**: We found that patients with recently prescribed antibiotics, and a medical history of sexually transmitted infections and/or Candidiasis significantly more often presented with recurrent BV. Patients with recurrent BV had more remote consultations and fewer in-person consultations than single-episode patients. The reason for encounter was more often a request for medication. Regarding GPs' diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, microbiological tests were more frequently performed in recurrent BV patients. Moreover, most patients in both groups were prescribed oral metronidazole most frequently.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings might help GPs better recognize patients at risk of recurrence. GPs could re-evaluate their approach to the diagnosis and treatment of recurrent BV, opting for in-person consultation and adjusting treatment strategies accordingly.

### Antibiofilm agents for the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis: A systematic narrative review [^112uReir]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a neglected and poorly treated condition with a significant burden for women worldwide. In Australia, a BV prevalence of 12% was reported, compared with 30% in North America and over 50% in southern and eastern Africa. Most affected are women of reproductive age.

BV is a polymicrobial condition with a complex pathophysiology where the native vaginal microbiome, mainly Lactobacillus species, is disrupted by increased numbers of Gardnerella species. These include G. vaginalis and G. swidsinskii/leopoldi, which grow together in biofilms with Prevotella species, such as P. bivia. Significant adverse reproductive and obstetric outcomes are associated with BV, such as miscarriage, preterm labor, preterm rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.

Treatment of BV has changed very little since metronidazole was first introduced 40 years ago. Due to teratogenic concerns with metronidazole at that time, clindamycin was added as an alternative in the late 1980s. Standard-of-care treatment with one of these antibiotics can achieve an initial cure rate between 80% and 90%. However, more than half of all patients experience recurrence within 6 months and up to 80% within 9 months of treatment. With the general increase in antimicrobial resistance, repeated use of antibiotics for the treatment of recurrent BV is clearly unsustainable.

Several factors are believed to play a role in the high recurrence rates, such as ineffective penetration of these antibiotics.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^112u1cXw]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Evidence to support sexual 'transmission' of the BV syndrome

There is longstanding evidence to support the contribution of sexual transmission to the pathogenesis of BV. In the 1950s, Gardner and Dukes first characterized BV and hypothesized that "… husbands must be treated simultaneously if recurrences by reinfection are to be prevented". When vaginal discharge was transferred from women with BV to those without, 11 out of 15 women developed clinical signs and microbiological features of BV, indicating the BV syndrome was infectious.

Initially, Gardnerella vaginalis was isolated from women with BV and hypothesized to be a new STI responsible for the syndrome; however, when 13 'healthy' women were inoculated with pure cultures of G. vaginalis (incubated for 24h prior to inoculation and in the stationary phase of growth), only one developed BV. In a subsequent study, which used fresh cultures of G. vaginalis incubated for 12h prior to inoculation and in the late logarithmic phase of growth, 5 out of 9 women developed the BV syndrome. This finding suggests that the phase of growth and environmental signals may control the expression of bacterial virulence factors, conferring greater pathogenic potential to G. vaginalis, a finding supported by more recent evidence.

In support of the initial hypothesis that G. vaginalis is the etiologic agent responsible for BV, it was isolated from the urethra of 91 out of 101 husbands of women with BV, but only 1 out of 38 male medical students. Successive studies also isolated G. vaginalis from the urethra of male partners of women with BV.

### A randomized trial of the duration of therapy with metronidazole plus or minus azithromycin for treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis [^116XWrAk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide. Currently, recommended treatments have poor efficacy and are associated with high rates of BV recurrence. We examined whether a longer duration of treatment with metronidazole or combination therapy with metronidazole and azithromycin would enhance the cure rates for BV. In addition, we examined factors other than drug therapy associated with cure.

- **Methods**: Women with symptomatic BV (defined by a modified Amsel criteria) were enrolled in a 4-arm study that compared metronidazole for 7 days versus 14 days, plus or minus azithromycin on days 1 and 3. Data regarding interim behaviors were also obtained, as were vaginal specimens for Gram staining.

- **Results**: At the first follow-up visit (7 days after the completion of therapy), there was a significant difference in cure rates among patients who received 7 days of metronidazole therapy compared with those who received 14 days of therapy, combined across azithromycin therapy (P = 0.0003). There was no effect associated with azithromycin therapy. There were no differences in cure rates between any of the treatment groups at 21 days after completion of therapy. Abstinence or protected sex, refraining from douching, and a lower baseline Nugent score for the vaginal Gram stain were all significantly associated with cure.

- **Conclusions**: Cure rates for BV were significantly improved by 14 days of metronidazole treatment (compared with 7 days of treatment), but the effects were not sustained, suggesting that relapse or reinfection occurred.

### Recurrent bacterial vaginosis following metronidazole treatment is associated with microbiota richness at diagnosis [^111BhUDE]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, a condition defined by a shift from Lactobacillus dominance to a polymicrobial, anaerobic bacterial community, increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections and other complications of the female reproductive tract. Antibiotic treatment frequently fails to return the microbiome to an optimal Lactobacillus-dominated state. No criteria currently exist to identify the patients likely to experience treatment failure.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify the pretreatment community signatures associated with treatment failure through 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis.

- **Study design**: Twenty-eight women who were enrolled in an oral metronidazole treatment trial of bacterial vaginosis were studied. Cervicovaginal lavage samples were collected before metronidazole treatment and at 7 and 30 days post-treatment. Cervicovaginal lavage DNA was amplified and sequenced using a paired-end, V4 region 2×150 MiSeq run.

- **Results**: Of the 28 women, 25% failed to clear bacterial vaginosis; 35.7% demonstrated a transient clearance, shifting to community-type 2 (Lactobacillus iners dominant) at visit 2 only; 7.1% demonstrated a delayed clearance, reaching community-type 2 at the final visit only; and 32.1% of patients experienced sustained bacterial vaginosis clearance. Examination of the community composition and structure demonstrated that both the richness and the evenness were significantly lower for the women who experienced sustained clearance, whereas the women who failed to clear bacterial vaginosis possessed the highest median levels of richness.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^116Ac4vJ]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Recommended first-line antimicrobial treatments, metronidazole or clindamycin, provide broad anaerobic coverage and are administered orally or intravaginally. These regimens have similar efficacy and cure approximately 70–85% of women with BV within one month; however, more than 50% experience recurrence of symptoms and/or BV on microscopy within six months. The low rate of sustained cure not only highlights our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence but also compounds women's distress and frustration, leading to repeated presentations to health services or the adoption of unproven home remedies.

- **Factors contributing to recurrence**: Persistence of a BV-associated biofilm, failure to recolonize the vagina with lactobacilli, reinfection from an untreated partner, and host genetic and/or immune factors may all play a role in recurrence. Frustratingly for both clinicians and patients, the contribution of reinfection and vaginal relapse cannot be separated, as the clinical presentation of both mechanisms of recurrence is identical.

Point-of-care laboratory tests cannot resolve this issue yet, and molecular methods, including next-generation sequencing, are unable to identify a unique or specific microbial signature to separate the two routes of recurrence. While persistence or resistance of BVAB or BV biofilm following antibiotic therapy is likely to be the dominant mechanism among some women, there is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of both optimal and detrimental bacteria between partners during sexual activity. These data suggest that reinfection of women with patho

### Treatment considerations for bacterial vaginosis and the risk of recurrence [^1117pJbh]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Recommended regimens for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) have similar efficacy; thus, the choice of treatment should consider additional factors such as the risk of BV recurrence and side effect profiles. The purpose of this study was to investigate BV recurrence rates and rates of acquiring vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) after different BV treatments in a commercially insured population.

- **Methods**: Private administrative insurance claims from 2004 to 2006 were used. Study subjects were continuously enrolled females aged 12–50 years who filled prescriptions for BV treatment (n = 32,268). The four BV treatments — single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%), multiple-dose clindamycin vaginal regimens, vaginal metronidazole, and oral metronidazole — were compared for rates of BV recurrence and VVC after treatment using multivariate analyses. Covariates included sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.

- **Results**: Overall, the rates of BV recurrence (2.7%) and VVC post-treatment (2.9%) were low. Women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) showed no significant difference from women treated with oral metronidazole in the likelihood of BV recurrence. However, women who received other vaginal treatments were significantly more likely to experience BV recurrence compared with women who received oral metronidazole (p < 0.01). Moreover, women who were treated with single-dose clindamycin vaginal cream (2%) and vaginal metronidazole were significantly less likely to have VVC compared with those treated with oral metronidazole (p < 0.01).

### Prevotella and gardnerella are associated with treatment failure following first-line antibiotics for bacterial vaginosis [^1125B53B]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

In this study, we identified specific vaginal taxa that were associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) recurrence within one month of treatment. Specifically, we found that a higher abundance of Prevotella spp immediately prior to treatment and Gardnerella spp immediately following treatment were both associated with increased odds of BV recurrence. Additionally, women who experienced recurrence had increased levels of BV-associated bacteria (primarily representing Gardnerella) relative to Lactobacillus spp (primarily representing L. iners) present in their vaginal microbiota immediately post-treatment compared to women who did not experience recurrence. Neither bacterial diversity nor the degree of compositional change following treatment was associated with BV recurrence. These findings provide insight into key taxa that may play a role in treatment failure following recommended BV therapy.

Prevotella and Gardnerella are commonly recovered from the vaginal microbiome of women with BV, and species from both genera possess characteristics that are important for BV initiation and persistence. In vitro, Prevotella bivia has been shown to produce ammonia and amino acids which enhance the growth of other BV-associated bacteria, including Gardnerella spp and Peptostreptococcus spp. Gardnerella, in turn, produces amino acids that stimulate the growth of P. bivia. In addition, both Gardnerella spp and Prevotella spp produce sialidases, and there is evidence that Prevotella may be a dominant source of vaginal sialidase.

### Prognostic indicators of recurrence of bacterial vaginosis [^114KC3PS]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Low credibility.

Following all forms of therapy for bacterial vaginosis (BV), recurrence rates are extremely high. Many diagnostic tests are available that differentiate bacterial vaginosis from other types of vaginal disorders, but none predict recurrence after treatment, nor are any vetted for monitoring ongoing responses to treatment. Our goal was to determine which tests, and at what optimal times, have prognostic value in predicting recurrence.

This prospective cohort study monitored 74 highly recurrent BV (reBV) patients for up to 9 months. Symptomatic BV patients were treated with oral metronidazole and were evaluated at cessation of treatment and monthly thereafter. Index tests included Amsel, Nugent, BV Blue, and Affirm VPIII, as well as a quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based test under initial evaluation here. The qPCR-based LbRC (Lactobacillus Relative Composition) assay predicted BV recurrence when performed shortly after oral metronidazole treatment, with both 90% positive predictive values (PPV) and 74% negative predictive values (NPV). The Nugent scores had 93% PPV but poor NPV (57%).

No test, at any other visit, was prognostic. The LbRC assay and, to a lesser extent, Nugent tests scored a week after oral metronidazole predicted recurrence, suggesting that the recurrence in this cohort was predominantly by relapse due to incomplete restoration of eubiosis soon after therapy. This is the first study in an under-evaluated population of reBV patients that emphasizes the need for and a pathway to a possible prognostic modality. Given the high recurrence rates of BV, further research is essential.

### Bacterial vaginosis: Drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117VSfPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is clear that therapies solely directed at women have failed to achieve a high rate of sustained cure. By continuing to ignore the potential risk of sexual transmission and reinfection when evaluating the efficacy of treatments, the effectiveness of these strategies is likely to be consistently underestimated. When managing a patient with BV, incorporating the regular partner, who may be a source of reinfection, provides an opportunity to make an impact on treatment outcomes.

We need to continue to assess how antimicrobials change the genital microbiomes of both women with BV and their partners to ensure the most effective regimens are utilized. Furthermore, to overcome the shortcomings of past partner treatment RCTs, we need innovative ways to engage women with BV and their partners to ensure recruitment of monogamous couples and promote adherence to treatment. Continued research into the pathogenicity of bacteria shared between couples may assist us in developing new treatment strategies, as well as providing evidence to support partner treatment as an adjunctive therapy to improve health outcomes for women.

### Changes in the vaginal microenvironment with metronidazole treatment for bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy [^114azSq2]. Journal of Women's Health (2009). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with preterm delivery, but there is little evidence that treatment improves pregnancy outcomes. We examined whether oral or vaginal metronidazole treatment for BV in early pregnancy was more effective in restoring the normal vaginal environment.

- **Methods**: This was a randomized controlled trial comparing oral and intravaginal metronidazole for treatment of BV in early pregnancy (< 20 weeks). Vaginal samples collected at baseline and 4 weeks after treatment were evaluated using gram stain, culture, colorimetric detection of sialidase, and immunoassay for measurement of proinflammatory cytokines interleukins-1beta, -6, -8 (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8), and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI). We compared the effect of treatment between groups (using chi-square and t test) and within individuals (McNemar's test).

- **Results**: Of 126 subjects, 108 (86%) completed follow-up (55 oral, 53 intravaginal). Of the study population, 34% achieved therapeutic cure, and this was not different between treatment groups. BV-associated bacteria were significantly reduced in both groups, but few subjects regained colonization with protective lactobacilli. Among women who achieved therapeutic cure, the level of IL-1beta dropped significantly (p < 0.001) and SLPI increased (p = 0.003). More women in the vaginal treatment group had undetectable sialidase after treatment (p = 0.013).

- **Conclusions**: Treatment with oral or intravaginal metronidazole in early pregnancy reduced colonization with BV-associated bacteria but was not effective in achieving the desired therapeutic outcomes.

### Cervicovaginal bacterial count and failure of metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis [^114yhUrf]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate whether total bacterial count in cervicovaginal fluid is associated with failure of metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis, a cross-sectional study was conducted. Women attending a primary health center in Botucatu, São Paulo, Brazil, for routine cervical screening between September 2012 and October 2013 were enrolled. Women who tested positive for bacterial vaginosis (Nugent classification) were offered oral metronidazole. Women who completed metronidazole treatment, along with an equal number of control women with normal vaginal flora at initial screening, were included in analyses of total bacterial count, assessed by flow cytometry of cervicovaginal fluid samples.

Of 287 women who enrolled, 49 were excluded because they tested positive for trichomoniasis, chlamydial endocervicitis, gonorrhea, or candidiasis. Among the remaining 238, 85 (35.7%) had bacterial vaginosis. Of 36 women evaluated at follow-up, 23 (63.9%) had successfully restored lactobacilli-dominant flora, 12 (33.3%) had persistent bacterial vaginosis, and 1 (2.8%) had vaginal candidiasis (excluded from flow cytometry). Total bacterial count did not differ between 35 women with bacterial vaginosis and 35 with normal vaginal flora (P = 0.62). Total bacterial count did not differ at enrollment between women who went on to have persistent bacterial vaginosis and those who had successful treatment (P = 0.78).

In conclusion, the failure of oral metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis was not associated with total bacterial count in cervicovaginal fluid.

### Quantitative modeling predicts mechanistic links between pre-treatment microbiome composition and metronidazole efficacy in bacterial vaginosis [^1116UzJh]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Initial composition influences efficacy in more complex models. While our model results emphasize the importance of pre-treatment Gv:Li ratios in MNZ efficacy in co-cultures, BV in women is more complex and involves interspecies interactions and strain variability across many different bacterial species.

To evaluate the above results in more complex settings that include multiple species, interspecies interactions, and strain variability, we created three additional model structures.

- **Models B and D**: We account for potential interspecies interactions, such as amensalism between Lactobacillus spp. and BV-associated bacteria, and commensal or mutualistic behavior within BV-associated bacteria subpopulations and Lactobacillus spp. [Figure 4a, d].

- **Models C and D**: We add additional representative species, including a second BV-associated species and a second Lactobacillus spp. [Figure 4c, d].

To address potential variability in associated parameters, we randomly selected parameter values from physiologically relevant ranges determined from previously published studies [Supplementary Tables 2 and 3]. Notably, across all four model structures, we found that higher initial relative amounts of BV-associated bacteria to Lactobacillus spp. had higher relative post-antibiotic levels of Lactobacillus spp. (BV:LB ratio) [Figure 4e, f, Supplementary Figure 6, p < 1E–6]. This result held for a range of ratios (0.6× BV:LB and 100× BV:LB) chosen to reflect the observed relative abundance of Lactobacillus spp. in BV positive women (60–1.0%).

### Effects of probiotics on the recurrence of bacterial vaginosis: a review [^116cUDt9]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common cause of genital discomfort in women of reproductive age and can lead to various complications. It is typically treated with metronidazole and clindamycin; however, these treatments do not prevent recurrence, which is a significant concern for patients. Women with BV have a significantly lower number of lactobacilli in the vagina compared to healthy women. Therefore, efforts have been made to restore vaginal flora through oral or vaginal administration of lactobacilli. This study aimed to review clinical evidence regarding the efficacy of probiotics in preventing and treating BV.

Published randomized controlled trials were searched in PubMed, Science Direct, and the Cochrane Database between 1990 and 2011, using search terms such as bacterial vaginosis, urinary tract infection, lactobacillus, and probiotics.

- **Results**: Orally consumed probiotics are believed to ascend to the vaginal tract after excretion from the rectum. Vaginal administration allows for direct replacement of probiotics for unhealthy vaginal microbiota and occupation of specific adhesion sites at the epithelial surface of the urinary tract. This process helps maintain a low pH and produces antimicrobial substances such as acids and hydrogen peroxide. A dosage of at least 10 CFU/day of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14 for two months has shown to provide patients with improved outcomes.
