## Question

ulcerative procititis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about ulcerative proctitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining ulcerative proctitis and its epidemiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and differential. Next, I will review first-line therapy and maintenance, followed by escalation strategies for refractory disease. After that, I need to check surgical indications and options. Finally, I will consider special populations, monitoring, and unmet needs, and I will double-check any numerical claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and epidemiology so I don't misstate anything. Ulcerative proctitis is inflammation limited to the rectum, typically within 15–20 cm of the anal verge, and it accounts for roughly 20–30% of ulcerative colitis presentations, with about 31% of new UC cases having proctitis at diagnosis in a European cohort, though estimates vary across populations and cohorts [^a17b6b15] [^b048a3c8]. Hold on, I should verify progression data: up to 46% of proctitis cases may extend proximally over time, with pooled extension around 22.8% at 5–10 years, which underscores the need for surveillance and proactive therapy [^e632122a] [^b048a3c8].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and differential. I need to ensure we exclude infection and confirm UC features endoscopically and histologically. Stool studies for C. difficile and bacterial pathogens are essential, and full ileocolonoscopy with biopsies helps confirm UC, define extent, and exclude Crohn's disease or other mimics; rectal sparing can occur with prior topical therapy, so I should be cautious in interpreting a normal-appearing rectum [^760f545b] [^a2f094da]. Wait, let me verify biomarker performance in proctitis: fecal calprotectin correlates less strongly with endoscopic activity in proctitis than in more extensive disease, so a normal calprotectin does not rule out active proctitis, and endoscopic assessment remains key when symptoms persist [^e2b4f9b1] [^60b53298].

> I will now examine first-line therapy for mild-to-moderately active proctitis. The AGA strongly recommends rectal mesalamine suppositories 1 g daily for induction and maintenance, with pooled RCT data showing superiority over placebo for induction and maintenance, and better tolerability and retention than enemas; ACG and ECCO align with this stance for distal disease [^b358d10c] [^d4e35437] [^4136bb2a]. Hold on, I should verify dosing and frequency: once-daily 1 g suppositories are effective and more convenient than divided dosing, and bedtime administration improves retention, which can aid adherence [^16bd8c02]. If suppositories are not feasible, enemas can be used, but suppositories are preferred for isolated proctitis because they deliver drug directly to the rectum with less proximal spread [^16bd8c02].

> Next, I should review maintenance therapy and adherence considerations. I need to ensure we emphasize that maintenance with rectal 5-ASA reduces relapse, and that many patients can use intermittent suppositories for infrequent flares given the lower colorectal cancer risk in isolated proctitis; however, adherence to rectal therapy is often suboptimal, so shared decision-making and adherence support are critical [^5c2b84ef] [^6cb4d494]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence: ACG gives a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence for rectal 5-ASA maintenance in proctitis, which supports routine maintenance when feasible [^923da0ba].

> For refractory proctitis, I should confirm escalation steps. If symptoms persist despite optimized rectal 5-ASA, adding oral 5-ASA can modestly improve outcomes, though the incremental benefit is smaller in isolated proctitis than in left-sided disease; if still refractory, topical corticosteroids such as budesonide foam or suppositories are reasonable, with ACG suggesting tacrolimus or beclomethasone suppositories when 5-ASA fails, acknowledging low-quality evidence [^a375599a] [^16bd8c02]. I should double-check the role of thiopurines: BSG suggests thiopurines after 5-ASA failure, but high-quality proctitis-specific data are limited, so this remains a conditional recommendation with careful monitoring [^e50e5689].

> Now, I need to check advanced therapies and the evidence gap. Most RCTs of biologics and small molecules exclude isolated proctitis, so recommendations are extrapolated from more extensive UC; nonetheless, consensus statements and guidelines support access to anti-TNFs, vedolizumab, and tofacitinib for refractory proctitis, with infliximab having the most supportive real-world and case-series signals in proctitis [^e50e5689] [^b048a3c8]. Hold on, I should verify combination therapy: in refractory cases, combining anti-TNF with thiopurine can be considered, mirroring strategies in moderate-to-severe UC, though proctitis-specific data are sparse [^e0e5c020].

> I should confirm surgical indications and options. Surgery is reserved for medically refractory disease, steroid dependence with unacceptable toxicity, or dysplasia/cancer; total proctocolectomy with IPAA is the standard restorative option, while total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy is a nonrestorative alternative for those with poor sphincter function, incontinence, or high risk of pouch failure; early surgical consultation is prudent when escalation fails [^4f4e1907] [^e0259cc9] [^72945cb4]. Wait, let me verify timing: contemporary practice favors a staged IPAA approach in the biologic era to reduce complications, and patient-specific factors should guide the choice between restorative and nonrestorative strategies [^7a453fff] [^e0259cc9].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with pediatrics. Children with proctitis are a minority and have higher rates of proximal extension than adults, so many pediatric guidelines favor adding oral 5-ASA even in limited disease; topical 5-ASA remains first-line, but closer monitoring and earlier escalation are reasonable given extension risk [^79a2b6b1] [^b28a2bce]. I should confirm that pediatric data are sparse and often extrapolated from adult literature, reinforcing the need for individualized care and shared decision-making with families [^79a2b6b1].

> Next, I should review monitoring and disease course. I need to ensure we reassess extent periodically because up to 46% of proctitis can extend, and extension increases colectomy risk and cancer surveillance needs; endoscopic reassessment at 1–2 years is reasonable in stable patients, and earlier if symptoms change or new features arise [^e632122a] [^924ce721]. Hold on, I should verify surveillance: CRC risk in isolated proctitis is near general-population levels, but if disease extends or PSC is present, surveillance intervals should follow UC-wide protocols, typically colonoscopy every 1–3 years depending on risk stratification [^666996d7] [^5c2b84ef].

> I will now examine unmet needs and research gaps. Proctitis is systematically excluded from most modern RCTs, leading to very low-quality evidence for advanced therapies; consensus initiatives like PROCTRIAL have begun to standardize definitions and endpoints, but head-to-head trials and biomarker-driven strategies are urgently needed to personalize therapy and clarify sequencing [^a767f99f] [^b048a3c8]. But wait, what if biomarkers could guide therapy? Fecal calprotectin performs poorly for detecting mild proctitis, so endoscopic assessment remains the gold standard, and patient-reported outcomes capturing urgency, tenesmus, and incontinence are underrepresented in current tools, limiting our ability to measure what matters to patients [^e2b4f9b1] [^044e71ac].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with guidelines. First-line is rectal mesalamine 1 g nightly for induction and maintenance, with early addition of oral 5-ASA if response is suboptimal; if refractory, escalate to topical corticosteroids or tacrolimus/beclomethasone suppositories; if still refractory, consider thiopurines and then advanced therapies such as anti-TNF, vedolizumab, or tofacitinib, recognizing the evidence gap; throughout, exclude infection, assess adherence, and manage proximal constipation, which can mimic or worsen proctitis symptoms [^b358d10c] [^a375599a] [^e50e5689]. Hold on, I should verify that this stepwise approach matches both AGA and ACG guidance: yes, both endorse rectal-first strategies for proctitis and support escalation to systemic or advanced therapies when appropriate, with shared decision-making given the limited proctitis-specific data [^b358d10c] [^a375599a].

Ulcerative proctitis is **inflammation limited to the rectum** [^a17b6b15], presenting with rectal bleeding, urgency, and tenesmus [^2a8c093b]. Diagnosis requires colonoscopy with biopsies to confirm extent and exclude infection or Crohn's disease [^a2f094da] [^760f545b]. First-line therapy is **rectal mesalamine suppositories** [^b358d10c] for induction and maintenance [^d4e35437]; if refractory, add oral mesalamine or rectal corticosteroids [^a375599a] [^4fa183f2], and escalate to thiopurines or biologics for steroid-dependent or refractory disease [^e50e5689] [^aff64be7]. Proximal extension occurs in about 22–31% over 5–10 years [^b048a3c8], so surveillance is essential [^a2f094da]. Surgery is rarely needed and reserved for refractory cases or dysplasia [^af96939f] [^72945cb4].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical symptoms include:

- **Rectal bleeding**: Often the predominant symptom [^2a8c093b].
- **Urgency and tenesmus**: Frequent, urgent stools with a feeling of incomplete evacuation [^2a8c093b].
- **Mucus discharge**: Common with active inflammation [^notfound].
- **Constipation or diarrhea**: Variable, often alternating [^2a8c093b].

Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss) are **rare** unless there is proximal extension or severe inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis relies on **endoscopic and histologic confirmation**:

- **Colonoscopy with biopsies**: Gold standard to confirm rectal-only disease and exclude Crohn's disease or infection [^a2f094da] [^760f545b].
- **Infectious workup**: Stool studies for C. difficile, bacterial pathogens, and STIs (gonorrhea, chlamydia, HSV) when indicated [^760f545b] [^e50e5689].
- **Biomarkers**: Fecal calprotectin and CRP may be elevated but are less reliable in proctitis; use to support activity, not to diagnose [^e2b4f9b1] [^60b53298].

---

## Medical management

### First-line therapy

Rectal mesalamine suppositories (**1 g nightly**) are first-line for induction and maintenance, with superior efficacy to placebo and oral mesalamine in proctitis [^b358d10c] [^d4e35437] [^676e54b4]. Combination therapy (**oral plus rectal mesalamine**) can be considered for suboptimal response or moderate disease [^a375599a] [^af8d26d2].

---

### Second-line therapy

Oral mesalamine (**2–3 g/day**) may be added if rectal therapy alone is insufficient [^a375599a] [^af8d26d2]. Rectal corticosteroids (**foam or suppositories**) are options for patients intolerant or refractory to mesalamine [^4fa183f2] [^a375599a].

---

### Refractory disease

Thiopurines (**azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine**) are reasonable for steroid-dependent or mesalamine-refractory proctitis, though high-quality proctitis-specific data are limited [^e50e5689] [^e0e5c020]. Biologics (**anti-TNF agents, vedolizumab, ustekinumab**) are indicated for steroid-refractory or immunomodulator-refractory disease, with infliximab having the most supportive evidence in proctitis [^e50e5689] [^aff64be7].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is rarely indicated and is reserved for **medically refractory disease**, **severe complications** (strictures, dysplasia, cancer), or **patient preference**. Options include total proctocolectomy with end ileostomy or ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) [^4f4e1907] [^e0259cc9].

---

## Prognosis and disease course

Ulcerative proctitis generally has a favorable prognosis, but **proximal extension** occurs in 22–31% over 5–10 years, necessitating ongoing surveillance [^b048a3c8] [^e632122a]. Colorectal cancer risk is lower than in extensive colitis but increases with disease duration and extension; surveillance colonoscopy is recommended every 1–3 years depending on extent and duration [^666996d7] [^5c2b84ef].

---

## Quality of life and patient-reported outcomes

Ulcerative proctitis significantly impairs quality of life due to urgency, incontinence, and sexual dysfunction; **patient-reported outcomes** are often underrecognized in clinical trials, highlighting the need for better symptom metrics and patient-centered care [^044e71ac] [^b048a3c8].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Recent and ongoing research includes:

- **Topical tacrolimus**: Small studies suggest benefit in refractory proctitis [^678a5910] [^e0e5c020].
- **JAK inhibitors**: Tofacitinib shows promise in refractory proctitis [^79a2b6b1].
- **Fecal microbiota transplantation**: Under investigation but not standard care [^7edefc86].

---

Ulcerative proctitis is a **localized form of UC** with a favorable prognosis but a meaningful risk of extension. Rectal mesalamine is first-line; escalation to oral mesalamine, rectal steroids, thiopurines, or biologics is guided by response and disease course. Surgery is rare and reserved for refractory cases or dysplasia, and ongoing surveillance is essential to detect extension and complications early [^b358d10c] [^a375599a] [^e50e5689] [^af96939f] [^666996d7].

### Management of proctitis in ulcerative colitis and the place of biological therapies [^aff64be7]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Approximately 20–30% of the patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) may present with isolated proctitis. Ulcerative proctitis (UP) is a challenging condition to manage due to its significant burden in terms of disabling symptoms.

Areas Covered

PubMed was searched up to March 2024 to identify relevant studies on UP. A comprehensive summary and critical appraisal of the available data on UP are provided, highlighting emerging treatments and areas for future research.

Expert Opinion

Patients with UP are often undertreated, and the disease burden is often underestimated in clinical practice. Treat-to-target management algorithms can be applied to UP, aiming for clinical remission in the short term, and endoscopic remission and maintenance of remission in the long term. During their disease, approximately one-third of UP patients require advanced therapies. Escalation to biologic therapy is required for refractory or steroid dependent UP. For optimal patient care and management of UP, it is necessary to include these patients in future randomized clinical trials.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^970d112b]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Effective and timely management of patients with ulcerative proctitis is therefore important not only to control symptoms and improve quality of life, but also potentially to delay or prevent proximal extension of inflammation and improve outcomes. To develop management strategies and improve health outcomes for patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis, agreement is needed on the current knowledge and opinions on the condition.

Aims

This study aimed to explore and better understand the opinions of healthcare professionals caring for, and patients living with, ulcerative proctitis. In order to do this, we recruited a small group of healthcare professionals and patients from around the UK to contribute initial thoughts on clinical and research needs in this area of IBD care by taking part in a focus group. We used the statements generated from the focus group work to develop a Delphi survey of key statements, this was then opened to a wider group of patients and healthcare professionals who met the inclusion criteria.

### French national consensus clinical guidelines for the management of ulcerative colitis [^224f7c35]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of multifactorial etiology that primarily affects the colonic mucosa. The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach.

Aim

To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions.

Methods

The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus.

Results

A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

Conclusions

Given the limited available evidence-based data, a formal consensus methodology was used to develop simple treatment guidelines for UC management in different clinical situations that is now accessible via an online application.

### Ulcerative colitis [^7d920111]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic, chronic inflammatory disorder of the colonic mucosa, which starts in the rectum and generally extends proximally in a continuous manner through part of, or the entire, colon; however, some patients with proctitis or left-sided colitis might have a caecal patch of inflammation. Bloody diarrhoea is the characteristic symptom of the disease. The clinical course is unpredictable, marked by alternating periods of exacerbation and remission. In this Seminar we discuss the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, natural history, medical and surgical management, and main disease-related complications of ulcerative colitis, and briefly outline novel treatment options. Enhanced understanding of how the interaction between environmental factors, genetics, and the immune system results in mucosal inflammation has increased knowledge of disease pathophysiology. We provide practical therapeutic algorithms that are easily applicable in daily clinical practice, emphasising present controversies in treatment management and novel therapies.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) has a prevalence of 1 in 125 (0.8%). It is unclear at any one time how many patients with UC have ulcerative proctitis where inflammation is confined to the anatomical region of the rectum. Refractory ulcerative proctitis is a prevalent problem and there is a large unmet need within IBD research on this chronic, progressive condition.

A ratio of 4.2:3.7:2.2for extensive colitis (E3), left-sided colitis (E2) and proctitis (E1) has been reported, respectively, with the highest prevalence of ulcerative proctitis identified at 33%. In a recent prospective European population-based inception cohort, 31% (93/300) of patients with UC have E1 at diagnosis, with 24% progressing to E2 and 14% progressing to E3 at the end of 7-year follow-up. The pooled frequency of UC extension rates are 22.8%, more specifically 17.8% at 5 years and 31% at 10 years, or 17.8% (95% CI 11.2 to 27.3) from E1 to E3, 27.5% (95% CI 7.6 to 45.6) from E2 to E3 and 20.8% (95% CI 11.4 to 26.8) from E1 to E2. Controlling the disease in limited proctitis is essential to preventing disease extension and any possible risks that may result from extension, such as a more severe clinical course and an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

In patients whose disease does not progress and remains confined to the rectum, ulcerative proctitis is still often responsible for distressing symptoms such as tenesmus, urgency, faecal incontinence, proximal constipation and rectal bleeding, leading to a reduced quality of life. A third (31%) of patients with ulcerative proctitis have refractory disease. Refractory disease is defined as active proctitis which fails rectal and oral therapy with aminosalicylates (5-ASA) and corticosteroids.5-ASA suppositories are the first-line treatment in patients with refractory disease, followed by immunomodulators and/or biological therapies. Treatment of refractory proctitis remains challenging because these patients are systematically excluded from randomised controlled trials with drugs with new modes of action. In the absence of controlled data, recommendations for the management of ulcerative proctitis are therefore extrapolated from data in more extended UC or from small real-world evidence.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^ba7820b0]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

From the Delphi survey, it was felt that there is not enough clarity surrounding the use of small molecules and sequencing of biological agents for the treatment of proctitis. Evidence-based guidance advising on the use of biological sequencing exists for UC, but there is no current guidance on their role in proctitis or extensive disease. Additionally, the source of these recommendations come from licencing trials which exclude proctitis from their inclusion criteria.

While formal clinical guidelines are still required, these statements could be considered and used by practitioners in real clinical practice to act as a basis for the management of refractory proctitis, especially in patients with poor disease control. As an example, combination treatment with immunomodulators and biological agents should be considered to treat refractory inflammatory disease in proctitis. A limitation to this study is the small sample size of the Delphi survey participants and further work could focus on validating these statements in a prospective study with a larger sample size of participants with a broader scope of knowledge on the condition.

Refractory proctitis is an under-researched area, as most clinical trials exclude this specific patient group, resulting in a dearth of evidenced-based data and guidance for the medical professionals who care for them. Ultimately, the thoughts from the Delphi survey confirmed this opinion and consensus was met that further research should be focused on this disease.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^d370f9f1]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Refractory ulcerative proctitis presents a huge clinical challenge not only for the patients living with this chronic, progressive condition but also for the professionals who care for them. Currently, there is limited research and evidence-based guidance, resulting in many patients living with the symptomatic burden of disease and reduced quality of life. The aim of this study was to establish a consensus on the thoughts and opinions related to refractory proctitis disease burden and best practice for management.

Methods

A three-round Delphi consensus survey was conducted among patients living with refractory proctitis and the healthcare experts with knowledge on this disease from the UK. A brainstorming stage involving a focus group where the participants came up with an initial list of statements was completed. Following this, there were three rounds of Delphi surveys in which the participants were asked to rank the importance of the statements and provide any additional comments or clarifications. Calculation of mean scores, analysis of comments and revisions were performed to produce a final list of statements.

Results

In total, 14 statements were suggested by the focus group at the initial brainstorming stage. Following completion of three Delphi survey rounds, all 14 statements reached consensus following appropriate revision.

Conclusions

We established consensus on the thoughts and opinions related to refractory proctitis from both the experts who manage this disease and the patients living with it. This represents the first step towards developing clinical research data and ultimately the evidence needed for best practice management guidance of this condition.

### Clinical guidelines for the medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis: summary statement [^562c0b36]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

There are few published guidelines for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Physicians choose therapy based on evidence-based data, peer and expert opinion, and personal experience. This article provides treatment guidelines for the induction and maintenance of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided colitis and the management of disease refractory to 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) compounds and corticosteroids The guidelines are derived from evidence-based data and, when lacking, expert opinion or the authors' experience. The comprehensive review of the literature is presented in the accompanying article, "The Medical Management of Left-Sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Critical Evaluation of Therapeutic Trials". Rectally administered 5-ASA and corticosteroid suppositories are effective treatment for most ulcerative proctitis patients. Corticosteroid and 5-ASA enemas, which reach the splenic flexure of the colon, are recommended for patients with left-sided ulcerative colitis. The combination of rectally administered 5-ASA enemas and oral 5-ASA agents may afford better treatment of left-sided colitis and possibly prevent proximal extension of disease. Patients refractory to 5-ASAs and corticosteroids may require an immunomodulator or biological response modifier therapy. Those who have ongoing signs and symptoms of ulcerative proctitis and left-sided ulcerative colitis despite maximal medical therapy require a proctocolectomy.

### The management of the hospitalized ulcerative colitis patient: the medical-surgical conundrum [^9596a889]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In this review article, we address emerging evidence for the medical and surgical treatment of the hospitalized patient with ulcerative colitis.

Recent Findings

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease involving the colon and rectum. About one-fifth of patients will be hospitalized from ulcerative colitis, and about 20–30%, experiencing an acute flare will undergo colectomy. Because of the significant clinical consequences, patients hospitalized need prompt evaluation for potential complications, stratification of disease severity, and a multidisciplinary team approach to therapy, which involves both the gastroenterologist and surgeon. Although corticosteroids remain first-line therapy, second-line medical rescue options, primarily infliximab or cyclosporine, are considered within 3–5 days of presentation. In conjunction, an early surgical consultation to present the possibility of a staged proctocolectomy as one of the therapeutic options is equally important.

Summary

A coordinated multidisciplinary, individualized approach to treatment, involving the patient preferences throughout the process, is optimal in providing patient-centered effective care.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surgical management of ulcerative colitis [^2d62f92b]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — statement of the problem — is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition that affects the mucosa lining the colon and rectum and, for unknown reasons, continues to increase in incidence with nearly 3.1 million people affected in the United States alone; patients most often present in 2 general age categories, between about ages 15 and 30 or 55 and 65, with rectal bleeding, urgency, and/or tenesmus from proctitis.

### Systematic review for non-surgical interventions for the management of late radiation proctitis [^95c43660]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

A detailed account of the determination of the diagnosis including background details such as precise radiation prescription and absence of infection.
Scored symptoms as in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) with the Colitis Activity Index or the Ulcerative Colitis Scoring System, before and after the specific intervention.
Scored endoscopic appearance (as for UC e.g. Baron score and the Colitis Endoscopic index), before and after the specific intervention.
Scored histological assessment (as for UC) which should be standardised.

The outstanding issue is the degree to which radiation induced damage to the rectum contributes to symptoms in this group of patients and how much comes from residual tumour, psychological factors, co-incident small intestinal damage or other changes within the abdomen and pelvis outside the bowel. Some of the areas that need to be addressed include:

How should late radiation proctitis be staged and how should endoscopic, radiological, physiological and quality of life assessments be combined to assess the patient's needs best?
Who needs intervention?
What treatments are effective?
Is there an optimal step up treatment approach?
How should patients be followed up after treatments, how long for and what parameters should be measured subsequently?

Implications for practice and research

If the management of late radiation practice is to become evidence based then good quality placebo-controlled studies need to be conducted to support the treatment options recommended. This review suggests that late radiation proctitis is not reported very often by patients to the clinicians who deliver the pelvic radiotherapy and as a result a number of fundamental issues remain to be clarified. First, the true incidence of the disease is not clear. Therefore, physicians caring for patients who have undergone pelvic radiotherapy need to be more aware that this group may develop problematic symptoms which may need detailed questioning to elicit and which may require specialist gastroenterological assessment to characterize in detail. Secondly, there is an urgent need to define clearly the diagnostic criteria and a unified grading system by which late radiation proctitis can be categorised. Without such a system, it is unlikely that meaningful randomised studies, particularly in a multi-centre setting, can be designed.

We propose that cases should be enrolled into regional or centralised registers of radiation toxicity or that all such patients should be referred to regional centres with an interest in radiation-induced gut toxicity. In this way terminology, baseline assessments including comorbidity and the documentation of therapeutic effect could be standardised. Interventions could be randomised and outcome data could be pooled to assess the response to treatment objectively. This approach would provide an evidence base of results of different treatments to develop an integrated care pathway for this difficult condition.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^f04e1337]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we achieved a consensus on 14 statements by means of the Delphi methodology on the opinions and needs of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis, and the healthcare professionals who care for them. We hope this statement will guide funders on potential themed calls. This is the first step towards more clinical research and ultimately guidance aimed at this specific patient group with ulcerative proctitis.

### Management of ulcerative colitis [^e9198a74]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Within the diagnostic label of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) is typically characterised by diffuse mucosal inflammation, limited to the colon, with confluent inflammation extending proximally from the rectum to varying severity and extent. In children, it is well recognised however, that UC typically affects all or most of the colon (extensive or pan-colitis), whereas adults more often present with localised distal disease (proctitis). Recently, the paediatric Porto criteria for the diagnosis of IBD have been revised to take account of diagnostic advances, for example, in imaging techniques, and also to help correctly assign patients to the differing IBD subgroups. In the paediatric age group, up to 10% of cases cannot be assigned to as either UC or Crohn's despite comprehensive assessment. These are classified as IBD unclassified, although in practice, currently, they are most commonly treated along the same lines as UC.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^d5231b47]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Therapeutic approach for mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) — the recommendations "were developed using the GRADE framework" to "reduce practice variation and promote high-quality, high-value care". The guideline states "The current evidence supports use of standard-dose mesalamine or azo-bonded 5-ASAs for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with extensive mild–moderate UC". For extensive disease, "Use of combined oral and rectal 5-ASA… may improve rates of induction of remission, as may escalation to high-dose oral with rectal 5-ASA in patients with suboptimal response to standard-dose therapy", and "Those with moderate symptoms may benefit from early use of combined oral and rectal 5-ASA". For distal disease, "Patients with proctosigmoiditis or proctitis can be treated with topical mesalamines rather than oral 5-ASA", while "Those patients with suboptimal response or intolerance to rectal mesalamine may opt to use rectal corticosteroids enemas or foams". When optimized 5-ASA is insufficient, "Patients with inadequate response to optimized 5-ASA require escalation of therapy to oral prednisone or budesonide MMX".

Ulcerative colitis with diagnosed colorectal cancer — operative approach emphasizes that patients with UC diagnosed with CRC should undergo staging and be discussed in a multidisciplinary team tumor board and are typically recommended to undergo total proctocolectomy. For those undergoing total proctocolectomy, an oncological resection with appropriate lymph node harvest should be performed to allow for appropriate oncological staging. Patients with UC diagnosed with rectal adenocarcinoma who undergo neoadjuvant radiotherapy should be appropriately counseled that an IPAA in this setting may have worse functional outcomes; however, external beam radiation therapy is not an absolute contraindication to subsequent pouch formation.

Ulcerative colitis–associated colorectal neoplasia — regardless of extent of disease at initial diagnosis, patients should undergo a screening colonoscopy within a year of the onset of symptoms, and surveillance colonoscopy should, ideally, be performed when the colonic disease is in remission; patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis should begin screening at the time of diagnosis and undergo surveillance annually; European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidance recommends annual colonoscopy for highest-risk patients (PSC or history of dysplasia or stricture), every 2 to 3 years for intermediate-risk patients (extensive or long-standing colitis or a family history of CRC), and a 5-year interval for low-risk patients, while the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends annual surveillance colonoscopy for patients with PSC, active inflammation, a history of dysplasia or CRC in a first-degree relative, or a stricture and every 1 to 3 years for average-risk patients; patients with a rectal stump after colectomy are at risk of developing neoplasia and should undergo regular proctoscopic surveillance.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) surgical management — Approximately 15% to 20% of patients with UC still require colectomy for medically refractory disease and/or neoplasia of the colon or rectum. Complete removal of all at-risk tissue (ie, the colon and the rectum) is considered curative for the intestinal manifestations of UC. Operative strategies for patients with UC may include a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy or ileoproctostomy or total proctocolectomy with a permanent end ileostomy, a continent ileostomy, or construction of an IPAA, all of which are increasingly performed using minimally invasive techniques. Optimal management involves a multidisciplinary team approach including colorectal surgeons, gastroenterologists, radiologists, pathologists, nutritionists, and enterostomal therapists.

### Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of ulcerative proctitis, chronic radiation proctopathy, and diversion proctitis [^6252df52]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic proctitis refers to persistent or relapsing inflammation of the rectum, which results from a wide range of etiologies with various pathogenic mechanisms. The patients may share similar clinical presentations. Ulcerative proctitis, chronic radiation proctitis or proctopathy, and diversion proctitis are the 3 most common forms of chronic proctitis. Although the diagnosis of these disease entities may be straightforward in the most instances based on the clinical history, endoscopic, and histologic features, differential diagnosis may sometimes become problematic, especially when their etiologies and the disease processes overlap. The treatment for the 3 forms of chronic proctitis is different, which may shed some lights on their pathogenetic pathway. This article provides an overview of the latest data on the clinical features, etiologies, diagnosis, and management of ulcerative proctitis, chronic radiation proctopathy, and diversion proctitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of ulcerative proctitis [^2a8c093b]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Proctitis refers to inflammation of the rectum, a diagnosis made by endoscopic evaluation. Symptoms of proctitis include rectal bleeding, urgency, tenesmus, diarrhea or constipation, and occasionally rectal pain. The causes of proctitis include infection, medication, ischemia, radiation, and ulcerative proctitis. Ulcerative proctitis is an important and increasingly common subcategory of ulcerative colitis (UC) in which inflammation is limited to the rectum. Historically, oral aminosalicylates have been the mainstay of acute and maintenance therapy. A growing body of data, however, indicates that topical aminosalicylates are effective first line agents in ulcerative proctitis and distal UC. Topical aminosalicylates act more effectively and rapidly to induce and maintain remission compared with their oral counterparts or topical steroids. Rarely ulcerative proctitis is refractory to topical therapy and in these instances systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics, immunomodulators, or surgery is required. This review highlights the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of ulcerative proctitis.

### Medical management of left-sided ulcerative colitis and ulcerative proctitis: critical evaluation of therapeutic trials [^6133ea35]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this work was to critically evaluate the published studies on the treatment of ulcerative proctitis (UP) and left-sided ulcerative colitis (L-UC). The results of this review provided the content for the accompanying treatment guidelines, Clinical Guidelines for the Medical Management of Left-sided Ulcerative Colitis and Ulcerative Proctitis: Summary Statement.

Methods

All English language articles published between 1995 and September 2005 were identified through a comprehensive literature search using OVID and PubMed. The quality of the data supporting or rejecting the use of specific therapies was categorized by a data quality grading scale. An "A+" grade was assigned to treatment supported by multiple high-quality randomized controlled trials with consistent results, whereas a "D" grade was given to therapy supported only by expert opinion. The therapeutic efficacy of a treatment was defined by its success in treating UP and L-UC compared with placebo. A medication was ranked as "excellent" if it was specifically studied for UP and L-UC and had consistently positive results compared with placebo or another agent. Quality and efficacy scores were agreed on by author consensus.

Results

For the acute treatment of UP or L-UC, the rectally administered corticosteroids and mesalazine (5-ASA), either alone or in combination with oral 5-ASAs, are the most effective therapy: evidence quality, A+; efficacy, excellent. Only rectally administered 5-ASA received an A+/excellent rating for maintenance of remission. Infliximab received an A+ grade for induction and maintenance of remission but only a "good" rating because the studies were performed in all UC, not specifically UP or L-UC.

Conclusions

This critical evaluation of treatment provides a "report card" on medications available for the management of patients with UP and L-UC. The guidelines should provide a useful reference and supplement for physicians treating UC patients.

### Differential efficacy of medical therapies for ulcerative colitis according to disease extent: patient-level analysis from multiple randomized controlled trials [^6963c347]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

In clinical trials for moderate to severe UC, patients with isolated proctitis have historically been excluded. Among the recruited patients, typically two-thirds have left-sided disease and one-third extensive disease at baseline; however, disease location is not used as a stratification factor. Given that patients with extensive versus left-sided colitis have different prognosis and inflammatory burden, it is plausible that response to treatment could vary. Thus, we undertook an individual patient level data meta-analysis from multiple clinical trials of advanced therapies in UC to investigate whether clinical outcomes were influenced by disease distribution. By identifying the impact of disease distribution on treatment efficacy, the results may help to inform treatment recommendations as well as the design of future clinical trials.

Several inflammatory and noninflammatory complications can occur after IPAA. Pouchitis is the most common, occurring in approximately 50% of patients. Whereas "acute" pouchitis can be treated rapidly and successfully in the majority of patients, "refractory" and "chronic pouchitis" remain therapeutic challenges to patients and physicians.

3.10.4 Treatment options in refractory proctitis

Statement 14. We suggest that refractory ulcerative proctitis may require treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators and/or biological therapy (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.5%).

A proctitis management flowchart is shown in figure 1. In severe or refractory proctitis, it is important to ensure that conventional therapy has been delivered appropriately (with assessment of adherence) and that the diagnosis is correct. Proximal constipation is common and may contribute to symptoms and poor response to therapy, as may co-existing irritable bowel syndrome. It is important to exclude other conditions that may be causing symptoms, including infection (lymphogranuloma venereum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, Giardia duodenalis, amoebiasis), solitary rectal ulcer, psoriatic colitis, chemical colitis and rectal prolapse.

Figure 1
Management of proctitis.

If the diagnosis is correct and standard therapy has failed, then thiopurine therapy should be added, with escalation to biologics if no response. Many UC trials have excluded proctitis, but a case series of infliximab therapy for proctitis confirms good response. Patients with refractory proctitis have disabling symptoms but are often systemically well and are usually very reluctant to have proctocolectomy, so many other therapies have been assessed. There are many other treatments based on small trials or case series — for example, rectal tacrolimus (0.5 mg/mL, dose 3 mL twice daily) — although active absorption results in significant serum levels and close monitoring and dose adjustment are required to avoid toxicity.

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^e0e5c020]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Agreement was reached that in patients with refractory proctitis, combination treatment with both biological agents and immunomodulators should be considered. It is essential that any clinician excludes other differentials prior to advanced therapies, such as acute infection, irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease, as these diagnoses may present with similar symptoms which mimic refractory disease. Furthermore, assuming that the symptoms described by a patient are due to active inflammatory disease, with proximal constipation being appropriately managed, then second-line or third-line biological treatments and small molecules could be warranted. Additionally, in select scenarios when the risks and benefits have been appropriately counselled to a patient, a low-dose topical or steroid therapy, such as 5 mg prednisolone tablets or suppositories, could be considered to treat troublesome symptoms in proctitis. For purposes of clarification, we included a dosage for prednisolone, which should not detract from the guidance for prescribing.

An additional area that was felt to have unclear clinical guidance included the role of thiopurines in the treatment of mesalazine-refractory proctitis and the use of off-licence topical therapies such as acetarsol or tacrolimus. The 2019 BSG IBD guidelines state that if the diagnosis is correct and standard therapy fails, then thiopurine therapy should be added in for proctitis, with escalation to biologics if no response is seen. One study found that azathioprine was more effective at achieving steroid-free clinical and endoscopic remission after 6 months compared with oral 5-ASAs in corticosteroid-dependent UC. For off-licence topical therapies, a Cochrane review on tacrolimus inducing remission in corticosteroid‐refractory UC highlighted the fact that further research including clinical trials are warranted to create real evidence-based guidance on the use of these drugs. However, a recent retrospective analysis on the efficacy of acetarsol suppositories found that two out of three patients with refractory proctitis responded well to acetarsol. The results of this study would be highly beneficial in furthering our understanding and creating practical guidance on the treatment of refractory proctitis.

Ulcerative proctosigmoiditis/proctitis — rectal versus oral mesalamine for induction and maintenance: The AGA suggests using mesalamine enemas (or suppositories) rather than oral mesalamine in patients with mild–moderate ulcerative proctosigmoiditis or proctitis. Conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence. Pooled analyses of 4 RCTs showed a trend favoring rectal mesalamine over oral mesalamine for induction (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.14–1.31), and after excluding 1 trial comparing high-dose MMX-release mesalamine vs mesalamine enemas, topical 5-ASA was significantly more effective than oral therapy (RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.56). For maintenance of remission, pooled effect estimates from 3 single-blinded trials showed a trend for increased effectiveness of topical 5-ASA vs oral therapy (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.41–1.17). In these studies, oral therapy consisted of sulfasalazine 2 g/d or low-dose mesalamine, while topical 5-ASA consisted of mesalamine enemas 4 g 2–3 times per week or 1 week per month. Some have defined left-sided disease as inflammation extending up to the splenic flexure, while others have used a definition of inflammation extending < 50 cm from the anus, and patients with active disease may have difficulty retaining enemas; given these limitations and the uncertainty in the extent estimates, patients with mild–moderate ulcerative proctosigmoiditis who place higher value on convenience of oral medication administration may reasonably choose oral 5-ASA over rectal therapy.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^60e530ff]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — conclusions outline disease characterization and management, noting that UC is an idiopathic chronic inflammatory condition of the recto-colon and colon with variable activity and severity and significant morbidity. Appropriate management involves successful induction of both clinical and endoscopic remission followed by use of a corticosteroid-free maintenance strategy and ongoing monitoring for disease and drug-related complications. Choice of therapy is based on activity, severity, extent of inflammation and prognostic factors, and may include oral, topical (rectal), or systemic therapies, as well as surgery. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease should be treated early in their disease course with therapies that have been shown to be effective and should not linger with suboptimal therapy or recurrent courses of corticosteroids. In general, the induction therapy selected drives the choice of maintenance therapy. Positioning considerations include a single head-to-head trial in moderately to severely active UC, separation of induction and maintenance strategies for some patients with ASUC, and considerations of comorbid or concomitantly existing extraintestinal manifestations. We advocate for preservation of the clinician-patient shared decision-making approach to therapy selection and exclusion of limitations imposed by third-party payers.

### Pouchitis: a practical guide [^b58fd15f]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) will require surgical management. The established surgical procedure of choice is colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) for most patients. Patients with UC who have undergone IPAA are prone to develop inflammatory and non-inflammatory complications. Up to 50% of patients can be expected to experience at least one episode of pouchitis, and most of these patients will experience at least one additional acute episode within 2years. In other cases, pouchitis might follow a relapsing-remitting course or a chronically active course. The specific aetiology of pouchitis is unknown and the optimal means of diagnosis and classification of pouchitis is not completely agreed upon. Diagnosis of pouchitis based on symptoms alone has been shown to be non-specific due to the fact that symptoms can originate from a myriad of aetiologies, not necessarily inflammatory in nature. As a result, the diagnosis of pouchitis should generally be based on the appropriate constellation of symptoms, combined with endoscopic and histological assessment. Due to the frequently relapsing course of pouchitis, and the fact that the aetiology and pathogenesis are not entirely clear, the long-term management can sometimes be challenging. This review outlines the features suggestive of deviation from 'normal' pouch function and provides an approach to the optimal use of diagnostic modalities and medical therapies to treat pouchitis in its various forms.

### Therapeutic strategies for the management of ulcerative colitis [^7e8bbe98]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Induction and maintenance of remission, mucosal healing, the avoidance of surgical intervention, and decreasing the likelihood of cancer developing are the primary therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis (UC). For the traditional therapies, 5-aminosalicylic acid (including mesalamine), corticosteroids, and thiopurines (azathioprine and mercaptopurine), there are major changes evolving in terms of formulation, patterns of use, and appreciation of long-term benefits and toxicities. The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and tacrolimus, and infliximab, have recently defined, well-established roles. Preliminary supportive evidence is emerging in relation to novel antiinflammatory molecules such as curcumin, manipulation of the bacterial flora, enhancement of the mucosal barrier, and direct epithelial restoration. For patients in whom the disease is resistant to standard simple therapies, strategies are required to integrate these developing and new therapies into clinical practice. This review aims to highlight the evidence supporting new patterns of use of existing therapies and new therapies, and to devise therapeutic pathways that incorporate these new treatments. We propose how treatment might be optimized to improve the outcome in patients with mild-to-moderately active UC, chronic active UC, resistant proctitis, and fulminant UC.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) — management of nonhospitalized moderately or severely active disease includes nuanced induction and optimization steps: 5-ASA therapy "could be used as monotherapy for induction of moderately but not severely active UC"; in moderately active UC, "consider nonsystemic corticosteroids such as budesonide MMX before the use of systemic therapy"; in severely active UC, "consider systemic corticosteroids rather than topical corticosteroids"; and corticosteroids "may be avoided entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned". Extent of bowel involvement "should not limit the choice of advanced therapies", including isolated proctitis with access to therapies with demonstrated efficacy. Evidence for combination anti-TNF and immunomodulators "only exist for infliximab and thiopurines". For anti‑TNF nonresponse or loss of response, patients "should be assessed with trough serum concentrations of drug" to guide whether to optimize current therapy or select an alternate therapy, and primary nonresponders "should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control… rather than cycling". Biosimilars "are acceptable substitutes", with the directive that "Delays in switching should not occur" and patients and clinicians "should be notified about such changes". For maintenance, subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab "are considered equivalent to the standard intravenous maintenance dosing", but equivalence for induction or as substitution for escalated doses "has not been robustly established". For refractory or intolerant disease, "Obtain consultation with a surgeon and consider colectomy".

### Delphi consensus survey: the opinions of patients living with refractory ulcerative proctitis and the health care professionals who care for them [^044e71ac]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study of its kind to provide a list of consensual statements on the opinions and needs of those caring for and living with refractory ulcerative proctitis. A wide variety of both healthcare professionals and patients with an understanding of the condition participated in this three-stage Delphi survey. It became apparent from the focus group that refractory proctitis presents a large clinical disease burden to both patients and the professionals who care for them. Despite full compliance with both oral and rectal mesalazine therapies, a third of patients still suffer from refractory disease. The symptom burden these patients experience is felt to not be adequately reported resulting in limited knowledge on the matter.

When posed with the idea that current clinical and research tools are effective at measuring symptom burden in proctitis, it was felt that while rectal bleeding is well captured in scoring systems such as the MAYO score and the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index, additional symptoms such as urgency and rectal discomfort are often excluded. Additionally, patient participants highlighted that other parameters of living with proctitis that were important to them, such as toilet tracking, fear of going out and incontinence during sexual intercourse were often overlooked as burdensome, contributing significantly to a reduced quality of life. There was disparity in patient and healthcare professionals opinions and what was deemed to be of importance, this perhaps represents the difference of opinions in what is important to patients regarding 'living well' with IBD. At present, there are no existing clinical scores for the assessment of proctitis alone, and thus it is felt that current reported outcomes do not capture the symptom burden appropriately in patients living with proctitis alone. Consensually, constipation was found to be a common issue in symptomatic refractory proctitis as emphasised in previous studies, which detailed how proximal constipation should always be considered in refractory cases. The participants agreed that management of faecal stasis should be prioritised and treated independently of existing IBD.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^72945cb4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Key concept statements in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis (UC) management — Patients with mildly to moderately active UC who are not responsive (or are intolerant) to 5‑aminosalicylic acid (5‑ASA) therapies should be treated as patients with moderate‑to‑severe disease. Strategies for the management of the nonhospitalized patient with moderately or severely active UC are similar with the exception of a few considerations: 5‑ASA therapy could be used as monotherapy for induction of moderately but not severely active UC; in patients with moderately active UC, consider nonsystemic corticosteroids such as budesonide MMX before the use of systemic steroid therapy; in patients with severely active UC, consider systemic corticosteroids rather than topical corticosteroids; and corticosteroids may be avoided entirely when other effective induction strategies are planned. The extent of bowel involvement in moderately to severely active UC should not limit the choice of advanced therapies, including that patients with moderately to severely active isolated proctitis should have access to and be treated with therapies with demonstrated efficacy in patients with more extensive UC of similar activity. Data on combination anti‑tumor necrosis factor (anti‑TNF) and immunomodulators in moderately to severely active UC only exist for infliximab and thiopurines. The patient with nonresponse or loss of response to anti‑TNF therapy should be assessed with measurement of drug concentrations to optimize the existing therapy or to select an alternate therapy. Patients who are primary nonresponders to an anti‑TNF should be evaluated and considered for alternative mechanisms of disease control rather than cycling to another drug within the anti‑TNF class. Biosimilars to anti‑TNF therapies and to ustekinumab are acceptable substitutes for originator therapies; delays in switching should not occur and patients and clinicians should be notified about such changes. Subcutaneous infliximab and vedolizumab are considered equivalent to the standard intravenous maintenance dosing of these agents, but the equivalence of the subcutaneous formulations for induction or as substitution for escalated doses of these therapies has not been robustly established. Obtain consultation with a surgeon and consider colectomy in patients with moderately to severely active UC who are refractory or intolerant to medical therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^7edefc86]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) recommendations — rectal therapy choices, corticosteroid foam, escalation after 5-ASA, and non-5-ASA adjuncts: In patients with mild–moderate ulcerative proctitis who choose rectal therapy over oral therapy, the AGA recommends using mesalamine suppositories. In patients with mild–moderate ulcerative proctosigmoiditis or proctitis being treated with rectal therapy who are intolerant of or refractory to mesalamine suppositories, the AGA suggests using rectal corticosteroid foam rather than no therapy for induction of remission. In patients with mild–moderate UC refractory to optimized oral and rectal 5-ASA, regardless of disease extent, the AGA suggests adding either oral prednisone or budesonide MMX. In patients with mild–moderate UC, the AGA makes no recommendation for use of probiotics. In patients with mild–moderate UC despite 5-ASA therapy, the AGA makes no recommendation for use of curcumin. In patients with mild–moderate UC without Clostridium difficile infection, the AGA recommends fecal microbiota transplantation be performed only in the context of a clinical trial.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^043fdbd9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis in adults — future directions highlight unmet needs, stating that this guideline did not address the arenas of endoscopic surveillance or management of UC during pregnancy and that these topics will be addressed in future guidelines and a pregnancy consensus statement by the ACG. There is great interest in the application of IUS to the assessment of UC, and further research is needed to define the timing of this tool and the role for transmural assessment in prognosticating treatment response and outcomes. The authors note a great need for head-to-head RCTs to clarify sequencing and positioning of therapies and to understand the role and optimal timing for elective proctocolectomy, emphasizing that such direct evidence is needed to inform comparative effectiveness. Additional priorities include prediction biomarkers for personalized therapy selection, breaking through the existing therapeutic ceiling in UC via novel mechanisms of action and combinations of therapies to improve efficacy without sacrificing safety while addressing costs and access issues, and determining whether earlier advanced treatment in UC improves long-term outcomes. For future IBD guideline updates, the ACG has initiated a rapid update protocol, with updated guidance released annually to provide timely and practical guidance on the ever-changing field.

### IOIBD recommendations for clinical trials in ulcerative proctitis: the PROCTRIAL consensus [^a767f99f]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Clinical trials evaluating biologics and small molecules in patients with ulcerative colitis are predominantly excluding ulcerative proctitis. The objective of the Definition and endpoints for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs initiative was to develop consensus statements for definitions, inclusion criteria, and endpoints for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis in adults.

Methods

Thirty-five international experts held a consensus meeting to define ulcerative proctitis, and the endpoints to use in clinical trials. Based on a systematic review of the literature, statements were generated, discussed, and approved by the working group participants using a modified Delphi method. Consensus was defined as at least 75% agreement among voters.

Results

The group agreed that the diagnosis of ulcerative proctitis should be made by ileocolonoscopy and confirmed by histopathology, with the exclusion of infections, drug-induced causes, radiation, trauma, and Crohn's disease. Ulcerative proctitis was defined as macroscopic extent of lesions limited to 15 cm distance from the anal verge in adults. Primary and secondary endpoints were identified to capture response of ulcerative proctitis to therapy. A combined clinical and endoscopic primary endpoint for the evaluation of ulcerative proctitis disease activity was proposed. Secondary endpoints that should be evaluated include endoscopic remission, histologic remission, mucosal healing, histologic endoscopic mucosal improvement, disability, fecal incontinence, urgency, constipation, and health-related quality of life.

Conclusions

In response to the need for guidance on the design of clinical trials in patients with ulcerative proctitis, the Definition and end points for ulcerative PROCtitis in clinical TRIALs consensus provides recommendations on the definition and endpoints for ulcerative proctitis clinical trials.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

### Long-term course and prognostic factors in pediatric ulcerative proctitis: a multicenter cohort study [^79a2b6b1]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC), an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has become more prevalent among children worldwide in recent years. Ulcerative colitis is classified by the extent of lesions as ulcerative proctitis (UP, E1); left-sided UC (E2), distal to the splenic flexure; extensive UC (E3), distal to the hepatic flexure; and pancolitis (E4), proximal to the hepatic flexure. Although UP is considered mild colitis because inflammation is localized, it causes frequent diarrhea, bloody stools, tenesmus, and abdominal pain, impacting the quality of life for affected children. A greater proportion of children than adults with UC have a severe course, with 74% having pancolitis at diagnosis. Only 5%-9% of children with UC have only UP at diagnosis, representing a less common UC presentation than in adults.

First-line therapies for UP in adults include topical 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); topical steroids or 5-ASA plus oral steroids may be required. Refractory proctitis, defined as resistance to these treatments, requires intensification to thiopurine or biologics. Proximal disease extension of UP occurs in 30% of adults, frequently requiring immunosuppressive treatment. Recently, concern has arisen about the exclusion of UP from randomized clinical trials of biologic and small molecule agents in patients with moderate to severe UC. Clinical data concerning treatment options are particularly limited for refractory UP; recommendations for management of moderate to severe UP are largely extrapolated from data based on extensive UC. To address this problem, the International Organization for Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease has issued a consensus statement standardizing methods for patient evaluation in UP trials. A 2023 study reported the efficacy of tofacitinib in adults with UP, and studies are increasingly focusing on UP.

Although UP treatment is progressing in adults, data concerning natural history and treatment is sparse for children. European Crohn's and Colitis Organization guidelines suggest that topical 5-ASA may be effective in children with mild to moderate UP, but since children face greater risk of disease extension oral medications should be added; however, detailed recommendations are not given. Few reports have even described the natural history of pediatric UP. In this study, we investigated clinical course, therapy, and characteristics of refractory UP in children.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^8aed0061]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

Ulcerative colitis — Induction strategies for mildly to moderately active disease: In patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative proctitis, we recommend rectal 5-ASA therapies at a dose of 1 g/daily for induction of remission (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). For patients with mildly to moderately active proctitis not responsive to topical 5-ASA, we suggest tacrolimus suppository or beclomethasone suppository over no treatment (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). For patients with mild to moderately active proctitis or left sided colitis, we suggest use of topical corticosteroids (suppository, foam, enema), over no treatment (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with mild to moderately active proctitis or left sided colitis, we recommend rectal 5-ASA enemas at a dose of at least 1 g/daily preferred over rectal steroids for induction of remission (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active left-sided UC, we suggest rectal 5-ASA enemas at a dose of at least 1 g/daily combined with oral 5-ASA at a dose of at least 2.0 g/daily compared to oral 5-aminosalicylate therapy alone for induction of remission (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active left-sided UC, who are intolerant or nonresponsive to oral and rectal 5-ASA at appropriate doses (oral at least 2.0 g daily and rectal at least 1 g daily), we recommend oral budesonide MMX 9 mg/d for induction of remission (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active extensive colitis, oral 5-ASA at a dose of at least 2.0 g daily is recommended to induce remission (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with UC of any extent who fail to respond to 5-ASA therapy, we recommend oral systemic corticosteroids to induce remission (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active UC who fail to reach remission with appropriately dosed 5-ASA (at least 2–4.8 g daily oral mesalamine and/or at least 1 g daily rectal mesalamine), we suggest against changing to an alternate 5-ASA formulation to induce remission. Alternative therapeutic classes should be considered (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). In patients with mildly active UC of any extent, we suggest using a low dose (2.0–2.4 g/d) of 5-ASA, in comparison with a higher dose (4.8 g) because there is no difference in remission rate (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active UC of any extent not responding to oral 5-ASA, we recommend the addition of budesonide MMX 9 mg/d to induce remission (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). In patients with mildly to moderately active UC of any extent using 5-ASA to induce remission, we recommend either once daily or more frequently dosed oral 5-ASA based on patient preference to optimize adherence because efficacy and safety are no different (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^a2f094da]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis — diagnosis, assessment, monitoring, and prognosis — The diagnosis of UC should be suspected in patients with hematochezia, increased stool frequency, or bowel urgency, and infectious etiologies should be excluded at the time of diagnosis. Colonoscopy with intubation of the ileum and biopsies of affected and unaffected areas should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of UC, with mucosal biopsies interpreted by a pathologist, preferably one with expertise in gastrointestinal pathology. Categories of disease extent include proctitis within 18 cm of anal verge (distal to rectosigmoid junction), left-sided colitis extending from sigmoid to splenic flexure, and extensive colitis beyond splenic flexure including pancolitis; if the terminal ileum is normal, further evaluation of the stomach and small bowel by upper endoscopy and cross-sectional imaging is not needed unless other symptoms or findings suggest proximal gastrointestinal involvement or a diagnosis of Crohn's disease rather than UC. Definitions of disease severity are needed to guide treatment decisions and should be based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), the inflammatory burden including endoscopic assessment and markers such as FC, CRP, and serum albumin, disease course, and disease impact. Endoscopic severity should be reported using a validated endoscopic scale such as the Mayo Endoscopic Score or the UC Endoscopic Index of Severity, and disease assessment and monitoring in response to therapy and during maintenance and suspected relapse may be performed with FC, CRP, endoscopic assessment with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and/or intestinal ultrasound.

### Progressing or preserving, disease extent evolution in hospitalized patients with ulcerative colitis in China: a real-world study [^6a3631a7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, mucus, and bloody stools. It is a long-term condition that can relapse throughout a patient's life, with inflammation extending from the rectum to the various portions of the colon. The extent and severity of the disease fluctuate between episodes.

The management of UC relies on a thorough evaluation of several factors, including the extent of disease, activity scores, complications, and previous treatment responses. The Montreal classification system, the first established tool for assessing disease extent, categorizes UC into three subgroups: E1 (ulcerative proctitis, CP), where inflammation is limited to the rectum; E2 (left sided UC), where inflammation affects the colon up to the splenic flexure; and E3 (extensive UC), where inflammation extended beyond the splenic flexure. Another classification system simplifies the categorization into distal colitis, treatable with enemas, and extensive colitis. These classification systems are crucial in guiding treatment decisions, as different categories of UC require tailored therapeutic approaches. However, the disease extent is dynamic over time, with both progression and regression frequently observed.

Although the incidence of UC is rising in Asia, few studies have explored how the disease extent evolves over time in Asian populations. Phenotypic differences between Asian and Caucasian UC patients have been observed. A retrospective Chinese cohort study reported that 72.5% of patients had limited UC (E1 or E2), whereas 27.5% of patients were diagnosed with E3 at the time of diagnosis. The cumulative rate of disease extension was 9.9%, 14.9%, 19.6%, 24.6%, and 30.5% at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years after diagnosis. By contrast, a European study found that 61% of patients had limited UC and 21% experienced disease progression during follow-up.

Studies have also demonstrated that the extent of UC is associated with severity, prognosis, and the response to pharmacological treatment. For example, distal/left-sided colitis is associated with a higher likelihood of clinical remission, while extensive colitis shows a negative association with remission induction in patients treated with vedolizumab. Moreover, extensive UC is associated with worse outcomes, including a higher risk of colorectal cancer and the need for stronger medications or more aggressive treatments, such as colectomy.

3.10.2 Maintenance therapy for proctitis

Many patients respond promptly to 5-ASA suppositories, and if they have infrequent flares, are happy to start suppositories when they begin to flare and not take regular maintenance therapy. This is quite safe as the colorectal cancer risk in proctitis is similar to the general population. For many, however, regular preventive treatment is needed, and 5-ASA suppositories are the most effective maintenance therapy for proctitis. In long-term treatment, however, this needs to be weighed against the importance of adherence, and some patients may choose not to use long-term rectal therapy and prefer oral therapy. It is worth noting that alternate night or every third night suppositories do not appear to reduce the rate of maintenance of remission substantially.

3.10.3 Corticosteroid suppositories in proctitis

Statement 13. We suggest that patients with ulcerative proctitis who do not respond or are intolerant to 5-ASA suppositories and oral 5-ASA may be switched to corticosteroid suppositories (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 84.8%).

Steroid suppositories are also effective in proctitis but not as effective as 5-ASA and so their use should be confined to those who either do not tolerate or do not respond to 5-ASA. Oral 5-ASA should be continued if possible. For those not responding to 5-ASA, the addition of a prednisolone 5 mg suppository in the morning while continuing 5-ASA suppositories at bedtime is worth trying. A novel budesonide suppository was studied in a four-group, prospective, double-blind, double-dummy randomised trial to treat UC proctitis with budesonide 2 mg, budesonide 4 mg, 5-ASA 1 g, or budesonide 2 mg plus 5-ASA 1 g. The 8-week study conducted in Germany, Russia and the UK assessed a primary end-point of resolution of clinical symptoms for three consecutive days (score of 0 for rectal bleeding and stool frequency on modified UCDAI). Budesonide 4 mg was more effective than 2 mg, but no different from 5-ASA 1 g or the combination of budesonide 2 mg and 5-ASA 1 g.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the medical management of nonhospitalized ulcerative colitis: the toronto consensus [^3bfdd616]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The medical management of ulcerative colitis (UC) has improved through the development of new therapies and novel approaches that optimize existing drugs. Previous Canadian consensus guidelines addressed the management of severe UC in the hospitalized patient. We now present consensus guidelines for the treatment of ambulatory patients with mild to severe active UC.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified studies on the management of UC. The quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Statements were developed through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on by a working group of specialists.

Results

The participants concluded that the goal of therapy is complete remission, defined as both symptomatic and endoscopic remission without corticosteroid therapy. The consensus includes 34 statements focused on 5 main drug classes: 5-aminosalicylate (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapies, and other therapies. Oral and rectal 5-ASA are recommended first-line therapy for mild to moderate UC, with corticosteroid therapy for those who fail to achieve remission. Patients with moderate to severe UC should undergo a course of oral corticosteroid therapy, with transition to 5-ASA, thiopurine, anti-TNF (with or without thiopurine or methotrexate), or vedolizumab maintenance therapy in those who successfully achieve symptomatic remission. For patients with corticosteroid-resistant/dependent UC, anti-TNF or vedolizumab therapy is recommended. Timely assessments of response and remission are critical to ensuring optimal outcomes.

Conclusions

Optimal management of UC requires careful patient assessment, evidence-based use of existing therapies, and thorough assessment to define treatment success.

### Drug therapies for ulcerative proctitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^676e54b4]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with ulcerative colitis limited to the proctum are considered to have ulcerative proctitis (UP). In patients with more extensive ulcerative colitis, treatment occurs in a step-up fashion (5-ASA, corticosteroids, thiopurines, anti-TNF-α agents), a strategy which has proven effective. Although treatment of UP occurs using the same step-up design, the efficacy of these therapies in UP is scarcely studied. The objectives were to systematically review the literature for randomized controlled trials studying drug therapies for induction and maintenance of remission in patients with UP.

Methods

Electronic databases and reference lists of review articles were searched. The primary outcomes were clinical remission induction rate and the maintained clinical remission rate. Secondary outcomes were induction and maintenance of endoscopic and histological remission. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for were calculated.

Results

Twenty-three studies (1834 patients) were included. Eighteen trials investigated induction and 5 studied maintenance of remission. Topical 5-ASA was significantly superior to placebo for induction (RR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.63–3.51) and maintenance (RR, 2.80; 95% CI, 1.21–6.45) of clinical remission, regardless of dose or formulation. Subgroup analysis of 5-ASA suppositories also showed superiority over placebo for induction of clinical (RR, 3.07; 95% CI, 1.70–5.55) and endoscopic remission (RR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.85–3.77).

Conclusions

Topical 5-ASA is superior to placebo for the induction and maintenance of clinical remission and for the induction of endoscopic remission. The efficacy of corticosteroids, thiopurines, and anti-TNFα has been insufficiently studied in patients with UP.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^86d25073]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by growing incidence and prevalence around the world in the last few decades. The range of available existing treatment and strategies for its management is being implemented. Given the introduction of newly developed molecules and the lack of specific guidelines, drug positioning may represent a tough clinical challenge. UC management is mostly medical, and it has been shifting toward a more personalized approach with the aim to create a tailored strategy depending on the patient's profile. A treat-to target strategy seems to be the best approach to reach disease control as it allows to carry out therapeutic choices based on objective and specific parameters: histological, ultrasonographic, and molecular targets may add to the already used clinical, endoscopic, and biochemical targets. In addition, dual-targeted therapy has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy for patients not achieving remission. This review aims to provide an overview of the available strategies to raise the bar in UC.

3.1.2 UC versus Crohn's disease

In 5–15% of IBD patients, endoscopic and histological assessments cannot distinguish between Crohn's colitis and UC, and these patients are labelled as IBD-unclassified (IBD-U), or if features are still indeterminate after colectomy histology is assessed, described as indeterminate colitis. IBD-U is more common in children than adults. In a small proportion of UC patients their diagnosis is later changed to IBD-U or Crohn's disease.

3.2 Phenotypic classification

The Montreal classificationin adults and Paris classificationin children (table 1) are useful in ascribing phenotypes to patients both for treatment and to assist with service delivery and research. Children developing IBD generally have more extensive disease than adults. Establishing the extent of the inflammation in a patient with UC is important for prognosis as the likelihood of colectomy is dependent on disease extent. A systematic review showed that the 10 year colectomy rate is 19% for those with extensive colitis, 8% with left-sided colitis and 5% with proctitis; and male gender, young age and elevated inflammatory markers at diagnosis also increase the likelihood of colectomy. Backwash ileitis is also associated with more aggressive disease, and with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Those with extensive colitis also have the highest risk of developing colorectal cancer.

Table 1
Montreal and Paris classification in UC

Disease extent can change after diagnosis. Up to half with proctitis or proctosigmoiditis will develop more extensive disease. Of patients with proctitis initially, 10% will ultimately have extensive colitis. However, over time the extent of inflammation can also regress, and classification should always remain as the maximal extent. Endoscopic appearance may significantly underestimate the true extent (particularly in quiescent UC), and this should be confirmed by mapping biopsies.

It emphasizes that "Shared decision making is an important process in selecting the management strategy for management of ulcerative colitis" and describes potential strategies including "combination advanced therapy or episodic use of nonimmunogenic advanced therapies, such as small molecules", while stating that "Further primary data are required to accurately inform the positioning of such strategies". For maintenance as a living guideline, it specifies that "the AGA will update relevant recommendations from these guidelines by periodic review of evidence every 6 months", and that the review "will include availability of phase 3 or phase 4 efficacy data for new treatments, treatment strategies, or existing treatments, as well as significant new safety concerns informing treatment positioning".

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Stopping maintenance therapy is tempting in the management of a chronic disease such as UC, but data guiding this action are lacking. In a nationwide study of paediatric and adult UC patients, 18% (12% of paediatric UC) were on no maintenance therapy; a propensity score‐matched analysis showed similar outcomes for those not adherent to those on 5‐ASA with mild disease.RCTs exploring stopping 5‐ASA and the risk of relapse in UC have yet to be published. However, the long‐term risk of developing CRC and the chemoprotective effects of 5‐ASA shown in adultsshould be considered in any discussion on stopping 5‐ASA as the sole UC therapy.

In patients with a limited extent of disease (proctitis or left‐sided colitis) topical monotherapy (suppositories or enemas) is logical, although supportive data are lacking and paediatric ulcerative proctitis has high rates of treatment escalation with proximal disease extension. Suppository use should be restricted to active proctitis, whereas both foam and liquid enemas are useful for distal and left‐sided colitis. Proctitis comprises 3%–10% of incident paediatric UC patients, but extension has been reported in up to 47%. An increase in topical 5‐ASA therapy use over 2008–2015 in paediatric UC was reported in the Swiss IBD cohort.

### Long-term outcomes and predictors of vedolizumab persistence in ulcerative colitis [^f18c3b9a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Data on long-term outcomes with VDZ therapy are lacking. Current studies have focused on 52-week follow-ups with limited data on objective markers of inflammation. The seminal GEMINI trials in UC showed a clinical response at induction of 47.1% and clinical remission at 52 weeks of 44.8%. Thereafter, the GEMINI long-term safety trial, which was a single-arm, continuing phase III trial investigating the safety of VDZ in IBD, reported data for up to 8 years. In UC, 35% of patients had a clinical response, while 33% of patients were in clinical remission at week 400. However, this study was not specifically designed or powered to evaluate efficacy outcomes. In addition, RCTs do not always reflect the patient population seen in clinical practice as, for example, patients with proctitis alone are generally not included. This is of importance as most of the evidence from advanced therapies for proctitis come from real-world experiences. Many real-world studies investigating VDZ, including ours, typically involve a limited number of patients with proctitis receiving the drug. – This limitation hampers our comprehension of its effectiveness in this particular context. In our study, only 8% of the cohort had proctitis, and its presence was linked to a more sustained response. Nonetheless, it is imperative to approach these findings with caution, as these patients likely also received topical mesalazine and could have a less aggressive disease compared to more extensive forms, which could potentially influence outcomes. Unfortunately, we did not gather specific data on topical therapy, thus leaving a gap in our understanding of ulcerative proctitis optimal management.

The Standards Committee is composed of Society members who are chosen because they have demonstrated expertise in the specialty of colon and rectal surgery. This committee was created to lead international efforts in defining quality care for conditions related to the colon, rectum, and anus. This is accompanied by developing Clinical Practice Guidelines based on the best available evidence. These guidelines are inclusive, and not prescriptive. Their purpose is to provide information on which decisions can be made, rather than dictate a specific form of treatment. These guidelines are intended for the use of all practitioners, health care workers, and patients who desire information about the management of the conditions addressed by the topics covered in these guidelines. It should be recognized that these guidelines should not be deemed inclusive of all proper methods of care or exclusive of methods of care reasonably directed to obtaining the same results. The ultimate judgment regarding the propriety of any specific procedure must be made by the physician in light of all of the circumstances presented by the individual patient.

### Ulcerative colitis: diagnosis and treatment [^0b5277d7]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease with recurrent symptoms and significant morbidity. The precise etiology is still unknown. As many as 25 percent of patients with ulcerative colitis have extraintestinal manifestations. The diagnosis is made endoscopically. Tests such as perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies are promising, but not yet recommended for routine use. Treatment is based on the extent and severity of the disease. Rectal therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds is used for proctitis. More extensive disease requires treatment with oral 5-aminosalicylic acid compounds and oral corticosteroids. The side effects of steroids limit their usefulness for chronic therapy. Patients who do not respond to treatment with oral corticosteroids require hospitalization and intravenous steroids. Refractory symptoms may be treated with azathioprine or infliximab. Surgical treatment of ulcerative colitis is reserved for patients who fail medical therapy or who develop severe hemorrhage, perforation, or cancer. Longstanding ulcerative colitis is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Patients should receive an initial screening colonoscopy eight years after the onset of pancolitis and 12 to 15 years after the onset of left-sided disease; follow-up colonoscopy should be repeated every two to three years.

### The pouch behaving badly: management of morbidity after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis [^a4d17239]. Colorectal Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Aim

Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA), or a 'pouch', allows restoration of intestinal continuity after proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. Most patients have a good long-term outcome after IPAA, but in a significant proportion the functional outcome and quality of life are unsatisfactory. We term this outcome 'the pouch behaving badly'. Managing this, especially one is when unfamiliar with the possible underlying pathologies, is a challenge for both patient and clinician. We aim to outline the clinical approach to the pouch behaving badly, highlighting key aspects of investigation and management.

Method

This is a narrative review of the literature covering the investigation and management of postoperative complications and morbidity after IPAA.

Results

Management of the pouch behaving badly requires a careful clinical assessment. The patient may present with multiple symptoms and a clear picture of the symptomatology and past history should be constructed before thorough examination and specialist investigation. We divide the pathology that underlies this clinical scenario into surgical, inflammatory, mechanical, functional and dysplastic causes and outline the investigation and management of each one.

Conclusion

The pouch behaving badly is a challenging problem for both patient and clinician. A detailed clinical assessment with careful specialist investigation is key to diagnosing the underlying pathology. We stress the importance of patient-centred care - the aim is to improve quality of life.

3.10.1 5-ASA suppositories in proctitis

Statement 12. We recommend that mild or moderately active ulcerative proctitis should be treated with a 1 g 5-ASA suppository (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

When treating mild to moderate proctitis, first-line therapy should be 5-ASA suppositories. These medications achieve much higher mucosal concentrations of the drug and work faster and better than oral 5-ASA monotherapy in disease which is confined to the rectum. Higher response rates are achieved if topical therapies are combined with oral 5-ASA, thus patients not responding fully to suppositories should have early addition of oral therapy. Suppositories are preferred to enemas for proctitis as they deliver the drug specifically to the rectum (enemas tend to pool higher up in the sigmoid) and are also better tolerated/retained, as shown in a study comparing 5-ASA suppositories with hydrocortisone foam enemas. Topical 5-ASA is more effective than topical corticosteroid. A Cochrane review did not show a dose–response relationship for rectal therapy (although this review assessed treatment of distal colitis, which included both proctitis and left-sided colitis up to the splenic flexure). A further review evaluating mucosal healing showed a dose–response relationship for oral but not rectal 5-ASA (again evaluating proctitis along with distal colitis). Divided doses are less convenient for patients. A study comparing 1 g 5-ASA suppository daily versus 500 mg three times daily showed more convenience and similar efficacy (except for mucosal healing) for the once daily dose, and a further study showed no difference between 1 g daily and 500 mg twice daily. Administering this dose at bedtime is practical for most patients, allowing the suppository to be retained for the longest possible time.

### Rectal tacrolimus in the treatment of resistant ulcerative proctitis… [^678a5910]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Tacrolimus and cyclosporin are classical calcineurin inhibitors and are widely used as immunosuppressive medications with promising results in UC. Calcineurin, or protein phosphatase 2B, is a ubiquitously expressed cytosolic Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, that is highly conserved in eukaryotes. The efficacy of oral tacrolimus has been examined in the management of medication resistant CD and UC. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies have been open labelled with only one randomised controlled trial reported in UC. This demonstrated a short-term clinical improvement but without a significant increase in the remission rate, potentially due to low patient numbers. Use of topical tacrolimus has been effective in the treatment of perioral and perineal inflammation in paediatric CD patients with resolution of symptoms in 75%.

Work examining topical perianal tacrolimus therapy in adult CD patients also demonstrated clinical efficacy, and although tacrolimus is absorbed well transdermally, only low trough levels of tacrolimus were detected in the blood. The recent pilot study by our group demonstrated that 75% of patients with resistant distal colitis responded and achieved a remission of their disease following 4 and 8 weeks of tacrolimus rectal ointment8. A dose of
0. 3 to 0. 5mg/ml 3ml twice a day was identified in the majority of patients to induce remission. In these patients tacrolimus trough levels were taken regularly and were either undetectable sub-therapeutic or, at their highest, in the low therapeutic range. The ointment was well tolerated without any systemic adverse effects. Use of the same rectal tacrolimus preparation in further 8 patients was also associated with a clinical response in 6 patients after 4 weeks of therapy.

The efficacy of topical tacrolimus in UC is further supported by a separate pilot study that examined topical tacrolimus in patients with resistant distal colitis. In this study a clinical and histological improvement in 10 of 12 patients by 4 weeks without any major side effects reported and the preparation was well tolerated.

### Raising the bar in ulcerative colitis management [^2fb1812f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, the imperative for early initiation of therapy emerges as a pivotal strategy in optimizing UC management, facilitated by prompt diagnosis. Regrettably, many patients with UC face diagnostic delays postsymptom onset, posing a risk for adverse outcomes and significant bowel damage in IBD. Clinical evidence consistently underscores the superior response rates to drugs in patients with shorter disease duration. Thus, raising awareness of UC symptoms in primary care settings is crucial to ensure timely access to specialized care and appropriate treatment. Early disease identification enables patients to commence suitable medications promptly, with studies consistently linking timely access to immunosuppressants or biologics to improved outcomes.

Moreover, the expanding array of new therapeutic agents presents a challenge in selecting the most suitable drug for UC management. With numerous therapeutic options available for mild-to-moderate as well as moderate-to-severe forms of UC, choosing the right agent for each patient has become increasingly complex and personalized. The T2T strategy offers guidance in identifying the optimal treatment solution for individual patients in a tailored manner. Additionally, proper patient profiling is essential, involving the assessment of patient risk stratification and prognostication. Validated prognostic and predictive tools, such as biomarkers, have the potential to enable personalized therapy and facilitate the targeted use of treatments. This approach ensures that patients at lower risk receive less intensive medical therapy, while those at higher risk of disease progression are treated with more intensive strategies. However, a significant challenge lies in the time required to develop, validate, and commercialize biomarkers, highlighting the need for ongoing research and innovation in this area.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the management of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis [^af8d26d2]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) mild–moderate ulcerative colitis (UC) recommendations — 5-ASA selection, dosing, and rectal adjuncts are as follows: In patients with extensive mild–moderate UC, the AGA recommends using either standard-dose mesalamine (2–3 g/d) or diazo-bonded 5-ASA rather than low-dose mesalamine, sulfasalazine, or no treatment, and patients already on sulfasalazine in remission or patients with prominent arthritic symptoms may reasonably choose sulfasalazine 2–4 g/d if alternatives are cost-prohibitive, albeit with higher rate of intolerance. In patients with extensive or left-sided mild–moderate UC, the AGA suggests adding rectal mesalamine to oral 5-ASA. In patients with mild–moderate UC with suboptimal response to standard-dose mesalamine or diazo-bonded 5-ASA or with moderate disease activity, the AGA suggests using high-dose mesalamine (> 3 g/d) with rectal mesalamine. In patients with mild–moderate UC being treated with oral mesalamine, the AGA suggests using once-daily dosing rather than multiple times per day dosing. In patients with mild–moderate UC, the AGA suggests using standard-dose oral mesalamine or diazo-bonded 5-ASA, rather than budesonide MMX or controlled ileal release budesonide for induction of remission. In patients with left-sided mild–moderate ulcerative proctosigmoiditis or proctitis, the AGA suggests using mesalamine enemas (or suppositories) rather than oral mesalamine, though patients who place a high value on convenience of oral medication administration and a lower value on effectiveness could reasonably choose oral mesalamine. In patients with mild–moderate ulcerative proctosigmoiditis who choose rectal therapy over oral therapy, the AGA suggests using mesalamine enemas rather than rectal corticosteroids.

### Ulcerative colitis [^be2e07da]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease of unknown aetiology affecting the colon and rectum. Multiple factors, such as genetic background, environmental and luminal factors, and mucosal immune dysregulation, have been suggested to contribute to UC pathogenesis. UC has evolved into a global burden given its high incidence in developed countries and the substantial increase in incidence in developing countries. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying UC has led to the emergence of new treatments. Since the early 2000s, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) treatment has significantly improved treatment outcomes. Advances in medical treatments have enabled a paradigm shift in treatment goals from symptomatic relief to endoscopic and histological healing to achieve better long-term outcomes and, consequently, diagnostic modalities have also been improved to monitor disease activity more tightly. Despite these improvements in patient care, a substantial proportion of patients, for example, those who are refractory to medical treatment or those who develop colitis-associated colorectal dysplasia or cancer, still require restorative proctocolectomy. The development of novel drugs and improvement of the treatment strategy by implementing personalized medicine are warranted to achieve optimal disease control. However, delineating the aetiology of UC is necessary to ultimately achieve disease cure.

Implementation considerations and safety — a subset of patients who have significant but not complete response with advanced therapies or immunomodulators may benefit from ongoing 5-ASAs, particularly those with residual proctitis who may benefit from adding rectal 5-ASA; however, the independent benefit of long-term 5-ASAs in preventing colorectal cancer in patients with IBD has not been robustly demonstrated. 5-ASAs are generally safe medications, with very low rates of idiosyncratic serious or life-threatening complications, though there are rare reports of allergic interstitial nephritis, pancreatitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, and pneumonitis. Continuing 5-ASA may add pill burden and contribute to high cost of care.
