## Question

Noah's age is twice Joe's age. If Joe is 6 years old, how old will Noah be after 10 years?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how old Noah will be after 10 years, given that Noah's current age is twice Joe's age and Joe is currently 6 years old. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Noah's current age. Then, I should verify the calculation for Noah's age in 10 years. Finally, I will state the answer clearly and make sure the logic holds up under scrutiny.

> Let me first confirm the current ages. If Joe is 6 years old and Noah is twice Joe's age, then Noah's current age is 2 times 6, which equals 12 years old. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 2 × 6 = 12, so yes, Noah is 12 now.

> Next, I should review the projection forward. After 10 years, Noah's age will be his current age plus 10, so 12 + 10 = 22 years old. Hold on, I should double-check the addition: 12 + 10 is indeed 22, so Noah will be 22 years old in 10 years [^notfound].

> I will now examine whether any of the provided references alter this straightforward arithmetic. The documents discuss age-related clinical thresholds and developmental stages, but none of them contradict basic chronological age addition, so the calculation remains valid without needing adjustment from medical or policy contexts.

> Final answer: Noah will be 22 years old after 10 years [^notfound].

Noah is currently **12 years old** (twice Joe's age of 6). After 10 years, Noah will be **22 years old**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

- **Current age of Joe**: 6 years old.
- **Current age of Noah**: 2 × 6 = 12 years old.
- **Age after 10 years**: 12 + 10 = 22 years old.

---

Therefore, Noah will be **22 years old** after 10 years.

In a recent JME article, Joona Räsänen makes the case for allowing legal age change. We identify three problems with his argument and, on that basis, propose an improved version thereof. Unfortunately, even the improved argument is vulnerable to the objection that chronological age is a better proxy for justice in health than both legal and what we shall call official age.

### Aging of the nitric oxide system: are we as old as our NO? [^f667b5f8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Figure 1.
Interactions between NOS, activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and physiological actions of NO. Sites evaluated in this study: (1) ADMA concentrations; (2) NO‐mediated effect on arterial stiffness; and (3) inhibition of platelet aggregation by NO. ADMA indicates asymmetric dimethylarginine; NOS, nitric oxide synthase.

Although ADMA levels are thought to increase in older individuals, this has not been extensively studied. In a cross‐sectional all‐female study, we have found that ADMA levels, platelet NO responsiveness, and augmentation index correlate with age. However, longitudinal effect of aging per se upon vascular and platelet NO responsiveness has not been reported on. Given the critical role of the NO system in cardiac and vascular function, we have now sought to establish the impact of aging on the platelet and vascular NO system in an aging, but otherwise unselected, population.

### Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age [^15c585b3]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

Increases in median ages, the most commonly used measure of population ageing, are rapid in today's wealthier countries, and population ageing is widely considered to be a significant challenge to the well-being of citizens there. Conventional measures of age count years since birth; however, as lives lengthen, we need to think of age also in terms of years left until death or in proportion to the expanding lifespan. Here we propose a new measure of ageing: the median age of the population standardized for expected remaining years of life. We show, using historical data and forecasts for Germany, Japan and the United States, that although these populations will be growing older, as measured by their median ages, they will probably experience periods in which they grow younger, as measured by their standardized median ages. Furthermore, we provide forecasts for these countries of the old-age dependency ratio rescaled for increases in life expectancy at birth. These ratios are forecasted to change much less than their unscaled counterparts, and also exhibit periods when the population is effectively growing younger.

### Aging of the nitric oxide system: are we as old as our NO? [^24b1bced]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Impaired generation and signaling of nitric oxide (NO) contribute substantially to cardiovascular (CV) risk (CVR) associated with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. In our rapidly aging society, advanced age is, in itself, a consistent and independent CVR factor. Many processes involved in aging are modulated by NO. We therefore postulated that aging might be independently associated with impaired NO signaling.

Methods and Results

In a prospective cohort study of 204 subjects (mean age 63 ± 6 at study entry), we evaluated the effects of 4 years of aging on parameters of NO generation and effect, including platelet aggregability and responsiveness to NO, and plasma concentrations of the NO synthase inhibitor, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Clinical history, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, routine biochemistry, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were obtained at study entry and after 4 years of follow-up. Aging was associated with marked deterioration of responsiveness of platelets to NO (P < 0.0001) and increases in plasma ADMA concentrations (P < 0.0001). There was a significant correlation between changes in these parameters over time (r = 0.2; P = 0.013). On multivariable analyses, the independent correlates of deterioration of responsiveness of platelets to NO were female gender (β = 0.17; P = 0.034) and low vitamin D concentrations (β = 0.16; P = 0.04), whereas increases in ADMA were associated with presence of diabetes (β = 0.16; P = 0.03) and impaired renal function (β = 0.2; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Aging is associated with marked impairment of determinants of NO generation and effect, to an extent which is commensurate with adverse impact on CV outcomes. This deterioration represents a potential target for therapeutic interventions.

### Stressor-evoked brain activity, cardiovascular reactivity, and subclinical atherosclerosis in midlife adults [^bf0f6417]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, several limitations of our study should be noted. First, our cohorts (PIP and NOAH) included predominantly white individuals who were relatively well educated and free of major chronic illnesses and medication regimens that could have confounded interpretations of preclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular reactivity markers. As a result, whether our findings are relevant to demographically diverse individuals and clinical populations is still unclear. Yet, we have made the multivariate predictive patterns reported here publicly available, so they could be eventually tested in other populations and used as predictors in tasks involving different clinical and preclinical outcomes. Second, our results were obtained from task‐based activation metrics and therefore did not involve some of the methodological and psychometric advantages that morphological, task‐free (or resting state)‐based measures could hold in the prediction of preclinical atherosclerosis, reactivity, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Third, to quantify mediation effects in an out‐of‐sample framework, we resorted to a explained variance‐based measure for mediation analysis, which has its own limitations. Efforts to find the optimal measure of effect size for mediation analysis continues to be an active area of research. Fourth, the present study did not statistically test possible moderators of the mediated associations reported here (eg, moderating influences of sex at birth, gender, chronic psychosocial stress, socioeconomic position, health status, etc.). For example, from a diathesis‐stress perspective, it may be possible that higher levels of prevailing cardiovascular risk, as reflected in composite risk indicators, could plausibly increase vulnerability to stress‐related neural and physiological influences on preclinical vascular disease (see Spencer et al). Future studies may explore moderated mediation if appropriate conditions (eg, enough statistical power) are met, and publicly available data from this report might facilitate initial exploratory testing. Last, causal inferences from the present observations are precluded because they are cross‐sectional. Preclinical vascular disease, as reflected in CA‐IMT, may have central influences that manifest as alterations in cerebral blood flow or neural‐hemodynamic coupling. In these regards, BP and related indicators of preclinical vascular disease are established risk factors for adverse central nervous system outcomes, including neurocognitive decline and neuropathology. Future longitudinal and interventional studies may thus help to adjudicate the temporal or causal relationships of stressor‐evoked fMRI and BP reactivity to CA‐IMT. In addition, the interpretation of the different causal effects may be influenced by deviations in the sequential ignorability assumptions. Statistically, we found these deviations to be small and attempted to control for confounding effects by accounting for prevailing levels of CVD risk as a plausible covariate. However, future research should investigate the effects of other potential unmeasured confounders not included in our study.

Results

Sample Description

Descriptive properties of the N = 3,028 sampled individuals who were located and consented to participate in the study are reported in Table 1. About 63% of participants described themselves as head of household. Regarding participants' education, 84% answered that they had no formal schooling. About 8% reported less education than the primary school level while 5% reported completed education comparable to the level of primary school, about 1% completed education of the secondary school level. About 0.5% finished high school and 0.4% went to college or university. Zero-order correlations between the study's main variables are presented in Supplementary Table 2.

Table 1.
Descriptive Data of the Study Sample (N = 3,028)

The average participant in the Nouna sample felt about one and a half years (95% CI: −1.75 to −1.25), or based on a proportional difference score of about 3% (95% CI: −0.033 to −0.024), younger. Around 30% of the sample felt older than they were, 21% felt the same age (in years) as their chronological age and 48% felt younger than they were.

### Age-related references in national public health, technology appraisal and clinical guidelines and guidance: documentary analysis [^a22dbfdf]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Theme 3: documentation of age-specific recommendations

Two-thirds of public health guidelines (n = 22, 67%), no clinical guidelines and two-fifths of technology appraisals (n = 82, 39%) documented that they took age into account when making recommendations. Many of these recommendations focused on ensuring people were not excluded from interventions on the basis of age alone.

Throughout, there were many documented discussions of whether age should be taken into account in recommendations and, in documents published since 2012, whether recommendations should be revised in light of the Equalities Act (2010). No such revisions were recommended and documents often concluded that intervention decisions should be made on an individual basis.

Evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new technologies are often supplied by manufacturers to NICE technology appraisal panels. Panels appear to spend substantial time testing and discussing this evidence. Age is regularly examined during this process (n = 82, 39%), but mostly in terms of how it is used in cost-effectiveness models.

Only public health guidelines made age-specific practice recommendations, but only in one-fifth of cases (n = 7, 21%). Less than half of these recommendations were specific to older-age (n = 3, 9%). In contrast, only clinical guidelines prioritised practice recommendations according to age, but these were only present in one-quarter (n = 31, 27%). Around half were older-age specific (n = 17, 15%).

Age-specific research recommendations were present across guideline types — but were least often found in technology appraisals. Two-thirds (n = 22, 67%) of public health guidelines included recommendations for further age-specific effectiveness evidence and more than one-third (n = 13, 39%) for further age-specific cost-effectiveness evidence. Comparable figures for clinical guidelines were 31 (27%) and 6 (5%); and for technology appraisals were 4 (2%) and 0. In most cases, less than half of these were older-age specific.

### A call for standardised age-disaggregated health data [^3eeb02bd]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

What is the current commonly recommended age disaggregation for health data?

In 2001, WHO recommended that groupings for the age standardisation of incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates took into account the rapid and continued declines in age-specific mortality rates among older people, and the increasing availability of epidemiological data for this group. To do so, WHO adopted an average age-structure of the world population for the period of 2000–25 based on the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division assessment in 1998. The recommendation at that time was to use 5 year groups from birth up to the oldest reached age (100 years or older). Although this recommendation has remained the suggested standard since then, it has not been universally applied.

Further complicating the recommendations, the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Statistical Division's standards for age disaggregation vary by health indicator and by country. There are ongoing debates as to what standard should be generally recommended for health data. For example, given the extensive and rapid changes in development, prevalence of health conditions, and risk behaviours in children, a further refinement of the 5 year age groupings for children should be considered.

### Male biological clock: a critical analysis of advanced paternal age [^12f788a3]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Extensive research defines the impact of advanced maternal age on couples' fecundity and reproductive outcomes, but significantly less research has been focused on understanding the impact of advanced paternal age. Yet it is increasingly common for couples at advanced ages to conceive children. Limited research suggests that the importance of paternal age is significantly less than that of maternal age, but advanced age of the father is implicated in a variety of conditions affecting the offspring. This review examines three aspects of advanced paternal age: the potential problems with conception and pregnancy that couples with advanced paternal age may encounter, the concept of discussing a limit to paternal age in a clinical setting, and the risks of diseases associated with advanced paternal age. As paternal age increases, it presents no absolute barrier to conception, but it does present greater risks and complications. The current body of knowledge does not justify dissuading older men from trying to initiate a pregnancy, but the medical community must do a better job of communicating to couples the current understanding of the risks of conception with advanced paternal age.

### Age limit of pediatrics [^3e13c6e8]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Age phase definitions and prior age-limit framework — federal references and American Academy of Pediatrics guidance — note that the US Department of Health and the Food and Drug Administration reference approximate age ranges consisting of: infancy, between birth and 2 years of age; childhood, from 2 to 12 years of age; and adolescence, from 12 to 21 years of age. Bright Futures guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics identify adolescence as 11 to 21 years of age, dividing the group into early (ages 11–14 years), middle (ages 15–17 years), and late (ages 18–21 years) adolescence. The American Academy of Pediatrics has previously published a statement on the age limit of pediatrics in 1988, which was reaffirmed in 2012 and identified the upper age limit as 21 years with a note that exceptions could be made when the pediatrician and family agree to an older age, particularly in the case of a child with special health care needs.

### Age-related references in national public health, technology appraisal and clinical guidelines and guidance: documentary analysis [^d833c252]. Age and Ageing (2017). Low credibility.

Theme 1: age documented as an a-priori consideration in guidance scope

Almost half of clinical guidelines (n = 49, 43%) and a quarter of public health guidelines (n = 8, 24%) and technology appraisals (n = 81, 23%) were aimed at age-specific groups. Very few of any type of document were aimed at older-age groups specifically (n = 15, 4%).

Only public health guidelines documented considering age at scope-setting, although this was done in less than half of cases (n = 14, 42%). On 11 occasions, the same question was listed: 'Does the effectiveness of the intervention vary with different characteristics within the target population, such as age?'. This question was not documented in any technology appraisals or clinical guidelines.

Public health guidelines (n = 25, 76%) were more likely than clinical guidelines (n = 22, 19%) or technology appraisals (n = 44, 21%) to report statistics describing the problem addressed by age. Similarly, public health guidelines were more likely to describe why age might be an important factor to consider than other documents. However, this was only done in one-third (n = 11, 33%) of public health guidelines. Around one-third of all documents identified age as a risk factor for the problem addressed (n = 105, 29%), particularly older-age (n = 87, 24%).

### Should older adults be screened for dementia? [^d2bc493a]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2006). Low credibility.

The question of whether to screen for dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been discussed in many forums throughout the world. Generally, medical advisory groups and policy-making groups have recognized the importance of early diagnosis but have uniformly avoided making recommendations to screen at-risk populations. This presentation reflects the support for reconsidering the importance of screening individuals at risk or above a certain age. In this statement, the majority of the authors support the consideration of dementia risk factors in individuals at age 50, with routine yearly screening after 75. Other authors remain concerned that the benefits of treatments of early disease do not yet support a general screening recommendation. These statements are made to encourage progress toward the development of a consensus regarding the widespread institution of screening policy. Accordingly, members of the worldwide scientific community are invited to add their perspective by contributing short commentaries (1500 words) on this subject.

Outcome variables

AUDIT

The AUDIT is a10‐item scale with a score range of 0 to 40. The items are not administered as a distinct scale in the NDSHS, but all items are covered sufficiently for use. All items have a reference period of 1 year except for items 9 and 10, where respondents are asked to differentiate between experiences that occurred in the past year or in their life‐time. Items 1 (frequency) and 2 (usual quantity per occasion) are administered as described above. Item 3, on risky single occasion drinking, also had to be derived from other questions in the NDSHS; this is described in full in Supporting information, Table S2. The other seven items from the AUDIT are asked as they are in the original scale. The authors of the scale recommended a cut‐point of eight when wanting to focus upon those who would potentially be identified as being in need of intervention — this cut‐point is used here for the sensitivity analysis focusing upon heavier drinkers in Figure 4. The method used to calculate AUDIT scores from the items in the NDSHS survey, outlined in Supporting information, Table S2, is based on that used by O'Brien and colleagues. Cronbach's alpha of the full scale is α = 0.80, indicating good reliability.

Dependence subscale

The summed total of items 4–6 of the AUDIT, with a possible score range of 0–12, make up the dependence subscale. Cronbach's alpha of the full scale is α = 0.67, indicating questionable, but not unacceptable, reliability.

Harms subscale

The summed total of items 7–10 of the AUDIT, with a possible score range of 0–12, make up the harmful drinking subscale. Cronbach's alpha of the full scale is α = 0.60, indicating questionable, but not unacceptable, reliability.

Age

Age was treated as a categorical variable, with respondents grouped into 5‐year age groups starting at age 18 (18–22, 23–27, etc. until 73+). These groups were chosen so that any gradual shifts in our results over age can be observed while still ensuring a large sample size in each age group. The size of each age group varied from 871 to 1774 respondents in the analysis in Figure 1, while in the subsample analysis in Figure 4 the size of each age group was between 147 and 471.

### Dietary intake in 6-year-old children from Southern Poland: part 1 – energy and macronutrient intakes [^c460d109]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

One of the crucial periods in a child's life is the age of six years. In Poland and some European countries, such as Estonia, Finland and Sweden, this is the last year of preschool attendance and thus the time when the child should attain the so called 'school readiness' in physical, mental and emotional terms. In other European countries, such as Belgium, France, Germany, Portugal or Spain, the age of six years is the time of attending the first class at school where the child needs to cope with the new challenges in the new environment. Both to attain the school readiness and to perform well at school, adequate dietary intakes should be provided for all children.

In the literature published after the year 2000, no publications were found on dietary intakes of 6-year-old children only. Usually, 6-year-olds are included in populations of wide age ranges and the results are reported for subgroups within these populations. In Poland, only two studies reported dietary intake of children aged 6 years or less. This is a study on 3-year-old children and a national study on a representative sample which included 4-6-year-old children. There is more information about dietary intake of children from other European countries. The population study of children and adolescents in Great Britain, called the National Diet and Nutrition Survey of young people aged 4–18 years, reported dietary intake for the subgroup aged 4–6 years. In another British population study, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey Rolling Programme 2008/2009–2010/2011, 6-year-old children were also included, however, in a subgroup of 4-10-year-olds. In a Belgian study on children aged 2.5–6.5 years, dietary intake was presented for a subgroup of children aged 4–6.5 years. Quite narrow age ranges were applied in a Greek study on Cretan children aged 5.7–7.6 years and in a Spanish study on 6-7-year-old children. Another Spanish study, on 2-24-year-olds, reported dietary intake in a subgroup of 6-9-year-old children. In a French study, dietary intake of 5-11-year-olds was presented. Information about energy and nutrient intakes in children outside Europe include American children from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the U.S. population where the widest age ranges of subgroups were applied: less than 6years and 6–11 years. In all of these studies, except for the Spanish study on 6-7-year-olds, dietary intake was presented according to gender.

### Feeling younger in rural burkina faso: exploring the role of subjective age in the light of previous research from high-income countries [^3be315de]. The Journals of Gerontology: Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypothesis 2: Proportion of People Feeling Younger Is Smaller in the Nouna Sample Compared to Established Western Studies

Following our reasoning in Hypothesis 1, we expected that the proportion of participants in the Nouna study who report feeling younger than they are would be smaller than in comparable representative samples of Western countries. For this purpose, we included established large studies from Western countries (Denmark, UK, and USA) with comparable inclusion criteria: recruitment of participants with a minimum age of 40–50 years, with the explicit effort for a representative sample. We also included the other comparable study from an African region that has been published, which recruited participants aged 50 years and older. A comparison of the proportions is displayed in Figure 2. Indeed, the proportion of individuals who felt younger was 37 percentage points higher in Western than in African samples. There was substantial heterogeneity among the African as well as Western studies.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^ab551a6a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — timing of delivery in advanced maternal age: The rate of stillbirth at 39 weeks of gestation in women aged 40 years and older is nearly the same as that of women aged 25 to 29 years at > 41 weeks of gestation; therefore, delivery in well-dated pregnancies at ≥ 39 weeks of gestation for individuals aged 40 years and older should be considered. In the absence of additional maternal or fetal comorbidities, the evidence for elevated stillbirth risk in individuals aged 35 to 39 years is not sufficient to support a clear recommendation regarding timing of delivery beyond routine practice.

### International consensus on initial screening and follow-up of asymptomatic SDHx mutation carriers [^60000ac8]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Timing of initial screening in childhood

Even if the risk of developing a tumour during childhood (< 18 years old) is low, a small number of SDHB -related paragangliomas have been reported at age 6 years,– and children with an SDHB mutation have a higher risk of developing a metastatic paraganglioma than children with mutations in the other SDHx genes. As surgery remains the only curative treatment, the experts surmised that earlier tumour detection and removal is likely to be associated with improved long-term prognosis. For SDHD - pi and SDHC mutation carriers, some cases have been described during childhood but, in most cases, children were older than 10 years. For SDHA mutation carriers, paragangliomas have been diagnosed in 17-year-old adolescents according to the literature. The experts reported some cases in 13 year olds. Based on this evidence, the experts proposed first screening at an earlier age (6 years old) for asymptomatic SDHB mutation carriers than for carriers of mutations in the other SDHx genes (10 years old).

Recommendation 2: During childhood, genetic screening should only be performed if tumour screening would be considered if a mutation was discovered (Grade B).
Recommendation 3: During childhood, tumour screening should only be performed following the discovery of a mutation (Grade A).
Recommendation 4: First tumour screening should be performed between 6 and 10 years of age for asymptomatic SDHB mutation carriers and between 10 and 15 years of age in asymptomatic SDHA, SDHC and SDHD-pi mutation carriers (Grade A).

### Investigation and management of young-onset hypertension: British and Irish hypertension society position statement [^6d10ef51]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, national and international studies suggest there are large numbers of young people with raised BP that, left untreated, are likely to suffer from avoidable premature morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines for initiating antihypertensive treatment are based on 10-year cardiovascular risk. As risk scores are strongly determined by age, and evidence from antihypertensive treatment trials are based on older individuals, younger people may not be accessing appropriate therapies to meet their needs, and current guidelines are therefore inherently ageist.

This BIHS statement provides a practical approach to the investigation and management of young-onset hypertension to enable consistent and high-quality care to be delivered across the UK and Ireland and poses important future research questions to improve patient outcomes.

### Management of stillbirth: obstetric care consensus No, 10 [^98fc1ad0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Stillbirth risk factors — maternal age extremes: Maternal age at either end of the reproductive spectrum (less than 15 years and greater than 35 years) is an independent risk factor for stillbirth. Advanced maternal age is associated with increased risk, with one study estimating a stillbirth risk of 1 in 116 in a 40-year-old nulliparous woman after 37 weeks versus 1 in 304 in a multiparous woman of the same age. Among adolescents, the rate is 15.88 per 1,000 live births for those younger than 15 years compared with 5.34 per 1,000 in women aged 25–29 years; rates were 7.03 per 1,000 for ages 15–17 and 6.52 per 1,000 for ages 18–19, which were 32% and 22% higher than the lowest risk age group.

### Cognitive performance from childhood to old age and intergenerational correlations in the multigenerational young finns study [^e296a7fa]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Information processing was evaluated using rapid visual information (RVP) test, which is used to assess visual processing, recognition, and sustained attention. In this test, the participant was presented with three number sequences (3–5–7, 2–4–6, and 4–6–8) next to a large box where the number 1–9 appeared in a random order at a rate of 100 numbers per minute. Whenever any of the particular sequences were presented, the participant was supposed to press a touchscreen button. Altogether, nine target sequences were presented at 100-s intervals during the 6-min assessment phase. During the practice phase, the participant was given visual cues (i.e. colored or underlined numbers) to help him or her recognize the particular sequence. At the assessment phase, the cues were no longer presented.

Reaction time was evaluated using reaction time (RTI) test, which assesses the speed of response and movement as well as accuracy on a task where the stimulus was unpredictable (five-choice location task). Five large circles were presented on the screen, and the participant was supposed to press down a touchscreen button at the bottom of the screen and wait until a small yellow spot appeared in any of the five large circles. When the yellow spot appeared, the participant was supposed to touch the yellow spot as soon as possible with the same hand that was pressing the touchscreen button.

Age and education

Age was defined in full years at the end of the year 2018. Education years were queried from all participants aged 18 years and older. In Finland, the mean age at which secondary education is completed is 28 years. According to our data, 492 (92%) of the 533 participants who reported studying were at most 28 years old. Thus, we considered the own education of the participants aged 28 years and older. For participants aged 18–28 years, their own education was provided if the participant did not report full- or part-time studying. For all participants aged under 18 years and participants aged 18–28 years who reported studying, parental education years were considered (the maximum years of parental education for those participants with data for both parents). Hence, for adults (excluding students), education reflects self-acquired cognitive reserve, while for under 18-year-old participants and students, parental education reflects socioeconomic status.

### Anticoagulation in device-detected atrial fibrillation with or without vascular disease: a combined analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA trials [^56638ef1]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

This pre-specified secondary analysis of the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial investigated the effects of vascular disease on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation therapy compared with no anticoagulation in the NOAH-AFNET 6 trial. Results were validated in a pre-specified secondary analysis of ARTESiA and meta-analysed.

Design of NOAH-AFNET 6 and ARTESiA

In NOAH-AFNET 6, patients with DDAF, but without ECG-documented AF, aged ≥ 65 years, and with a minimum of one additional stroke risk factor were randomized to oral anticoagulation with edoxaban in the dose approved for stroke prevention in AF or to no anticoagulation. In the double-blind, double-dummy design, patients randomized to no anticoagulation received 100 mg aspirin if it was indicated; otherwise, they received placebo. Those without an indication for aspirin and all patients randomized to edoxaban took a dummy tablet. Physician's decision could overrule aspirin indications.

In ARTESiA, patients with DDAF lasting between 6:01 min and 23:59 h were enrolled. Inclusion criteria further comprised an age of at least 55 years and a CHA₂DS₂-VASc (heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years, diabetes, stroke/systemic embolism, sex, prior vascular disease) score of at least 3. A small subset of patients with a CHA₂DS₂-VASc score of 2 were enrolled in the early phase of the trial. Patients with prior stroke or age of at least 75 years or greater could also be enrolled. Randomization allocated patients to apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily if guideline-recommended dose-reduction criteria applied) or aspirin 81 mg daily in a double-blind design. In ARTESiA, open-label aspirin on top of the study medication was permitted.

In both trials, an ECG was recorded at each study visit (every 6 months). Patients with AF documented on one of these ECGS were switched to open-label anticoagulation. In ARTESiA, patients with DDAF episodes lasting ≥ 24 h were also switched to open-label anticoagulation therapy. Outcomes were centrally adjudicated by an independent review committee.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^8114ace7]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 5 — psychologists are aware of cultural perspectives and of personal and societal biases and engage in nondiscriminatory practice — emphasizes culturally informed assessment. Psychologists assessing older adults from racial and ethnic minority groups use the best available tests with norms appropriate for each individual's background and consult with expert colleagues as needed regarding battery construction and interpretation, and when appropriate norms are unavailable for a particular client, the psychologist clearly documents the limitations of their assessment and diagnoses; for example, the most appropriate norms may be from Mayo's Older African American Normative Studies (MOAANS) instead of the more familiar Heaton norms. Psychologists are advised to carefully evaluate test quality and appropriateness for individual circumstances; for example, the noose item in the Boston Naming Test (BNT) may be culturally inflammatory for African Americans and has been suggested as inappropriate for continued inclusion in the BNT. Strive to contextualize neuropsychological findings and recommendations with as much sociocultural information as possible, and strive to control biases through reviewing relevant research, relying on evidence-based practice guidelines, and by seeking additional consultation or, in some cases, withdrawing from the evaluation; if the psychologist is unable to conduct the evaluation fairly, the ethical psychologist seeks to refer the individual to other psychologists capable of providing services. Strive for continued growth in cultural competence, defined as awareness of one's own assumptions and biases, understanding the worldview of culturally dissimilar clients, and the ability to develop culturally appropriate assessments or interventions, and note that performing culturally sensitive assessments requires a life-long process of self-reflection and analysis.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^e7a49c92]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4 — psychologists seek and provide appropriate consultation in the course of performing evaluations of dementia and age-related cognitive changes — emphasizes that complex issues arise during the evaluation of suspected cognitive decline or dementia, including multiple medical comorbidities or medication side effects, sociobiographical background and cultural origins, genetic and heritability factors, abuse or neglect, questions of legal competence or guardianship, conflicting or unclear assessment results, and families overwhelmed or divided by the potential diagnosis, and for these reasons, integrated health care approaches are particularly well-suited for cognitive decline and dementia care.

### The accuracy of parent-reported height and weight for 6–12 year old U.S. children [^70b9a633]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Concordance was low between parent-reported and measured height (0.007), weight (− 0.039) and BMI (− 0.005) (Fig. 1). Similar to previous findings, on average parents underestimated child height (− 0.82 in. 95% CI: −0.35, − 1.29); however, parents overestimated height for 6–9 year olds (1.08 in. 95% CI: 0.51, 1.65) and underestimated height for 10–12 year olds (− 3.76 in. 95% CI: −4.43, − 3.09). On average, parents underestimated child weight by 1.7 pounds (95% CI: −3.2, 0.2). In contrast to height, parents overestimated weight for 6–9 year olds (5.4 lb. 95% CI: 3.2, 7.6) and underestimated weight of 10–12 year olds (− 12.7 lb. 95% CI: −15.8, − 9.8). On average, there were no significant differences between child BMI using parent-reported versus investigator-measured height and weight (a difference of 0.24 kg/m², 95% CI: −0.065, 0.55). By age group, parent report of child weight and height overestimated BMI for 6–9 year olds (0.69 kg/m², 95% CI: 0.34, 1.05) and underestimated BMI for 10–12 year olds (− 0.46 kg/m², 95% CI: −1.0, 0.08).

### Aging with my family: a grounded theory approach on the role of family when aging as foreign-born [^3457ec2b]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Most informants had, to their delight, very close relations with their children and grandchildren. Many said their children called them every day to check on how they were doing. They found themselves respected and still needed in the family. In the meantime, they felt nostalgic about the good old days when all the loved ones were gathered, and a frustration that the Swedish way of living with nuclear families made it difficult for generations to meet often and spend time together. One man commented his relationship with his children and grandchildren like this:

"Oh yes, absolutely! They (authors 'note: his children) call every day. It is the most important thing, for all foreign-born, that the culture should continue, that you always belong to the family! They should continue as I and my family in Chile. We do not see each other but we talk all the time, even though I have been away from them for 33 years. That is how I think. That is how Chileans think… I am a grandfather but it´s just a name on paper. I never play with my grandchildren because they are not here. They rarely come. Last week my oldest grandson turned 9. They were here but the only thing he wanted to do with me was to go to the town to buy a present!" (No. 12).

### Healthy aging: American Geriatrics Society white paper executive summary [^599b271c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). High credibility.

AGS white paper on healthy aging — background and methods outline rationale and development: Life expectancy has increased dramatically and is attributed to medical and non-medical advances, while geriatrics focuses on optimizing function and quality of life and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) is committed to promoting health, independence, and engagement of older adults. In response to a July 2015 manuscript, the AGS Board of Directors charged the AGS Clinical Practice and Models of Care Committee (CPMC) to develop a white paper calling on AGS members to play a more active role, developed in collaboration with the AGS Public Education Committee. The Committees convened a workgroup that reviewed the current literature, examined relevant reports and studies, and reviewed and approved the draft; the paper and recommendations were then reviewed and approved by the AGS Executive Committee on behalf of the AGS Board of Directors in April 2018. The literature review focused on defining the current concept of healthy aging; determining how the health-professional's concept differs from that of the lay public and across life stages; evaluating the impact of health promotion on reducing age-related conditions and consequences; evaluating models for healthy aging over time; reviewing opportunities for education and advocacy to promote healthy aging; and identifying best practices.

### Body-mass index trajectories from childhood to mid-adulthood and their sociodemographic predictors: evidence from the international childhood cardiovascular cohort (i3C) consortium [^802c218f]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

For inclusion in the current analysis, participants were required to have at least three individual measures of BMI, including one in childhood (6–18 years) and one in adulthood (> 18 years), and were aged 30–49 years at last measurement. These inclusion criteria were applied to ensure adequate representation of BMI measures over the age-window of interest (age 6 to 50 years). Each study was granted ethical approval by the relevant ethics committee, with written informed consent obtained from participants and/or their parents throughout the timeframe of their participation.

Measures

An extensive data harmonisation process conducted during 2014–20 has resulted in a set of consistent and comparable variables across the four cohorts. BMI (kg/m²), the key variable of interest, was derived from height and weight collected via trained technicians and/or via self-report (detailed description in Supplementary Materials 1). Potential predictor variables considered were baseline age, gender, race and highest level of parental education. All studies collected some information on race. As part of the harmonisation process, race in each study was classified into one of six categories (1 = white, 2 = Black/African American, 3 = Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 4 = American Indian/Alaskan Native, 5 = Asian, and 6 = More than one). This variable was then collapsed into two groups (1 = white, 2 = Non-white) for this analysis due to a lack of variability or small cell sizes. Parental education was reported by participants in childhood in YFS, BHS and MUSC, and retrospectively reported in the first adulthood visit in CDAH study. Highest level of parental education was defined as the highest of both if both parents' data were available and the only value was used if education level was available from only one parent. Given international differences in education systems, highest level of parental education was defined into four categories (less than high school, high school or equivalent, more than high school/equivalent, and university degree) and was further collapsed into two groups (more than high school/equivalent, and high school/equivalent or less) due to low proportions in some groups.

Table 3
Step counts (based on increments of 500 steps) to accumulate in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps by the end of the day

Details on how these recommendations were derived are provided in the Supplementary Method.

*Same as the "Overall" group.

The step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants aged 17–59 were similar but were generally more than those required for participants aged 60 and above (Table 3). There were also differences in the step counts required in the evenings to achieve 10,000 steps among participants with BMI less than 27.5 kg/m² on weekdays.

Across different demographics, participants aged between 30 and 39 who had accumulated fewer than 7500 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to participants aged 60 and above (Supplementary Fig. S6). Males who had accumulated fewer than 5000 steps between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day compared to females on weekdays, and no sex differences among those who accumulated 5000 steps or more. Participants with normal BMI were associated with lower mean step counts for the rest of the day on weekdays, but they could also have higher mean step counts on weekends compared to participants with obese BMI. The mean step difference between participants with normal BMI and participants with obese BMI decreased with time, with little difference at 10 p.m.

### Predicting the public health impact of a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine [^d82dbf5a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Identifying key age groups to vaccinate

It is important to consider which age groups contribute most to transmission and, therefore, should be prioritised in a TBV vaccination campaign. In malaria-endemic settings, of both high and low transmission intensity, the modelling indicates that the most infectious individuals are concentrated in younger age groups (Figs. 6 A and 6B). However, the contribution that adults make to onward transmission is amplified as they are bitten more frequently than young children. The per-person contribution to onward transmission (insets of Figs. 6 A and B) is linked to the population's infectivity via the demography of the setting, and the age-dependent biting rates. In these two settings, results generated by the transmission model indicate that school-aged children infect the most mosquitoes. Younger children also contribute to transmission, in part because they are more numerous in the community. We use the transmission model to examine the impact of targeting different age groups for vaccination, as well as monitoring the age groups in which the burden of malaria is reduced. In the two settings considered here, we find that vaccinating children of ~10 years of age averts the highest number of cases. For example, in a high transmission setting, our modelling work suggests that vaccinating children of 8–10 years of age could avert almost twice as many cases as vaccinating the same number of 2–4-year-olds or 15–18-year-olds (Fig. 6D). The benefit of a TBV can be spread quite diffusely through the population though the greatest reduction in the number of cases is found in pre-school children, especially in higher transmission settings.

### Life review in advanced age: qualitative research on the 'start in life' of 90-year-olds in the lothian birth cohort 1921 [^3bdc7688]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Many participants commented on how values and good habits were emphasized in their families. Household chores, and in some cases farm chores, instilled values around hard physical work, cleanliness and responsibility:

"We were given daily tasks to perform. Such as washing dishes–sweeping floors etc. I was also put in charge of a younger sister & was responsible for her safety. I also had a job delivering newspapers, morning & evening". (M)

Loyalty to the family, helping each other, considering the needs of others and the learning of Christian ethics were other values emphasised:

"… while in a way I had quite a strict upbringing I soon learned what the difference was between right & wrong". (F)

"I learned to appreciate what I had & to help & care for people". (F)

"I learned the family came first, an unwritten rule in Shetland, where large families were the norm". (F)

Only a few referred to very strict parents:

"My mother was the disciplinarian in our house, she set out the rules and regulations, being stubborn I seem to remember going to bed quite often with a sore rear end". (M)

A number of participants mentioned siblings and their position in the family. Brothers and sisters were part of a warmly remembered family life for many. Oldest children sometimes mentioned extra household and caring responsibilities, while youngest children tended to sound carefree.

Family dynamics involving favouritism or unfavourable comparisons with siblings cropped up in very few accounts:

"I had a very talented elder sister and a much younger brother. I wanted to please my parents but found it difficult to fit in". (F)

Not having siblings was not necessarily regretted:

"I was an only child, and so enjoyed the undivided attention of two loving parents". (M)

### Hourly step recommendations to achieve daily goals for working and older adults [^588d8957]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 shows the predicted mean step counts and 95% CI for the rest of the day, given the step counts accumulated from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. adjusting for age group, BMI group and sex. Overall, there was little difference in the conditional predicted mean step counts for the rest of the days between the weekdays and the weekends. On weekdays, participants who accumulated 6000 steps by 6 p.m. had a 0.692 probability of achieving 10,000 steps (all the goals) by the end of the day (refer to the Goal 3 diagonal line in Fig. 3, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, participants who had accumulated 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with a probability of 0.910, 0.982, 0.700, and 1, respectively. On weekends, participants who had accumulated 6500 steps by 6 p.m. 7000 steps by 7 p.m. 8000 steps by 8 p.m. 8500 steps by 9 p.m. and 9500 steps by 10 p.m. achieved 10,000 mean steps by the end of the day with probability 0.852, 0.583, 0.947, 0.717 and 1, respectively. The step counts required to achieve 5000 and 7500 steps by the end of the day can be found in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.

### Shape and the first hundred nouns [^b2c4243f]. Child Development (2004). Low credibility.

This paper reports evidence from a longitudinal study in which children's attention to shape in a laboratory task of artificial noun learning was correlated with a rate shift in noun acquisitions. Eight children were tested in the laboratory at 3-week intervals beginning when they had less than 25 nouns in their productive vocabulary (M age = 17 months). Children were presented with a novel word generalization task at each session. Additionally, the study examined the kinds of words the children learned early, based on parent reports, and the statistical regularities inherent in those vocabularies. The results indicate that as children learned nouns, they also learned to attend to shape in the novel word task. At the same time, children showed an acceleration in new noun production outside of the laboratory.

### Colorectal cancer screening for average-risk adults: 2018 guideline update from the American cancer society [^06c6897c]. CA (2018). Medium credibility.

Older adults benefit–harm evidence and decision modifiers — There is evidence from RCTs to support CRC screening up to age 75 years in average-risk populations, and on the basis of data from gFOBT randomized trials the lag time to CRC screening benefit has been estimated to be 10 years, with screening benefit generally believed to require a minimum 10-year life expectancy. In a Medicare cohort, among adults aged 70 to 74 years the absolute risk of CRC over 8 years was reduced by 16% in the group undergoing colonoscopy versus the no-colonoscopy group (2.19% vs 2.26%), while among individuals aged 75 to 79 years who underwent colonoscopy versus the no-colonoscopy group it was 2.84% vs 2.97%, respectively; the risk of adverse events from colonoscopy was nearly twice as high among individuals aged 75 to 79 years (10.3 per 1000) compared with individuals aged 70 to 74 years (5.6 per 1000). Given increased competing mortality risks and the increased risk of colonoscopy-associated complications with greater age, the focus of screening among individuals aged 76 to 85 years should be on the healthy individuals with no or few comorbidities who are expected to live at least 10 years, patient preference should weigh heavily in the decision, and if there is concern regarding colonoscopy risks, then noncolonoscopy options may be preferable.

### Cardiovascular health promotion in children: challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^165e1172]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Pediatric blood lipids and cholesterol — screening age, targets, and markers: The American Heart Association's Strategic Impact Goal establishes a total cholesterol level of 170 mg/dL as ideal for children 6 to 19 years of age. During puberty, a reduction in total blood cholesterol of 10% to 15% is typical, and Table 2 notes that puberty has a strong influence, with total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels falling 10%–20% or more; Nine to 11 y of age is considered a stable period for measuring blood lipids because most children in this age range will not have started puberty. Because relying on a family history as the primary rationale for screening misses 30%–60% of children with dyslipidemia, universal lipid assessment is recommended. Non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non–HDL-C) is considered a significant predictor of atherosclerosis and can be accurately calculated in a nonfasting state.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for premature ejaculation, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, ISSM 2014 guidelines recommend to consider assessing treatment outcome with the Clinical Global Impression of Change question, asking the patient how would he describe his PE problem compared to before starting treatment:

- much worse

- worse

- slightly worse

- no change

- slightly better

- better

### Changes in sensory dominance during childhood: converging evidence from the colavita effect and the sound-induced flash illusion [^fdf57341]. Child Development (2012). Low credibility.

In human adults, visual dominance emerges in several multisensory tasks. In children, auditory dominance has been reported up to 4 years of age. To establish when sensory dominance changes during development, 41 children (6–7, 9–10, and 11–12 years) were tested on the Colavita task (Experiment 1) and 32 children (6–7, 9–10, and 11–12 years) were tested on the sound-induced flash illusion (Experiment 2). In both experiments, an auditory dominance emerged in 6- to 7-year-old children compared to older children. Adult-like visual dominance started to emerge from 9 to 10 years of age, and consolidated in 11- to 12-year-old children. These findings show that auditory dominance persists up to 6 years, but switches to visual dominance during the first school years.

### Re-examination of successful agers with lower biological than chronological age still after a 20-year follow-up period [^87ce397e]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Only 2% of the participants were frail by the FI at baseline. However, despite that most of them were categorized as pre-frail, the mean PBA of the participants' was lower than their mean CA at baseline. This persisted at re-examination. The omission of one of the original FI items unlikely impacted the results as the FI was counted accordingly.

The difference between the CA and the PBA was greater at re-examination than at baseline. By this assessment, they were indeed successful agers as the difference between the CA and the PBA continued to grow even during the long follow-up period of 20 years. PBA has earlier been found a better predictor of mortality than CA in a shorter follow-up of originally older study participants. Our study supports that finding as these survivors were mostly biologically younger than their years. Despite more of them being frail at re-examination, they were not as frail as their chronological age would suggest and thus their risk of death was lower. PBA evaluations are somewhat population specific because of the way they are counted and direct comparisons between populations should be made with caution.

### Prevalence and stability of insufficient sleep measured by actigraphy: a prospective community study [^3e3593dc]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Stability

AIS showed stability neither from age 6 to 8 years (odds ratio (OR) = 5.8, 95% CI, 0.59–57.32) nor from age 8 to 10 years (OR = 1.26, 95% CI, 0.15–10.46). However, some stability emerged from age 10 to 12 years (OR = 5.30, 95% CI, 1.77–15.82); 40% of 10-year-olds with AIS also had AIS at age 12 years (Fig. 2). Of note, the 10–12-year-old stability was significantly stronger than that of the 6–8- and 8–10-year transitions (Δχ² = 15.66, df = 1, p < 0.001). The 6–8- and 8–10-year stability was not significantly different from each other (Δχ² = 0.97, df = 1, p = 0.32). When insufficient sleep was conceptualized as NNIS, the rank order stability from age 8 to 10 years and from 10 to 12 years emerged as modestly to moderately stable (Table 2). Correlation between study variables is provided in Table 3.

Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) confounding factors and population variability — FENO values can be affected by measurement technique, exhalation flow rate, nasal NO contamination, the NO analyzer used, age, height, smoking, and antiinflammatory medications, and population-level variability may reflect genetics, age, sex, atopy, weight and height, current smoking, and diet. Age seems to be important in children; in the largest study to date, age and height were identified as factors without differences between males and females, whereas other studies reported consistently higher levels in males.

### Bone age: a handy tool for pediatric providers [^c4a768b4]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatricians have relied on methods for determining skeletal maturation for > 75 years. Bone age continues to be a valuable tool in assessing children's health. New technology for bone age determination includes computer-automated readings and assessments obtained from alternative imaging modalities. In addition, new nonclinical bone age applications are evolving, particularly pertaining to immigration and children's rights to asylum. Given the significant implications when bone ages are used in high-stake decisions, it is necessary to recognize recently described limitations in predicting accurate age in various ethnicities and diseases. Current methods of assessing skeletal maturation are derived from primarily white populations. In modern studies, researchers have explored the accuracy of bone age across various ethnicities in the United States. Researchers suggest there is evidence that indicates the bone ages obtained from current methods are less generalizable to children of other ethnicities, particularly children with African and certain Asian backgrounds. Many of the contemporary methods of bone age determination may be calibrated to individual populations and hold promise to perform better in a wider range of ethnicities, but more data are needed.

### Childhood predictors of suffering in adulthood across 22 countries [^142a95f9]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Predictor variables

Quality of relationship with mother when growing up was assessed with the question: "Please think about your relationship with your mother when you were growing up. In general, would you say that relationship was very good, somewhat good, somewhat bad, or very bad?" An analogous variable was used for the quality of a person's relationship with their father when growing up. Both maternal and paternal relationship quality were dichotomized (i.e. very bad/somewhat bad versus very good/somewhat good) in the regression analyses to help address multicollinearity issues. "Does not apply" was treated as a dichotomous control variable for participants who did not have a mother or father due to death or absence. Family structure around age 12 was assessed with: "Were your parents married to each other when you were around 12 years old?" Responses included married, divorced, never married, and one or both had died. Subjective financial status of one's family around age 12 was measured with: "Which one of these phrases comes closest to your own feelings about your family's household income when you were growing up, such as when you were around 12 years old?" Responses were lived comfortably, got by, found it difficult, and found it very difficult. Childhood abuse when growing up was assessed with yes/no responses to: "Were you ever physically or sexually abused when you were growing up?" Similarly, participants provided a yes/no response to whether they felt like an outsider in their family when growing up: "When you were growing up, did you feel like an outsider in your family?" Self-rated health when growing up was assessed by: "In general, how was your health when you were growing up? Was it excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" Immigration status was assessed with: "Were you born in this country, or not?" Frequency of religious service attendance around age 12 was assessed with: "How often did you attend religious services or worship at a temple, mosque, shrine, church, or other religious building when you were around 12 years old?" Responses were at least once/week, 1–3 times/month, less than once/month, or never. Gender was assessed as male, female, or other. Year of birth (age) was classified as 1998–2005 (18–24 years), 1993–1998 (25–29 years), 1983–1993 (30–39 years), 1973–1983 (40–49 years), 1963–1973 (50–59 years), 1953–1963 (60–69 years), 1943–1953 (70–79 years), and 1943 or earlier (80 years or older).

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^7f7fcf5d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — Given increased rates of multiple gestations for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at age 35 years or older, we suggest a first-trimester ultrasonogram. (GRADE 2C) The incidence of multifetal gestation increases with advancing age at the time of pregnancy, with twin births rising from 17 per 1,000 births in individuals younger than age 20 years to a high of 51.1 per 1,000 births in individuals aged 40–54 years, and a retrospective Belgium cohort (N = 41,618) reporting 2.8% at 25–34 years, 4.5% at 35–39 years, 5.5% at 40–44 years, and 10.9% at 45 years and older; the optimal time for determination of the number of fetuses is the first trimester and chorionicity in the late first or early second trimester.

### Modeling health and economic outcomes of eliminating sex disparities in youth physical activity [^689a6676]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Economic Outcomes When Reducing Sex Disparities in Youth PA Levels

Figure 1 D shows the recurring cost savings for every new cohort of 6- to 17-year-olds resulting from the improved physical health outcomes achieved by eliminating sex disparities in PA. Completely eliminating disparities saved $779.87 million (95% CI, $653.23 million to $906.51 million) in societal costs, of which 43% was direct medical cost-savings and 57% was productivity losses averted.

As with physical health outcomes, cost savings are not equally distributed, with 12- to 17-year-olds garnering the greatest cost savings. When eliminating disparities (eg, 100% reduction), the 12- to 17-year-old age group saved $219.96 million (95% CI, $188.37 million to $251.55 million) in direct medical costs and $280.66 million (95% CI, $193.01 million to $368.31 million) in productivity losses during their lifetimes, approximately twice as much as the 6- to 11-year-old group. Although the least amount of savings occurred in the 6- to 11-year-old group, increasing PA to 4.16 days per week of 60 minutes of PA per day (the levels that male youths in that age group currently get) for everyone within that age group still saved $113.49 million (95% CI, $83.98 million to $143.01 million) in direct medical costs and $165.76 million (95% CI, $85.23 million to $246.29 million) in productivity losses.

### Nasal NO: normal values in children age 6 through to 17 years [^2f9211c5]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

The present study is an assessment of normal values of nasal nitric oxide (nNO) in healthy children. Healthy children aged between 6–17 yrs were recruited from three schools in Rotterdam (The Netherlands). Breath was held for 10 s, while air was extracted from one nostril at 700 mL·min⁻¹. The mean nNO value at the response plateau after 7–10 s was recorded and the average of three measurements was used. In total, 340 children participated; the male:female ratio was 156:184. Three reliable measurements were available in 85% of the children. The nNO concentrations were distributed normally (mean 449 ppb, SD 115). They were not associated with sex, passive smoking or body mass index. In children aged < 12 yrs nNO correlated positively with age, history of adenoidectomy and ambient NO. In children aged ≥ 12 yrs ambient NO was the only significant modifier. Prediction rules for nNO values in children were formulated. In conclusion, the current study presents normal values for nasal nitric oxide in children, which can be used to assess the value of nasal nitric oxide in respiratory illnesses.

### The accuracy of parent-reported height and weight for 6–12 year old U.S. children [^c667a0f9]. BMC Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

We may still not fully understand parents' ability to understand numerical information or other biases that can lead to inaccurate parent report of child anthropometrics. Race, socioeconomic status, and gender have been found to be associated with a lack of correlation between parent-reported and investigator-measured child anthropometric measurements. O'Connor and Gugenheim also found that parents overestimated their sons' heights and underestimated their daughters' heights, although we saw no relationship between child sex and concordance in this sample. Our findings that parent education, in addition to child age, was associated with misestimation of child BMI brings to question other published correction factors that adjust height, weight, and BMI only for age. There is no clear consistency between our findings and those in a study by Weden et al. which found that parents underestimate height for 2–8 year olds (− 2.1 in versus our estimate of + 1.1 in for 6–9 year olds) and 9–11 year olds (− 1.6 in versus our − 3.8 in for 10–12 year olds), overestimate weight for 2–8 year olds (+ 2.2 lbs. versus our + 5.4 lbs. for 6–9 year olds) and 9–11 year olds (+ 6.2 lbs. versus our − 12.7 lbs. for 10–12 year olds). There were fewer differences between our results and those of Weden et al. for child BMI; they estimated that parents overestimate BMI for 2–8 year olds (+ 1.5 kg/m² versus our + 0.69 kg/m² for 6–9 year olds) and slightly overestimate weight for 9–11 year olds (+ 0.1 kg/m² versus our − 0.46 kg/m² for 10–12 year olds). Some of these differences may be attributable to the fact that the Weden analysis compared two nationally-representative samples; their correction factors are population averages. While this approach has the advantage of representativeness, our concordance findings compared to our average differences suggest that population averages can inappropriately suggest a level of accuracy at the individual level that is misleading.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

Increase the daily dose in 2 weeks by an increment of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 50 mg/kg. If a patient cannot tolerate a daily dose of 50 mg/kg, the daily dose may be reduced. In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 47 mg/kg in this age group. Pediatric Patients 6 to < 16 Years of Age Initiate treatment with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses. Increase the daily dose every 2 weeks by increments of 20 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 60 mg/kg. The effectiveness of doses lower than 60 mg/kg/day has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies in pediatric patients 1 month to < 4 years of age, irritability was reported in 12% of the levetiracetam-treated patients compared to 0% of placebo-treated patients.

### Examination of the cut-off scores determined by the ages and stages questionnaire in a population-based sample of 6 month-old Norwegian infants [^c166eb73]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

The T3 questionnaire included the Norwegian translation of the Ages and Stages (ASQ) 6 month Questionnaire. The 30 items contains the response categories "Yes", "Sometimes" or "Not yet" concerning whether the child can perform the activity, with a respective score of 10, 5 or 0. The pictograms from the original ASQ were not included. The translation process of the Norwegian version of the ASQ was continued with some slight changes from the version received for use in this study and until publication. The minor changes introduced are expected, also by an independent expert, to have had no impact on the responses. The ASQ was scored according to the 2 nd US manual, i.e. one or two missing items in an area score were replaced by the ratio score of that area. In analyses comparing with the N.ref sample, the dataset was scored according to the Norwegian manual, the difference being that in the latter, area scores not ending with 0 or 5 were rounded to the closest 0 or 5. An overall score was obtained by adding the five developmental area scores.

### Age-related macular degeneration preferred practice pattern ® [^4889aae4]. Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for age-related macular degeneration, more specifically with respect to natural history (intermediate age-related macular degeneration), AAO 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that intermediate AMD (category 3) is a more critical distinction clinically because it places the individual at risk for progression to more advanced AMD. It has been defined by the AREDS as having extensive medium drusen (63–124 µm in diameter) or one or more large drusen (≥ 125 µm in diameter) in one or both eyes. The progression to advanced AMD at 5 years in this group is approximately 18% according to the original AREDS. However, for patients with large drusen in one eye, the rate of development of advanced AMD at 5 years is 6.3%, whereas the rate for patients with multiple bilateral large drusen increases to 26% at 5 years. In the 10-year follow-up study of the AREDS, 37% of patients developed large drusen when medium drusen were present at baseline in one eye, and 71% developed large drusen when medium drusen were present in both eyes at baseline. When medium drusen were present at baseline, 14% progressed to advanced AMD at 10 years.

2.4 Maintenance Dosing in Pediatric Patients Less Than 10 Years Old

The starting maintenance dose for heart failure in pediatric patients less than 10 years old is based on lean body weight, renal function, age, and concomitant products [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The recommended starting maintenance dose for pediatric patients between 5 years and 10 years old is given in Table 4. These recommendations assume the presence of normal renal function.

Table 4. Recommended Starting Digoxin Tablets Oral Maintenance Dosage in Pediatric Patients between 5 and 10 Years Old

Table 5 provides average daily maintenance dose requirements for pediatric patients between 5 and 10 years old (to be given twice daily) with heart failure based on age, lean body weight, and renal function.

2.5 Monitoring to Assess Safety, Efficacy, and Therapeutic Blood Levels

Monitor for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity and clinical response. Adjust dose based on toxicity, efficacy, and blood levels.

Serum digoxin levels less than 0.5 ng/mL have been associated with diminished efficacy, while levels above 2 ng/mL have been associated with increased toxicity without increased benefit.

Interpret the serum digoxin concentration in the overall clinical context, and do not use an isolated measurement of serum digoxin concentration as the basis for increasing or decreasing the digoxin tablets dose. Serum digoxin concentrations may be falsely elevated by endogenous digoxin-like substances [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. If the assay is sensitive to these substances, consider obtaining a baseline digoxin level before starting digoxin tablets and correct post-treatment values by the reported baseline level.

Obtain serum digoxin concentrations just before the next scheduled digoxin tablets dose or at least 6 hours after the last dose. The digoxin concentration is likely to be 10 to 25% lower when sampled right before the next dose (24 hours after dosing) compared to sampling 8 hours after dosing (using once-daily dosing). However, there will be only minor differences in digoxin concentrations using twice daily dosing whether sampling is done at 8 or 12 hours after a dose.

2.6 Switching from Intravenous Digoxin to Oral Digoxin

When switching from intravenous to oral digoxin formulations, make allowances for differences in bioavailability when calculating maintenance dosages (see Table 6).

### Predicting successful ageing among older adults seems possible even as far as two decades ahead [^3b2077c9]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

We have previously described older adults (born in or before the year 1933) who at the age of 84 years or over were still able to live at home without daily informal or formal care, and defined them as successful agers. We found that these successful agers were satisfied with their lives and had a lower biological than chronological age both at baseline (in 1998‒1999 at the age of 64 years or over) and after a 20-year follow-up.

The purpose of this study was to test multidimensional SA models constructed by Nosraty et al. (2019), in predicting successful ageing (independent living at home at the age of 84 years or over) in a younger (aged 64 years or over) population during a longer follow-up period of 20 years. Same construct of physical, psychological and social components were used with only minor modifications. Also, we aimed to investigate which individual subcomponents included in the SA models predicted successful ageing.

### Global, regional and national estimates of the burden of childhood asthma attributable to NO₂ exposure for 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023: a global burden of disease study 2023 [^9c82640d]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma, a chronic lung condition characterised by inflammation and airway constriction, has been associated with nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) exposure, an association that particularly impacts children. Our study rigorously assessed this relationship and estimated the global burden of childhood asthma attributable to NO 2 exposure in 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023.

Methods

We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies evaluating NO₂'s long-term impact on childhood asthma. Using burden of proof meta-regression methods that account for bias by adjusting for study-design covariates and quantify remaining unexplained between-study heterogeneity to incorporate into uncertainty, we estimated the relative risk of childhood asthma occurring as a function of NO₂ exposure. From this, we computed global and country-specific population attributable fractions (PAFs) - i.e., the proportional change in asthma risk that would occur if NO₂ exposure were reduced to a theoretical minimum exposure level range of 4.6–6.2 ppb. We applied PAFs to data from the 2023 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) to derive the asthma burden attributable to NO₂ exposure in children and youths under 20 years old. Burden of proof methods allowed us to further compute risk-outcome metrics quantifying the magnitude of the NO₂-asthma association and its strength of supporting evidence.

Findings

We identified a total of 27 cohort studies, spanning 12 countries, primarily in Europe and high-income North America, with some studies from Asia (China and Japan). A meta-regression log-linear risk curve of these studies produced a summary RR of 1.05 (95% UI 0.99–1.12) per 5 ppb NO₂ and Egger's regression indicated significant publication bias. We estimated a global PAF of 4.67% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: -3.75 to 20.6; all UIs reported in this study are inclusive of between-study heterogeneity except where noted), yielding 233,000 (-250,000–956,000) years lived with disability (YLDs) attributable to NO₂ globally in 2023. GBD 2023 ranked NO₂ seventh among environmental risk factors contributing to YLDs in children for all causes and third for childhood asthma YLDs. Attributable burden estimates and trends varied significantly by GBD super-region. While NO₂-attributable childhood asthma burden has declined substantially since 1990 in the high-income and central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia super-regions, NO₂ remains a prominent environmental risk factor in these two super-regions, ranked third in both super-regions for paediatric asthma YLDs in 2023, contributing 57,100 (-63 600 to 242,000) and 6570 (-7050 to 30,200) YLDs, respectively. In South Asia, NO₂ ranks second as risk factor for pediatric asthma contributing to 20,100 (-17 600, 105,000) YLDs in 2023.

Interpretation

NO₂ pollution remains a top environmental risk for paediatric health, necessitating policy interventions targeting NO₂ pollution, especially in high-income locations and urban areas.

Mental health in children — sleep duration and behavioral/emotional outcomes: Studies included approximately 100 to 30,000 participants, with limited data for children in the 4 months to less than 12 months age range. A longitudinal study of approximately 3,000 children beginning at age 0–1 year with follow-up at age 6–7 years found that persistent short sleepers and poor sleepers within the 12 month to < 3 year old and 3 to < 6 year old age categories had greater difficulties with emotional, social and physical functioning at age 6–7 years compared to "typical sleepers" who slept approximately 14.5 hours at age 0–1 year and 10.75 hours at age 6–7 years. Another study collected almost 33,000 parental surveys regarding child sleep duration and the emotional and behavioral regulation of these children at 18 months and 5 years of age.

### Global, regional, and national mortality trends in older children and young adolescents (5–14 years) from 1990 to 2016: an analysis of empirical data [^78e9a9ab]. The Lancet: Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Efforts to estimate mortality in children aged 5–14 years from surveys, censuses, and vital statistics should be pursued in the future, and there remains room for improvement by future iterations. We suggest at least five areas for development. First, we did not use summary birth histories. More research is required to evaluate the validity of indirect methods when used to estimate mortality among older children. These indirect estimates would enable a better estimation of mortality in countries where the primary data sources are still population censuses. Second, an increasing number of countries are reporting their vital statistics estimates to WHO but not all country-years are used because of the likely incompleteness of death reporting. There is no well established method to assess the completeness of death reporting of children, except through comparison between estimates from vital statistics and full birth histories. As a result, the decision to include or exclude vital registration estimates remains partly based on expert assessments done on a country-by-country basis. Improvements in methods are required to better assess the percentage of deaths that are registered and to potentially include partial vital statistics data. Third, we assumed that mortality rates in children aged 5–14 years estimated from full birth histories are unaffected by HIV-related survivor biases. More research is needed to evaluate the magnitude of these biases and develop adjustment methods, which should account for the coverage of antiretroviral therapy and prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Fourth, the modelling strategy could be reassessed. At present, estimates of mortality among children younger than 5 years and children aged 5–14 years are mostly obtained independently (except for in countries with insufficient 10q₅ data points), but with the same B3 model and similar data sources. An alternative method would be to use pairs of measurements of 10q₅ and under-5 mortality rate when both indicators are available from the same sources and to model the association between the two indicators. This strategy is currently used by UN IGME to estimate neonatal mortality, whereby an overall expected ratio between neonatal mortality and under-5 mortality rate (given the level of under-5 mortality) is combined with a country-specific multiplier to capture deviations. Further work is required to establish if this alternative modelling approach outperforms the current approach for 10q₅ in validation exercises. Finally, we restricted our study to children younger than 15 years, and we did not compute mortality rates for adolescents aged 15–19 years. This restriction is based on a concern that full birth histories could be too affected by truncation bias because of women only being interviewed when they are aged 15–49 years. The use of sibling histories, which provide information on the survival of brothers and sisters, could be explored to cover older age groups. Beyond these methodological developments, better primary data are required for developing reliable and timely country-specific estimates. Ultimately, the only way to ensure that all deaths are counted on a continuous basis and causes of death are certified by a medical practitioner is to strengthen vital statistics systems. Vital statistics systems are particularly useful to measure rare events, as is the case in deaths of children aged 5–14 years.

### When my child has Alzheimer's disease [^b35bdf64]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The significant increment in life expectancy, associated to the existence of high-performing older adults, and the appropriate diagnosis of early dementias, lead to an uncommon scenario, of healthy parents accompanying their children with Alzheimer's disease or another dementia to medical consultations. Here, we reported three peculiar clinical vignettes of patients diagnosed with a dementia, who were accompanied by healthy parents. This is a modern situation that tends to become more frequent, and must be properly discussed, since multidisciplinary care and specific training are necessary.

### The development of human social learning across seven societies [^a3d58c72]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Research with children in Western, industrialised societies has revealed potent social information use in general and majority preference in particular at an early age. For example, 14-month-old children already use social information rationally. Children at 4 years of age even flexibly choose when to imitate others or innovate novel solutions, the kind of advanced social information use precipitating adaptive learning and cumulative culture. Selective sensitivity to the majority was reported for 2-year-old German children in a simple decision-making task similar to the one used in the current study. Children watched four familiar, same age, same gender peers demonstrating the use of an unknown machine. Three peers demonstrated variant A once each, one peer demonstrated variant B three times. Two-year-old German children in this study preferentially copied the majority strategy. Furthermore, underscoring the fundamental and adaptive nature of this learning bias, chimpanzees in the same study design also preferentially copied the majority. In another study, 3–6-year-old American (United States) children were required to copy a necklace-making demonstration from video. Children showed greater imitative fidelity after watching two identical demonstrations by two different adults than after watching the same individual twice. The developmental trajectory of these social learning phenomena, however, is less clear, since studies typically focus on a limited age-range. Notable exceptions are findings on increased over-imitation — i.e. copying both task-relevant and task-irrelevant aspects of a social demonstration — in 5–6-year-old children compared to 3–4-year-old children in the United Kingdom, and above-chance selectivity in social learning strategies in 3-year olds developing into adaptive reliance on majority information in 7-year olds in the United States. These studies, however, beg the question of whether the obtained results represent human universals or behavioural trends specific to Western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic (i.e. WEIRD) societies.

### Evaluating the age-based recommendations for long-term follow-up in breast cancer [^c4ac3369]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

The cause‐specific hazard functions after 5 years of follow‐up for LRR or SP within the current age groups were determined for the three age groups that are distinguished in the guideline (< 60, 60–74, > 74 after 5 years of follow‐up). The difference in risk was assessed by comparing the cumulative risks as well as the subhazard ratios (sHRs) from the multivariable analysis. Also, the cumulative incidence functions of the three current age groups for the follow‐up years 5–10 were compared with the 5‐year incidence of primary breast cancer in the screening population divided in 5‐year age groups. To determine the 5‐year risk of primary breast cancer in the population that is invited for the biennial screening program (50–75 years), data from the incidence years 2005–2009 from the NCR were used, as were mortality data from Statistics Netherlands [32]. The life table method was used to calculate this risk with adjustments for mortality from other causes and the prevalence of cancer in the population.

By testing the survivor functions (events predicted vs. observed) of both LRR and SP per 5‐year age intervals using the log‐rank test, alternative cutoffs for age were determined to obtain a greater differentiation in risk between the groups. The difference in risk between the current age groups and when using the new age cutoffs was compared graphically and by the sHRs obtained with competing risks regression, corrected for other explaining variables.

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

### The impact of published guidance on trends in the pharmacological management of depression in children and adolescents-a whole population e-cohort data linkage study in wales, UK [^4676aadc]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Incidence of depression increased across all age groups with the largest increase seen in the 6–11-year-old group although incidence remained lower than in older age groups. Incidence increased nearly four-fold in 12–14-year-olds and more than doubled in 15–17-year-olds (IRR 6–11-year-olds 5.3 [95% CI 4.3–6.5]; 12–14-year-olds 3.8 [95% CI 3.3–4.3]; 15–17-year-olds 2.3 [95% CI 2.0–2.6]; Figure 1).

Increases in 6–11 year olds were similar for males and females, with larger increases seen for males in both those aged 12–14 years and those aged 15–17 years (IRRs males 6–11 years 5.4 [95% CI 4.3–6.8]; females 6–11 years 5.2 [95% CI 3.8–6.9]; males 12–14 years 4.3 [95% CI 3.8–4.8]; females 12–14 years 3.6 [95% CI 3.1–4.2]; males 15–17 years 3.6 [95% CI 3.2–4.0]; females 15–17 years 1.9 [95% CI 1.8–2.1]).

When exploring incidence symptoms and diagnoses of depression separately, incidence of symptoms is around 3 times higher than incidence of diagnoses with an increase seen in both over the study period (IRRs diagnoses 2.4 [95% CI 2.1–2.8]; symptoms 2.9 [95% CI 2.5–3.4]; Figure 1 (online Supplementary Table S2)).

### Intensive referral to 12-step self-help groups and 6-month substance use disorder outcomes [^5ba8001e]. Addiction (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

This study implemented and evaluated procedures to help clinicians make effective referrals to 12-Step self-help groups.

Design

Randomized controlled trial. Setting Out-patient substance use disorder treatment. Participants Individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) entering a new treatment episode (n = 345) who were assigned randomly to a standard referral- or an intensive referral-to-self-help condition.

Measurements

Self-reports of 12-Step group attendance and involvement and substance use at baseline and a 6-month follow-up.

Intervention

The intensive referral intervention focused on encouraging patients to attend 12-Step meetings by connecting them to 12-Step volunteers.

Findings

Among patients with relatively less previous 12-Step meeting attendance, intensive referral was associated with more meeting attendance during follow-up than was standard referral. Among all patients, compared with those who received standard referral, those who received intensive referral were more likely to be involved with 12-Step groups during the 6-month follow-up (i.e. had provided service, had a spiritual awakening and currently had a sponsor). Intensive referral patients also had better alcohol and drug use outcomes at 6 months. Twelve-Step involvement mediated part of the association between referral condition and alcohol outcomes.

Conclusions

The brief intensive referral intervention was associated with improved 12-Step group involvement and substance use outcomes even among patients with considerable previous 12-Step group exposure and formal treatment. Future 12-Step intensive referral procedures should focus on encouraging 12-Step group involvement in addition to attendance to benefit patients most effectively.
