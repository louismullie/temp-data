## Question

Is there a better opening sentence for this paragraph that more clearly signals it discusses the many strategies to improve blood pressure control?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a better opening sentence for the first substantive paragraph of the 2014 AHA/ACC/CDC hypertension control advisory that more clearly signals the paragraph discusses multiple, complementary strategies for improving BP control at the population level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact function of that opening paragraph and whether it currently conveys the intended scope. Then, I should verify how recent authoritative statements frame the breadth of implementation strategies. Next, I will map key terms from high‑credibility sources that explicitly denote multiplicity. After that, I will draft candidate opening sentences, pressure‑test them against the document's intent, and reconcile any misreads. Finally, I will select the best candidate and justify it with targeted citations and a concise rationale.

> Let me first confirm the target paragraph and its limitation. The advisory's opening substantive paragraph emphasizes best‑practice, evidence‑based management algorithms and promises to describe their value, criteria, an AHA/ACC/CDC‑recommended algorithm, and exemplar algorithms linked to improved BP control, but its initial sentence reads generically and does not signal that the document situates algorithms within a larger ecosystem of complementary strategies operating at system and population levels, which risks underselling the breadth of approaches needed to close the guideline‑to‑practice gap [^111MdGgG].

> Wait, let me verify the core message that should be telegraphed up front. The advisory is a call to action for system‑level, standardized, algorithm‑enabled hypertension care, embedded in programs, protocols, and quality systems to improve population BP control, so the opener should foreshadow a multifaceted approach rather than a single tool or pathway, aligning algorithms with team‑based care, performance feedback, and broader implementation supports [^111MdGgG] [^113dKNdr].

> Next, I should review how contemporary guidance signals "many strategies" to ensure the language mirrors the field. Authoritative statements emphasize coordinated, evidence‑based approaches including antiracism efforts, accurate measurement and self‑measured BP monitoring with clinical support, team‑based and task‑shared care, standardized treatment protocols, medication‑adherence enhancement, continuous quality improvement, financial and policy levers, and digital/community interventions, all aimed at population‑level impact and equity [^1168AaNe] [^116i6ee9] [^117SSzV3] [^113nkK21] [^114QUYCa].

> I will now draft candidate opening sentences that explicitly convey multiplicity while remaining faithful to the advisory's scope. Candidate 1 is: "Achieving national blood‑pressure control goals requires a multifaceted portfolio of evidence‑based strategies — including antiracism efforts, team‑based care, self‑measured BP monitoring, medication‑adherence enhancement, and system‑level quality‑improvement programs — that, when implemented together, can substantially improve hypertension outcomes at the population level" [^1168AaNe] [^116i6ee9] [^117SSzV3] [^111MdGgG]. Candidate 2 is: "A suite of complementary, evidence‑based strategies — spanning clinical algorithms, team‑based care, digital health tools, and community‑based interventions — is essential to close the gap between hypertension guidelines and real‑world BP control across diverse populations" [^1168AaNe] [^111MdGgG]. Candidate 3 is: "Translating hypertension guidelines into population‑level BP control demands multiple, coordinated implementation strategies that address patient, provider, and system barriers, such as self‑monitoring, adherence support, standardized protocols, and equity‑focused efforts" [^1168AaNe] [^117SSzV3] [^111MdGgG].

> Hold on, I should verify the paragraph's precise intent before locking in a choice. At first, I thought the paragraph's main job was to enumerate every strategy, but wait, that would overshoot its descriptive purpose, which is to introduce the value and use of standardized algorithms within a system‑level framework while cueing the reader that algorithms are one part of a broader implementation armamentarium; therefore the opener should clearly signal multiplicity without becoming an exhaustive list [^114mB11i] [^111MdGgG].

> Let me reconsider and select the candidate that best matches that balance. Candidate 1 most effectively signals a multifaceted, coordinated set of evidence‑based approaches, names representative categories aligned with contemporary guidance, and links them explicitly to population‑level BP control, which mirrors the advisory's system orientation and sets up the detailed discussion of algorithms that follows [^1168AaNe] [^111MdGgG].

> Final recommended opening sentence for replacement is: "Achieving national blood‑pressure control goals requires a multifaceted portfolio of evidence‑based strategies — including antiracism efforts, team‑based care, self‑measured BP monitoring, medication‑adherence enhancement, and system‑level quality‑improvement programs — that, when implemented together, can substantially improve hypertension outcomes at the population level" [^1168AaNe] [^116i6ee9] [^117SSzV3] [^111MdGgG] [^113dKNdr].

> If brevity is needed, a concise alternative that still signals plurality and scope is: "A suite of complementary, evidence‑based strategies — spanning standardized clinical algorithms, team‑based care, and community‑enabled supports — is essential to close the gap between hypertension guidelines and population BP control" [^1168AaNe] [^111MdGgG].

---

A better opening sentence is: "Multiple evidence-based strategies are available to improve blood pressure control in clinical practice". This sentence clearly signals the paragraph's focus on practical interventions and introduces subsequent details on team-based care [^1168AaNe], self-measured blood pressure monitoring [^116i6ee9], standardized protocols [^114mB11i], and adherence support [^117SSzV3].

---

### Alternative first sentences

Several alternatives could effectively introduce the paragraph's focus:

- "A variety of evidence-based strategies have been developed to improve blood pressure control in clinical practice".
- "Numerous practical interventions exist to enhance blood pressure control among patients with hypertension".
- "Multiple evidence-based strategies are available to improve blood pressure control in clinical practice".
- "A range of evidence-based interventions can help clinicians achieve better blood pressure control in their patients".

---

### Rationale for the recommended sentence

The recommended sentence, "Multiple evidence-based strategies are available to improve blood pressure control in clinical practice", is **concise and directly communicates the paragraph's focus**. It signals that the paragraph will discuss practical, evidence-based interventions for improving blood pressure control. It also aligns with the subsequent content, which details strategies such as team-based care [^116zBE8n], self-measured blood pressure monitoring [^114H7YKT], standardized treatment protocols [^111MdGgG], and medication adherence support [^117SSzV3].

---

### Conclusion

The recommended first sentence, "Multiple evidence-based strategies are available to improve blood pressure control in clinical practice", effectively introduces the paragraph's focus on practical, **evidence-based interventions**. It clearly signals the main topic and aligns with the subsequent content, making it a suitable replacement for the original opening [^112DXjG1].

### Implementation strategies to improve blood pressure control in the United States: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association and American Medical Association [^1168AaNe]. Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension is one of the most important risk factors that contribute to incident cardiovascular events. A multitude of US and international hypertension guidelines, scientific statements, and policy statements have recommended evidence-based approaches for hypertension management and improved blood pressure (BP) control. These recommendations are based largely on high-quality observational and randomized controlled trial data. However, recent published data demonstrate troubling temporal trends with declining BP control in the United States after decades of steady improvements. Therefore, there is a widening disconnect between what hypertension experts recommend and actual BP control in practice.

This scientific statement provides information on the implementation strategies to optimize hypertension management and to improve BP control among adults in the United States. Key approaches include:

- **Antiracism efforts**: Accurate BP measurement and increased use of self-measured BP monitoring.
- **Team-based care**: Implementation of policies and programs to facilitate lifestyle change, standardized treatment protocols using team-based care.
- **Improvement of medication acceptance and adherence**: Continuous quality improvement, financial strategies, and large-scale dissemination and implementation.

Closing the gap between scientific evidence, expert recommendations, and achieving BP control, particularly among disproportionately affected populations, is urgently needed to improve cardiovascular health.

### Medication adherence and blood pressure control: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^117SSzV3]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

The widespread treatment of hypertension and the resultant improvement in blood pressure have been major contributors to the dramatic age-specific decline in heart disease and stroke. Despite this progress, a persistent gap remains between stated public health targets and achieved blood pressure control rates. Many factors may contribute to the gap between population hypertension control goals and the currently observed control levels. Among them is the extent to which patients adhere to prescribed treatment.

The goal of this scientific statement is to summarize the state of knowledge regarding the contribution of medication nonadherence to the national prevalence of poor blood pressure control, methods for measuring medication adherence and their associated challenges, risk factors for antihypertensive medication nonadherence, and strategies for improving adherence to antihypertensive medications at both the individual and health system levels.

Support self-measured BP monitoring with clinical support: A recent AHA/AMA policy statement emphasizes the clinical and cost-effectiveness of self-measured blood pressure (SMBP) monitoring. Other scientific statements, guidelines, and meta-analyses have stressed the value of SMBP monitoring. The CDC established SMBP monitoring with clinical support as a best practice. The wider use of SMBP monitoring with clinical support may help reverse the worsening trend in hypertension control and link clinical care and communities. SMBP monitoring engages patients in their care and can improve hypertension control when accompanied by patient education, support by community health workers, case management, or pharmacy support. SMBP readings have been shown to be more prognostic of stroke, CVD, and other target organ damage than office-based readings.

Evidence on SMBP monitoring comes predominantly from studies with research personnel interacting with patients. Research has focused on the relative risks of hypertension phenotypes (white coat hypertension and masked hypertension), and less on adherence to hypertension treatment. While there are extensive outcome studies correlating SMBP monitoring with clinical outcomes in White and Asian populations, there are fewer on Black and Hispanic adults.

Wider use of SMBP monitoring may occur because of inclusion in quality measures. The clinical quality measures (e.g. Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set [HEDIS] controlling high BP and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS] controlling high BP) recently began including patients in their metrics.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^117GgAjo]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The ACC/AHA guideline provides 106 formal recommendations, and the ESC/ESH provides 122. In both guidelines, each recommendation is characterized by a class of recommendation that specifies the strength or importance of the recommendation and by a level-of-evidence designation. Both the ESC/ESH and ACC/AHA guideline committees voted on the wording and grading of each recommendation.

Both guidelines offer comprehensive advice for the prevention, diagnosis, evaluation, and management of high BP/hypertension. As a result, the two full reports are relatively long, comprising 103 pages for the ACC/AHA and 84 pages for the ESC/ESH. However, for ease of reading, the documents are divided into sections and subsections that use a similar presentation format. Additionally, a variety of shorter executive summaries and brief synopses have been published.

Guideline authors have published articles that expand on individual guideline topics, provide perspective for the evidence underpinning selected recommendations, and furnish quantitative estimates of potential impact based on universal application of guideline recommendations in their target populations. Lastly, both guidelines are complemented by publicly available slide sets, CVD risk estimation calculators, and other educational tools.

### Trends in prevalence and control of hypertension according to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline [^117QyYgg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Compared with prior guidelines, the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) hypertension guideline recommends lower blood pressure thresholds for defining hypertension, initiating antihypertensive medication, and setting antihypertensive medication treatment goals.

- **Methods and results**: To better understand the potential impacts of the 2017 guideline, we studied trends in mean systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, the prevalence and burden of hypertension, and the proportion of controlled hypertension in the US adult population aged ≥ 20 from 1999 through 2016. We used data from 38,276 adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased from 48.4% in 1999–2000 to 45.4% in 2015–2016. However, the absolute burden of hypertension consistently increased, from 87.0 million in 1999–2000 to 108.2 million in 2015–2016. The age-standardized proportion of controlled hypertension among adults receiving antihypertensive pharmacologic treatment increased from 1999–2000 (25.6%) to 2015–2016 (43.5%). There was not consistent improvement in control throughout the full period among non-Hispanic Blacks, individuals aged ≥ 60, or those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, or high cardiovascular disease risk.

- **Conclusions**: Based on the 2017 guideline, from 1999 to 2016, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased, and the proportion of control among those treated for hypertension improved.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^113GhXGe]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Both guidelines provide recommendations for follow-up intervals. The ACC/AHA CPG suggests reevaluation of adults with normal blood pressure (BP) at 1-year intervals, 3 to 6 months for those treated with nonpharmacological therapy, and 1 month after initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy followed by 3 to 6 months after meeting the BP goal. The ESC/ESH CPG suggests follow-up within the first 2 months after the initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy, with the caveat that the interval should depend on the severity of hypertension and the urgency to achieve BP control. After the desired BP target has been achieved, an interval of a few months is suggested for BP monitoring and 2 years for reassessment of risk factors and evidence of asymptomatic target organ damage. The ESC/ESH CPG recommends achieving BP control within 3 months of initiating therapy, further emphasizing the need to consider initial therapy with combination drugs in most patients to achieve rapid BP control.

Both guidelines provide detailed guidance for the detection and management of secondary hypertension; definition and management of resistant hypertension; hypertensive urgencies and emergencies; masked and white coat hypertension; and hypertension in older adults, men and women, persons of different races/ethnicities, and patients with various comorbidities and conditions, including heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus (DM) and metabolic syndrome, aortic disease, and pregnancy.

Both guidelines focus considerable attention on strategies to improve adherence to therapy, emphasizing the importance of patient education and regular monitoring.

### Poor guideline adherence in a real-world evaluation of hypertensive emergency management [^114C7wyN]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association define hypertensive emergency (HTN-E) as a systolic blood pressure greater than 180 mmHg or a diastolic blood pressure greater than 120 mmHg with evidence of end-organ damage (EOD). Based on expert opinion, guidelines recommend antihypertensive therapy to reduce blood pressure (BP) at specific hourly rates to reduce the progression of EOD, outlined by four criteria. Our goal was to describe compliance with guideline recommendations for early management of HTN-E and to analyze safety outcomes related to pharmacologic intervention.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review including patients presenting to the emergency department with HTN-E between September 2016 and August 2020. We excluded patients with a compelling indication for altered therapeutic goals (e.g. acute aortic dissection, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and pheochromocytoma). The primary outcome was complete adherence with guideline recommendations in the first 24 hours.

- **Results**: Of 758 screened records, 402 were included. The mean age was 54 years, and the majority were Black (72%). Overall, total adherence was poor (< 1%): 30% received intravenous therapy within 1 hour, 64% achieved 1-hour BP goals, 44% achieved 6-hour goals, and 9% had appropriate 24-hour maintenance BP. Hypotensive events (N = 67) were common, and antihypertensive-associated EOD (N = 21) did occur. Predictors of hypotension include treatment within 1 hour and management with continuous infusion medication.

- **Conclusions**: Practice is poorly compliant with guideline criteria.

### An effective approach to high blood pressure control: A science advisory from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [^117DY37K]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

As described previously, despite the strong evidence and consensus regarding the treatment and control of high blood pressure, as well as the availability of many different therapeutic options, achieving success in hypertension control at both the individual patient level and, even more importantly, the population level, has remained a major challenge nationally.

Although there is no single explanation for the poor hypertension control seen in many patient subgroups, the fragmentation of health care for many patients and the lack of consistent implementation of system-level solutions in clinical practice and healthcare delivery systems appear to be important contributors. Efforts focused primarily on educating patients and providers about hypertension and the benefits of its treatment have not been sufficient in bringing hypertension under control. Similarly, interventions targeting only physicians have not led to consistent and meaningful improvements on a large scale. However, there are examples of substantial success that could be emulated and scaled with a high likelihood of important benefit.

To reduce the prevalence of hypertension in the United States, system-level approaches will be needed. Successful examples from other medical areas where a system-level approach has been taken include reducing medical errors and improving patient safety in the hospital setting and improving the inpatient treatment and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^1111P6p8]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Despite assertions to the contrary, there is greater congruity between the 2017 ACC/AHA and 2018 ESC/ESH clinical practice guidelines than previous blood pressure guidelines on each side of the Atlantic. Additional harmonization of the two guidelines in the future would be helpful. Ways to achieve this goal could include processes that better approximate each other, liaison membership from each writing committee to the other, and temporal synchronization of guideline preparation allowing ongoing communication between writing committees.

- **Structured open discussion**: Discussion of the science underpinning recommendations by the writing committees and sharing systematic reviews related to key questions. Peer review of each report by members of the other guideline writing committee, and joint presentations/publications to compare the ACC/AHA and the ESC/ESH recommendations and to place them in the context of the populations and practice communities for which they are being written.

Much of this is already happening to some extent, but it is informal and would likely benefit from a more structured approach. The ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH guidelines have a common purpose of assisting clinicians, the public health community, and the public in achieving the goal of better health. Rates of treatment and control of hypertension, however defined, remain suboptimal in Europe and the United States. The more convergent the major American and European guideline recommendations are with each other, the more unified the message to patients, clinicians, professional societies, and government bodies.

### Advancing equity in blood pressure control: A response to the Surgeon General's call-to-action [^113dKNdr]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Hypertension is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although controlling blood pressure reduces cardiovascular and stroke mortality and target organ damage, poor blood pressure control remains a clinical and public health challenge. Furthermore, racial and ethnic disparities in the outcomes of hypertension are well documented.

In October of 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published "The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension". The Call to Action emphasized, among other priorities, the need to eliminate disparities in the treatment and control of high blood pressure and to address social determinants as root causes of inequities in blood pressure control and treatment.

To support the goals set in the Call to Action, this review summarizes contemporary research on racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities in hypertension and blood pressure control. It describes interventions and policies that have improved blood pressure control in minoritized populations by addressing the social determinants of health, and proposes next steps for achieving equity in hypertension and blood pressure control.

### Differences in patient and physician perspectives on pharmaceutical therapy and renal denervation for the management of hypertension [^1154Ljxh]. Journal of Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

Hypertension remains the major preventable cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause death globally, and substantial evidence supports the reduction of adverse clinical outcomes through the implementation of both nonpharmacological and pharmacological antihypertensive strategies. Despite the availability of these approaches, the prevalence of blood pressure (BP) control according to societal guidelines remains less than 50% in both economically advanced and developing countries.

Successful treatment of hypertension in contemporary practice faces several barriers: poor adherence to treatment regimens, physician inertia, and insufficient use of combination therapies, among others. In particular, nonadherence is a complex phenomenon involving pill burden, patient reluctance to depend on lifelong medical therapy, experiencing adverse events or drug side effects, and biased perception of the benefit/risk ratio for drugs.

In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the potential to reduce BP through device-based approaches, such as renal denervation. This may be an attractive and effective option for patients with hypertension who cannot achieve control with other treatment methods, have elevated cardiovascular risk, and/or whose adherence is challenged by medication intolerance or other factors.

The importance of a patient-provider shared decision-making process in healthcare is becoming widely recognized. Patient preference examines how patients evaluate treatment decisions and how treatment attributes may influence that decision.

### American Society of Hypertension regional chapters: Leveraging the impact of the clinical hypertension specialist in the local community [^116Qvmp3]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Hypertension control has remained at 24% to 27% for the past decade, despite the revision of national treatment guidelines, expansion of therapeutic options, and evidence from clinical trials indicating that higher control rates are attainable. Uncontrolled hypertension contributes significantly to the health and economic burden imposed by cardiovascular and renal disease. The risk of hypertension-related complications is increasing in the United States due to rising comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and congestive heart failure in a population that is becoming progressively older, more obese, and more ethnically diverse.

Given the regional variations in demographic characteristics and disease burdens, implementing evidence-based guidelines will be more effective if tailored appropriately to the local community. The Clinical Hypertension Specialist program is a positive response to an impending health care crisis. The impact of the Hypertension Specialist on blood pressure control can be leveraged by extending the academic mission of education, patient care, and health services research to the local community.

The American Society of Hypertension regional chapter can serve as a forum for Clinical Hypertension Specialists from academic medicine and the community to define mutual goals, develop an action plan that is responsive to community needs, and monitor progress. With support from the chapter, Clinical Hypertension Specialists in the community can influence local medical practice by contributing to the education of primary care providers and receiving referrals of patients with complex hypertension cases.

### Hypertension pharmacological treatment in adults: A World Health Organization guideline executive summary [^114Gufds]. Hypertension (2022). High credibility.

Prevailing concepts about blood pressure (BP) have changed dramatically over time. Results of the Framingham Heart Study and many other cohort studies have shifted the emphasis from diastolic blood pressure (DBP) to systolic blood pressure (SBP) by demonstrating that SBP was a more important predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk compared with DBP. In addition, almost all the recent landmark clinical trials have employed SBP rather than DBP as an inclusion criterion and for the trial BP treatment goals. U.S. guidelines recommend an intensive BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg without mentioning the lower limits of diastolic BP. A recent cohort study found that lowering diastolic BP to < 60 mm Hg was associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with high cardiovascular risk and a treated SBP < 130 mm Hg.

The finding that a diastolic BP value between 70 and 80 mm Hg was an optimum target for this patient population merits further study; the results in this DBP group should be interpreted with caution, and these results may not apply to the general population. Since most recent clinical trials/studies use SBP to initiate treatment as well as a treatment goal, the guideline development group (GDG) felt it was appropriate to use SBP in the recommendation.

Intensive treatment for selected patients adds complexity for health workers; emphasis on team-based care in low-resource settings means that simple, protocolized care is needed. Intensive treatment for some patients complicates treatment protocols and may lead to decisional overload, especially for health workers with more limited training and/or autonomy. On the other hand, strict BP targets in the general population could contribute positively to overall health outcomes.

### Interventions used to improve control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension [^113nkK21]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) in the community frequently fail to meet treatment goals, a condition labeled as "uncontrolled" hypertension. The optimal way to organize and deliver care to patients with hypertension to achieve treatment goals has not been clearly identified.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve the control of blood pressure in patients with elevated blood pressure and to evaluate the ability of reminders to enhance the follow-up of these patients.

- **Search strategy**: An all-language search of articles from any year in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), Medline, and Embase from June 2000 was conducted.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with hypertension that evaluated the following interventions were included:
	1. Self-monitoring
	2. Educational interventions directed to the patient
	3. Educational interventions directed to the health professional
	4. Health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care
	5. Organisational interventions aimed at improving the delivery of care
	6. Appointment reminder systems

	- **Outcomes assessed were**: (1) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, (2) control of blood pressure, and (3) proportion of patients followed up at the clinic.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.

- **Main results**: Fifty-nine RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed.

### Overcoming barriers to developing and implementing novel therapies for hypertension [^111mwGDC]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension is the single most important modifiable risk factor for preventable disability and death worldwide and disproportionately affects socially disadvantaged populations. We face a paradox: blood pressure control is low, and recent trends suggest it is even declining, despite the availability of inexpensive and effective therapies.

A variety of barriers on the system, patient, and healthcare provider sides hinder effective drug-based risk factor management. Clinical inertia represents a major barrier on the clinician side, as well as workload and limited education. Common barriers on the patient side include limited English proficiency, low health literacy, and nonadherence with misaligned incentives, limited resources, lack of structured clinical pathways, and reimbursement issues.

New innovations in the field of RNA-targeted therapies and device-based interventions could prevent and potentially even cure diseases previously designated as chronic health conditions, such as hypertension. Such novel therapies could potentially overcome several major barriers to effective treatment, including nonadherence.

Drug development of novel long-acting treatments requires consideration of specific clinical trial design aspects, including safety collection, benefit-risk assessment, development and assessment of novel qualitative surrogate endpoints, such as time-in-therapeutic range, the use of representative trial settings, and the definition of standard of care in placebo-controlled trials, which should be of reasonably high quality, allowing for credible evaluation.

### Therapeutic perspectives in hypertension: novel means for renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulation and emerging device-based approaches [^11599yQN]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Despite recent and substantial advances in the treatment of hypertension, the majority of patients still remain not optimally controlled, highlighting the need for innovative strategies to lower blood pressure (BP). The BP target values are fairly aggressive, often requiring the addition of a fourth or fifth agent. This challenges even the most skilled physician and reduces drug compliance among a large proportion of patients.

Any innovation in antihypertensive therapy is generally judged on several criteria:

- **Capability to improve BP control**: Innovations must enhance the management of BP.

- **Effectiveness in treatment-resistant hypertension**: Strategies should be assessed for their ability to treat resistant hypertension.

- **Potential for further risk reduction**: Innovations should aim for risk reduction beyond BP control, impacting associated functional, metabolic, and structural alterations.

While there is significant debate on the issue, emphasis tends to fall on tight BP control rather than specific treatments. Novel approaches to hypertension treatment include:

- **Drug-based strategies**: These target traditional pathways, such as the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), or less-studied neurohumoral pathways, like endothelin or renalase.

- **Unique approaches**: Involves gene and vaccine therapies.

- **Device-based therapies**: Such as baroreceptor sensitization or renal nerve ablation.

We provide an overview of various therapies in development and outline prospects for how and which of them might impact clinical care.

### Report of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Working Group on Hypertension: Barriers to translation [^112iuCxD]. Hypertension (2020). High credibility.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened a multidisciplinary working group of hypertension researchers on December 6–7, 2018, in Bethesda, MD, to share scientific knowledge in hypertension and to identify barriers to the translation of basic into clinical science/trials and the implementation of clinical science into the clinical care of patients with hypertension. The goals of the working group were as follows:

- **To provide an overview of recent discoveries**: These may be ready for testing in preclinical and clinical studies.
- **To identify gaps in knowledge**: These gaps impede translation.
- **To highlight the most promising scientific areas**: Areas in which to pursue translation are identified.
- **To identify key challenges and barriers**: These barriers hinder the movement of basic science discoveries into translation, clinical studies, and trials.
- **To identify roadblocks for effective dissemination**: These affect the implementation of basic and clinical science in real-world settings.

The working group addressed issues that were responsive to many of the objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Strategic Vision. They identified major barriers and opportunities for translating research to improve the control of hypertension. This review summarizes the discussion and recommendations of the working group.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^116YbHH7]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertension, specifically in the context of multidisciplinary care, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the use of physician-patient web communications in primary care. This includes reporting on home blood pressure readings.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^111VK83n]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, were developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the two guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach. Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the two guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help to underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension worldwide.

### Hypertension treatment in Blacks: Discussion of the U.S. clinical practice guidelines [^116PzcJx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Blacks are especially susceptible to hypertension (HTN) and its associated organ damage, leading to adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal outcomes. Accordingly, HTN is particularly significant in contributing to the black-white racial differences in health outcomes in the U.S. In order to address these health disparities, practical clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on how to treat HTN specifically in Blacks are needed.

This review article is a timely addition to the literature because the most recent U.S. CPG more explicitly emphasizes race in the algorithmic management of HTN. However, recent clinical research cautions against using race as a proxy to determine therapeutic response to pharmaceutical agents, as it may be erroneous. This review will address the implications of the use of race in the hypertension CPGs.

- **Rationale behind the introduction of race**: We will review the rationale and the level of evidence available to justify the introduction of race into the U.S. CPG.

- **Practical considerations**: Finally, we will conclude with practical considerations in the treatment of HTN in Blacks.

### The team education and adherence monitoring (TEAM) trial: Pharmacy interventions to improve hypertension control in blacks [^111VPrAp]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Recent studies suggest that involving pharmacists is an effective strategy for improving patient adherence and blood pressure (BP) control. At the time of writing, few controlled studies have tested the cost-effectiveness of specific models for improving patient adherence and BP control in community pharmacies, where most Americans obtain prescriptions. We hypothesized that a team model of adherence monitoring and intervention in corporately owned community pharmacies can improve patient adherence, prescribing, and BP control among hypertensive black patients.

The Team Education and Adherence Monitoring (TEAM) Trial is a randomized controlled trial testing a multistep intervention for improving adherence monitoring and intervention in 28 corporately owned community pharmacies. Patients in the 14 control pharmacies received "usual care", and patients in the 14 intervention pharmacies received TEAM Care by trained pharmacists and pharmacy technicians working with patients and physicians. Data collectors screened 1250 patients and enrolled 597 hypertensive black patients.

- **Primary end points**: The proportion of patients achieving BP control and reductions in systolic and diastolic BP measured after 6 and 12 months.

- **Secondary end points**: Changes in adherence monitoring and intervention, patient adherence and barriers to adherence, prescribing, and cost-effectiveness. Researchers also will examine potential covariates and barriers to change.

Involving pharmacists is a potentially powerful means of improving BP control in blacks. Pharmacists are in an excellent position to monitor patient adherence and intervene effectively.

### Research gaps in primary pediatric hypertension [^117G4MpX]. Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertension affects over 40% of the US population and is a major contributor to cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality. Although less common among children and adolescents, hypertension affects 1% to 5% of all youth. The 2017 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Diagnosis and Management of High Blood Pressure in Children and Adolescents provided updates and strategies regarding the diagnosis and management of hypertension in youth. Despite this important information, many gaps in knowledge remain, such as the etiology, prevalence, and trends of hypertension; the utility and practicality of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; practical goals for lifestyle modification that are generalizable; the long-term end-organ impacts of hypertension in youth; and the long-term safety and efficacy of antihypertensive therapy in youth.

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the US Food and Drug Administration, sponsored a workshop of experts to discuss the state of childhood primary hypertension. We highlight the results of that workshop and aim to:

- **Provide an overview of practices**: Related to the diagnosis, management, and treatment of primary pediatric hypertension.
- **Identify related research gaps**: Highlight and discuss existing gaps in current research.
- **Propose ways to address existing research gaps**: Suggest methodologies and strategies to bridge the existing divides in knowledge.

The "big ideas" to improve hypertension control in the United States summarize potential solutions for reversing the worsening trend in hypertension control. Best practices and promising options that may be used to overcome barriers to hypertension control across diverse communities are discussed. Some options may rely on forming new partnerships within and outside the traditional clinical environment. Engaging new partners may be necessary to maximize impact.

### Target: BP™: A national initiative to improve blood pressure control [^112DXjG1]. Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

In 2015, the AHA and the American Medical Association (AMA) brought together shared goals, complementary resources, and expertise to help focus the Nation's attention on improving BP control among US adults. In 2017, that collaboration launched Target: BP™, a national initiative offering quality improvement (QI) tools and resources to HCOs and care teams, with no user fees, to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and management of hypertension and recognize HCOs committed to prioritizing and reporting BP control rates.

- **Engaging the primary audience**: The primary audience for Target: BP™ is health care professionals and care teams who manage patients with hypertension, focusing mostly on primary care and some specialty providers and practices. To engage in Target: BP™, HCOs register to participate and can submit their aggregate BP control rate data based on CMS 165 through a self-service data platform, enabling them to track annual progress, benchmark against peer groups, and receive national recognition. Participating HCOs receive monthly newsletters, access to free continuing medical education/continuing education credit opportunities, and QI tools translating the latest evidence into practice. Although there are no user fees associated with the Target: BP™ initiative, HCO costs to champion and lead QI efforts, use initiative tools and resources, and participate in the annual recognition program depend on the unique engagement and cost structure of each HCO. Among actively engaged HCOs who submitted recognition data in 2022, 44% are Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs).

### Women, hypertension, and the systolic blood pressure intervention trial [^116hwxo2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension accounts for approximately 1 in 5 deaths in American women and is a major contributor to many comorbid conditions. Although blood pressure lowering reduces cardiovascular disease outcomes, considerable uncertainty remains on the best management in women. Specifically, female blood pressure treatment goals have not been established, particularly among older and African American and Hispanic women, for whom hypertension prevalence, related adverse outcomes, and poor control rates are high. The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) planned to clarify optimal blood pressure management in both sexes. Although the trial confirmed that a lower blood pressure goal is generally better, female enrollment and event rates were low and follow-up periods were shortened, leading to outcomes differences in women that were not statistically significant. Thus, optimal blood pressure goals for women have not been established with the highest evidence. This review addresses SPRINT's significance and key remaining knowledge gaps in optimal blood pressure management to improve women's health.

### Blood pressure and the new ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines [^115GPRbD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines comprehensively address the diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring, secondary causes, and treatment — both pharmacological and non-pharmacological — of hypertension. Significant emphasis is placed on strategies necessary for accurate blood pressure measurement in any setting where valid readings are required. Common errors during measurement often lead to upward bias, resulting in the over-diagnosis of hypertension and, among those on medication, an underestimation of blood pressure reduction, leading to overtreatment. Hypertension is diagnosed with consistent readings of ≥ 130 and/or ≥ 80 mm Hg. However, most patients with blood pressure between 130–139/80–89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) do not qualify for immediate medication.

- **New recommendations**: The guidelines innovate by incorporating absolute cardiovascular risk to assess high-risk status for stage 1 hypertension, 130–139/80–89 mm Hg, especially if high-risk characteristics such as age 65 or older, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or known cardiovascular disease are absent. High-risk individuals start medication when blood pressure is ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, with an exception for secondary stroke prevention in drug-naïve individuals, where therapy begins at ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. Low-risk individuals initiate medication at ≥ 140/90 mm Hg.

### New concepts in hypertension management: A population-based perspective [^11359wcp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension (HTN) is the most common chronic disease in the US, and the standard model of office-based care delivery has yielded suboptimal outcomes, with approximately 50% of affected patients not achieving blood pressure (BP) control. Poor population-level BP control has been primarily attributed to therapeutic inertia and low patient engagement. New models of care delivery utilizing patient-generated health data, comprehensive assessment of social health determinants, computerized algorithms generating tailored interventions, frequent communication and reporting, and non-physician providers organized as an integrated practice unit, have the potential to transform population-based HTN control. This review highlights the importance of these elements and constructs the rationale for a reengineered model of care delivery for populations with HTN.

### Hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa: Burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^115Fpfi5]. Circulation Research (2025). Low credibility.

- **Addressing the barriers: Practice and policy approaches**: In the following, we discuss various practice and policy approaches to address the hypertension burden in SSA. These strategies encompass both preventive and clinical measures, each of which should be carefully considered.

- **Preventative**: The high prevalence of hypertension underscores the need for a coordinated, multisectoral approach to comprehensive noncommunicable disease prevention and control programs. Currently, population-wide strategies for preventing hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases are insufficient. Many existing programs in SSA remain predominantly clinical rather than preventative, and where preventative initiatives do exist, they are often limited to a few municipalities rather than being implemented on a broader, population-wide scale. Without such intervention, the region's under-resourced health systems are likely to face a significant burden of complications from target organ damage, including stroke, ischemic heart disease, and chronic kidney disease. These complications often affect the most productive age groups, leading to greater economic burden to individuals, their families and national economies, and premature mortality. A strategy developed using a participatory approach and reaching all sectors of society is urgently needed. A coordinated multipronged prevention program addressing three main areas should be considered:

	- **Health and nutrition education and promotion**: These programs have been shown to be effective in reducing the burden of noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension.

### Gender differences in hypertension [^117JAuAi]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to discuss the sex/gender differences in blood pressure control, focusing on hypertension awareness, prevalence, and treatment. It examines the new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines and recent discoveries in animal models and humans regarding the mechanisms responsible for these differences.

Recent findings indicate that hypertension awareness is greater in women than men. The prevalence of hypertension is higher in men than women until after menopause, despite the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommending similar treatment for both genders. In practice, treatments differ. New studies explore the mechanisms responsible for sex/gender differences in hypertension, including the roles of the kidneys, the renin-angiotensin system, relaxin, and developmental programming.

Specific guidelines for hypertension treatment in men and women have yet to be developed. However, numerous animal and human studies have demonstrated differences in the mechanisms responsible for blood pressure control between the sexes. More research into these sex/gender differences is needed to determine the best treatment options to reduce the risk of hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular diseases in both genders.

Regarding the medical management of hypertension, specifically in the choice of antihypertensives for subsequent therapy, the JNC 8 2014 guidelines recommend considering the addition of antihypertensive drugs from other classes. This approach is advised if the goal blood pressure cannot be reached using only the initially selected drugs, either due to contraindications or the necessity of employing more than three drugs to achieve the target blood pressure.

### Interventions used to improve control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension [^112uFQnH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

It is well recognized that patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) in the community frequently fail to meet treatment goals — a condition labeled as "uncontrolled" hypertension. The optimal way to organize and deliver care to patients with hypertension, so they reach treatment goals, has not been clearly identified.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve control of blood pressure in patients with hypertension and to evaluate the effectiveness of reminders on improving the follow-up of patients with hypertension.

- **Search strategy**: An all-language search of all articles (any year) in the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (CCTR), Medline, and Embase from June 2000.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patients with hypertension that evaluated the following interventions: (1) self-monitoring; (2) educational interventions directed to the patient; (3) educational interventions directed to the health professional; (4) health professional (nurse or pharmacist) led care; (5) organizational interventions that aimed to improve the delivery of care; (6) appointment reminder systems. Outcomes assessed were: (1) mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure; (2) control of blood pressure; (3) proportion of patients followed up at clinic.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors extracted data independently and in duplicate and assessed each study according to the criteria outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook.

- **Main results**: Fifty-six RCTs met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed.

### Hypertension in sub-Saharan Africa: Burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116FTHSg]. Circulation Research (2025). Low credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program, which included a patient population that was 65% Black, utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%.

### US trends in premature heart disease mortality over the past 50 years: Where do we go from here [^114TNLs5]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical interventions

- **Standardized treatment protocol adoption**: Studies have suggested that younger adults are less likely than older adults to have their hypertension diagnosed and treated or to use statins as recommended, and are more likely to use combustible tobacco products. Moreover, studies suggest that siblings and children of people with premature coronary heart disease are not routinely screened for risk factors, provided therapeutic treatment, or recommended lifestyle modifications, even with their increased risk. Clinicians and their patients, especially younger adults, may hesitate to start a medication regimen that could be life-long, despite a strong indication to do so. A systems-approach to care, using protocols, teams, and timely data, is useful in overcoming these barriers and protecting this group from largely preventable HD events. Treatment protocols can help systematically identify all patients who are eligible for clinical management, reduce unwarranted variation, simplify medication initiation and intensification, reinforce lifestyle counseling, routinize timely patient follow up, and enable all members of the clinical team to contribute to patient management. Healthcare systems that have improved their performance on chronic disease indicators, including hypertension control, often attribute their success, in part, to protocol implementation.

### A systems-level approach to improving medication adherence in hypertensive Latinos: A randomized control trial [^1138AEfN]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Despite numerous interventions targeting medication adherence in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, practice-based trials in Latino patients are scant.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effect of a systems-level adherence intervention, delivered by medical assistants (MAs), versus a comparison condition on medication adherence and blood pressure (BP) in 119 hypertensive Latino patients who were initially non-adherent to their antihypertensive medications.

- **Study design**: Randomized control trial.

- **Participants**: Patients (50% women; mean age, 61 years) were recruited from April 2013 to August 2015 in a community-based practice in New York.

- **Intervention**: Systems-level approach that included an office system component built into the electronic health record and a provider support component consisting of nine MA-delivered health coaching sessions for improving medication adherence. The comparison group received the standard health coaching procedures followed at the clinic.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was rate of medication adherence measured by an electronic monitoring device (EMD) across 6 months. The secondary outcomes were self-reported medication adherence measured by the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and BP reduction from baseline to 6 months.

- **Key results**: Adherence as measured by EMD worsened for both groups (p = 0.04) with no between-group difference (-9.6% intervention and -6.6% control, p = 0.66). While systolic BP improved in both groups, the difference between groups was not significant (-6 mmHg in intervention).

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^115PhMLy]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension clinical practice guidelines for management of high blood pressure/hypertension are influential documents. Both guidelines are comprehensive, developed using rigorous processes, and underwent extensive peer review. The most notable difference between the two guidelines is the blood pressure cut points recommended for the diagnosis of hypertension. There are also differences in the timing and intensity of treatment, with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommending a somewhat more intensive approach.

Overall, there is substantial concordance in the recommendations provided by the two guideline-writing committees, with greater congruity between them than their predecessors. Additional harmonization of future guidelines would help underscore the commonality of their core recommendations and could serve to catalyze changes in practice that would lead to improved prevention, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension worldwide.

### Guideline-driven management of hypertension: An evidence-based update [^114ugJqL]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Several important findings bearing on the prevention, detection, and management of hypertension have been reported since the publication of the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Guideline. This review summarizes and places in context the results of relevant observational studies, randomized clinical trials, and meta-analyses published between January 2018 and March 2021.

- **Blood pressure measurement**: Topics include patient evaluation for secondary hypertension, cardiovascular disease risk assessment, and blood pressure threshold for drug therapy.

- **Lifestyle and pharmacological management**: Discussion on treatment target blood pressure goal; management of hypertension in older adults, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and resistant hypertension.

- **Optimization of care**: Strategies using patient, provider, and health system approaches.

Presenting new information in each of these areas has the potential to increase hypertension awareness, treatment, and control, which remain essential for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality in the future.

### Design and rationale of the home blood pressure telemonitoring linked with community health workers to improve blood pressure (LINKED-BP) program [^114H7YKT]. American Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Hypertension disproportionately affects persons who are medically underserved in the United States and is a major contributor to racial disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes. In 2017–2018, Black adults (54%) had the highest hypertension prevalence compared to White (44%), Asian (39%), and Hispanic (36%) adults. Persons with lower incomes also have a higher burden of hypertension. To mitigate the risk of progression to advanced hypertension stages, it is critical and urgent to implement effective prevention strategies targeting early stages of hypertension in these populations. Presently, only a few implementation trials have direct interventions towards individuals with elevated blood pressure (BP) or untreated stage 1 hypertension. About one-quarter of U.S. adults who do not take antihypertensives either have elevated BP or untreated stage 1 hypertension, further underscoring the critical importance of this area of inquiry.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is both clinically and cost-effective; however, its impact on hypertension disparities is unclear. HBPM readings have higher prognostic value for stroke, CVD, and target organ damage than office-based readings. The American Heart Association (AHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA) recommend HBPM plus co-interventions such as team-based care, regular support from trained clinicians, lifestyle counseling, and patient education to reduce BP and achieve BP control.

Engaging community health workers (CHWs) to deliver targeted interventions constitutes a culturally sensitive and effective approach.

### Management of arterial hypertension: Challenges and opportunities [^1123KUw4]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Systemic arterial hypertension (HTN) remains the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years and death globally. It affects over one billion adults worldwide, and 10% of global healthcare spending is directly related to HTN and its complications. Over the past 20 years, progress in HTN awareness, treatment, and control rates has plateaued or even deteriorated, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.

Improvement of HTN management in these countries faces significant resource constraints, governance difficulties, lack of funding, and poor prioritization due to competing priorities such as infectious diseases and maternal and child health. Given the burden of HTN, enhancing its detection, management, and control should be a high priority. The World Heart Federation (WHF) has developed a roadmap for HTN, advising on health system policies and clinical practices as part of its commitment to improving global cardiovascular health.

In this paper, we will briefly discuss some barriers and their potential solutions to improve the prevention, detection, and management of HTN.

Hypertension (2018). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertension, specifically with respect to adjuncts to controlling hypertension, the 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of performance measures in combination with other quality improvement strategies. These strategies should be applied at patient, provider, and system-based levels to facilitate optimal hypertension control.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease [^112M8ivC]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recently, a group of primary care practices in the United States developed an algorithm for identifying patients at risk of hypertension from their electronic records. The innovation was successful and has now been implemented in these practices. It is easy to see how this type of innovation could be used in calculating rescreening intervals for patients and also follow-up times after BP treatment intensification.

### Harmonization of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension blood pressure/hypertension guidelines [^115syZP7]. European Heart Journal (2022). High credibility.

Both the ACC/AHA and ESC/ESH recommend lower blood pressure (BP) treatment targets compared to the goals advised in previous guidelines. The ACC/AHA recommends a systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) of < 130/80 mm Hg as a general treatment target if tolerated. For older adults (≥ 65 years), who are noninstitutionalized, ambulatory, and community dwelling, the target is SBP < 130 mm Hg if tolerated. For older adults with a high burden of comorbidity and limited life expectancy, treatment decisions should be based on clinical judgment, patient preference, and a team-based assessment of risk/benefit.

The ESC/ESH recommends target ranges but recognizes that the optimal and tolerated targets for individuals will differ. The initial SBP/DBP target is < 140/90 mm Hg for all adults with hypertension. Provided the treatment is well tolerated, targeting to 130/80 mm Hg is recommended, with subsequent efforts to achieve a lower BP in individuals aged 18 to 65 years. An exception to the general rule is that the SBP target in adults with hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) should be < 140 to 130 mm Hg.

The ESC/ESH advises against specifically targeting an SBP < 120 mm Hg for adults but acknowledges that this may be achieved in some treated patients without adverse effects. A key emphasis, especially in older and frailer patients, is to tailor the treatment to achieve the best BP possible within the target range while monitoring for adverse effects. The optimal DBP target is defined as 70 to 79 mm Hg for all patients. However, the emphasis is on controlling SBP, even when DBP is below these levels, provided the treatment is well tolerated.

### Implications of new hypertension guidelines in the United States [^111rdtVJ]. Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

The American Heart Association released a scientific statement in 2007 based on available clinical trials and expert opinion for the treatment of hypertension to prevent coronary artery disease. These guidelines recommend more aggressive control of blood pressure (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) among individuals at high risk for coronary artery disease, such as those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, coronary artery disease or its risk equivalent, or a 10-year Framingham risk score ≥ 10%.

Based on newer clinical trial data, the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (AHA) hypertension guidelines for the elderly recommend a less aggressive approach of maintaining BP < 145/90 mm Hg in those over the age of 80 years. We estimated the burden of uncontrolled BP among those at increased risk of coronary artery disease using both the 2007 AHA and the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2008 participants, comprising 10,198 adults aged 18 to 85 years.

Using the 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA hypertension guidelines (≥ 140/90 mm Hg), it was found that 72 million Americans (35%) have hypertension. Utilizing the 2007 AHA guidelines, an additional 7 million American adults (5%) have elevated BP requiring treatment, totaling 79 million adults (40%). Although individuals at a higher risk for coronary artery disease are more likely to be aware of their hypertension and to be taking antihypertensive medication, the burden of uncontrolled hypertension remains significant.

### Optimizing observer performance of clinic blood pressure measurement: A position statement from the Lancet Commission on Hypertension Group [^1118MqK8]. Journal of Hypertension (2019). High credibility.

High blood pressure (BP) is the leading modifiable risk factor for death and disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 1.4 billion adults and leading to over 10 million deaths per year. It is a primary contributor to heart disease, stroke, and chronic kidney disease, significantly impacting healthcare costs. With an overall global adult prevalence of 31%, high BP is prevalent in all major regions. However, low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs) bear the highest burden, with over one billion individuals affected and lower awareness, treatment, and control levels compared to high-income countries. Efforts to improve hypertension diagnosis, prevention, treatment, and control globally must include tailored interventions that reduce regional disparities.

Accurate and reliable BP measurement is crucial for the proper diagnosis and management of hypertension. On a population-wide level, a 5-mmHg difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) corresponds to an estimated 6% absolute and 30% relative change in hypertension prevalence. An error of 5-mmHg in BP measurement could lead to the incorrect classification of hypertension status in 84 million individuals worldwide, highlighting the profound ramifications of inaccurate measurement globally.

Blood pressure is a physiological parameter that changes constantly in response to endogenous factors and external stimuli.

### Thirty-five years of the European Society of Hypertension: from past to future [^114a4kHy]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

Historically, essential hypertension represents one of the first clinical conditions for which diagnostic and therapeutic clinical guidelines have been developed. The first official guideline paper dates back to 1977 when the Joint National Committee in the United States released the document, which was revised a few years later in a new paper jointly issued by an 'ad hoc' committee of the WHO in conjunction with the International Society of Hypertension (ISH). During the last decade of the 20th century, updated versions of the guidelines document were prepared by the previously mentioned organizations in collaboration with American scientific societies.

The first guideline document prepared by European societies dates back to 2003, when the ESH and the European Society of Cardiology jointly signed the European guidelines document. New guidelines followed in 2007, 2013, and 2018, the latter being, as previously mentioned, the most frequently cited paper in worldwide medical literature. The new guidelines document, released during the 32nd European Meeting on Hypertension held in Milan in 2023 and published in the Journal of Hypertension, represents the most updated document on the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.

Although an in-depth analysis of the guidelines is beyond the scope of this article, it should be mentioned that the 2023 guidelines document addresses a number of critical issues in the field of hypertension diagnosis and treatment, also offering readers elements of novelty.

### Hypertension guidelines: Criteria that might make them more clinically useful [^113ZmA3w]. American Journal of Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease prevention depends on the reduction of risk factors, including hypertension. Guidelines designed to improve the management of hypertension are widely available. Their purpose is to compile the available data from basic biomedical science, epidemiology, and clinical science in an accessible form, allowing physicians and patients to make reasoned decisions for individual cases. However, these guidelines have neither been widely accepted nor effectively implemented.

We recommend a strategy for guideline preparation designed to yield a product that is more user-friendly, accessible, and effective. Guideline recommendations and the evidence used to formulate them should be based on an explicit grading system.

- **Consideration of factors**: Relevant clinical as well as nonclinical factors must be considered. The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to prevent cardiovascular events. The likelihood of such events is determined by multifactor or absolute risk assessment; therefore, risk, rather than the level of blood pressure, should determine the need for therapy. Similarly, the benefit of therapy must be assessed by the reduction in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Home-based blood pressure interventions for blacks [^1127YQ7N]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2009). Low credibility.

Efforts to increase blood pressure (BP) control rates in blacks, a traditionally underserved high-risk population, must address both provider practice and patient adherence issues. The home-based BP intervention for blacks study is a three-arm randomized controlled trial designed to test two strategies to improve hypertension management and outcomes in a decentralized service setting serving a vulnerable and complex home care population. The primary study outcomes are systolic BP, diastolic BP, and BP control. Secondary outcomes are nurse adherence to hypertension management recommendations and patient adherence to medication, healthy diet, and other self-management strategies.

Nurses (n = 312) in a nonprofit Medicare-certified home health agency are randomized, along with their eligible hypertensive patients (n = 845). The two interventions being tested are:

- **Basic intervention**: Delivering key evidence-based reminders to home care nurses and patients while the patient is receiving traditional postacute home health care.
- **Augmented intervention**: Includes the basic intervention plus transition to an ongoing Hypertension Home Support Program that extends support for 12 months.

Outcomes are measured at 3 and 12 months after the baseline interview. The interventions will be assessed relative to usual care and to each other. Systems change to improve BP management and outcomes in home health will not easily occur without new intervention models and rigorous evaluation of their impact. Results from this trial will provide important information on potential strategies.

### Reducing racial and ethnic disparities in hypertension prevention and control: What will it take to translate research into practice and policy [^115unoBi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of effective therapies, racial and ethnic disparities in the care and outcomes of hypertension persist. Several interventions have been tested to reduce these disparities; however, their translation into practice and policy is hampered by knowledge gaps and limited collaboration among stakeholders.

- **Methods**: We characterized factors influencing disparities in blood pressure (BP) control by levels of an ecological model. We conducted a literature search using PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases to identify interventions targeted toward reducing disparities in BP control. These interventions were categorized by the levels of the model at which they were primarily targeted, and we summarized the evidence regarding their effectiveness.

- **Results**: We identified 39 interventions and several state and national policy initiatives aimed at reducing racial and ethnic disparities in BP control, with 5 ongoing. Most interventions had patient populations that were majority African-American. Of the completed interventions, 27 demonstrated some improvement in BP control or related process measures, while 7 did not. Of the 6 studies examining disparities, 3 reduced disparities, 2 increased, and 1 had no effect on disparities.

- **Conclusions**: Several effective interventions exist to improve BP in racial and ethnic minorities; however, evidence that they reduce disparities is limited, and many groups are understudied. To strengthen the evidence and translate it into practice and policy, we recommend rigorous evaluation of pragmatic, sustainable, multilevel interventions, along with institutional support for training.

### Achieving equity in hypertension: A review of current efforts by the American Heart Association [^115DCfah]. Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

The purpose of this article is to summarize disparities in blood pressure (BP) by race in the United States, discuss evidence-based strategies to increase equity in BP, review recent American Heart Association BP equity initiatives, and highlight missed opportunities for achieving equity in hypertension. Over 122 million American adults have hypertension, with the highest prevalence among Black Americans. Racial disparities in hypertension and BP control in the United States are estimated to be the single largest contributor to the excess risk for cardiovascular disease among Black versus White adults. Worsening disparities in cardiovascular disease and life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic warrant an evaluation of the strategies and opportunities to increase equity in BP in the United States.

Racial disparities in hypertension are largely driven by systemic inequities that limit access to quality education, economic opportunities, neighborhoods, and health care. To address these root causes, recent studies have evaluated evidence-based strategies, including community health workers, digital health interventions, team-based care, and mobile health care to enhance access to health education, screenings, and BP care in Black communities. In 2021, the American Heart Association made a $100 million pledge and 10 commitments to support health equity. This commitment included implementing multifaceted interventions with a focus on hypertension as a seminal risk factor contributing to disparities in cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity.

### Update on hypertension in African-Americans [^117AUxJ9]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) in the U.S. is particularly prevalent and devastating among Black individuals, who disproportionately suffer the consequences of this condition compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, African Americans are often underrepresented in cardiovascular clinical trials, which limits the ability to reliably apply results from many outcome studies to this specific population.

In this review, we summarize and analyze the currently available evidence, specifically related to the risk factors, manifestations, complications, and management of HTN in this often difficult-to-treat population. The aim of the review is to improve the understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and to identify the optimal approach to deliver the best care for African American patients.

### An effective approach to high blood pressure control: A science advisory from the American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [^111MdGgG]. Hypertension (2014). High credibility.

It is critical that the AHA, ACC, and CDC, together with other organizations, continue to identify, define, and implement exemplary local, regional, and national programs that facilitate better blood pressure awareness, treatment, and control while improving other cardiovascular health factors and behaviors. Arming healthcare providers, health systems, and communities with proven tools, algorithms, strategies, programs, and other best practices, along with expertise and technical assistance for improving blood pressure awareness, treatment, and control, is essential to reducing the tremendous burden of cardiovascular risk.

This advisory serves as a call to action for broad-based efforts to improve hypertension awareness, treatment, and the proportion of patients treated and controlled. There is a clear need to provide enhanced, evidence-based blood pressure treatment systems for providers, including standardization of protocols and algorithms, incentives for improved performance based on achieving and maintaining patients at blood pressure goals, and technology-facilitated clinical decision support and feedback.

As noted previously, health system-wide implementation of focused evidence-based hypertension treatment algorithms, together with regularly scheduled performance feedback within a coordinated multifactorial management program, has been associated with substantially improved hypertension control in large populations and varied clinical practice settings. This approach can facilitate the ability to emphasize existing resources and strategies in improving hypertension management across various demographics and clinical sites.

### Racial and gender discrimination when tailoring medical management to hypertension treatment in Latin America [^112N49RG]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Low credibility.

Discrimination in cardiovascular healthcare, particularly concerning hypertension treatment, is a significant and complex issue in Latin America, driven by biases related to gender, ethnicity, and economic status. Although cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, disparities in healthcare delivery endure, especially impacting marginalized populations.

Women, ethnic minorities, and economically disadvantaged groups encounter considerable barriers, including underrepresentation in clinical research, delayed diagnoses, and unequal access to guideline-recommended treatments. Economic disparities maintain a divided healthcare system in which the quality of treatment often directly correlates with socioeconomic status, reinforcing inequities and adversely affecting health outcomes in lower-income communities. Ethnic discrimination, stemming from deeply ingrained social biases, leads to inadequate care and limited access to advanced medical technologies, disproportionately impacting indigenous and Afro-descendant populations.

Addressing these systemic inequities requires comprehensive strategies that ensure equitable participation in clinical trials, develop tailored public health policies sensitive to socioeconomic and cultural contexts, and implement targeted educational initiatives. Healthcare systems must actively dismantle entrenched biases, improve access for economically disadvantaged communities, and guarantee that ethnic minorities receive treatment of equal quality. The Inter-American Society of Hypertension emphasizes that removing these disparities is crucial for equitable healthcare delivery.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^1148paiZ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). High credibility.

This is the first update of this review, originally published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually aim to achieve a specific target. This target is the blood pressure value below which optimal clinical benefit is supposedly realized. The "lower the better" approach, which guided treatment for years, was challenged in the past decade due to a lack of evidence from randomized trials supporting this strategy. As a result, the standard target in clinical practice has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials in recent years have reintroduced the idea of achieving lower targets. Therefore, it is important to assess whether the benefits of achieving lower targets outweigh the potential harms.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with a reduction in mortality and morbidity compared to standard targets (less than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg) for treating patients with chronic arterial hypertension. Secondary objectives included determining if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) associated with "lower targets" compared to "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension, and assessing if there is a change in withdrawal rates related to different targets.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: International Society of Hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^1148fgg2]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). High credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of at least 90mmHg according to the International Society of Hypertension guidelines, affects over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, such as coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke, as well as death.

An international panel of experts convened by the International Society of Hypertension College of Experts compiled lifestyle management recommendations as a first-line strategy to prevent and control hypertension in adulthood. We recommend that lifestyle changes be continued even when blood pressure-lowering medications are prescribed.

Specific recommendations based on literature evidence are summarized with advice to start these measures early in life, including maintaining a healthy body weight, increasing levels of different types of physical activity, adopting healthy eating and drinking habits, and avoiding smoking and alcohol use. Additionally, the management of stress and sleep levels is emphasized.

- **Specific approaches**: We discuss the relevance of specific approaches, including the consumption of sodium, potassium, sugar, fiber, coffee, and tea, as well as intermittent fasting. Integrated strategies to implement these recommendations, using behavior change-related technologies and digital tools, are also addressed.
