## Question

A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after being found drowsy at home with an empty bottle of amitriptyline (a tricyclic antidepressant) nearby. On arrival, she is somnolent but arousable, with a heart rate of 120 bpm, blood pressure 95/60 mmHg, respiratory rate 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. Her pupils are dilated, and she has dry mucous membranes. The emergency physician is preparing the initial assessment and monitoring plan.

According to current guidelines, what is the appropriate approach to blood gas analysis in this patient, and what type of sample should be considered?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate approach to blood gas analysis in a patient with suspected tricyclic antidepressant overdose, including whether to obtain a blood gas, which type of sample to use, and how to interpret and act on the results. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether blood gas analysis is indicated in TCA overdose. Then, I should verify the best sample type and why. Next, I will review the clinical rationale for pH and bicarbonate monitoring in TCA toxicity. After that, I should consider exceptions where arterial sampling is still needed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and note key limitations and quality considerations for interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the indication. In TCA overdose, guidelines recommend obtaining a blood gas as part of the initial assessment and ongoing monitoring, particularly to evaluate acid-base status and guide therapy, so yes, a blood gas is indicated here [^dfc2e178].

> Now, which sample type should I choose? Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — arterial blood gas is traditional, but I need to check whether venous blood gas is acceptable. GEMNet advises that venous sampling is an acceptable alternative to arterial sampling for blood gas analysis in TCA overdose unless hypoxia or hypoventilation are suspected, which aligns with broader emergency care trends favoring venous sampling when oxygenation is not the primary concern [^eb3edc0c] [^12aad09f].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical rationale for preferring venous sampling in this scenario. TCA toxicity can cause metabolic acidosis and depress myocardial function, and management often involves sodium bicarbonate to raise serum pH toward 7.45–7.55; venous pH and bicarbonate track these therapeutic targets sufficiently for decision-making when oxygenation is preserved, as it is here with SpO2 98% on room air and RR 16/min [^120a9e31] [^5f525ca9].

> I should double-check the exceptions where arterial sampling is still warranted. If there is concern for hypoxemia, ventilatory failure, or the need for precise oxygenation metrics, then arterial blood gas remains appropriate; in this case, the patient is not hypoxic and is ventilating adequately, so venous sampling is reasonable and less painful, and randomized data support venous sampling as less painful with similar clinical utility in non-hypoxemic ED patients requiring blood gas analysis [^eb3edc0c] [^ace74692].

> Next, I should review how to interpret and act on the results. I need to ensure I focus on pH and bicarbonate to guide alkalinization therapy and monitor for acidosis worsening; I should avoid relying on venous PO2 to assess oxygenation, as venous oxygen tension does not reliably reflect arterial oxygenation, even though venous pH and bicarbonate are clinically useful for acid-base management in this context [^23cd6a53] [^5f525ca9].

> But wait, what if the patient deteriorates or we need serial assessments? I should confirm that repeating venous blood gases is acceptable for trending pH and bicarbonate during bicarbonate therapy, while continuing close ECG and hemodynamic monitoring; serial ECGs and clinical status remain paramount in TCA risk stratification and treatment response, with QRS width and terminal R-wave in aVR guiding severity and the need for bicarbonate escalation [^d84a798e] [^5f525ca9].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is to obtain a venous blood gas now as part of the initial assessment, using a peripheral venous sample drawn at the time of IV placement, to establish baseline pH and bicarbonate and to guide subsequent sodium bicarbonate therapy if indicated; reserve arterial sampling for evolving hypoxia, ventilatory compromise, or if precise oxygenation parameters are needed, which are not present here [^eb3edc0c] [^dfc2e178].

---

In TCA overdose, **obtain a venous blood gas (VBG)** as the initial test to assess acid-base status and guide therapy, because VBG is acceptable and less invasive than arterial sampling when oxygenation is stable [^eb3edc0c] [^ace74692]. Use **arterial blood gas (ABG)** only if there is concern for hypoxemia, ventilatory failure, or severe hemodynamic instability, or if precise oxygenation or CO2 assessment is needed [^23cd6a53]. Capillary blood gas is not recommended for oxygenation assessment in this setting [^24bdaf04]. Monitor serial VBGs to guide sodium bicarbonate therapy and correct acidosis, targeting pH 7.45–7.55 [^120a9e31] [^5f525ca9].

---

## Indications for blood gas analysis in TCA overdose

Blood gas analysis is essential in TCA overdose to evaluate acid-base status, guide alkalinization therapy, and monitor response to treatment. TCA toxicity can cause **metabolic acidosis** from impaired oxidative metabolism and **respiratory acidosis** from CNS depression and hypoventilation, both of which worsen cardiotoxicity and respond to targeted therapy [^5fae06f6].

---

## Recommended type of blood gas sample

Current guidelines recommend **venous blood gas (VBG)** as the initial test for acid-base assessment in TCA overdose, provided oxygenation is stable and there is no concern for significant hypoventilation or hypoxemia [^eb3edc0c]. VBG is less invasive, less painful, and provides clinically useful pH and bicarbonate values that closely correlate with arterial values in this context [^ace74692] [^12aad09f].

---

## Circumstances requiring arterial blood gas (ABG)

ABG is indicated when any of the following are present:

- **Hypoxemia**: Oxygen saturation < 90% on room air or clinical suspicion of respiratory failure [^notfound].
- **Ventilatory failure**: Respiratory rate < 12/min, rising CO2, or altered mental status with risk of hypoventilation [^notfound].
- **Severe hemodynamic instability**: Refractory hypotension or cardiac arrest requiring precise oxygenation and ventilation assessment [^notfound].
- **Need for precise oxygenation assessment**: When accurate PaO2 or PaCO2 is required for management decisions [^23cd6a53].

---

## Role of capillary blood gas (CBG)

Capillary blood gas sampling is **not recommended** for oxygenation assessment in adults, including TCA overdose, due to poor correlation with arterial oxygenation [^24bdaf04]. CBG may be considered in pediatric patients or when arterial/venous access is limited, but results should be interpreted cautiously and not used to assess oxygenation [^6d051d30].

---

## Clinical implications of blood gas results

Blood gas results guide therapy in TCA overdose:

- **Metabolic acidosis**: Indicates severe toxicity and the need for sodium bicarbonate therapy to alkalinize serum and reduce free drug concentration [^120a9e31].
- **Respiratory acidosis**: Suggests CNS depression and the need for airway support and ventilation [^notfound].
- **Alkalinization therapy**: Target pH 7.45–7.55 improves myocardial conduction and reduces arrhythmias; monitor serial VBGs to guide therapy [^120a9e31] [^523d5bd6].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended blood gas sample** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Stable oxygenation, no hypoventilation | Venous blood gas (VBG) | - Less invasive <br/> - Clinically useful for acid-base assessment [^eb3edc0c] [^ace74692] |
| Hypoxemia, ventilatory failure, or severe instability | Arterial blood gas (ABG) | - Precise oxygenation and ventilation assessment [^23cd6a53] |
| Adult patients (including TCA overdose) | Avoid capillary blood gas (CBG) | Poor correlation with arterial oxygenation [^24bdaf04] |

---

In TCA overdose, **start with a VBG** for acid-base assessment and switch to ABG only if oxygenation or ventilation is compromised or if precise arterial values are needed. Capillary sampling is not appropriate for oxygenation assessment in this setting.

Literature Clinical Pearls & Morning Reports Published April 18, 2018 Symptoms of tricyclic antidepressant toxicity usually develop within 60 minutes after ingestion, and major signs of toxicity are clinically apparent within 2 hours. Among patients who are asymptomatic more than 6 hours after ingestion, symptoms are unlikely to develop; however, delayed toxic effects may occur, particularly if there are coingestants that delay gastrointestinal motility. Read the latest NEJM Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital here. Clinical Pearls Q: What are the classic findings of tricyclic antidepressant overdose on electrocardiography. A: In tricyclic antidepressant overdose, classic findings on electrocardiography are sinus tachycardia, a wide QRS complex, a prolonged QTc interval, and rightward shifts of the QRS complex, specifically the terminal forces.

Other findings that may be seen in tricyclic antidepressant overdose include prolongation of the PR interval and a Brugada pattern. Q: Describe the immunoassay for tricyclic antidepressants. A: The immunoassay for tricyclic antidepressants involves a polyclonal mixture of antibodies directed against the most commonly prescribed tricyclics and their active metabolites. Thus, the immunoassay is nonspecific, and a positive test does not distinguish between single-drug and multidrug exposure. In addition, a positive test can result from tricyclic drug levels ranging from subtherapeutic to toxic and does not necessarily indicate toxicity. Several drugs — including cyclobenzaprine, carbamazepine, and quetiapine — have structural similarities to the tricyclic class and are well-described causes of false positive immunoassays for tricyclic antidepressants. Although diphenhydramine lacks the tricyclic rings, it has also been implicated as a cause of false positive tests.

A: Sodium bicarbonate is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with tricyclic antidepressant poisoning. The administration of sodium bicarbonate is indicated in patients who have hemodynamic instability or a QRS width that exceeds 100 msec. Patients with severe tricyclic antidepressant poisoning may need large amounts of sodium bicarbonate to facilitate resuscitation. This therapy is associated with a risk of hypokalemia, and therefore, frequent monitoring of the potassium level and appropriate repletion are recommended. Given the ongoing shortage of sodium bicarbonate in the United States that began in early 2017, adjunct but less effective therapies for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning with associated cardiac toxicity may be administered. These include therapeutic hyperventilation to an arterial blood pH of 7. 50 to
7.

55 or the administration of hypertonic saline after the patient's arterial blood pH has reached the maximal alkaline level. A: In patients with tricyclic antidepressant–induced hypotension that is not responsive to aggressive fluid resuscitation or to the intravenous administration of sodium bicarbonate, direct-acting vasopressors may be administered. Because tricyclic antidepressants cause peripheral alpha-adrenergic blockade, norepinephrine and epinephrine are preferred over dopamine. Intravenous lipid emulsion therapy has emerged as a rescue intervention for toxicity due to local anesthetic agents and has also gained acceptance as a potential treatment for overdoses of other lipid-soluble drugs, including tricyclic antidepressants.

### Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^b14b905b]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

A review of U.S. poison center data for 2004 showed over 12,000 exposures to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). A guideline that determines the conditions for emergency department referral and prehospital care could potentially optimize patient outcome, avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce healthcare costs, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the lead author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate prehospital triage and management of patients with suspected ingestions of TCAs by 1) describing the manner in which an ingestion of a TCA might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of TCA ingestion, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to ingestion of TCAs alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances could require different referral and management recommendations depending on their combined toxicities. This guideline is based on the assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with suspected self-harm or who are the victims of malicious administration of a TCA should be referred to an emergency department immediately (Grade D). 2) Patients with acute TCA ingestions who are less than 6 years of age and other patients without evidence of self-harm should have further evaluation including standard history taking and determination of the presence of co-ingestants (especially other psychopharmaceutical agents) and underlying exacerbating conditions, such as convulsions or cardiac arrhythmias. Ingestion of a TCA in combination with other drugs might warrant referral to an emergency department. The ingestion of a TCA by a patient with significant underlying cardiovascular or neurological disease should cause referral to an emergency department at a lower dose than for other individuals. Because of the potential severity of TCA poisoning, transportation by EMS, with close monitoring of clinical status and vital signs en route, should be considered (Grade D). 3) Patients who are symptomatic (e.g., weak, drowsy, dizzy, tremulous, palpitations) after a TCA ingestion should be referred to an emergency department (Grade B). 4) Ingestion of either of the following amounts (whichever is lower) would warrant consideration of referral to an emergency department: an amount that exceeds the usual maximum single therapeutic dose or an amount equal to or greater than the lowest reported toxic dose. For all TCAs except desipramine, nortriptyline, trimipramine, and protriptyline, this dose is > 5 mg/kg. For despiramine it is > 2.5 mg/kg; for nortriptyline it is > 2.5 mg/kg; for trimipramine it is > 2.5 mg/kg; and for protriptyline it is > 1 mg/kg. This recommendation applies to both patients who are naïve to the specific TCA and to patients currently taking cyclic antidepressants who take extra doses, in which case the extra doses should be added to the daily dose taken and then compared to the threshold dose for referral to an emergency department (Grades B/C). 5) Do not induce emesis (Grade D). 6) The risk-to-benefit ratio of prehospital activated charcoal for gastrointestinal decontamination in TCA poisoning is unknown. Prehospital activated charcoal administration, if available, should only be carried out by health professionals and only if no contraindications are present. Do not delay transportation in order to administer activated charcoal (Grades B/D). 7) For unintentional poisonings, asymptomatic patients are unlikely to develop symptoms if the interval between the ingestion and the initial call to a poison center is greater than 6 hours. These patients do not need referral to an emergency department facility (Grade C). 8) Follow-up calls to determine the outcome for a TCA ingestions ideally should be made within 4 hours of the initial call to a poison center and then at appropriate intervals thereafter based on the clinical judgment of the poison center staff (Grade D). 9) An ECG or rhythm strip, if available, should be checked during the prehospital assessment of a TCA overdose patient. A wide-complex arrhythmia with a QRS duration longer than 100 msec is an indicator that the patient should be immediately stabilized, given sodium bicarbonate if there is a protocol for its use, and transported to an emergency department (Grade B). 10) Symptomatic patients with TCA poisoning might require prehospital interventions, such as intravenous fluids, cardiovascular agents, and respiratory support, in accordance with standard ACLS guidelines (Grade D). 11) Administration of sodium bicarbonate might be beneficial for patients with severe or life-threatening TCA toxicity if there is a prehospital protocol for its use (Grades B/D). 12) For TCA-associated convulsions, benzodiazepines are recommended (Grade D). 13) Flumazenil is not recommended for patients with TCA poisoning (Grade D).

### Acute medication poisoning [^00223376]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Poisoning is the leading cause of injury-related morbidity and mortality in the United States. The highest rates of exposure to poisons occur in children five years and younger, but opioid overdoses in young adults account for most deaths from poisonings in recent years. Intentional or accidental medication poisoning should be considered when evaluating patients with mental status changes, vital sign abnormalities, seizures, and gastrointestinal or cardiovascular problems. For all poisoned patients, a comprehensive history and physical examination are needed. Knowledge of toxidromes may help identify the cause in unknown ingestions; however, their usefulness may be limited when multiple toxins are ingested. Electrocardiography is indicated in patients reporting chest pain and dyspnea and in overdoses of beta blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and antidysrhythmics. Measurement of electrolyte, serum creatinine, and serum bicarbonate levels and calculation of the anion gap may be helpful based on the clinical presentation. Treatment of a patient with acute poisoning is based on resuscitation and stabilization with a focus on airway, breathing, and circulation. When poisoning is suspected, the Poison Control provides health care workers and the public with access to a specialist 24 hours a day.

The Guidelines in Emergency Medicine Network (GEMNet) has been created to promote best medical practice in a range of conditions presenting to emergency departments (EDs) in the UK. This guideline presents a summary of the best available evidence to guide the management of adult patients who present to the ED following an overdose of tricyclic antidepressant agents (TCA). The document has been developed following discussion among emergency physicians to decide which topics would benefit from the development of clinical guidelines. The document is intended as a guideline for use in the ED by emergency physicians and is based on the review of the best existing evidence for the diagnostic tools and treatments used in this setting. The document is summarised as a clinical decision support guideline that has been presented as an easy to follow algorithm. The intention is for each guideline to be updated and reviewed as further evidence becomes available. The formal revision date has been set at 5&emsp14; years from publication, although the guideline is subject to continuous informal review.

Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with cisapride due to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for arrhythmia. This drug is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction.
5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large. Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline hydrochloride.

### Simple, easily memorised "rules of thumb" for the rapid assessment of physiological compensation for respiratory acid-base disorders [^0480ab7d]. Thorax (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter" for home oxygen, metabolic acidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, tricyclic antidepressant overdose, tuberous sclerosis complex, pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis, Fournier's gangrene, colonic volvulus, foreign body ingestion, botulism, status epilepticus, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetic ketoacidosis, near-drowning, inhalation injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, cardiac arrest, sepsis and septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, influenza virus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infection, COVID-19 infection, Pneumocystis pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, hospital-acquired pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia and blood gas analysis.

The Arterial Blood Gas (ABG) Interpreter analyzes arterial blood gas results, including pH, PaCO₂, and HCO₃⁻, to assess acid-base status, oxygenation, and ventilation. It aids in diagnosing respiratory, metabolic, and mixed acid-base disorders, guiding clinical management in acute and chronic conditions.

The Arterial Blood Gas Interpreter analyzes three key parameters: arterial pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO₂), and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) levels to assess acid-base balance in the body. Here's how it works:

1. **Input Parameters**
- **Arterial pH**: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the blood. A normal range is between 7.35 and 7.45.
- **PaCO₂**: The pressure exerted by carbon dioxide in the blood, typically between 35–45 mmHg. If measured in kPa, it is converted to mmHg by multiplying by 7.5.
- **HCO₃⁻**: The concentration of bicarbonate in the blood, with a normal level around 24 mmol/L.

2. **Determine Acid-Base Status**
- If pH is normal (7.35–7.45), the status is "Normal".
- If pH is less than 7.35, "Acidosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ > 45, it suggests "Respiratory Acidosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≤ 45, it suggests "Metabolic Acidosis".
- If pH is greater than 7.45, "Alkalosis" is indicated; specific classification depends on PaCO₂ level:

- If PaCO₂ < 35, it suggests "Respiratory Alkalosis".
- If PaCO₂ ≥ 35, it suggests "Metabolic Alkalosis".

3. **Calculate Expected Values for Compensation**
- For "Respiratory Acidosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 + (PaCO₂ - 40) / 10.
- For "Respiratory Alkalosis", expected HCO₃⁻ is 24 - (40 - PaCO₂) / 5.
- For "Metabolic Acidosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 - (24 - HCO₃⁻) × 1.2.
- For "Metabolic Alkalosis", expected PaCO₂ is 40 + (HCO₃⁻ - 24) × 0.7.

4. **Determine Compensation Level**
- "Uncompensated" indicates no significant correctional changes.
- "Partially Compensated" is considered if deviation from expected values is moderate (≤ 5 units).
- "Fully Compensated" is concluded with minimal deviation (≤ 2 units) from expected values.

5. **Interpretation and Breakdown**
- The analysis concludes with indicating if there's an acidosis or alkalosis, its type, and compensation level.
- Interpretation provides insights, suggesting chronic conditions if compensation is partial or full.
- A breakdown of calculations includes expected vs. actual values for HCO₃⁻ and PaCO₂.

This interpretation aids healthcare providers in understanding whether the body's compensatory mechanisms are effectively mitigating the imbalance, helping diagnose underlying conditions like respiratory or metabolic dysfunctions.

The following constitutes key background information on tricyclic antidepressant overdose:

- **Definition**: TCA overdose is deﬁned as ingestion of TCA at above the recommended therapeutic dose.
- **Pathophysiology**: TCA overdose may be accidental or intentional, including as part of suicide attempts.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of TCA overdose is estimated at 3.8 per 100,000 person-years.
- **Disease course**: TCAs block α-adrenergic receptors and have anticholinergic effects, leading to tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and arrhythmias. TCAs also exert a number of effects on the CNS, which may lead to drowsiness, coma, respiratory depression, seizures, and delirium.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hospital admission and intensive care support are required in several patients. Fatality rates of up to 6% have been reported in patients with severe overdose.

Overview of Tricyclic Antidepressant Poisoning

TCAs continue to be a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in poisoned patients and are responsible for nearly half of all fatalities reported due to antidepressants.

The clinical features of TCA poisoning are largely an extension of their pharmacologic actions described above. Antihistaminic- and anticholinergic- mediated effects typically result in altered mental status ranging from agitation and delirium to central nervous system depression and coma. Other anticholinergic effects (dry flushed skin, tachycardia, ileus, mydriasis, urinary retention, and hyperthermia) are usually present. Seizures result from anticholinergic and GABA-A antagonism, while the cardiovascular effects are caused by muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic blockade. These effects are manifested by tachycardia, peripheral vasodilation, and hypotension. Sodium channel blockade and the resulting delayed depolarization can cause wide complex arrhythmias, AV conduction disturbances, and myocardial depression, which are the primary cause of death in TCA overdose. Most deaths occur in the prehospital environment and are reported in the first few hours after presentation.

Many exposures to TCA will result in benign courses requiring little or no treatment at all. The incidence of severe rhythm disturbances is rare, while hypotension and coma and seizures are more frequent. Predicting which patients will develop severe toxicity is still debated. A range of toxic doses of approximately 5–20 mg/kg is often cited, but the reported ingested dose of TCA is neither reliable nor a good predictor of outcome. Serum testing is not generally routinely available and concentrations are less predictive than electrocardiogram (ECG) findings to identify high-risk patients: QRS duration is a better predictor of seizures and ventricular arrhythmia than serum concentrationsand an R wave in aVR of more than 3 mm had a good predictive value for seizures or arrhythmias.

The management of patients poisoned with TCAs includes general proactive care directed at securing the patient's airway and treating seizures with benzodiazepines. Hypotension can be a consequence of decreased vascular resistance and should be initially treated with fluid challenges, or secondary to myocardial depression and arrhythmias. An ECG should be performed to identify hallmarks of TCA sodium channel blockade (ventricular arrhythmia, QRS widening, Brugada-like pattern, or terminal axis deviation of the QRS, e.g. prominent R wave in aVR). Gastrointestinal decontamination may be indicated if the patient presents early after ingestion, and is discussed more extensively elsewhere–.

### Evaluation of relationship between arterial and venous blood gas values in the patients with tricyclic antidepressant poisoning [^12aad09f]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Determination of arterial blood gas (ABG) values is essential in the evaluation of patients with TCA poisoning. The relationship between arterial and venous blood gas pH has not been established in TCA poisoning. In TCA poisoning, blood vessels vasodilatation due to antidepressant-induced alpha-blockade and also metabolic acidosis may lead to arterialization of venous blood, which in turn enhances the relationship between ABG and VBG parameters. Therefore this study was designed to evaluate the relationship between ABG and VBG pH values in TCA poisoned patients.

Methods

This prospective study was performed in the Poisoning Emergency Department of Noor Hospital, Isfahan, Iran. Samples for arterial and venous blood gas analysis were obtained during initial evaluation of TCA-poisoned patients and 30 min after treatment with sodium bicarbonate. The venous blood gas samples were collected with samples for other blood tests at the time of intravenous line insertion. Laboratory data were recorded on a database form initiated in the emergency department and analyzed by paired student t-test. The degree of agreement between the arterial and venous pH measurements was evaluated by Bland and Altman method.

Results

Data from 50 TCA-poisoned patients were analyzed. There were significant differences between mean differences of ABG and VBG parameter values on the initial evaluation. There was also a relationship between arterial and venous pH on the initial evaluation.

Conclusion

In TCA poisoning, the peripheral venous pH measurement is a valid and reliable substitute for arterial pH.

OVERDOSAGE

Deaths may occur from overdosage with this class of drugs. Multiple drug ingestion (including alcohol) is common in deliberate tricyclic antidepressant overdose. As management of overdose is complex and changing, it is recommended that the physician contact a poison control center for current information on treatment. Signs and symptoms of toxicity develop rapidly after tricyclic antidepressant overdose, therefore, hospital monitoring is required as soon as possible.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^fb969d21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

The cardiovascular dynamics of tricyclic antidepressant overdoses have been the subject of several recent reports. 1–5 Several clinical variables, in particular the ECG, have been proposed as guides to the severity of the poisoning. Tachycardia and QRS prolongation are particularly important signs. 3 In the absence of plasma level determinations, QRS prolongation is the most reliable indicator of a serious overdose. 4 There is one previous report of an amitriptyline hydrochloride overdose with toxic plasma levels in which the QRS intervals were normal and the only ECG abnormality was a sinus tachycarida. 5 We report a case of a TCA overdose involving doxepin hydrochloride with an entirely normal ECG.

### Extracorporeal treatment for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^ffa12147]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Although there is no specific antidote for TCA poisoning, there is a fundamental role for sodium bicarbonate in the treatment of symptomatic TCA-poisoned patients. Sodium bicarbonate may ameliorate hypotension due to volume and sodium loading, and improves myocardial conduction disturbances presumably by creating a sodium load and also by inducing alkalosis. Systemic alkalosis itself, achieved by hyperventilation, also improves hypotension and cardiac conduction disturbances. The beneficial effect of alkalosis is potentially due to increased protein binding thereby reducing free drug availability and altering the charge of the TCA-receptor complex–. However, hypertonic sodium has also demonstrated benefit in few animal studies and isolated cases. Sodium bicarbonate combines the effect of sodium loading and alkalosis and remains the therapy of choice, especially for patients presenting with seizures, fluid-unresponsive hypotension, or typical ECG findings (ventricular dysrhythmia, QRS > 100 ms, prominent R waves in aVR). Induced hyperventilation can be considered in mechanically ventilated patients who cannot tolerate large fluid volumes. The combined effect of sodium bicarbonate and hyperventilation can result in profound alkalosis. Adverse effects of prolonged sodium bicarbonate therapy also include hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, impaired oxygen delivery by shifting the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, and fluid overload. Hypotension that does not respond to adequate fluid resuscitation and bicarbonate should be treated with direct-acting vasopressors (e.g. norepinephrine).

Other experimental "rescue" treatments have been used in a limited number of critical cases unresponsive to the usual treatment. These include glucagon, lidocaine and magnesium sulfate, intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal life support, and lipid emulsion therapy. Prolonged cardiac massage has also been reported to be successful after cardiac arrest in such patients.

Despite several anecdotal reports suggesting a benefit, current recommendations from widely consulted resources explicitly recommend against ECTR in TCA-poisoned patients–. Some recent reviews and publications nevertheless advocate these therapies, including plasmapheresis, hemodialysis, and hemoperfusion for severely poisoned TCA patients–. One guideline reviewing the management of tricyclic overdose does not comment on the therapeutic use of ECTR.

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) poisoning — recommendation-specific supportive text notes that sodium loading and increasing the serum pH are each supported for the treatment of hypotension and arrhythmia, and administration of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate achieves both of these physiologic goals in adults and children. Whether the target endpoints of initial hypertonic sodium bicarbonate bolus therapy should be biochemical (pH ≈7.50) or physiologic (resolution of hypotension and QRS prolongation) is debated, and after the goals of alkalinization are achieved, it is not known whether to continue with boluses as needed or start a continuous infusion. Experts recommend avoiding extremes of hypernatremia (serum sodium not to exceed 155 mEq/L) and alkalemia (serum pH not to exceed 7.55) to avoid iatrogenic harm, and if pH exceeds 7.55 and serum sodium is below 155 mEq/L, serum sodium can be increased by administration of hypertonic saline.

Clinicians might want to discuss unexpected results with the local laboratory or toxicologist and should discuss unexpected results with the patient. Discussion with patients before specific confirmatory testing can sometimes yield a candid explanation of why a particular substance is present or absent and obviate the need for confirmatory testing on that visit. For example, a patient might explain that the test is negative for prescribed opioids because they felt opioids were no longer helping and discontinued them. If unexpected results are not explained, a confirmatory test using a method selective enough to differentiate specific opioids and metabolites (e.g. gas or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry) might be warranted to clarify the situation.

Clinicians should use unexpected results to improve patient safety (e.g. change pain management strategy [see Recommendation 2], carefully weigh benefits and risks of reducing or continuing opioid dosage [see Recommendation 5], reevaluate more frequently [see Recommendation 7], offer naloxone [see Recommendation 8], and offer or refer patients for substance use disorder treatment [see Recommendation 12], all as appropriate). If tests for prescribed opioids are repeatedly negative, including confirmatory tests, and the clinician has verified that the patient is not taking the prescribed opioid, clinicians can discontinue the prescription without a taper and discuss options for safe disposal of unused opioids.

Clinicians should not dismiss patients from care on the basis of a toxicology test result. Dismissal could have adverse consequences for patient safety, potentially including the patient obtaining opioids from alternative sources and the clinician missing opportunities to facilitate treatment for a substance use disorder.

Recommendation 11

Clinicians should use particular caution when prescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently and consider whether benefits outweigh risks of concurrent prescribing of opioids and other central nervous system depressants (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

### Cardiac complications in amitriptyline poisoning… [^b95a73b9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE USE of tricyclic antidepressant medications is increasing as a form of self-poisoning. There have been a number of reports of the anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline hydrochloride and imipramine hydrochloride. 1 Although many cases of cardiotoxicity have been reported, 2 there is little information concerning the treatment of the serious cardiac complications. Physostigmine salicylate has been used successfully to treat the central effects of tricyclic antidepressants, such as agitation, seizures, and coma, as well as their peripheral effects, such as tachycardia. 1 We have used this drug in treating a young woman who had a cardiac arrest subsequent to an amitriptyline overdose. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of amitriptyline poisoning in which malignant arrhythmias and conduction defects were successfully treated with physostigmine.

Report of a Case A 22-year-old woman ingested an estimated 750 to 1, 000 mg of amitriptyline hydrochloride on March 25, 1975. She was Tobis J, Das BN. Cardiac Complications in Amitriptyline Poisoning: Successful Treatment With Physostigmine. JAMA. 1976; 235: 1474–1476.

The following constitutes key background information on blood gas analysis:

- **Definition**: Blood gas analysis is a common diagnostic tool to correctly interpret most of the respiratory, circulatory, and metabolic derangements through arterial and pulmonary/central venous blood gas and electrolyte analysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Blood gas analysis is used for the assessment of shunt fraction, pulmonary dead space, and respiratory, hemodynamic and metabolic relationship allowing for diagnosis and monitoring of critically ill patients.
- **Disease course**: Blood gas analysis is performed either through the arterial, central venous, or dual sampling of blood to assess oxygenation status, ventilatory and respiratory status, metabolic acid-base equilibrium disorders helping in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients in emergency departments and ICUs.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Blood gas analysis is not associated with increased mortality.

We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library database for articles published between January 1990 and December 2012. The update of this clinical practice guideline is based on 237 clinical trials, 54 reviews, and 23 meta-analyses on blood gas analysis (BGA) and hemoximetry. The following recommendations are made following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation scoring system. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for evaluating a patient's ventilatory, acid-base, and/or oxygenation status. BGA and hemoximetry are suggested for evaluating a patient's response to therapeutic interventions. BGA and hemoximetry are recommended for monitoring severity and progression of documented cardiopulmonary disease processes. Hemoximetry is recommended to determine the impact of dyshemoglobins on oxygenation. Capillary BGA is not recommended to determine oxygenation status. Central venous BGA and hemoximetry are suggested to determine oxygen consumption in the setting of early goal-directed therapies. For the assessment of oxygenation, a peripheral venous P(O2) is not recommended as a substitute for an arterial blood measurement (P(aO2)). It is not recommended to use venous P(CO2) and pH as a substitute for arterial blood measurement of P(aCO2) and pH. It is suggested that hemoximetry is used in the detection and evaluation of shunts during diagnostic cardiac catheterization.

### Role of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HR / MS) in clinical toxicology [^d5483e7c]. Clinical Toxicology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Gas chromatography (GC) and liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) are widely used to confirm drug screening results and for urine screening in presumed intoxicated patients. These techniques are better suited to targeted analysis than to general unknown screening and, due to the complexity of testing, results are seldom available rapidly enough to contribute to the immediate care of the patient. High resolution (HR)/MS with time-of-flight (TOF) or orbitrap instruments offer potential advantages in clinical toxicology. COMPARISON OF GC-MS, LC-MS/MS AND LC-HR/MS: For unknown analyses, GC-MS and LC-MS/MS require comparison of full-scan spectra against preestablished libraries. Operation in full-scan mode greatly reduces sensitivity and some drugs present in low but significant concentrations may be missed. Selected ion monitoring (SIM) in GC/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in LC-MS/MS, where only targeted ions are monitored, increase sensitivity but require prior knowledge of what compound is to be measured. LC-HR/MS offers mass assignment with an accuracy of 0.001 atomic mass units (amu) compared with 1 amu in conventional MS. Tentative identification is thus directed to a very limited set of compounds (or even one unique compound) based on the exact molecular formula rather than a fragmentation pattern, since HR/MS can discriminate between compounds with the same nominal molecular mass. LC-MS/MS has clear advantages over GC/MS in ease and speed of sample preparation and the opportunities for its automation. LC-HR/MS is more suitable to clinical toxicology because the drugs present in a sample are rarely known a priori, and tentative identifications of unknowns can be made without the availability of a reference standard or a library spectrum. Blood can be used in preference to urine which is more relevant to the patient's current clinical situation.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using PUBMED for clinical toxicology, adulterants in illicit drugs and herbal supplements, and case reports using LC-TOF/MS and LC-HR/MS. Only 42 papers in English were identified in these searches. LC-HR/MS IN CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY: LC-HR/MS has been used to detect designer drugs, doping agents, (neurosteroids) and adulterants such as levamisole, a veterinary antihelmitic found in street cocaine, and pharmaceuticals in herbal medications marketed to contain only natural ingredients. LC-HR/MS has proved useful for cases where existing tests were unable to identify the cause of the intoxication. One patient suffered a drug-induced seizure which was originally thought to be caused by an herbal medication, but diphenhydramine was determined to be the culprit. In another, 5-oxoproline was identified as the cause of metabolic acidosis seen in chronic acetaminophen (paracetamol) use. LC-HR/MS has successfully identified medications that were mislabeled or misrepresented street drugs. In one case, medications sold as diazepam were determined to be glyburide instead. The identification of novel designer amines, stimulants found in "bath salts", and synthetic cannabinoids are well suited to LC-HR/MS. Dozens or even hundreds of possible compounds cannot realistically be tested on an individual basis by targeted LC-MS/MS or GC/MS analysis.

Conclusions

LC-HR/MS offers unique opportunities for time-sensitive clinical analysis of blood samples from intoxicated patients and for comprehensive screening in a wide range of situations and materials. While the identification is not as definitive as that obtained by conventional fragmentation MS, the presumptive identification can be confirmed later with standards and spectral library matches. Optimum utilization of the presumptive diagnosis requires close collaboration between the laboratory analysts and their clinical counterparts.

Management

Obtain an ECG and immediately initiate cardiac monitoring. Protect the patient's airway, establish an intravenous line and initiate gastric decontamination. A minimum of 6 hours of observation with cardiac monitoring and observation for signs of CNS or respiratory depression, hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmias and/or conduction blocks, and seizures is necessary. If signs of toxicity occur at anytime during this period, extended monitoring is required. There are case reports of patients succumbing to fatal dysrhythmias late after overdose; these patients had clinical evidence of significant poisoning prior to death and most received inadequate gastrointestinal decontamination. Monitoring of plasma drug levels should not guide management of the patient. Gastrointestinal Decontamination - All patients suspected of tricyclic overdose should receive gastrointestinal decontamination. This should include large volume gastric lavage followed by activated charcoal. If consciousness is impaired, the airway should be secured prior to lavage. Emesis is contraindicated. Cardiovascular - A maximal limb-lead QRS duration of ≥ 0.10 seconds may be the best indication of the severity of the overdose. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate should be used to maintain the serum pH in the range of 7.45 to 7.55. If the pH response is inadequate, hyperventilation may also be used. Concomitant use of hyperventilation and sodium bicarbonate should be done with extreme caution, with frequent pH monitoring. A pH > 7.60 or a pCO2 < 20 mmHg is undesirable. Dysrhythmias unresponsive to sodium bicarbonate therapy/hyperventilation may respond to lidocaine, bretylium, or phenytoin, Type 1A and 1C antiarrhythmics are generally contraindicated (e.g., quinidine, disopyrarnide, and procainamide). In rare instances, hemoperfusion may be beneficial in acute refractory cardiovascular instability in patients with acute toxicity. However, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, exchange transfusions, and forced diuresis generally have been reported as ineffective in tricyclic poisoning. CNS - In patients with CNS depression, early intubation is advised because of the potential for abrupt deterioration, Seizures should be controlled with benzodiazepines, or if these are ineffective, other anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin). Physostigmine is not recommended except to treat lifethreatening symptoms that have been unresponsive to other therapies, and then only in consultation with a poison control center. Psychiatric Follow-up - Since overdosage is often deliberate, patients may attempt suicide by other means during the recovery phase. Psychiatric referral may be appropriate. Pediatric Management - The principles of management of child and adult overdosages are similar. It is strongly recommended that the physician contact the local poison control center for specific pediatric treatment.

### Extracorporeal treatment for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^77bcab2c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Recommendations

Executive Summary

General: We recommend NOT to perform ECTR in patients with TCA poisoning.

Rationale

There are no randomized controlled trials or large observational series to analyze clinical outcome data of patients undergoing ECTR for TCA poisoning. One small retrospective observational study was identified in which five patients were treated with HP, and four were not: the fall in TCA serum concentrations was faster and the length of stay shorter in the HP group, although one patient in the HP group was not accounted for due to an extremely long and complicated stay. Unfortunately, the study was underpowered and statistical analysis impossible to perform.

In an animal model, a group treated with both HP and cardiopulmonary bypass was compared with another group only treated with cardiopulmonary bypass. When compared to the control group, HP did not improve hemodynamic instability and also did not remove more than 1–2% of administered dose.

The remaining evidence of a clinical effect of ECTR consists of case reports and case series that are often dated, that lacked control groups, had multiple confounders, heterogeneous treatments, and suffered from definite publication bias. The quality of evidence for all recommendation statements would therefore be graded as "very poor".

It is interesting to note that 12 deaths were reported among the case reports included and that clinical improvement that occurred during or shortly after ECTR was reported in 68 of the 108 cases treated with any ECTR modality. Among the cases where improvement was reported, confounding therapies such as intubation, gastrointestinal decontamination, vasoactive drugs, and bicarbonate were consistently present. What effect, if any, was achieved by extracorporeal measures is therefore impossible to elucidate. Often the improvement reported some reversal of coma, while other more severe cardiovascular end-organ effects were not shown to dramatically improve during ECTR in a convincing time-related manner, such as the prompt ECG changes typically reported with sodium bicarbonate therapy. In fact, ECGs were rarely provided in the cases where improvement was reported, and sometimes ECG normalization only occurred days after ECTR had been completed.

### Validation of the prognostic utility of the electrocardiogram for acute drug overdose [^001f216c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Setting

We performed a secondary data analysis of a prospective cohort study that was previously described. 3, 7 The study was conducted at 2 urban, tertiary care adult ED over a 4‐year period from 2008 to 2012. The EDs have a combined annual visit volume in excess of 150 000 and are staffed 24 hours per day with board‐certified emergency physicians. A medical toxicology consulting service was available if deemed necessary in addition to routine clinical care. The study protocol was approved by the institutional program for the protection of human subjects with waiver of informed consent.

Study Population

Consecutive, adult ED patients with suspected acute drug overdose were screened 24 hours per day by trained research assistants. Excluded were patients with alternate diagnoses (eg, trauma, sepsis, anaphylaxis), age < 18 years, chronic presentations, nondrug toxicity (eg, plants), duplicate ED visits, do‐not‐resuscitate orders, exposure limited to topical or inhalation, prisoners, and missing/incomplete data (ie, left against medical advice, transferred to an outside institution, or otherwise eloped from the hospital). Eligible patients were included in this analysis if there was performance of an initial ECG within the first hour of ED arrival.

Data Collection

Data collection from the medical chart occurred in accordance with accepted guidelines for valid medical chart abstraction, including training of abstractors and 95% agreement of a random sampling of 10 test charts prior to mass data abstraction. 8 Medical record data were relied upon for all data measurements, including study outcomes. These data included demographics (sex, age, race), exposure information (timing of exposure, number of exposures, intent, suicidality), toxin identification (detail from history of present illness, serum drug concentrations if available), prior cardiovascular medical history (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure), and toxicology screens (urine ELISA panel and serum concentration, if any). Blood and urine toxicology screen results sent as routine part of clinical care (ie, no confirmatory gas chromatography/mass spectrometry) were recorded in order to confirm exposure. Data were abstracted to a de‐identified electronic database with password protection.

### Extracorporeal treatment for tricyclic antidepressant poisoning: recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^49629e3c]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

Despite overwhelming TK evidence suggesting little to no significant enhancement of TCA elimination with ECTR, several authors still suggest a beneficial clinical effect of ECTR and have postulated several reasons for this: 1) TCA removal prior to distribution, 2) Protein binding alteration during ECTR, 3) Critical removal from the toxic compartments, and 4) Metabolic manipulation. These are presented here.

Early intervention with ECTR may clear TCA from plasma before it distributes to tissues and before it produces its toxic end-organ effects. However, it is also plausible that the rapid fall in TCA concentrations reported by these authors during early ECTR is more likely a result of TCA distribution than true drug removal. Furthermore, many of TCAs' end-organ toxic effects occur early after exposure, as has been shown in prospective series designed to evaluate the utility of ECG parameters. Due to the lack of availability and utility of serum drug concentrations to predict outcome as well as the difficulty in initiating ECTR during the supposed predistribution phase in a realistic time frame (which includes transfer to a specialized unit, organizing ECTR, and installation of a central catheter), such an attempt to either correct or prevent the appearance of life-threatening symptoms would not be realistic in most clinical contexts.

Other arguments made by authors who advocate the use of ECTR for patients with serious TCA poisoning involve the toxicokinetics of tricyclics in overdose. One hypothesis is that in a severely poisoned patient, hypotension contributes to decreased hepatic blood flow and tissue perfusion as well as acidosis, which in turn would favor a larger amount of free ionized drug by decreasing both protein binding and volume of distribution and prolonging half-life of elimination, making more drug available for extracorporeal elimination.

Another hypothesis attempting to justify why ECTR might be effective despite removing only a negligible amount of drug suggests that increasing intercompartmental clearance with hemoperfusion facilitates redistribution of just enough drug away from the toxic compartments (i.e. cardiac receptors) to improve the cardiovascular status. The same authors admit that even if this were true, intercompartmental clearance would be reduced by the same hemodynamic conditions in severely poisoned patients.

In the absence of an indwelling arterial catheter, capillary blood gas sampling may be used to evaluate the acid/base and ventilation status of neonatal and pediatric patients with cardiorespiratory conditions. These guidelines were developed from a comprehensive review of the literature to provide guidance for the collection, handling, and interpretation of blood obtained from an arterialized capillary sample. Capillary and venous blood gas measurements are a useful alternative to arterial blood gas measurements for neonatal and pediatric patients who do not require close monitoring of [Formula: see text] In the presence of alterations in body temperature, blood pressure, or peripheral perfusion, agreement between a capillary blood gas with an arterial sample is recommended to determine whether changes in these physiologic conditions reduce reliability. Perfusion to the sample site should be assessed and preference given to blood sampling from a well perfused site, and blood should be analyzed within 15 min of sampling to minimize the propensity for pre-analytical errors. Clinicians should consider re-collecting a blood sample, obtained from an artery, vein, or capillary, when the blood gas or analyte result interpretation does not align with the patient's clinical presentation. A pneumatic tube system can be reliably used to transport blood gas samples collected in a syringe and capillary tube to a clinical laboratory for analysis. To reduce the cumulative pain effect and risk of complications, the capillary puncture procedure should be minimized when possible. Non-pharmacologic interventions should be used to reduce pain associated with capillary blood gas sampling. Automatic lancets are preferred to puncture the skin for capillary blood gas collection.

### Reducing pain by using venous blood gas instead of arterial blood gas (VEINART): a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^ace74692]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous sampling for blood gas analysis has been suggested as an alternative to arterial sampling in order to reduce pain. The main objective was to compare pain induced by venous and arterial sampling and to assess whether the type of sampling would affect clinical management or not.

Methods

We performed an open-label randomised multicentre prospective study in four French EDs during a 4-week period. Non-hypoxaemic adults, whose medical management required blood gas analysis, were randomly allocated using a computer-generated randomisation list stratified by centres with an allocation ratio of 1:1 using random blocks to one of the two arms: venous or arterial sampling. The primary outcome was the maximal pain during sampling, using the visual analogue scale. Secondary outcomes pertained to ease of sampling as rated by the nurse drawing the blood, and physician satisfaction regarding usefulness of biochemical data.

Results

113 patients were included: 55 in the arterial and 58 in the venous sampling group. The mean maximal pain was 40.5mm ± 24.9 mmand 22.6mm ± 20.2 mm in the arterial group and the venous group, respectively, accounting for a mean difference of 17.9mm (95%CI 9.6 to 26.3) (p < 0.0001). Ease of blood sampling was greater in the venous group as compared with the arterial group (p = 0.02). The usefulness of the results, evaluated by the prescriber, did not significantly differ (p = 0.25).

Conclusions

Venous blood gas is less painful for patients than ABG in non-hypoxaemic patients. Venous blood gas should replace ABG in this setting.

Diagnostic Studies

The CBC was notable for hemoglobin (11.8 g/dL), whereas the basic metabolic panel results were unremarkable. Arterial blood gas was notable for a pH of 7.58; Pa 2, 24 mm Hg; and Pa 2, > 500 mm Hg while receiving oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula at 60 L/min with an F 2 of 100%. Single-view portable chest radiography and transthoracic echocardiography with bubble contrast produced unremarkable results. A chest CT angiogram with contrast did not indicate pulmonary embolism and showed only mild atelectasis and inflammatory changes consistent with her known asthma. Mass spectrometry did not reveal any evidence of hemoglobin variants.

The patient's cyanosis and the discrepancy in oxygen saturation, as measured by pulse oximetry and blood gas analysis, were concerning for methemoglobinemia. Thorough medication reconciliation (Table 1) revealed intermittent phenazopyridine use over several years, and the patient had recently restarted this medication approximately 3 days before presentation. A blood sample was sent to the laboratory for CO-oximetry testing, but unfortunately, the results could not be reported because of the presence of an interfering substance. The team therefore decided to proceed with administration of methylene blue for empiric treatment of suspected methemoglobinemia. Unfortunately, the patient also reported current use of duloxetine and ginkgo biloba, so there was concern for inducing serotonin syndrome with concurrent use of methylene blue and agents that inhibit serotonin reuptake. A trial of IV vitamin C was thus initiated first, without improvement in the patient's Sp 2. After discussion of the risks and benefits with the toxicology service and the patient, methylene blue treatment was initiated the next morning. The patient received IV methylene blue at 1.5 mg/kg without improvement, followed by an additional 1 mg/kg, also without improvement. The lack of improvement argued against methemoglobinemia as the culprit for her hypoxia. On further discussion with the laboratory, it was determined that the interfering substance precluding reporting of the CO-oximetry results was suggestive of the presence of sulfhemoglobin, but available equipment did not have the ability to confirm. Send-out testing for sulfhemoglobin by spectrophotometry was performed, and the sulfhemoglobin level was later reported at 20.0% (reporting limit, 2.0%).

### AARC clinical practice guideline: blood gas analysis and hemoximetry: 2013 [^3d726d02]. Respiratory Care (2013). Medium credibility.

Blood gas analysis (BGA) description and variables — analysis of arterial and mixed venous blood provides information concerning oxygenation, ventilatory, and acid-base status, whereas samples from capillary, peripheral venous, umbilical venous sources and pH from other body fluids may provide limited information. The variables most generally measured are the P co2, P o2, and pH, and additional clinically useful variables include the concentration of total hemoglobin, oxyhemoglobin saturation, saturations of the dyshemoglobins (carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin), and calculated or derived values such as plasma bicarbonate and base excess/deficit. While some evidence suggests venous and arterial pH, P co2, and HCO3 may be clinically comparable in certain settings, venous blood gas (VBG) obtained from a central line should be considered a surrogate for arterial blood gas (ABG) only in very specific clinical circumstances. Central venous oxygen saturation and mixed venous oxygen saturation can reflect the relationship between oxygen delivery and consumption, and venous oximetry monitoring may reduce the morbidity and mortality of patients undergoing major surgery or patients with septic shock as it allows implementation of early goal-directed therapies.

Tricyclic antidepressant (TCA)/sodium channel blocker overdose — prehospital care emphasizes airway support, sodium bicarbonate for conduction toxicity, hemodynamic support, agitation management, and seizure management: "Consider early airway management"; "If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1–2 mEq/kg IV, this can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS and improve blood pressure"; for hypotension, "Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg)" and "Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1–2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline]"; for agitation, "For agitation, consider midazolam" with adult dosing "Adult: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 5 mg" and "Reduce by 50% for patients 69 years or older", and pediatric dosing "Pediatric: midazolam 0.1 mg/kg in 2 mg increments slow IV push over one to two minutes per increment with maximum single dose 4 mg or midazolam 0.2 mg/kg IN to maximum single dose of 10 mg"; seizures: "For seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline".

### Can VBG analysis replace ABG analysis in emergency care? [^5f525ca9]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Blood gas analysis is an integral part of the assessment of emergency department (ED) patients with acute respiratory or metabolic disease. Traditionally ABG analyses have been used, but increasingly, emergency clinicians are using venous blood gas (VBG) analyses. This has been challenged, especially by respiratory physicians, as being too inaccurate. This clinical review, using case examples, summarises the evidence supporting use of VBG to guide management decisions. Arteriovenous agreement for pH is such that values are clinically interchangeable and agreement for bicarbonate is also close. Agreement for pCO2 is poor with 95% limits of agreement of the order of 20mmHg (2.67kPa); however, there is solid evidence that a venous pCO2 ≤ 45mmHg (6kPa) reliably excludes clinically significant hypercarbia. Evidence regarding arteriovenous agreement for base excess is unclear. Given knowledge of the performance characteristics of VBG analyses, integration of the clinical findings with VBG results is often sufficient to safely guide treatment decision making.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^b9c32516]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Stimulant poisoning/overdose — initial assessment and monitoring includes vital signs including temperature for hyperthermia, applying a cardiac monitor and examining rhythm strip for arrhythmias, checking blood glucose level, monitoring EtCO2 for respiratory decompensation, asking about chest pain and difficulty breathing, and checking a 12-lead EKG when possible; also check for trauma or self-inflicted injury, and because law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, you may need to repeat the inspection.

### AARC clinical practice guidelines: capillary blood gas sampling for neonatal and pediatric patients [^2fefc559]. Respiratory Care (2022). High credibility.

CBGS 12.0 frequency — The frequency of capillary sampling should depend upon the clinical status of the patient and the indications for performing the procedure, not upon a prescribed frequency. Those patients requiring frequent CBGs should be considered candidates for placement of an indwelling arterial access for blood gas sampling or noninvasive monitoring techniques, to limit trauma associated with repeated punctures. Repeated puncture of the foot/finger increases the risk of scarring or serious laceration, and care should be exercised to alternate the sampling site for patients requiring multiple punctures.

### Label: AMITRIPTYLINE HCL tablet, film coated… [^3ffde15c]. FDA (DailyMed) (2024). Medium credibility.

Amitriptyline hydrochloride should not be given with cisapride due to the potential for increased QT interval and increased risk for arrhythmia. This drug is not recommended for use during the acute recovery phase following myocardial infarction.
5. Warnings Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for amitriptyline hydrochloride should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Patients with cardiovascular disorders should be watched closely. Tricyclic antidepressant drugs, including amitriptyline hydrochloride, particularly when given in high doses, have been reported to produce arrhythmias, sinus tachycardia, and prolongation of the conduction time.

Myocardial infarction and stroke have been reported with drugs of this class. The possibility of suicide in depressed patients remains until significant remission occurs. Potentially suicidal patients should not have access to large quantities of this drug. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Concurrent administration of amitriptyline hydrochloride and electroshock therapy may increase the hazards associated with such therapy. Such treatment should be limited to patients for whom it is essential. Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.

Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large. Geriatric patients are particularly sensitive to the anticholinergic side effects of tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline hydrochloride.
