## Question

Management of Osteopenia with Frax hip greater than 3% and major osteoporotic greater than 20%

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage osteopenia when the FRAX 10-year hip fracture probability is at least 3% and the 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability is at least 20%. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and risk category. Then, I should verify that these FRAX thresholds are indeed treatment triggers in major guidelines. Next, I will consider secondary causes and baseline labs, followed by first-line pharmacologic choices and dosing. After that, I need to address lifestyle and fall-prevention strategies, monitoring intervals, and drug holidays. Finally, I should review special populations and summarize a practical algorithm with shared decision-making in mind.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and risk category. Osteopenia is defined as a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, or distal one-third radius, and the FRAX thresholds of hip fracture ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic fracture ≥ 20% identify high fracture risk in this BMD range, which shifts management toward pharmacotherapy rather than observation alone [^116Bx2YU] [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw].

> Wait, let me verify that these thresholds are consistently endorsed across high-credibility guidelines. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the same intervention thresholds: AACE/ACE 2020, Endocrine Society 2019, ACOG 2022, and the NOF/BHOF framework all recommend initiating pharmacologic therapy for osteopenic patients who meet or exceed a 10-year hip fracture risk of 3% or a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk of 20% by FRAX, reflecting cost-effectiveness modeling and epidemiologic burden in osteopenic patients [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw] [^1178VTfV] [^113nQ3A8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment without excluding secondary causes. I should confirm that we screen for contributors such as hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, malabsorption, hypogonadism, thyroid disease, liver or renal impairment, and medication-induced bone loss, and obtain baseline labs including 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, creatinine/eGFR, and consider testosterone in men or estradiol in women when clinically indicated, because correcting these can modify risk and guide therapy selection [^1178VTfV] [^1164gpi1].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic therapy. Bisphosphonates are the preferred initial agents for most patients with osteopenia at high FRAX risk, with strong evidence for reducing hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; alendronate or risedronate are common oral choices, while zoledronic acid is reasonable when adherence to oral therapy is a concern or when rapid effect is desired, and denosumab is an alternative when bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated, though I need to remember denosumab rebound risk if stopped [^113WfNAn] [^115beCmp] [^115XJKUb].

> I need to ensure dosing and administration are correct. Oral bisphosphonates should be taken with water on an empty stomach with delayed upright posture, and patients should be counseled on adherence and gastrointestinal tolerability; zoledronic acid 5 mg IV annually is an option, and denosumab 60 mg SC every 6 months is an alternative, with dental clearance and calcium/vitamin D optimization before initiation to mitigate hypocalcemia and ONJ risk [^113WfNAn] [^115XJKUb].

> Let me consider lifestyle and fall-prevention strategies because pharmacotherapy is only part of risk reduction. Weight-bearing and resistance exercise, adequate calcium intake to about 1000–1200 mg/day preferably from diet with supplementation as needed, and vitamin D to achieve at least 25-hydroxyvitamin D 30 ng/mL are foundational; multifactorial fall-risk assessment and mitigation, including vision correction, home hazard modification, balance training, and medication review, should be implemented in parallel [^1144VFQh] [^1164gpi1].

> I should double-check monitoring intervals and response assessment. Repeat DXA is generally reasonable at 1–2 years to document BMD gains and guide continuation, with earlier reassessment if clinical risk factors change; vertebral imaging is appropriate in patients aged 70 and older or with historical height loss to detect silent vertebral fractures that would escalate risk and potentially alter therapy, and I should remember that FRAX does not capture falls or recent fractures, so clinical vigilance is essential [^112ejnJ6] [^113oovCj].

> But wait, what about drug holidays and duration of therapy. For low-to-moderate risk patients who are stable after 3–5 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy, a drug holiday can be considered with reassessment in 2–4 years, whereas high-risk patients, including those with osteopenia at very high fracture probability, should continue therapy longer, up to 10 years for oral agents or 6 years for IV zoledronic acid, with individualized decisions based on BMD trajectory and new fractures [^112bMy56] [^113WfNAn].

> Let me think about special populations where thresholds or agents may differ. In men, the same FRAX thresholds apply and treatment is recommended when met, with particular attention to hypogonadism and ADT-related bone loss; in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, FRAX underestimates risk and many guidelines recommend prophylactic bisphosphonate therapy when prednisone-equivalent dose is 7.5 mg/day or more for 3 months, adjusting FRAX upward and favoring prompt pharmacologic intervention; in cancer survivors on ADT or AIs, bone-modifying therapy is indicated at the same FRAX thresholds and should be integrated into survivorship care with dental precautions [^1123A956] [^113Kovgq] [^117L45MD] [^113nQ3A8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the SCOOP randomized trial directly proved that treating to FRAX thresholds reduced hip fractures, but I should verify the strength of evidence. The SCOOP study showed that a FRAX-based screening strategy reduced hip fractures by about 28% over 5 years, with the effect size increasing with baseline FRAX hip risk, which supports the clinical utility of FRAX-guided treatment decisions, though this was a screening and treatment implementation study rather than a pure pharmacologic efficacy trial, so I need to be precise about inference here [^114NPgrp] [^112UM7Fq].

> I should confirm that shared decision-making is emphasized because patient preferences vary. Many patients with osteopenia prioritize symptom burden, convenience, and perceived risks, and acceptance of therapy does not perfectly align with guideline thresholds; explaining absolute risk reduction, potential benefits, and rare adverse effects like atypical femur fracture or ONJ, and aligning choices with patient values, improves adherence and outcomes [^113TQsai] [^113WfNAn].

> Putting this together, my practical algorithm is as follows: confirm osteopenia by DXA and that FRAX hip risk is ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic risk is ≥ 20%; exclude secondary causes and obtain baseline labs; initiate a bisphosphonate as first-line unless contraindicated, with denosumab as an alternative; implement exercise, calcium/vitamin D, and fall-prevention measures; reassess BMD in 1–2 years and continue therapy if risk remains high, considering a holiday only if stable and risk is lower; and tailor for men, glucocorticoid users, and cancer survivors with the same FRAX thresholds and condition-specific nuances [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw] [^1178VTfV] [^113WfNAn].

---

Patients with osteopenia and FRAX hip fracture risk ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥ 20% should **start pharmacologic therapy** to reduce fracture risk [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw]. First-line options are **bisphosphonates** (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid) or denosumab [^113WfNAn]; teriparatide or romosozumab are reserved for very high risk or intolerance [^1118pYsm]. Combine therapy with calcium 1000–1200 mg/day, vitamin D 800–1000 IU/day, weight-bearing/resistance exercise, and fall prevention [^1144VFQh]. Reassess BMD and FRAX in 1–2 years; continue therapy if risk remains high, and consider a bisphosphonate holiday after 3–5 years if risk is low-to-moderate [^112bMy56]. Address secondary causes and monitor for adverse effects [^1164gpi1].

## Indications for pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy is indicated for osteopenic patients with **FRAX hip fracture risk ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥ 20%** [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw]. These thresholds are supported by major guidelines (AACE/ACE, Endocrine Society, ACOG) and reflect the high absolute fracture risk in this population [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw] [^1178VTfV].

---

## Pharmacologic treatment options

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Indication** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bisphosphonates | - Alendronate <br/> - Risedronate <br/> - Zoledronic acid | First-line therapy | - Reduce vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures [^113WfNAn] <br/> - Consider drug holiday after 3–5 years if risk is low-to-moderate [^112bMy56] |
| Denosumab | Denosumab | Alternative to bisphosphonates | - Effective in reducing fractures <br/> - Requires continuous therapy; rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures can occur on discontinuation [^115XJKUb] |
| Anabolic agents | - Teriparatide <br/> - Romosozumab | Reserved for very high risk or intolerance | - Rapid BMD gains <br/> - Typically limited to 1–2 years, followed by antiresorptive therapy [^notfound] |

## Non-pharmacologic interventions

Non-pharmacologic measures are essential adjuncts to pharmacotherapy:

- **Calcium intake**: 1000–1200 mg/day (diet plus supplements) [^1144VFQh].
- **Vitamin D**: 800–1000 IU/day; adjust to maintain 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: Weight-bearing and resistance training to improve BMD and reduce falls [^1144VFQh].
- **Fall prevention**: Home safety assessment, vision correction, balance training, and medication review [^1144VFQh].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Re-evaluation**: Repeat DXA and FRAX in 1–2 years to assess response and adherence [^115kAF5B].
- **Continuation**: Continue therapy if FRAX remains above thresholds or if new risk factors emerge.
- **Drug holiday**: Consider after 3–5 years of bisphosphonate therapy if risk is low-to-moderate, with reassessment every 2–4 years [^112bMy56].

---

## Special considerations

- **Secondary causes**: Evaluate and treat contributors (e.g. hyperparathyroidism, malabsorption, hypogonadism, glucocorticoid use) [^1164gpi1].
- **Adverse effects**: Monitor for atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and hypocalcemia with denosumab [^113WfNAn].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Tailor therapy to comorbidities, preferences, and adherence [^113TQsai].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate pharmacologic therapy** with bisphosphonates or denosumab for osteopenic patients with FRAX hip ≥ 3% or major osteoporotic ≥ 20% [^111K2pB4] [^113r3Juw].
- **Combine with calcium, vitamin D, exercise, and fall prevention** [^1144VFQh].
- **Reassess in 1–2 years** and continue therapy if risk remains high; consider a bisphosphonate holiday if risk is low-to-moderate [^112bMy56].
- **Address secondary causes** and monitor for adverse effects [^1164gpi1].

---

Patients with osteopenia and elevated FRAX scores have a **high absolute fracture risk**; evidence-based pharmacotherapy plus lifestyle measures reduces fractures and should be implemented with appropriate monitoring and shared decision-making [^1126ocEQ].

Key Points for Practice
- Routine exercise, including aerobic and resistance activities, helps prevent bone loss; exercise also helps prevent falls in older adults.
- Calcium and vitamin D supplementation has not been shown to reduce fracture risk.
- Bone density screening is recommended for all postmenopausal patients 65 years and older. Younger patients with an estimated fracture risk of greater than 8. 4% also benefit from screening. Osteoporosis Prevention Exercise helps prevent bone loss and is an important consideration in osteoporosis prevention counseling. Resistance and high-impact or weight-bearing exercises are most effective and are safe in patients with osteopenia. A walking regimen also may be helpful. The National Academy of Medicine recommends 600 IU daily of vitamin D from food in patients up to 70 years of age and 800 IU in those older than 70 years.

For calcium, they recommend 1, 000 mg daily for adults up to 50 years of age, increasing to 1, 200 mg daily for those older than 50 years. Fall Prevention Fractures in patients with osteoporosis often occur related to falls, and certain risk factors make falls more likely. Multifactorial interventions, including referral to physical or occupational therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, and nutrition therapy, may be the most helpful for patients with risk factors. Exercise interventions reduce falls, and injurious falls, in older adults. ACOG follows the USPSTF and recommends exercise interventions for community-dwelling adults 65 years or older who are at increased risk of falls. Osteoporosis Screening Bone density screening is recommended in postmenopausal patients 65 years and older to decrease fractures. For younger patients with at least one risk factor, screening is recommended if the fracture risk is greater than 8.

4% using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Risk factors include alcohol use; body mass index less than 20 kg per m. Diagnosis Osteoporosis is diagnosed in a patient with any of the following: T-score of −2. 5 or less for hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, or distal third of radius History of fragility fracture, including incidental or asymptomatic vertebral fracture T-score between −1. 0 and −2. 5 and increased risk of fracture determined by risk assessment tool.

### Bone mineral density: clinical relevance and quantitative assessment [^115XJKUb]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is an internationally accepted standard-of-care screening tool used to assess fragility-fracture risk. Society guidelines have recommended which populations may benefit from DXA screening and the use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) to guide decisions regarding pharmacologic treatment for osteoporosis. According to the U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, postmenopausal women and men at least 50 y old with osteopenic BMD warrant pharmacologic treatment if they have a FRAX-calculated 10-y probability of at least 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with osteoporosis defined by a clinical event, namely a fragility fracture, or with an osteoporotic BMD should also be treated. Patients who are treated for osteoporosis should be monitored regularly to track expected gains in BMD by serial DXA scans. With some drug therapies, BMD targets can be reached whereby further improvements in BMD are not associated with further reductions in fracture risk. Although reaching this target might suggest a stopping point for therapy, the reversibility of most treatments for osteoporosis, except for the bisphosphonates, has dampened enthusiasm for this approach. In the case of denosumab, it is now apparent that stopping therapy at any point can lead to an increase in multiple-fracture risk. For patients who do not respond to antiosteoporosis pharmacologic therapy with an improvement in BMD, or who have an incident fragility fracture on therapy, secondary causes of osteoporosis or non-compliance with medical therapy should be considered.

Regarding medical management for hip fracture, more specifically with respect to management of osteoporosis, indications, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to initiate pharmacologic therapy in patients with a T-score between -1.0 and -2.5 if the FRAX (or if available, trabecular bone score-adjusted FRAX) 10-year probability for major osteoporotic fracture is ≥ 20% or the 10-year probability of hip fracture is ≥ 3% in the US or above the country-specific threshold in other countries or regions.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^1178VTfV]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — indications for pharmacotherapy state that after evaluation for remediable secondary causes, pharmacotherapy is recommended for patients who meet any of the following: T-score −2.5 or lower by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, or distal 1/3 radius; history of fragility fracture, including asymptomatic vertebral fracture; or T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 with increased risk of fracture determined by a formal clinical risk-assessment tool. For example, using the U.S. Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) tool, this corresponds to a 10-year hip fracture probability of 3% or greater, or a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability of 20% or greater. Hip (femoral neck) and lumbar spine measurements by DXA provide the most accurate and precise measurements of bone mineral density, and when one or both these sites cannot be evaluated, bone mineral density measurement at the forearm (distal one third of the radius) can be used for diagnosis.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^113oovCj]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Fracture risk assessment and treatment consideration — postmenopausal women aged 50 years or older with osteopenia (T-score between −1.0 and −2.5) who have a 10-year hip fracture probability ≥ 3% or 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability ≥ 20% in the U.S. or above a country-specific threshold are recommended to consider osteoporosis treatment, and the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX) incorporates clinical factors such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking, alcohol use, prior fracture, parental history of hip fracture, glucocorticoid use, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, and femoral neck BMD while predicting the 10-year probability of hip and major osteoporotic fracture; however, FRAX underestimates risk in settings including multiple or recent fractures, lumbar spine BMD much lower than femoral neck BMD, secondary osteoporosis, and increased fall risk, and falls are not directly captured in FRAX and are a proximate cause of most fractures in older adults.

### Osteoporosis in men: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1123A956]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis in men — treatment decision criteria and risk thresholds state that men who have suffered fragility hip or clinical vertebral fractures are at high risk of additional fractures and should be considered for pharmacological treatment, a T-score of −2.5 or below in the spine, femoral neck, or total hip (using the young male reference range) should also be a factor in the decision to treat, and we recommend the use of FRAX or Garvan or another risk assessment tool in men who have not sustained a fragility fracture and in whom the T-score is between −1.0 and −2.5, and, at least in the United States, to recommend pharmacological therapy for men who have a 10-yr risk of greater than 3% for hip fracture or at least 20% for major osteoporosis-related fracture using FRAX.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^111pEJ6s]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO algorithm for maintaining bone health in individuals with nonmetastatic cancer states that clinicians should be aware that patients with nonmetastatic cancer may have baseline and treatment-related risks for osteoporosis; all patients should be counseled on intake of calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercises, minimizing the risk of falls, and bone-healthy lifestyle and behaviors; and osteoporosis fracture risk assessment may include use of FRAX. When one or more risk factor for osteoporotic fracture is present and there is consideration for use of a bone-modifying agent, then evaluate bone mineral density, with the preferred assessment using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of total spine, hip, and femoral neck. Thresholds to initiate a bone-modifying agent include: if FRAX shows 10-year risk of hip fracture at 3% or greater, or 10-year risk of non-hip fracture at 20%; if the BMD (DXA) demonstrates osteoporosis or significant osteopenia with additional risk factors; or if the clinical scenario indicates significant risk for osteoporotic fracture, then initiate a bone-modifying agent, with the bisphosphonates (oral or IV) or denosumab as the preferred agents dosed for osteopenia or osteoporosis as clinically indicated. For surveillance, repeat DXA every 2 years or as clinically indicated, and bone mineral density assessment should not be conducted more than annually.

### The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX ®): applications in clinical practice [^1178FFQu]. Journal of Women's Health (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a serious health concern affecting millions of Americans, with many patients going undiagnosed and untreated. Fractures due to osteoporosis and fracture-related complications are the most clinically relevant and costly consequences of this disorder. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®), released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2008, is a major achievement in helping determine which patients may be candidates for pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis. This Web-based algorithm, which has been incorporated into some dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) reporting software, calculates the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture (clinical vertebral, hip, forearm, or humerus) and the 10-year probability of hip fracture in men and women based on easily obtained clinical risk factors and bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck (optional). The National Osteoporosis Foundation updated its U.S. guidelines in February 2008 to incorporate FRAX and recommends that all postmenopausal women and men aged ≥ 50 years with a hip or vertebral fracture, a T-score ≤ -2.5 at the femoral neck or spine (excluding secondary causes), or low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) and a 10-year probability of hip fracture ≥ 3% or of major osteoporosis-related fracture ≥ 20% (based on FRAX) should be considered candidates for drug therapy. Despite its demonstrated clinical utility, FRAX has limitations and should not be used in all situations. Acceptance and clinical use of FRAX may help identify men and women at increased risk for osteoporotic fracture, but implementing the tool into clinical practice may be a challenge for busy physicians.

Bone mineral density categories and fracture risk — osteoporosis is defined by a T-score at or below −2.5 and osteopenia as a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 based on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and these criteria are useful for classification and risk stratification but are not intended as treatment thresholds. More than 80% of fragility fractures occur in women with BMD in the "osteopenia" range, and it is now recommended that treatment decisions include consideration of fracture probability; BMD results should be combined with other clinical risk factors, and FRAX® integrates the contribution of BMD and other clinical risk factors and calculates an individual's probability of fracture over 10 years.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^1118pYsm]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — treatment indications and very high fracture-risk criteria: Pharmacologic therapy to reduce fracture risk is indicated when fracture risk is high based on T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5 with a history of fragility fracture of the hip or spine, or when T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5 are accompanied by a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture ≥ 20% or hip fracture ≥ 3% in the U.S., or above country-specific thresholds elsewhere. Patients at very high fracture risk include those with a recent fracture within the past 12 months, fractures while on approved therapy, multiple fractures, fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (e.g., long-term glucocorticoids), a very low T-score less than −3.0, high risk of falls or history of injurious falls, or very high FRAX probability such as major osteoporotic fracture > 30% or hip fracture > 4.5%. Some patients at very high fracture risk may require more aggressive treatment, and there is evidence supporting superiority of anabolic agents over antiresorptive agents in reducing vertebral fracture risk in this group.

### FRAX updates 2012 [^117R1cau]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There is an increasing recognition that the management of osteoporosis requires the characterization of fracture risk to be based on absolute risk rather than single measures such as bone mineral density (BMD). FRAX, the most widely used tool that incorporates clinical risk factors with or without BMD, was launched in 2008. This brief review addresses the development of FRAX since then and describes some of the issues that continue to be discussed as FRAX plays an increasing role in clinical practice.

Recent Findings

FRAX is a platform technology that will continue to develop. High-quality updated epidemiology of fracture and mortality can lead to recalibration of models. The addition of new risk factors is complex as the process requires validation in an international setting as well as a comprehensive assessment of how such new factors interact with the existing FRAX variables. Nonetheless, clinical interpretation can be enhanced by taking into account the potential adjustments of FRAX probabilities and several of these are described.

Summary

FRAX is being incorporated in an increasing number of clinical guidelines, and assessment and intervention thresholds have been provided to instruct clinical decision-making. There is an increasing body of evidence that patients deemed at highest risk of fracture by FRAX, with or without the use of BMD, will overlap significantly with those identified by previous guidelines and will respond to appropriate osteoporosis therapy.

The Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Women for the Prevention of Fracture (SCOOP) study was a community-based screening intervention in women aged 70 to 85 years in the United Kingdom. In the screening arm, licensed osteoporosis treatments were recommended in women identified to be at high risk of hip fracture using the FRAX risk assessment tool (including bone mineral density measurement). In the control arm, standard care was provided. Screening led to a 28% reduction in hip fractures over 5 years. In this planned post hoc analysis, we wished to examine for interactions between screening effectiveness on fracture outcome (any, osteoporotic, and hip fractures) on the one hand and baseline FRAX 10-year probability of hip fracture on the other. All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis, based on the group to which women were randomized, irrespective of whether screening was completed. Of 12,483 eligible participants, 6233 women were randomized to screening, with treatment recommended in 898 (14.4%). No evidence of an effect or interaction was observed for the outcomes of any fracture or osteoporotic fracture. In the screening arm, 54 fewer hip fractures were observed than in the control arm (164 versus 218, 2.6% versus 3.5%), and commensurate with treatment being targeted to those at highest hip fracture risk, the effect on hip fracture increased with baseline FRAX hip fracture probability (p = 0.021 for interaction); for example, at the 10th percentile of baseline FRAX hip probability (2.6%), there was no evidence that hip fractures were reduced (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71 to 1.23), but at the 90th percentile (16.6%), there was a 33% reduction (HR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84). Prior fracture and parental history of hip fracture positively influenced screening effectiveness on hip fracture risk. We conclude that women at high risk of hip fracture based on FRAX probability are responsive to appropriate osteoporosis management. © 2018 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

ABSTRACT

The Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Women for the Prevention of Fracture (SCOOP) study was a community‐based screening intervention in women aged 70 to 85 years in the United Kingdom. In the screening arm, licensed osteoporosis treatments were recommended in women identified to be at high risk of hip fracture using the FRAX risk assessment tool (including bone mineral density measurement). In the control arm, standard care was provided. Screening led to a 28% reduction in hip fractures over 5 years. In this planned post hoc analysis, we wished to examine for interactions between screening effectiveness on fracture outcome (any, osteoporotic, and hip fractures) on the one hand and baseline FRAX 10‐year probability of hip fracture on the other. All analyses were conducted on an intention‐to‐treat basis, based on the group to which women were randomized, irrespective of whether screening was completed. Of 12,483 eligible participants, 6233 women were randomized to screening, with treatment recommended in 898 (14.4%). No evidence of an effect or interaction was observed for the outcomes of any fracture or osteoporotic fracture. In the screening arm, 54 fewer hip fractures were observed than in the control arm (164 versus 218, 2.6% versus 3.5%), and commensurate with treatment being targeted to those at highest hip fracture risk, the effect on hip fracture increased with baseline FRAX hip fracture probability (p = 0.021 for interaction); for example, at the 10th percentile of baseline FRAX hip probability (2.6%), there was no evidence that hip fractures were reduced (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.71 to 1.23), but at the 90th percentile (16.6%), there was a 33% reduction (HR = 0.67; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.84). Prior fracture and parental history of hip fracture positively influenced screening effectiveness on hip fracture risk. We conclude that women at high risk of hip fracture based on FRAX probability are responsive to appropriate osteoporosis management. © 2018 The Authors.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^117KoxiW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnostic criteria for postmenopausal osteoporosis — Box 2 — state that "Any one of the following criteria is consistent with a diagnosis of postmenopausal osteoporosis:" a "T-score −2.5 or lower by DXA of the femoral neck, total hip, lumbar spine, or distal 1/3 radius", "History of fragility fracture, including asymptomatic vertebral fracture", or "T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 and increased risk of fracture, as determined by a formal clinical risk assessment tool". Footnotes add that hip and lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) "provide the most accurate and precise measurements of BMD" and allow diagnosis using "BMD measurement at the forearm (distal one third of the radius)" when those sites cannot be evaluated; for FRAX, an example threshold is "a 10-year hip fracture probability of 3% or greater or a 10-year major osteoporotic fracture probability of 20% or greater".

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 2 [^112bMy56]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

ACOG clinical practice guideline — bisphosphonate drug holidays and duration — ACOG suggests discontinuation of bisphosphonates to allow a drug holiday for low-to-moderate risk patients who are stable after 5 years of treatment with oral bisphosphonates or after 3 years of treatment with intravenous zoledronic acid. Longer treatment, of up to 10 years for oral bisphosphonates or up to 6 years for intravenous zoledronic acid, is suggested for patients at high risk of fracture (CONDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). Based on available evidence, a bisphosphonate holiday can be considered for low-to-moderate risk patients after these treatment durations, and longer treatment is suggested for patients at high risk of fracture including those with osteoporotic fractures, a hip T-score of -2.5 or lower, or other significant risk factors determined by a validated clinical risk-assessment tool such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX). The optimal length of bisphosphonate holidays is unclear, and expert guidelines recommend re-evaluation 2–4 years after bisphosphonate discontinuation; resumption of treatment should be considered in patients with new fractures, additional fracture risk factors, or significant decreases in bone mineral density (BMD).

### Estimates of the proportion of older white men who would be recommended for pharmacologic treatment by the new US National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines [^113kpXgR]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Analysis

Men in MrOS were excluded from the analysis if they were nonwhite. Although MrOS and NHANES III enrolled nonwhite men and FRAX probabilities can be calculated for several different ethnicities, the analysis was limited to white men because there were too few nonwhite men in the MrOS cohort to provide an accurate ethnicity-stratified analysis. Men also were excluded if they had missing data for any of the factors required to apply the NOF guidelines, including those required to calculate FRAX. We applied the NOF guidelines as given in Table 1 to determine the proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment.

Radiographic vertebral fracture status was not available in MrOS. However, this information is not collected routinely in the usual care setting, and therefore, in order to conservatively apply the guidelines, we did not include information about radiographic vertebral fractures in determining whether a man should be treated.

In the primary analysis, the criterion "past history of hip fracture or clinical or radiographic vertebral fracture" was conservatively limited to past history of hip fracture. We also estimated the proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment if a history of clinical vertebral fractures was included. In other secondary analyses, we applied the criterion " T -score of −2.5 or less at femoral neck or spine" and "osteopenia and 10-year risk of hip fracture of 3% ot greater or osteopenia and major osteoporotic fracture risk of 20% or greater" alone. Finally, to determine if the proportion of men who would be recommended for treatment differed by age, we analyzed men 65 years of age and older and 75 years of age and older.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^113nQ3A8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline — pharmacologic management states that for patients with nonmetastatic cancer with osteoporosis (T scores of −2.5 or less in the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine) or who are at increased risk by clinical assessment or risk tools (10-year probability of ≥ 20% for major osteoporotic fractures or ≥ 3% for hip fracture based on the US-adapted FRAX tool), bone-modifying agents such as oral bisphosphonates, intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates or subcutaneous denosumab at the osteoporosis-indicated dosage may be offered to reduce the risk of fracture. Hormonal therapies for osteoporosis management (eg, estrogens) are generally avoided in patients with hormonally-responsive cancers, and for patients without hormonally responsive cancers, estrogens may be offered along with other bone-modifying agents when clinically appropriate (Type: evidence based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: high; Strength of recommendation: strong). Current evidence suggests that oral bisphosphonates, IV bisphosphonates, and subcutaneous denosumab are each efficacious options.

### Prostate cancer, version 2.2025, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113ytc64]. NCCN (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) indicates increased fracture risk and outlines osteoporosis screening and treatment. Medical or surgical ADT is associated with greater risk for osteoporosis and clinical fractures, with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk in large population-based studies, and in a population-based cohort of 3295 patients surgical castration had lower fracture risk than medical castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; P = 0.01). ADT decreases bone mineral density (BMD), with hip and spine BMD declining by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy. The NCCN Guidelines Panel recommends screening and treatment for osteoporosis according to guidelines for the general population from the National Osteoporosis Foundation and states that a baseline bone mineral density study should be considered for patients on ADT. National Osteoporosis Foundation measures include calcium (1000–1200 mg daily from food and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily) and additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years with osteopenia (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) meeting FRAX thresholds of a 10-year probability of hip fracture greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%. Fracture risk can be assessed using the algorithm FRAX®, and ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis" using the FRAX® algorithm. Earlier randomized trials showed bisphosphonates increase BMD during ADT, and in 2011 the FDA approved denosumab to prevent bone loss and fractures during ADT, with denosumab binding and inhibiting receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) to blunt osteoclast function.

### Reassessment intervals for transition from low to high fracture risk among adults older than 50 years [^115PksDH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This analysis of a population-based clinical registry of individuals undergoing baseline and subsequent fracture risk assessment found that relatively few individuals (< 20%) reached guidelines-defined high fracture risk after a mean (SD) of 5.2 (2.9) years (ranging from 6.6% for fixed MOF treatment threshold to 16.2% for fixed hip fracture threshold). Major variables associated with reaching treatment-qualifying fracture risk were the baseline level of risk (particularly when FRAX scores were 75%-99% of the treatment threshold) and an increase in the number of clinical risk factors. Together, these measures identified subgroups in which transition to guidelines-defined high fracture risk was unlikely for more than 15 years and others in which transition to high risk occurred before 3 years. Broadly similar patterns were seen for fracture risk strategies and thresholds that are included in the clinical practice guidelines for Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

Simulation analysis performed by Reid and Gamblefound a doubling time in 10-year hip fracture risk of 5 to 6 years across a range of baseline assumptions, with a doubling time for 10-year MOF risk that exceeded 10 years. Gourlay et alanalyzed the time for 10% of women who did not have osteoporosis at baseline to make the transition to osteoporosis. The estimated testing interval was 16.8 years for women with normal BMD and as short as 1.1 years for women with advanced osteopenia (BMD T-score, –2.00 to –2.49). A subsequent study extended these observations to examine the time for 10% of women to develop a treatment-level fracture risk score using US National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines. Before age 65 years, postmenopausal women with a subthreshold fracture risk score at baseline rarely developed a treatment-level FRAX score. Time to a treatment-level score ranged from 7.6 years (ages 65–69 years) to 5.1 years (ages 75–79 years). Our study showed that estimated time to develop a treatment-level high fracture risk score was associated with baseline fracture risk and new clinical risk factors.

### Implications of expanding indications for drug treatment to prevent fracture in older men in United States: cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of prospective cohort study [^116Fj5fD]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

The FRAX algorithm is a publicly available web based tool that uses clinical risk factors and country specific data, with or without consideration of femoral neck bone mineral density measurement, to estimate an individual patient's 10 year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fractures (defined by FRAX as clinical vertebral, forearm, hip, or proximal humerus fracture). The development of the FRAX tool has been advocated by several organizations, supported in part by funding from the pharmaceutical industry, which have advocated the use of FRAX in clinical decision making to identify high risk candidates for drug treatment to prevent fracture. This has promoted a shift in treatment approach in many practice settings from one based primarily on measurement of bone mineral density to an approach based on absolute risk of fracture.

Use of FRAX in clinical practice demands a consideration of the probability of fracture at which to intervene. On the basis of a cost effectiveness analysis, the NOF in 2010 recommended FRAX intervention thresholds of 3% for hip fracture and 20% for major osteoporotic fracture as cut points for starting drug treatment in US adults aged 50 years and older. However, a critical unproved assumption in this analysis is that drug treatment reduces risk of clinical fractures by 35% regardless of bone mineral density or the presence of existing vertebral fractures. Despite the controversies in identifying osteoporosis in men and lack of data on the efficacy of treatment in preventing clinical fracture events in populations other than postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as defined by WHO criteria or with existing vertebral fractures, current US treatment guidelines recommend starting drug treatment to prevent fracture in men with a history of hip or vertebral fracture, men with male specific bone mineral density T scores at or below –2.5, and men with a male specific bone mineral density T score between –1.0 and –2.5 who are at or above NOF derived FRAX intervention thresholds.

We used data collected in 5880 untreated, community dwelling US men aged 65 years or above enrolled in the prospective Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study to determine the incremental effects of broadening the definition of osteoporosis and use of NOF derived FRAX intervention thresholds on the proportion of older men identified as candidates for drug treatment for fracture prevention. We also compared observed and predicted 10 year fracture probabilities within distinct groups identified by osteoporosis status and fracture risk category.

### New national osteoporosis guidance-implications for geriatricians [^112jw7ym]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Intervention thresholds recommended by NOGG

Certainly, treatment should be considered for any older person who sustains a fragility fracture, and this remains unchanged in the updated NOGG guidance. After using FRAX, NOGG now defines four categories of fracture risk based on FRAX outputs: low risk (green), intermediate risk (amber), high risk (red) and very high risk (dark red), with DXA recommended in all patients with intermediate or higher risk.

Hitherto, a common dilemma for geriatricians has arisen when fracture risk is intermediate, but BMD measurement has been impractical due to frailty. Now a strong recommendation is made to offer anti-osteoporosis treatment if there is a history of fragility fracture and/or if fracture risk exceeds the intervention thresholds set at 20.3% for MOF and at 5.4% for hip fracture; corresponding lines are now clearly shown on post-FRAX NOGG graphs.

### Clinical practice. postmenopausal osteoporosis [^113WfNAn]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Key Clinical Points Postmenopausal Osteoporosis Fractures and osteoporosis are common, particularly among older women, and hip fractures can be devastating. Treatment is generally recommended in postmenopausal women who have a bone mineral density T score of -2.5 or less, a history of spine or hip fracture, or a Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score indicating increased fracture risk. Bisphosphonates (generic) and denosumab reduce the risk of hip, nonvertebral, and vertebral fractures; bisphosphonates are commonly used as first-line treatment in women who do not have contraindications. Teriparatide reduces the risk of nonvertebral and vertebral fractures. Osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fractures have been reported with treatment but are rare. The benefit-to-risk ratio for osteoporosis treatment is strongly positive for most women with osteoporosis. Because benefits are retained after discontinuation of alendronate or zoledronic acid, drug holidays after 5 years of alendronate therapy or 3 years of zoledronic acid therapy may be considered for patients at lower risk for fracture.

### Osteoporosis treatment prevents hip fracture similarly in both sexes: the FOCUS observational study [^113TJngG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinically, these results should have implications for how men are managed for osteoporosis. In 2018, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men. More recently, the American College of Physicians recommended that clinicians offer treatment to men at high risk for fracture, but this was presented as a "conditional recommendation" with "low-certainty evidence". We did not address cost-effectiveness of diagnostic screening and treatment for men, nor what is the optimal way to define "high-risk" for initiating treatment for either sex. Nonetheless, our study does provide more conclusive evidence, particularly when also considering the accumulated literature, that osteoporosis treatment in clinical practice prevents hip fractures similarly in high-risk men and women, whether "high-risk" is defined by DXA, FRAX, or BCT. Given the devasting effects of hip fracture, especially for men, clinical guidelines for osteoporosis testing and treatment should be updated to reflect this new evidence.

### Osteoporosis prevention, screening, and diagnosis: ACOG clinical practice guideline no. 1 [^1167VMvL]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Risk assessment tools for osteoporosis — USPSTF and FRAX: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) review found common osteoporosis risk assessment tools performed comparably with moderate predictive ability, with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.58 to 0.82; an AUC of 0.5 indicates no discrimination, 0.7 or greater acceptable discrimination, and 1.0 perfect discrimination. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is a computer-based algorithm that estimates the 10-year risk of hip fracture and the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture in adults 40 years and older and can be used to assess the need for BMD testing in postmenopausal patients younger than 65 years with risk factors or to determine the need to initiate pharmacotherapy in a patient with a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5. Risk calculations include multiple clinical risk factors and the U.S. FRAX tool has separate calculators for Caucasian, Black, Asian, and Hispanic racial and ethnic groups. Without femoral neck BMD T-score input, FRAX's pooled AUC for identifying major osteoporosis fracture risk was 0.66 (95% CI 0.63–0.69), and with inclusion of the hip BMD T-score, FRAX's pooled AUC for predicting future major osteoporotic fracture in women was 0.70 (95% CI 0.68–0.71). Limitations include that FRAX does not allow input of specific amounts, dosage, or duration for alcohol intake, corticosteroid use, or smoking or for the number of prior fractures, and that spine BMD and recent falls are not incorporated, which can underestimate risk in individuals with these factors.

Limitations and validation of FRAX — FRAX underestimates fracture risk in patients with falls or diabetes and in those with low spine but not FN BMD, and current FRAX scoring does not allow quantification of several risk factors such as glucocorticoid dose, alcohol amount, smoking duration/amount, or prior fracture number, type, or recency. Despite these limitations, FRAX has been validated as an accurate predictor of fracture probability in large U.S. and Canadian populations, although its performance in identifying individual patients who will or will not fracture is less robust; FRAX does not accurately predict BMD, and it remains one of the most useful tools for estimating fracture risk.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) enhances assessment of fracture risk in older women and men across many race/ethnicities and with a broad range of comorbidities. The best validated clinical utility of TBS is for input in the FRAX algorithm to modify assessment of fracture risk in patients who are close to FRAX-based intervention thresholds, thereby possibly influencing treatment decisions. TBS has been shown to increase with anabolic therapy and to a lesser degree with denosumab. TBS-adjusted T-scores may be useful with treatment guidelines that do not include FRAX.

### Fracture risk assessment in long-term care: a survey of long-term care physicians [^115i6BL9]. BMC Geriatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by low bone mass and increased risk for fractures. Osteoporosis-related fractures are strongly associated with recurrent fractures, and are responsible for lasting disability, morbidity and excess mortality. In Canada, the incidence of osteoporosis-related fractures is 7.2 and 15. 3/1000 person-years for men and for women over the age of 50 years, and the cost to the healthcare system has been estimated to be up to $3.9 billion annually.

In recent years, the focus of osteoporosis management has shifted from the treatment of low bone mineral density (BMD) to an integrated approach of fracture risk reduction through recognition of important clinical risk factors. In 2010, Osteoporosis Canada (OC) published evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis that reflect the new approach to risk assessment. The guidelines strongly recommend the use of the validated fracture risk assessment tools FRAX or CAROC (Canadian Association of Radiologists and Osteoporosis Canada). These tools evaluate the risk of osteoporosis-related fractures based on individual risk factors and are appropriate for use in clinical practice. Both tools are country- and sex- specific, and based on sets of risk factors that include age, BMD of the hip (FRAX, but not CAROC, can also provide a score in the absence of BMD measurement), prevalent fragility fractures, use of glucocorticoids and others, and predict the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (hip, spine, distal forearm and humerus). Results obtained from the FRAX or CAROC predictor tools are used to guide treatment so that pharmacotherapy is recommended for patients with an elevated 10-year probability of major fractures. Many countries have also recently reviewed and updated their clinical practices guidelines using a similar framework. Knowledge may not benefit patients unless it is disseminated and translated to healthcare providers, patients and policy makers in a form they can use. Attention must be devoted to adapt this knowledge to the context and its stakeholders.

### Estimates of the proportion of older white men who would be recommended for pharmacologic treatment by the new US National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines [^112zuj3e]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

We estimate that application of the new NOF guidelines would result in recommending that pharmacologic treatment to prevent fractures should be initiated for about one-third of the participants in the MrOS study and approximately half the men over age 75. These figures may underestimate the proportions that would be recommended for treatment in the US population because the men in MrOS had somewhat higher BMD values than the men in the US population-based NHANES III survey. Furthermore, we did not include some criteria for treatment, such as a history or presence of a radiographic vertebral fracture, inclusion of which would further increase the number recommended for treatment.

Our estimates are consistent with results from the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study (CaMOS). In our study, we found that approximately 8% of men would be eligible for treatment using only the 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture of 20% or greater criterion. A similar analysis in the CaMOS cohort found that over 10% of white men aged 65 years or older would have a 10-year probability of fracture of 20% or greater based on BMD and the risk factors used in the WHO model. Although the NOF cost-effectiveness analysis did not report the proportion of men who would be treated under the NOF guidelines, they do conclude that pharmacologic treatment would be cost-effective for the average 73-year-old white man. Thus, given that the median age of men who participated in MrOS was 73 years, it is consistent that we estimated that a high proportion (34%) of men would be recommended for drug treatment.

Our analysis suggests that approximately one-third of the older white men recommended for pharmacologic treatment under the new guidelines would be included because they have low bone mass (osteopenia) at one of the two skeletal sites and a 10-year estimated probability of hip fracture of 3% or greater or a 10-year estimated probability of major osteoporotic fracture of 20% or greater. The FRAX probability of hip fracture risk (≥ 3%) was the criterion that would lead to the greatest number of men being treated (29% of total group). When so many people and such a large proportion of older men are recommended for drug treatment, it is important that the assumptions underlying the recommendations be based on robust data. In particular, it is important that there be strong evidence of substantial benefit from treatment among those with low bone mass and additional risk factors. To date, there have been no randomized, controlled trials testing the efficacy of antifracture drug treatment in this population.

### Clinical assessment of fracture risk and novel therapeutic strategies to combat osteoporosis [^116xSHeH]. Fertility and Sterility (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the latest tools in the clinical assessment of fracture risk and to review new and emerging options for osteoporosis therapy.

Design

Retrospective analysis of published studies regarding the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis.

Result(S)

Large-scale epidemiologic data were recently assembled by the World Health Organization to produce a Web-based clinical assessment tool, FRAX, which uses clinical and historical data to provide prompt assessment and quantitation of fracture risk. The FRAX models were developed from studying population-based cohorts in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia. The FRAX algorithms indicate the 10-year probability of hip fracture and the 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture (at the clinical spine, forearm, hip, or shoulder) on which to base treatment decisions. Recent progress in the study of bone metabolism including anabolic pathways that enhance bone maintenance, is anticipated to improve the ways in which skeletal health can be maintained and osteoporosis can be treated.

Conclusion(S)

Using FRAX, fracture risk in now easily assessed in the clinical setting. New and emerging treatment strategies for bone maintenance are reviewed. Improved assessment of fracture risk, combined with tailored therapies for at-risk patients, will increase the number of patients who receive appropriate bone-sparing therapies.

### Management of patients with high baseline hip fracture risk by FRAX reduces hip fractures – A post hoc analysis of the SCOOP study [^116wJLGb]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the last few years, treatment based on the absolute risk of fracture has been incorporated into many national and international guidelines, given the availability of validated fracture risk assessment tools such as FRAX, launched in 2008. 1, 2 For example, in the United Kingdom, specific age‐dependent intervention thresholds based on 10‐year probability of fracture are advocated by the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group in their recent NICE‐accredited guidance. 3 A cornerstone of the clinical utility of fracture risk tools is that the risk identified should be reversible by bone‐targeted therapies, and a number of post hoc analyses of phase 3 clinical trials have demonstrated that this is the case for risk identified by FRAX. (4–11) Very recently, the first study that prospectively screened patients using FRAX probabilities to assess fracture risk (the Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Women for the Prevention of Fracture [SCOOP] study) has been published. 12 This UK multicenter study, largely primary care based, assessed the effectiveness of a FRAX‐based, community screening program in women aged 70 to 85 years, with treatment targeted at women at high risk of hip fracture, compared with a control group receiving standard clinical care. The approach appears to be acceptable to both patients and GPs. 13 During 5 years of follow‐up, prescriptions for anti‐osteoporosis medications were more frequent, and hip fracture incidence lower, in the screening intervention arm compared with the control arm (Table 1). Anti‐osteoporosis medications were particularly frequently prescribed in those intervention participants classified as high fracture risk, and so we hypothesized that the effect of screening to reduce hip fractures would be greatest in women with higher baseline FRAX probability, with a consequent interaction between baseline FRAX hip fracture probability and screening effectiveness.

### Updates on osteoporosis in men [^116kQsxt]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is less common in men than women; however, the mortality rate associated with major fragility fractures is higher in men. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is established by measurement of bone mineral density or by the presence of a fragility fracture, especially spine or hip fracture. However, many men at high risk of fracture will not meet the T-score criteria for osteoporosis, so fracture risk calculation, with a tool such as FRAX, should be performed. Bone-active agents should be prescribed for men at high risk of fracture to decrease fracture risk, and therapy must be individualized.

ASCO Clinical Practice Guideline — Recommendation 3.5 on bone-modifying agents in adult cancer survivors: Provided that T score and/or risk assessment (e.g. FRAX-estimated fracture risk) exceed threshold values for fractures as described in Recommendation 3.4, the following specific populations may be considered appropriate candidate for bone-modifying agents: premenopausal women receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapies causing ovarian suppression or with chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure (CIOF) or who have undergone an oophorectomy; postmenopausal women who are receiving aromatase inhibitors; men who have received or are receiving androgen deprivation therapy; patients undergoing or with a history of bone marrow transplantation; and patients with chronic (> 3 to 6 months) glucocorticoid use. The guideline states the type as evidence based with benefits outweigh harms, evidence quality as high, and strength of recommendation as strong. A qualifying statement notes that the short-term bone loss associated with these conditions can be rapid, and that clinicians could consider treatment at higher bone density or T score than recommended using FRAX or similar tools, with decision making further guided by anticipated losses and inclusion of the bulleted conditions as secondary osteoporosis in FRAX. ASCO believes that cancer clinical trials are vital to inform medical decisions and improve cancer care, and that all patients should have the opportunity to participate.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis — diagnostic criteria and treatment indications state that osteoporosis can be diagnosed if there is a low-trauma (i.e., fragility) fracture in the absence of other metabolic bone disease, independent of the BMD (T-score) value; a fragility fracture is usually from force similar to a fall from a standing position or less that would not have occurred in healthy bone excepting fractures of the skull, face, fingers, and toes; patients with a low-trauma (fragility) fracture of the spine, hip, proximal humerus, pelvis, or possibly distal forearm should be diagnosed with osteoporosis and considered for pharmacologic therapy; osteoporosis may also be diagnosed in patients with osteopenia and increased fracture risk using FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) country-specific thresholds; patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated; indications for pharmacologic therapy are low T-score, increased fracture risk based on FRAX®, or fragility fracture; and once the diagnosis of osteoporosis is made, the diagnosis remains even if treatment results in a T-score better than −2.5.

Postmenopausal osteoporosis diagnosis — T-score and FRAX criteria is defined as follows: Osteoporosis is also diagnosed based on a T-score of −2.5 or lower in the lumbar spine (anteroposterior), femoral neck, total hip, or 1/3 radius (33% radius), even in the absence of a prevalent fracture; when the initial diagnosis is made according to a T-score of −2.5 or below, the diagnosis persists even when a subsequent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) shows a T-score better than −2.5. Osteoporosis may also be diagnosed in patients with a T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 and increased fracture risk using FRAX country-specific thresholds.

### Osteopenia: a key target for fracture prevention [^1126ocEQ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Osteopenia was originally a qualitative term denoting bone that appeared to be less dense on radiographs. Since 1994, it has also had the quantitative meaning of a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score between -1.0 and -2.5. More than 60% of White women older than 64 years are osteopenic. Although fracture risk is often lower in osteopenic women than in those with osteoporosis, their greater number means that most fractures occur in osteopenic individuals. Fracture risk varies widely in the osteopenic range, depending on factors including BMD, age, fracture history, and nationality and ethnicity. Therefore, the diagnosis of osteopenia is not an indication for either intervention or reassurance, but BMD is a risk factor that should be incorporated into a quantitative fracture risk calculation. Evidence from trials shows that oral and intravenous bisphosphonates cost-effectively reduce fractures in older osteopenic women. Major osteoporotic fracture risks of 10–15% could be acceptable indications for treatment with generic bisphosphonates in patients older than 65 years motivated to receive treatment. This Review assesses the evidence relating to the management of older adults with osteopenic bone densities.

Fragility fractures are painful, debilitating, often life-changing and accounted for an estimated 2.4% of pre-pandemic health care spending in the UK. Those who are older, frail and multimorbid have the highest fracture risk and therefore the most to gain from anti-osteoporosis treatments to reduce this risk. Currently, an unacceptable treatment gap exists between those eligible for and those who receive treatment. This commentary discusses the major changes to the new, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence accredited, UK National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG) guidance (published March 2022) most relevant to the management of older people's bone health. Changes include intervention thresholds; using fracture probabilities from FRAX; for patients too frail to undergo DXA; greater emphasis on vertebral fracture detection and the use of intravenous zoledronate as a first-line anti-osteoporosis therapy; the new concept of 'very high fracture risk' which should prompt consideration of use of parenteral anti-osteoporosis therapy; new guidance regarding anabolic treatment options; concerns regarding denosumab cessation; and the urgent need to get patients with a fragility fracture onto treatment to reduce re-fracture risk with follow-up to check tolerance and ensure adherence.

Baseline FRAX hip fracture probability and observed incidence of fractures

Over 5 years of follow‐up, 3.5%, 11.6%, and 13.6% of the control arm sustained a new hip fracture, a new major osteoporotic fracture, or any new osteoporotic fracture, respectively. There was evidence of an increase in the observed incidence of hip and osteoporotic fractures in the control arm of the study (Fig. 1) across the range of baseline FRAX hip fracture probability. For example, the observed incidence of hip fracture was 6.5‐fold higher in the highest quintile of baseline risk compared with the lowest quintile of risk. The incidence of osteoporotic fractures also increased in a stepwise fashion across the quintiles of risk, but the increase was less marked than that found in hip fractures, with only a 2.3‐fold increase from lowest to highest quintile.

Consider BMD testing for postmenopausal women aged younger than 65 years who have one or more risk factors including thinness (body weight < 127 lb [57.7 kg] or BMI < 21 kg/m2) and increased fracture risk according to country-specific thresholds using FRAX; in the United States, thresholds are a 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture of at least 20% or of hip fracture of at least 3%. Use DXA as the preferred technique for BMD testing and categorization, and vertebral imaging is appropriate for women aged 70 years and older or with historical height loss of more than 1.5 in. The annual examination should include measurements of height and weight, assessment for chronic back pain, kyphosis, and clinical risk factors for osteoporosis, fractures, and falls.

### Implications of expanding indications for drug treatment to prevent fracture in older men in United States: cross sectional and longitudinal analysis of prospective cohort study [^111gMFh1]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Our study determined observed and FRAX predicted probabilities within mutually exclusive groups of men identified by osteoporosis status and fracture risk, as US professional societies have strongly recommended that clinicians consider both bone mineral density and fracture risk defined using NOF derived FRAX intervention thresholds in making the critical decision about whether to recommend drug treatment to a patient. We found a wide range of observed 10 year probabilities of hip and major osteoporotic fracture events across these distinct groups of men. As expected, observed probabilities were highest among men with osteoporosis as defined by WHO criteria using a young female specific normative database, intermediate among men with osteoporosis defined by NOF (but not WHO) criteria using a male specific normative database, intermediate among men without osteoporosis but at high fracture risk, and lowest among men without osteoporosis and at low fracture risk. Among men with osteoporosis by WHO criteria, one out of every five had a hip fracture and three out of every 10 had a major osteoporotic fracture. On the basis of evidence from randomized trials in women, these men with osteoporosis defined using a young female specific normative database are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fracture. However, our results indicated that fracture probabilities as calculated by the FRAX tool in this group of men underestimated their actual fracture risk. Because the FRAX tool did not underestimate fracture risk among men without osteoporosis, differences in predicted fracture probabilities across groups were smaller than actual observed differences in fracture probabilities. As patients may be prepared accept a higher absolute fracture risk than providers are before considering drug treatment to be justified, information about absolute fracture risk must be accurately conveyed to the patients most likely to benefit from treatment. In addition, evidence suggests that a large discrepancy may exist between NOF recommended FRAX intervention thresholds and acceptable intervention thresholds of patients.

The 2020 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guideline recommends evaluating all women 50 years or older for fracture risk and considering BMD measurement based on clinical fracture risk profile.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^114rYJT3]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Osteopenia/osteoporosis with endocrine therapy — tamoxifen can cause bone loss in premenopausal patients, but ovarian function suppression (OFS) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the most significant threat to bone density in women on endocrine therapy, and decreased bone density and bone quality leading to fractures is a common complication of AI therapy. Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture include advanced age, postmenopausal status, low body weight, current tobacco use, heavy alcohol use, history of long-term glucocorticoid use, history of nontraumatic fracture, increased fall risk, immobility, rheumatoid arthritis, and parental hip fracture, and patients with any of these risk factors need bone mineral density (BMD) assessment. Although not validated in cancer patients, tools like FRAX can assess fracture risk in osteopenic patients, identifying those who should receive bone-protective therapy based on clinical fracture risk. Patients on AI therapy or OFS should undergo BMD at baseline and at least every 2 years, and all patients should be encouraged to consume adequate amounts of calcium and vitamin D, minimize tobacco and alcohol use, and engage in balance, flexibility, and weight-bearing exercise as status allows. In general, bone-protective therapy is indicated for patients on AIs/OFS with frank osteoporosis (T-score ≤ 2.5 standard deviations or any T-score with a history of fragility fracture) or osteopenia and risk factors for fracture, using a higher T-score threshold for patients with multiple risk factors.

Osteoporosis in men — limitations of bone mineral density (BMD) T-score–only criteria are noted: criteria based only on BMD T-scores (T-score −2.5 or below in the spine or hip) are too restrictive because they identify too few men for therapy (< 10%), whereas approximately 25% of men experience a fracture after age 60, and a majority of men who fracture have T-scores that are better than −2.5; the use of FRAX identifies a larger proportion of older men in whom therapy appears to be cost-effective than use of T-scores alone, but these algorithms may not be sufficiently sensitive because they do not incorporate risk factors and because they consider only hip BMD.

### At odds about the odds: women's choices to accept osteoporosis medications Do not closely agree with physician-set treatment thresholds [^113TQsai]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis guidelines recommend pharmacologic therapy based on 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture, which may fail to account for patient-specific experiences and values.

Objective

We aimed to determine whether patient decisions to initiate osteoporosis medication agree with guideline-recommended intervention thresholds.

Design and Participants

This prospective cohort study included women aged ≥ 45 with age-associated osteoporosis who attended a group osteoporosis self-management consultation at a tertiary osteoporosis center.

Intervention

A group osteoporosis self-management consultation, during which participants received osteoporosis education and then calculated 1 their 10-year MOF and hip fracture risk using FRAX and 2 their predicted absolute fracture risk with therapy (assuming 40% relative reduction). Participants then made autonomous decisions regarding treatment initiation.

Main Measures

We evaluated agreement between treatment decisions and physician-set intervention thresholds (10-year MOF risk ≥ 20%, hip fracture risk ≥ 3%).

Key Results

Among 85 women (median [IQR] age 62 [58–67]), 27% accepted treatment (median [IQR] MOF risk, 15.1% [9.9–22.0]; hip fracture risk, 3.3% [1.3–5.3]), 46% declined (MOF risk, 9.5% [6.5–11.6]; hip fracture risk, 1.8% [0.6–2.3]), and 27% remained undecided (MOF risk, 14.0% [9.8–20.2]; hip fracture risk, 4.4% [1.7–4.9]). There was wide overlap in fracture risk between treatment acceptors and non-acceptors. Odds of accepting treatment were higher in women with prior fragility fracture (50% accepted; OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.9–15.2; p = 0.0015) and with hip fracture risk ≥ 3% (32% accepted; OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4–9.2; p = 0.012), but not MOF risk ≥ 20% (47% accepted; OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.0–8.5; p = 0.105).

Conclusions

Informed decisions to start osteoporosis treatment are highly personal and not easily predicted using fracture risk. Guideline-recommended intervention thresholds may not permit sufficient consideration of patient preferences.

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis: who to treat with what agent? [^115wqD8u]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Among the adverse events of glucocorticoid treatment are bone loss and fractures. Despite available, effective preventive measures, many patients receiving or initiating glucocorticoid therapy are not appropriately evaluated and treated for bone health and fracture risk. Populations with, or at risk of, glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) to target for these measures are defined on the basis of dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy and bone mineral density. That patients with GIOP should be treated as early as possible is generally agreed upon; however, diversity remains in intervention thresholds and management guidelines. The FRAX(®) algorithm provides a 10-year probability of fracture that can be adjusted according to glucocorticoid dose. There is no evidence that GIOP and postmenopausal osteoporosis respond differently to treatments. Available anti-osteoporotic therapies such as anti-resorptives including bisphosphonates and the bone anabolic agent teriparatide are effective for the management of GIOP. Prevention with calcium and vitamin D supplementation is less effective than specific anti-osteoporotic treatment. Anti-osteoporotic treatment should be stopped at the time of glucocorticoid cessation, unless the patient remains at increased risk of fracture.

### Management of patients with high baseline hip fracture risk by FRAX reduces hip fractures – A post hoc analysis of the SCOOP study [^113FMd4j]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and Methods

The SCOOP clinical study was a pragmatic, unblinded, two‐group, parallel, randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost‐effectiveness of screening to prevent fractures in older women; the design and results have been published previously. 12, 14 In brief, women aged 70 to 85 years, not already on osteoporosis medications but suitable to participate, were approached through primary‐care lists in and around seven regions of England. Written, informed consent was obtained from all agreeing to participate, and they completed a self‐filled questionnaire capturing the FRAX risk factors before being randomized to the intervention (screening) or control arm. Baseline data comprised age, sex, height, and weight for body mass index (BMI) calculation and dichotomized risk variables including a prior fragility fracture since the age of 50 years, parental history of hip fracture, current tobacco smoking, any long‐term use of oral glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, other causes of secondary osteoporosis, and daily alcohol consumption of ≥ 3 units daily. If the respondent did not know the answer to an individual question, a negative response was assumed.

In the screening arm, the baseline risk factor questionnaire was used to calculate the 10‐year probability of hip fracture using the FRAX risk algorithm. Women deemed at moderate to high risk of hip fracture were invited to undergo a dual‐energy X‐ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurement of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) measurement and the 10‐year hip fracture probability was recalculated with inclusion of BMD. The final risk category (low or high) was communicated to the participant and family doctor by letter; participants remaining at high risk after incorporation of BMD into FRAX were advised to make an appointment with their family doctor to discuss treatment options.

In the control arm, apart from a letter to the general practitioner informing them of their patient participating in the study, no additional information was provided and they received usual care. The baseline 10‐year FRAX probabilities, without the inclusion of BMD, were calculated at the end of the trial for comparative purposes only.

During 5 years of follow‐up, exposure to osteoporosis treatment was higher in the screening arm with around 24% of the screening arm participants receiving at least one prescription for anti‐osteoporosis medication compared with 16% of the control arm. The difference reflected a high uptake of treatment in the high‐risk group within the screening arm with 703 women (78.3% of the high‐risk group) having received at least one prescription of anti‐osteoporosis medication within 6 months of randomization.

### The effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment in the midwest [^114R6mAk]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and Methods

After institutional review board approval, patients who presented to our orthopedic trauma service were screened prospectively using our electronic medical record system. Patients who sustained fracture(s) regardless of location and mechanism were consecutively enrolled. Patients 55 years of age and older were chosen for their increased risk of fragility fracture. The study was carried out from May 15, 2016 to July 28, 2016; 100 patients participated. The sample size of 100 was chosen to obtain enough observations to be able to reasonably obtain precise estimates regarding the effectiveness of osteoporosis screening and treatment without exceeding the practical resource budget.

After obtaining informed consent, the patients were asked questions from the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX; available online at) to determine their FRAX score. The 12-question osteoporosis screening questionnaire included questions about patient demographics (age, sex, height, and weight) as well as questions regarding personal and family history. The UK version, rather than the US version, of the FRAX assessment tool was used to calculate the 10-year risk for hip and other major osteoporotic fractures because it includes management guidelines (US version does not). The UK version of the tool has been accepted by the International Osteoporosis Foundation for the use in all patient populations due to the treatment recommendations it generates. The FRAX assessment tool and the National Osteoporosis Guideline Group recommendationswere used to determine the adequacy of osteoporosis management.

Patients were also asked questions about osteoporosis through a study-specific questionnaire that aimed to identify their level of understanding, current and past management, and preventative education. Due to lack of availability of medical records in some patients (ie, new patients initially managed elsewhere), it was decided not to use electronic medical records to determine the history of osteoporosis diagnosis. All patients answered every question of the study-specific questionnaire to the best of their ability. Questions included the status of osteoporosis diagnosis; current treatment, if applicable; the level of understanding about treatment and osteoporosis; preventative education (eg, lifestyle changes); use of DXA screening; and history of fractures with the type of mechanism (Figure 1). Based on their response (yes/no) to the status of osteoporosis diagnosis, patients were separated into 2 groups for evaluation. Group A includes patients who answer "no" to the previous diagnosis of osteoporosis. Group B includes patients who answer "yes" to the previous diagnosis of osteoporosis.

### A comprehensive approach to fragility fractures [^115iZCER]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

To address the cause of fragility fractures, an understanding of the determinants of bone strength is needed. Identifying patients at increased fracture risk should take into account bone quantity, quality, and turnover. Postmenopausal osteoporosis remains the most common derangement of bone strength; however, decreased bone strength can also result from secondary causes of osteoporosis. In order to properly manage patients with fragility fractures, assessment should include a focused medical history and physical examination, proper laboratory investigation, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry screening, and, if necessary, use of the fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX). Treatment options will include nonpharmacologic treatment such as calcium and vitamin D and pharmacologic treatment with antiresorptive or anabolic agents to prevent future fractures. Bisphosphonates remain the standard treatment for osteoporosis. Concerns of oversuppression of bone turnover on long-term bisphosphonate treatment can be addressed with a drug holiday depending on the patient's fracture risk. An anabolic agent such as teriparatide is a powerful tool for the prevention of fragility fractures and should be reserved for patients at high risk for fracture, such as those with declining bone mineral density despite bisphosphonate treatment. Careful evaluation of all patients with a fragility fracture will enable the orthopaedic surgeon to identify the cause of fracture and implement a treatment plan that can prevent subsequent fractures in this vulnerable population.

### Clinical question: what is the best approach to managing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis? [^111yE3Ku]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is common, and the resulting fractures cause significant morbidity and mortality. Rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk occur soon after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and are dose dependent. The increase in fracture risk is partly independent of bone mineral density, probably as a result of changes in bone material properties and increased risk of falling. Fracture risk can be assessed using the FRAX algorithm, although risk may be underestimated in patients taking higher doses of glucocorticoids. Because of the rapidity of bone loss and increase in fracture risk after the start of glucocorticoid therapy, primary prevention should be advised in high-risk individuals, for example older women and men, individuals with a previous fracture history and those with low bone mineral density. Bisphosphonates are the front-line choice for the prevention of fracture in the majority of glucocorticoid-treated patients, with teriparatide as a second-line option. Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be co-prescribed unless there is evidence of an adequate dietary calcium intake and vitamin D status.

### Osteoporosis: the emperor has no clothes [^116tE4gQ]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 4
Fracture risk prediction tools seem to expand the treatment thresholds. Whatever the FRAX® score for a given patient, the outcome is almost always the same: drug therapy.

Despite these concerns, the use of a 'high-risk' identification strategy through fracture risk assessment tools is also recommended by many national guidelines, including the FRAX® in the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), the NOGG, Osteoporosis Canada and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Against this background, it is noteworthy that, to our knowledge, the effect of these tools in selecting patients for therapy and thus improving fracture outcomes has not been determined to date. Efficacy studies of bone-specific drugs have largely been undertaken in individuals with low BMD and previous fractures. It thus remains uncertain whether the treatment is as effective when prescribed on the basis of clinical risk factors and related risk assessment. For example, the antifracture efficacy of risedronate could not be demonstrated in women over the age of 80 who were selected primarily on the basis of their risk of falling. Neither is there proof from pharmaceutical interventions that fracture risk would actually be reduced in those with a high FRAX® score, and whether FRAX® in daily practice improves decision-making and, ultimately, patient-important outcomes remains unproven. A recent re-analysis of the data from the large Fracture Intervention Trial (FIT) showed no significant association between FRAX® score and reduction in fractures by alendronate. In summary, the utility of fracture prediction tools for selecting individuals for bone protective treatment needs to be confirmed before their widespread use can be recommended.

Very high fracture risk

The concept of 'very high fracture risk' is new and is indicated by the presence of one or more important CRFs, or 'red flags', such as a recent (within 2 years) vertebral fracture, or ≥ 2 vertebral fractures (whenever they happened), a BMD T-Score ≤ −3.5, treatment with high dose glucocorticoids (≥ 7.5 mg/day of prednisolone or equivalent over 3 months), the presence of multiple CRFs particularly with a recent fragility fracture which indicates high imminent risk of re-fracture, or other indicators of very high fracture risk, such as by FRAX assessment. As age is such a strong predictor of fracture risk, it is estimated that 32.5% of people aged ≥ 70 years will be at very high fracture risk based on FRAX estimates. A conditional recommendation is made: those with very high risk should be considered for referral to an osteoporosis specialist in secondary care, for assessment and consideration of parenteral treatment. Without consideration, this could translate to a very high number of secondary care referrals. The guideline explains a conditional recommendation applies 'where the clinician examines the evidence within the wider health and social context and discusses the choices with the patient, taking into account the patient's values and preferences, or where documentation of the discussion of the pros and cons of an intervention is the indicator of quality, rather than the course of action itself'. This patient-centred holistic approach to decision-making will be very familiar to geriatricians. It is important when deciding on a treatment pathway to consider the patient's wishes, their ability to attend a hospital, the fact that delays in treatment initiation (while waiting for a hospital appointment) increase fracture risk as well as the potential benefit of the treatment options.

For those too frail to have a DXA, new post-FRAX intervention thresholds indicate whom to treat.
'Very high fracture risk' is indicated by 'red flags', consider using parenteral anti-osteoporosis treatments here.
When initiating oral bisphosphonates in older patients, counsel them for 10 years of treatment.
Denosumab cessation needs careful planning due to the increased risk of vertebral fractures.

### Approaches to the targeting of treatment for osteoporosis [^1111ajRh]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Fractures are a clinical consequence of osteoporosis, and represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Several treatments have been shown to decrease the risk of fracture, but problems arise in identifying individuals at high fracture risk so that treatments can be effectively targeted. The case for widespread population screening using bone mineral density testing is weak, as these tests lack sensitivity. Case-finding algorithms are available in many countries, but differ markedly in their approaches. Recent developments in fracture risk assessment include the availability of the FRAX (WHO Collaborating Center for Bone Metabolic Disease, Sheffield, UK) tool, which integrates the weight of clinical risk factors for fracture risk with or without information on bone mineral density, and computes the 10-year probability of fracture. The tool increases sensitivity without trading specificity, and is now being used in the reappraisal of clinical guidelines.

### Reassessment intervals for transition from low to high fracture risk among adults older than 50 years [^114ZtR4K]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis is characterized by susceptibility to fracture, with substantial health consequences for the individual and society. Bone mineral density (BMD) is associated with fracture risk but has low sensitivity, with most fractures occurring above the threshold for osteoporosis diagnosis (≥ 2.5 SDs below peak bone mass; T-score, –2.5 or lower). Fracture risk prediction algorithms that incorporate clinical risk factors independent of BMD have been developed to target high-risk individuals for treatment. At present, the fracture risk assessment (FRAX) tool is the most widely used and has been incorporated into more than 100 clinical practice guidelines. The FRAX tool evaluates 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), defined as a composite of hip, clinical spine, distal forearm, and proximal humerus, and 10-year risk of hip fracture based on age, sex, body mass index, 7 additional clinical risk factors, and (optionally) femoral neck BMD. When used with BMD, the FRAX tool provides a higher sensitivity than BMD alone.

Repeated BMD testing is commonly performed, with a substantial proportion of women receiving repeated tests within 2 years, a practice questioned by the Choosing Wisely campaign, speaking to the need for guidance to help clinicians make higher-value decisions regarding repeated BMD measurement. Studies examining BMD loss and transition to osteoporosis have provided insights into BMD testing intervals according to the level of baseline BMD. Subsequent analyses have evaluated time to reach clinically relevant fracture risk for those who fall below the treatment threshold at baselineand the doubling time in fracture risk, although these have not adequately considered baseline fracture risk relative to the treatment threshold, which would be expected to affect treatment eligibility. Specifically, one would expect a shorter interval for those just below the treatment threshold and a longer interval for those well below the treatment threshold. Change in clinical risk factors would also be expected to affect time to treatment qualification, with a shorter interval for those with new clinical risk factors and a longer interval for those with a reduction in clinical risk factors.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^1113sskP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Patient–clinician communication and personalized screening for osteoporosis in adult cancer survivors highlights that it is important for clinicians to initiate discussion about the risks of developing osteopenia or osteoporosis as part of the treatment decision‑making process and to revisit it after treatment has ended, and that management of bone health should be part of an overall survival plan supported by a multidisciplinary team. The choice of risk assessment tools, such as FRAX, could be discussed with patients; most patients who are at risk should be offered BMD with dual‑energy X‑ray absorptiometry (DXA), but in settings in which DXA is not available providers and patients should discuss alternatives, and the frequency of screening should be personalized according to the risk of bone loss, results of the baseline screening test, and patient preference.

### Intervals between bone density testing [^111NvuRF]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2014). Low credibility.

There is a wide range of practices regarding times between bone density (BMD) measurements in osteopenic women. If decisions to treat osteoporosis are to be based on absolute fracture risk, then projections of fracture risk are a logical basis for determining appropriate intervals for BMD testing. Fracture risk depends mainly on age and BMD, and bone loss in older women is relatively constant at ∼1% annually, so it is possible to project fracture risk into the future and estimate when an individual's risk will approach the threshold for intervention. Modeling scenarios for a range of osteopenic baseline BMDs in 65-year-old women shows a remarkable consistency in the doubling time for Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX)-assessed fracture risk: 5 to 6 years. This estimate is of immediate relevance to clinical practice in that it can be used to determine how long to wait before reassessing BMD and fracture risk in women whose other risk factors are stable.

Other risk-assessment and imaging methods — T-score values obtained with ultrasound or quantitative computed tomography (CT) are not substitutes for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) because they may overestimate or underestimate BMD and thus fracture risk, and for patients unable to have hip or spine DXA, assessing fracture risk with FRAX without BMD provides more useful information than BMD measured by alternate techniques. Biomechanical CT analyzes quantitative CT scans of the LS and hip with finite element analysis and predicts fracture risk, but its advantage over DXA is small; access is limited and its role in routine clinical practice has not been defined. Trabecular bone score analyzes heterogeneity on routine LS DXA images, correlates with trabecular microarchitecture, predicts fracture risk independently from bone density, has recently been incorporated into FRAX, and is most helpful in women whose fracture risk is near the treatment threshold. Assessing fall risk, emphasizing a recent fall, is important in older women, and the Stopping Elderly Accidents Deaths and Injury initiative provides an algorithm for fall-risk screening.

### Management of patients with high baseline hip fracture risk by FRAX reduces hip fractures – A post hoc analysis of the SCOOP study [^117EgfBA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

Because BMD measurements were not undertaken in all participants, the FRAX 10‐year hip fracture probability calculated without BMD was used in the analyses because this was available in both the control and intervention groups. A Poisson model was used to study the relationship between age, the time since baseline, invitation for screening, and FRAX 10‐year probability of hip fracture on the one hand, and on the other hand, the risk of any fracture, osteoporotic fracture or hip fracture with only one fracture being counted per patient during follow‐up (expressed as person‐years). A reduction in hip fracture risk that showed no interaction, with a flat reduction in risk across the range of baseline risk, would have suggested that factors other than treatment could have explained the observed effect.

All analyses were conducted on an intention‐to‐treat basis with participants analyzed according to the group to which they were randomized, irrespective of whether screening was completed. The hazard function was assumed to be exp(β₀ + β₁ · current time from baseline + β₂ · current age + β₃ · 10‐year probability + β₄ · screening + β₅ · 10‐year probability · screening). The beta coefficients reflect the importance of the variables as in a logistic model, and βₓ = 0 denotes that the corresponding variable does not contribute to fracture risk. The variable "10‐year probability · screening" tested for an interaction between screening effectiveness and baseline 10‐year probability, handled as a continuous variable, by determining if β₅ ≠ 0. Hazard ratios (HR) for screening effect and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were computed as a continuous variable. For presentation, hazard ratios were shown at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentile of fracture probability. Further analyses explored the interaction between effectiveness and individual clinical risk factors within FRAX to determine the drivers of any potential interaction. A similar analysis was conducted for any fracture and all incident osteoporotic fractures. An exploratory analysis used the 10‐year probability of major osteoporotic fracture instead of hip fracture as the baseline risk.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a clinical review [^113fbdn2]. Journal of Women's Health (2018). Low credibility.

In postmenopausal women, osteoporotic fractures are more common than stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer combined, and fractures can be costly and result in disability or death. Because there are no signs or symptoms of osteoporosis other than fracture, risk assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk for clinical events. For women, a clinical fracture risk assessment (FRAX) is appropriate at menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended for women at age 65, and earlier for those who have risk factors. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise are important for bone health at all ages, and those at high risk for fracture based on BMD or FRAX should be offered medical therapy to reduce fracture risk after an appropriate medical evaluation. Bisphosphonates can accumulate in bone, so after a period of treatment, lower risk patients may be offered a period off drug therapy. However, the effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment is discontinued, so there is no "drug holiday" with denosumab. Anabolic therapy can be offered to those with higher risk for fracture. Although rare safety concerns regarding atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw have received prominent attention, for patients who are appropriately treated according to National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, the benefit of hip fracture risk reduction far outweighs the risk of these uncommon side effects. Accurate information for patients and shared decision-making are important for acceptance and persistent with appropriate treatment.

### Pre-treatment bone mineral density and the benefit of pharmacologic treatment on fracture risk and BMD change: analysis from the FNIH-ASBMR SABRE project [^114Wgy9Q]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Antiosteoporotic medications did not significantly reduce non-vertebral or clinical fracture risk in the highest BMD quintile (T-scores above −1.7) either for all studies or when limiting to bisphosphonates. Prior to this study, there was a concern that treatments do not affect non-vertebral fractures in patients with T-score above −2.5. This was shown in the FIT II trial, where alendronate did not reduce the risk of non-vertebral and all fractures in the group with FN BMD T-score > −2.5. These trials are mostly antiresorptive medications and these work by lowering bone turnover and a high bone turnover increases the risk for vertebral fractures by increasing the number of stress risers and this is why antiresorptives are particularly effective for this fracture type. In general, the magnitude of the risk reduction is much larger for vertebral fractures than for non-vertebral fractures. This is also true for non-antiresorptive medications. Also, many of the studies included criteria related to existing vertebral fractures thus increasing the risk for additional vertebral fractures during follow-up. For both of these reasons, the precision error of the estimates of vertebral fractures reduction is much smaller which could be an important contributor to the additional consistency in vertebral fracture reductions.

Our analysis suggests that the BMD T-score threshold for treatment could be higher than −2.5 that is −1.7. However, many clinical guidelines for starting antiosteoporosis medications incorporate other fracture risk factors or fracture risk estimates (eg, FRAX) together with BMD. An example is the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundationrecommendations that BMD T-score < −2.5 is sufficient alone for treatment but in those with BMD T-score between −2.5 and −1.0, a 3% 10-yr FRAX risk for hip fractures or 20% for major osteoporotic fractures is also required for recommending pharmacologic treatment. The attraction of using estimates like FRAX is that it estimates absolute fracture risk.

There are several strengths of our study. It is a large, comprehensive study which used IPD from all major osteoporosis trials to create a large database including a very large number of participants. Moreover, a variety of medications were evaluated. We used harmonized fracture definitions across the trials and standardized DXA BMD values across manufacturers.

### Implementing an electronic medical record osteoporosis self-assessment tool score which identifies patients at risk for osteoporosis promotes osteoporosis evaluation [^111KaiHE]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporosis, a systemic skeletal disease resulting in the deterioration of the micro architecture of bone tissue, affects an estimated 10.2 million adults in the U.S.while another 43.4 million adults have low bone mass. The diagnosis of osteoporosis established by the World Health Organization (WHO) is based on the occurrence of adulthood hip or vertebral fragility fracture in the absence of major trauma, or by central Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) T-score at or below −2.5; low bone mass (or osteopenia) is meanwhile defined by T-scores ranging between −1.0 to −2.5. According to guidelines published by the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, bone mineral density (BMD) testing should be performed by DXA for: 1) women age 65 and older and men age 70 and older, 2) postmenopausal women and men above age 50–69, based on risk factor profile, and 3) postmenopausal women and men age 50 and older who have had an adult age fracture, to diagnose and determine the degree of osteoporosis. Screening methods remain inadequate, however, leaving the disease underdiagnosed; a prior report noted only 12% of patients receiving a correct diagnosis of osteoporosis after a fracture, leaving the disease grossly underdiagnosed.

There are many barriers to the implementation of care of osteoporosis that involve lack of knowledge from both the physician and the patient. Some of these include the perception by the orthopedic surgeon that the osteoporosis diagnosis and treatment is not their responsibility, low rates of referral to an appropriate osteoporosis service, the cost of therapy, side effects of medication, poor patient follow up, non-adherence to medication regimen, patient's fear of treatment side effects, and multiple medical comorbidities. Due to these barriers, the quality of life of these patients suffers. In addition, there is a high cost of treatment and management of fragility fracture that occurs due to osteoporosis. As an example, in 2005, the direct cost of fragility fractures alone were US$17 billion. Annually, there are about 1.5–2 million fractures in the US. Worldwide, osteoporosis causes more than 8.9 million fractures annually, resulting in an osteoporotic fracture every 3 seconds. This number is expected to rise as the WHO estimates that 6 million hip fractures alone will occur each year worldwide by the year 2050, when 1 in every 5 individuals will be over 50.

### An update on dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [^11534dmo]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure bone mineral density at the spine and hip have an important role in the evaluation of individuals at risk of osteoporosis, and in helping clinicians advise patients about the appropriate use of antifracture treatment. Compared with alternative bone densitometry techniques, hip and spine DXA examinations have several advantages that include a consensus that bone mineral density results should be interpreted using the World Health Organization T score definition of osteoporosis, a proven ability to predict fracture risk, proven effectiveness at targeting antifracture therapies, and the ability to monitor response to treatment. This review discusses the evidence for these and other clinical aspects of DXA scanning. Particular attention is directed at the new World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) algorithm, which uses clinical risk factors in addition to a hip DXA scan to predict a patient's 10-year probability of suffering an osteoporotic fracture. We also discuss the recently published clinical guidelines that incorporate the FRAX fracture risk assessment in decisions about patient treatment.

### FRAX without bone mineral density versus osteoporosis self-assessment screening tool as predictors of osteoporosis in primary screening of individuals aged 70 and older [^112WxfiM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare two well-validated tools — the FRAX without bone mineral density (BMD) and the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Screening Tool (OST) — in predicting osteoporosis and to define thresholds above and below which it would be reasonable to recommend omitting BMD testing.

Design

Retrospective review.

Setting

General practices in Western Australia.

Participants

Individuals aged 70 and older responding to a prospective audit of osteoporosis investigation and management for whom dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan results and clinical risk factor data were available (N = 626).

Measurements

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were compared, upper and lower thresholds for omission of screening BMD were proposed, and the statistical performance measures for the tests are reported.

Results

The areas under the ROC curves for the OST (0.76–0.82) were slightly better than for FRAX without BMD 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk (0.64–0.76) in predicting osteoporosis at the defined sites. At defined lower thresholds, the tests were comparable in identifying a group with low osteoporosis risk (sensitivity 89.6–92.2%, specificity 35.0–39.9%), translating into 33.5% to 36.1% of tests saved at a cost of missing 7.8% to 10.4% of individuals with osteoporosis on BMD criteria. It was not possible to identify a useful upper threshold.

Conclusion

At the defined thresholds, the OST is as good as FRAX without BMD in identifying a low-risk population subgroup for whom screening BMD can reasonably be omitted. This could reduce costs and improve access to treatment.

### Prostate cancer, version 3.2026, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115kAF5B]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Prostate cancer — bone health during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) — ADT was associated with a 21% to 54% relative increase in fracture risk, and bone mineral density of the hip and spine decreases by approximately 2% to 3% per year during initial therapy; in a population-based cohort of 3295 patients, surgical castration had a lower fracture risk than medical castration using an LHRH agonist (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62–0.94; P = 0.01). A baseline bone mineral density study should be considered for the patients on ADT; the National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include calcium (1000–1200 mg daily) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily), and additional treatment for males aged greater than or equal to 50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5) at specified sites and a 10-year probability of hip fracture greater than or equal to 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture greater than or equal to 20%; fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX®, and ADT should be considered "secondary osteoporosis" using the FRAX® algorithm. Evidence includes a phase 3 study that randomized 1468 patients in which, at 24 months, denosumab increased bone mineral density by 6.7% and reduced fractures (1.5% vs. 3.9%) compared to placebo. When drug therapy is warranted by absolute fracture risk, treatment with denosumab (60 mg every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), or alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) is recommended; a baseline DEXA before start of therapy and a follow-up DEXA after one year is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry; use of biochemical markers of bone turnover is not recommended, and there are no existing guidelines on the optimal frequency of vitamin D testing, but vitamin D levels can be measured when DEXA scans are obtained.

### Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer. part I: intermediate-/ high-risk and locally advanced disease, biochemical relapse, and side effects of hormonal treatment: report of the advanced prostate cancer consensus conference 2022 [^114Ht6R1]. European Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Q127. For patients with mHSPC with severe voiding symptoms, the panel voted on their preferred type of ADT when starting this treatment: 64% of panellists voted for LHRH antagonist, 33% voted for starting with LHRH with initial flare protection (with any kind of ARPI), and 3% voted for orchiectomy. There were five abstentions. (No consensus for any given answer option.)

Bone health has been discussed at prior APCCCs. In 2022, panellists voted on questions related to bone health agents in mHSPC. Since the most recent APCCC (held in 2019), the ESMO has released new guidelines. For patients with cancer who are receiving chronic endocrine therapy that is known to accelerate bone loss (ADT in the case of prostate cancer), in addition to basic measures (calcium and vitamin D3 supplementation, exercise, smoking cessation, and no or low alcohol consumption), a risk-adapted approach is recommended that incorporates the following risk factors: T score < −1.5, smoking (current and historical), body mass index < 24, family history of hip fracture, personal history of fragility fracture at > 50 yr of age, and oral glucocorticoid use for > 6 mo. Patients with a T score of ≥ −2.0 and no additional risk factors can undergo observation, with bone mineral density (BMD) reassessed in 1–2 yr, while patients who have two or more of the above risk factors or a T score of < −2 are recommended to start denosumab or a bisphosphonate at the dose and schedule used for osteopenia/osteoporosis. Web-based tools such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) currently do not integrate cancer treatment-induced bone loss but can still help clinicians evaluate risk factors for fracture and calculate individual fracture risk.

Survivorship osteoporosis management — screening and bone-modifying agent (BMA) thresholds: DXA screening should occur at least every 2 years and once per year in some cases, if clinically indicated, and the decision to treat with BMA should be guided by the estimated fracture risk using a guide such as FRAX calculator; FRAX may underestimate the true fracture risk for those beginning high-risk treatment, so those survivors of cancer receiving ADT, AI, GnRH agonists, or chronic glucocorticoids or undergoing allogeneic transplantation, or those who developed CIOF should be deemed to have secondary osteoporosis when using FRAX; if a survivor of nonmetastatic cancer has an estimated 10-year fracture risk that exceeds 3% and/or 20% nonhip major osteoporotic fracture risk, then BMAs are indicated; the choice of either oral or IV bisphosphonate or subcutaneous RANK-L inhibitor should be based on patient preference, adherence, and cost, and before initiating a BMA, a dental screening exam should be performed.

### Postacute management of older adults suffering an osteoporotic hip fracture: a consensus statement from the international geriatric fracture society [^1164gpi1]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention of Osteoporosis

Hip fracture patients should be evaluated for future fracture risk using the FRAX score. Basic interventions should include vitamin D repletion, optimization of nutritional status, and lifestyle modification. Patients should be referred to a fracture liaison (if available) or providers with expertise in osteoporosis such as rheumatologists or endocrinologists before being discharged from a PAC facility.

Patients who suffer fragility fractures are at higher risk of developing subsequent fractures. Despite this increased risk, only a fraction of these patients receive treatment for osteoporosis. - As bone mineral density only can account for less than 50% of bone strength, secondary prevention should be considered even in patients with bone densities outside of the range considered for osteoporosis. The FRAX score is a validated tool that helps assess fracture risk in men and women and takes into consideration characteristics such as age, body habitus, family history, and use of medications, among others.

During the PAC facility stay, nutritional status should be assessed, and vitamin D levels should be measured, if not checked in the hospital, and supplemental vitamin D prescribed if indicated. Although the quality of the evidence regarding their effectiveness is variable, lifestyle modifications such as exercise and diet should be part of the treatment plan. - Conditions that can contribute to osteoporosis should be considered, including thyroid, parathyroid, kidney, neurological, obesity, hypogonadism, malignancies, and malabsorption disorders based on the patient's history, symptoms, and physical signs.

Starting pharmacologic treatment may be appropriate, even in those with shorter life expectancy. Due to the relative complexity of the workup and the controversial concerns from orthopedic professional societies regarding the right time to start treatment and its effects on fracture healing, the use of antiabsorbing agents (ie, bisphosphonates) may be delayed until discharged from the PAC facility. Appropriate coordination of care through fracture liaison services has demonstrated to be a cost-effective strategy to reduce refracture risk and mortality. If such a service is not available, good communication with the primary care provider or a specialist with expertise in the treatment of osteoporosis such as an endocrinologist or a rheumatologist is important. If there is a significant concern about appropriate follow-up or compliance, starting treatment during the PAC stay is a reasonable and safe option.

### The utility and limitations of using trabecular bone score with FRAX [^112yr3Ci]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Trabecular bone score (TBS) is a texture index derived from the lumbar spine dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry which can assess skeletal quality and provide information about fracture risk independent of bone mineral density (BMD). TBS is useful in assessing osteoporotic fracture risk, with lower TBS values associated with increased fracture risk. In this article, we review the current state of TBS, including its utility and limitations in the assessment and management of osteoporosis, with particular emphasis on the recent literature.

Recent Findings

Ten-year fracture risk assessment using the FRAX tool can be improved through the use of a TBS adjustment. The use of TBS-adjusted FRAX can change management in a modest but significant number of patients, particularly in those close to an intervention threshold. Change in lumbar spine TBS for patients undergoing antiresorptive treatment is not a useful indicator of antifracture effect.

Summary

Lumbar spine TBS provides information complementary to conventional BMD, and has been shown to be clinically useful for enhancing fracture risk prediction.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^113W5ySg]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Successful treatment and treat-to-target concepts — postmenopausal osteoporosis: Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments aim to prevent fractures, randomized trials have demonstrated a reduction in fracture risk in patients with stable or increasing BMD receiving pharmacologic therapy, particularly with bisphosphonates versus placebo, and the goal of treatment is prevention of fractures although no treatment can eliminate risk of fracture. A fracture during therapy is not necessarily a treatment failure and should trigger reconsideration of fracture risk factors and possible changes in treatment strategies; the risk of fracture is higher after a recent fracture and diminishes over time, and the number, severity, and recency of vertebral fractures are directly correlated with risk of future fractures. Response to therapy is not necessarily the same as achieving an acceptable level of fracture risk, leading to proposals for treat-to-target goals; an ASBMR/NOF task force was formed to review evidence and propose targets, but at this time treatment targets have not been identified. When treatment is initiated due to a low DXA T-score (such as −2.5 or lower), a higher T-score is an intuitive target, and when treatment is started due to high fracture probability with FRAX it is intuitive that fracture probability be reduced below the threshold for starting treatment; a change in BTMs is also a possible target, and challenges to defining targets include limited comparative effectiveness data, lack of consensus on acceptable risk, and limited effectiveness particularly for nonvertebral fractures.

### Management of patients with high baseline hip fracture risk by FRAX reduces hip fractures – A post hoc analysis of the SCOOP study [^112UM7Fq]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2018). Low credibility.

Effectiveness and relationship to FRAX

In Table 3, the effects of screening on various categories of fracture outcomes are shown, according to the baseline FRAX 10‐year probability of a hip fracture. The latter was entered as a continuous variable in the model, but for illustrative purposes, the table shows the effect at various values of baseline probability. Confidence estimates for the hazard ratio crossed unity at all probabilities for any fracture and osteoporotic fractures, with no evidence of an interaction between effectiveness and baseline FRAX hip fracture probability.

Table 3
Hazard Ratio (95% Confidence Interval) Between Screening and Control Arms for any Fracture, Osteoporotic Fracture, and Hip Fracture at Different Values of FRAX 10‐Year Probability (%) of a Hip Fracture Calculated Without Bone Mineral Density

In contrast, the hazard ratio showed an interaction with baseline FRAX hip fracture probability for the outcome of hip fracture (p = 0.021), and the upper confidence intervals were below unity at higher baseline risk (Table 3). The interaction between screening effect and fracture probability for the outcome of hip fracture is shown in Fig. 2. At the median value of baseline hip fracture probability in the whole study population (6.3%), invitation for screening was associated with a 15% reduction in hip fracture risk albeit with a 95% CI that included the null. At the 90th centile of the whole population risk (16.8%), there was a larger 33% reduction with a 95% CI that excluded the null, and at the 90th centile of baseline risk in the high‐risk population (32%), the reduction was even higher at 53% (95% CI 26% to 70%) (Fig. 2).

In brief, we captured self‐reported fractures as well as searching routine Hospital Episode Statistics data, comprising information on hospital inpatient stays and emergency department attendance, together with primary‐care records to identify fractures in any of the study participants from the point of randomization until the end of follow‐up. Only independently confirmed fractures were included. Incident osteoporosis‐related fractures were defined as those excluding the hands, feet, nose, skull, or cervical vertebrae. Hip fractures were defined as verified fractures with a specific description of "neck of femur" or "proximal femur".

### Bone management in Japanese patients with prostate cancer: hormonal therapy leads to an increase in the FRAX score [^115jjqrA]. BMC Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study revealed that ADT increased the FRAX score and that the duration of ADT correlated with the FRAX score. In particular for prostate cancer patients treated with hormonal therapy, fractures are a major complication which can influence both the activities of daily life and life expectancy. Although the median 10-year probability of major osteoporotic and hip fracture risks were not higher than expected, 7.9 and 2.7%, respectively, ADT elevated those probabilities as expected. It is plausible that patients who received ADT were comparatively older than those who received brachytherapy or RRP. We found that the FRAX score correlated with the duration of ADT. In most of the patients in the brachytherapy-treated group, ADT was performed within one year. Consequently, there were no large differences occurred within the brachytherapy group regardless of whether the patients received ADT or not. ADT, a common treatment option for patients with prostate cancer that reduces circulating testosterone levels, has a detrimental effect on BMD, leading to a substantial increase in the fracture risk. Men undergoing ADT are four times more likely to develop significant bone deficiency. ADT is known to cause a decrease in BMD, and therefore patients who receive ADT should be assumed to have secondary osteoporosis when calculating the fracture risk using the FRAX score. It has been well established that fractures are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study showed that the increase in FRAX score by ADT correlated with the duration of ADT. During ADT, it might be recommended that patients, especially those who have received ADT for longer periods of time, perform regular muscle-strengthening exercises or increase their vitamin D intake.

Although ADT use was positively correlated with the FRAX score (R² = 0.141), the correlation was not so high. We speculate that the relatively weak correlation resulted from the use of the FRAX score for assessment rather than the DEXA score. We are presently conducting another study to reveal the correlation between the ADT time and the risk of fracture using the DEXA score and some bone related biomarkers. Although there were some indications for intervention to prevent fracture, we set the cut-off point as 20% in patients with major osteoporosis and 3% in patients with hip fracture because a 10-year probability of major osteoporotic risk > 20% and hip fracture > 3% is considered to represent a clinically-relevant degree of risk according to the American National Osteoporosis Foundation Clinician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis. Our study also found that the ADT group showed a significantly higher fracture risk, which requires fracture prevention.

For FRAX, there is no such threshold defined with respect to its use in screening. However, to provide context, a 65-year-old White female with a body mass index of 25 and no risk factors has a 10-year risk of hip fracture of 1. 3% and a 10-year risk of MOF of
9. 3% based on FRAX without BMD input. FRAX in women ranged from 0. 65 to
0. 67 without BMD and from 0. 67 to
0. 71 when BMD was included, and the AUCs for 10-year risk of hip fracture for FRAX in women ranged from 0. 74 to
0. 77 without BMD and ranged from 0. 76 to
0. 79 when BMD was included. 49–51. For example, for FRAX without BMD, the AUCs for 10-year risk of MOF ranged from
0. 56 to 0. 59 across 3 studies, 52–54 and the AUCs for 10-year risk of hip fracture were
0. 65 and 0. 68 in 2 analyses reported in 1 study. 53 For studies reporting outcomes for men, the AUCs ranged from 0. 63 to 0.
93. 1, 46.

The mean or median 10-year FRAX-estimated risk of MOF was 19% in SCOOP, 20% in ROSE, and
24. 6% in SOS; the respective 10-year estimated hip fracture risks were 8. 5%,
6. 7%, and 11. 6%. 55–57 Test results and treatment recommendations were shared with participants' primary care physicians, who made final decisions about treatment; the comparison group in all 3 studies was routine care. A pooled analysis of these studies found a statistically significant reduction in hip fractures and MOF. The pooled relative risk for the effect of screening on hip fractures was 0. 83, and the pooled RR for MOF was 0.
94. This corresponded to an absolute risk difference of 5 few.

Statement 100. We recommend that patients starting corticosteroids should be assessed for risk of osteoporosis. Those at high risk should be started on bisphosphonate therapy at the onset of corticosteroid therapy (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence), after ensuring adequate calcium intake and supplementing vitamin D (Agreement: 90.7%).

Reduction in bone mineral density and fracture risk are worsened by oral corticosteroid use, and the greatest bone loss occurs in the first 6 months of treatment. Before starting oral steroids, patients should have their fracture risk assessed as shown in figure 5. For patients aged over 40, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) can be used to assess the 10 year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture. Patients with a high FRAX score (score ≥ 20% major fracture and ≥ 3% hip fracture), those aged under 40 with risk factors or those receiving prolonged (more than 3 months) or repeated courses of oral corticosteroids should have their bone mineral density assessed by bone densitometry. Note that FRAX does not discriminate past versus current corticosteroid use, nor does it stratify risk according to doses beyond 7.5 mg, and risk should be adjusted accordingly. Patients on long-term steroids should have a repeat bone densitometry at 1 year, and if stable, repeated at 2–3-year intervals, but if declining, repeated annually. Women and men aged 70 or more, with past fragility fracture, taking high-dose steroids (7.5 mg or more prednisolone-equivalent), or at high risk based on FRAX score, should be considered for bone-protective therapy at the start of steroid treatment. Alendronate or risedronate should be used, unless contra-indicated or not tolerated, in which case intravenous zoledronate or teriparatide should be given. For women of childbearing age requiring bone-protective therapy, if they are taking effective contraception (or not sexually active), oral bisphosphonates are the first-line therapy followed by teriparatide if oral bisphosphonates cannot be used. Denusomab and high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates should not be used in this situation due to lack of data on the risk of fetal harm should an unplanned pregnancy occur. There is a lack of safety data on use of denosumab with immunosuppressive therapy, and on all osteoporosis therapies during pregnancy, other than calcium and vitamin D.

### External validation and comparison of three prediction tools for risk of osteoporotic fractures using data from population based electronic health records: retrospective cohort study [^114ZUY9W]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and practice implications

Current guidelines for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture incorporate fracture prediction tools; the UK's National Osteoporosis Guideline Group (NOGG)supports the use of age dependent risk cut-offs as an indication for treatment, regardless of bone mineral density, and a lower set of cut-offs as an indication for performing bone mineral density scanning. Another approach, adopted by the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) in the US, recommends using a constant cut-off as indication for treatment in osteopenic patients (with borderline bone mineral density). However, even with clear recommendations from the professional committees, uptake in the adoption of these tools in practice is not widespread. This is in part due to the lack of an automated decision support infrastructure that allows clinicians easy access to patients' risk for fractures. The current study showed that two of the three tools assessed offer good discrimination for hip fracture prediction using electronic health record data, which could be incorporated into the electronic health record system and automatically raise an alert for clinicians when a patient is indicated to be at high risk.

Our results were consistent with previous findings that the best discrimination was associated with prediction of hip fractures, which are known to be associated with the greatest morbidity and mortality. Because the calibration can be corrected for a local population, the selection of a tool should primarily be based on its discriminative ability. In an electronic health record system where all input variables are available for automatic implementation, our study suggests that QFracture yields the best discriminatory performance for hip fracture prediction. If some of the input variables are not available, FRAX, which performed almost as well, despite not being developed using data from electronic health records, could be a simpler option for implementation of decision support. However, to identify those at risk for all major osteoporotic fractures, FRAX yielded slightly better discrimination, and thus may be preferable. The selected tool should only be used for the age ranges for which it was developed. Since all tools underestimated the risk of hip fractures in our population, the selected tool will require local calibration when implemented in practice, as the guidelines are based on specific risk cut-offs. This calibration will be more straightforward for FRAX, which showed steadier calibration but will require age dependent calibration of the other tools.

### Time to clinically relevant fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women [^113iusk4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend use of fracture risk scores for screening and pharmacologic treatment decisions. The timing of occurrence of treatment-level (according to 2014 National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines) or screening-level (according to 2011 US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines) fracture risk scores has not been estimated in postmenopausal women.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective competing risk analysis of new occurrence of treatment-level and screening-level fracture risk scores in postmenopausal women aged 50 years and older, prior to receipt of pharmacologic treatment and prior to first hip or clinical vertebral fracture.

Results

In 54,280 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 64 years without a bone mineral density test, the time for 10% to develop a treatment-level FRAX score could not be estimated accurately because of rare incidence of treatment-level scores. In 6096 women who had FRAX scores calculated with bone mineral density, the estimated unadjusted time to treatment-level FRAX ranged from 7.6 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.6–8.7) for those aged 65 to 69, to 5.1 years (95% CI, 3.5–7.5) for those aged 75 to 79 at baseline. Of 17,967 women aged 50 to 64 with a screening-level FRAX at baseline, 100 (0.6%) experienced a hip or clinical vertebral fracture by age 65 years.

Conclusions

Postmenopausal women with sub-threshold fracture risk scores at baseline were unlikely to develop a treatment-level FRAX score between ages 50 and 64 years. After age 65, the increased incidence of treatment-level fracture risk scores, osteoporosis, and major osteoporotic fracture supports more frequent consideration of FRAX and bone mineral density testing.

Trabecular bone score (TBS) and FRAX® — TBS predicts fracture risk independent of BMD and enhances FRAX® fracture risk prediction, and low TBS values increase FRAX® estimated risk while high values reduce it. TBS adjustment of FRAX® has been validated in 14 prospective international cohorts, and age substantially alters the impact of TBS on FRAX® estimated risk with the effect being much greater for younger women.

Introduction

A BMD value (T-score) 2.5 SDs or more below the mean for young adults is commonly used to define higher fracture risk and is incorporated into many osteoporosis guidelines. Low BMD is known to increase the likelihood of fractures including hip, vertebrae, forearm, and humerus. However, many fractures occur in patients having osteopenia (T-score between −1.0 and −2.5). Moreover, patients with normal BMD can also have major osteoporotic fractures.

Many randomized trials have been conducted to assess the efficacy of antiosteoporotic medications on fracture risk. Medications included in these trials include antiresorptives (bisphosphonates [oral and parenteral], SERMs, denosumab, hormone replacement treatment [HRT]), anabolic (PTH and PTH-Related Protein Analogs [teriparatide and abaloparatide]), and more recently romosozumab [that can both increase bone formation and decrease bone resorption]. In general, treatment is most commonly recommended for people with high fracture risk assessed by risk assessment tools such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX), QFracture, the Garvan Institute fracture risk calculator, or in patients with prior hip or spine fractures.

Consequently, not all patients receiving antiosteoporotic medications have a T-score ≤ −2.5. Some studies have shown similar efficacy for those with baseline BMD above and below −2.5. However, several studies have suggested a larger effect of treatment on fractures in those with lower BMD. The FIT Clinical fracture arm (FIT II) recruited women free of vertebral fracture and showed that alendronate did not have an anti-fracture effect on non-vertebral fractures in women who do not have BMD T-score below −2.5. In the BONE Study (oral ibandronate), there was a significant non-vertebral fracture reduction only in those with baseline BMD T-score below −3. The limitations of previous studies include the issue of publication bias and the possibility of chance findings due to multiple comparisons. Moreover, several studies were performed before the introduction of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III data as the reference standard for FN and TH T-scores. Given these inconsistent and incomplete findings, it is important to examine systematically whether antiosteoporosis treatments work better in those with osteoporosis based on BMD after standardizing both BMD and fracture definitions.

Limitations

This study has limitations. Because the study population was derived from a clinical registry, the decision to reassess fracture risk was influenced by clinician and patient perception of an individual's risk for fractures. However, this may have increased the relevance of our study to the clinical practice setting where such considerations are a standard part of patient care and decision-making because research cohorts may not reflect routine clinical practice. Our study did not consider competing mortality. We excluded individuals receiving pharmacologic treatment and those with previous major fracture (hip or clinical vertebral), which other researchers have addressed through a competing risk analysis; the objective of this study was to examine the change in fracture risk in the absence of treatment (which would affect BMD loss) and those with previous hip or clinical vertebral fracture (generally recommended for treatment rather than further risk assessment). Our analysis of change in clinical risk factors did not consider their different weights in the FRAX tool because this can be directly modeled through the website. Also, the population was 98% white or of European ancestry, and the lack of racial/ethnic heterogeneity precluded a direct assessment of whether this modified our findings. Likewise, international FRAX models reflect underlying population differences in terms of fracture and mortality rates. The generalization of our findings to other populations and FRAX models is uncertain.
