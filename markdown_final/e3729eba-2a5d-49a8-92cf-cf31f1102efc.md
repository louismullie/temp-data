## Question

When is liver biopsy indicated in the evaluation of alcoholic liver disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when liver biopsy should be performed in the evaluation of alcoholic liver disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and spectrum of alcoholic liver disease. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of when biopsy is useful versus when noninvasive assessment suffices. Next, I will examine specific scenarios: diagnostic uncertainty, suspected alcoholic hepatitis, staging fibrosis, and competing etiologies. After that, I need to check procedural considerations, especially transjugular biopsy in decompensated disease. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant algorithm and double-check for any exceptions or evolving evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and spectrum. Alcoholic liver disease spans steatosis, alcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, and diagnosis hinges on documented heavy alcohol use with exclusion of other causes; biopsy is not routinely required for steatosis or established cirrhosis when the etiology is clear, so I need to ensure I'm not over-calling biopsy in straightforward cases [^116hgTmC] [^111L6gsn] [^116Wxnis].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the overarching principle. Modern guidance emphasizes that liver biopsy is reserved for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty or when histology will change management, whereas noninvasive blood and imaging tests are first-line to assess fibrosis severity and guide care. Biopsy is not required for routine staging in asymptomatic ALD if noninvasive assessment is informative [^1143zLET] [^111qDoR8] [^114h6MUJ].

> Now, I will examine diagnostic uncertainty as the primary indication. If the clinical picture is atypical, the alcohol history is unreliable, or competing etiologies are suspected (for example, drug-induced liver injury, ischemic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, hemochromatosis, viral hepatitis), then I should consider biopsy to clarify the diagnosis. This is particularly true when results of noninvasive tests are indeterminate or discordant with clinical findings [^111qDoR8] [^1126vhyv] [^114rv5tc].

> Next, I should review suspected alcoholic hepatitis. Wait, let me verify the classification: definite, probable, and possible alcoholic hepatitis are defined by consensus criteria, with definite requiring histology. However, in the absence of confounders, a probable diagnosis based on clinical and laboratory features is sufficient to treat, and biopsy is not routinely required. I initially thought biopsy was mandatory for all suspected alcoholic hepatitis, but that's outdated. Current guidance supports treating probable cases without biopsy unless confounding factors are present or the diagnosis is uncertain, in which case transjugular biopsy should be considered, especially if steroid therapy is contemplated [^116HXRPz] [^116G7nuS] [^114mwBou] [^1168321n].

> I need to check fibrosis staging next. For asymptomatic patients with ALD, noninvasive tests such as FIB-4 and transient elastography are recommended to assess fibrosis; biopsy is not required for routine staging if noninvasive assessment is informative. But wait, what if noninvasive tests are indeterminate or discordant, or if precise staging would alter management or trial eligibility? In those situations, biopsy may be reasonable, acknowledging that histology is an imperfect reference standard and should be individualized [^1143zLET] [^114h6MUJ] [^113SitcU].

> Let me consider competing etiologies and mixed disease. Because ALD frequently coexists with other liver diseases and can be underestimated, biopsy helps when the noninvasive workup suggests more than one process or gives conflicting information. This is where histology can distinguish ALD from NAFLD/NASH, autoimmune hepatitis, drug injury, or infiltrative disease and guide therapy [^114NASYt] [^112MsYXr].

> I should confirm procedural considerations, especially in decompensated disease. When platelets are low, INR is prolonged, or ascites is present, transjugular liver biopsy is preferred over percutaneous routes due to safety; I need to ensure the center has experience and that sample adequacy is addressed, as diagnostic yield depends on length and portal tract count [^111nx5pU] [^114rv5tc] [^114zxtL9].

> But wait, what about acute liver failure or research contexts? In acute liver failure, routine biopsy is not recommended and should be individualized; in clinical trials or when standardized histologic endpoints are required, biopsy is often mandated, which I should keep in mind when counseling patients about potential research-related indications [^1144B9fp] [^111qDoR8].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. First, apply noninvasive assessment broadly in ALD using FIB-4 and transient elastography to gauge fibrosis and guide referral. Biopsy is not required if the diagnosis is clear and noninvasive staging is adequate. Second, escalate to biopsy when there is diagnostic uncertainty, atypical features, unreliable alcohol history, or suspected confounders. Third, in suspected alcoholic hepatitis, treat probable cases clinically; reserve transjugular biopsy for possible cases with confounders or when the diagnosis remains uncertain and management hinges on confirmation. Finally, consider biopsy when noninvasive fibrosis assessment is indeterminate or discordant and the result would change management or for research/trial purposes [^1143zLET] [^116HXRPz] [^111qDoR8].

> I should double-check that this aligns with major guidelines. ACG 2024 supports noninvasive fibrosis assessment as first-line and advises against routine biopsy for alcoholic hepatitis in the absence of confounders, while recommending biopsy for diagnostic uncertainty; EASL 2018 similarly reserves biopsy for uncertainty, precise staging, or trials; AASLD 2025 prioritizes noninvasive fibrosis assessment and cautions that histology is an imperfect reference, reinforcing selective rather than routine biopsy use [^1143zLET] [^111qDoR8] [^114h6MUJ].

> In conclusion, liver biopsy in alcoholic liver disease is indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists after noninvasive evaluation, when alcoholic hepatitis is only "possible" due to confounders or unclear history, when noninvasive fibrosis staging is indeterminate or discordant and would change management, or for research and clinical trial requirements. It is not routinely indicated for uncomplicated steatosis, clear-cut probable alcoholic hepatitis without confounders, or when noninvasive staging suffices, with transjugular biopsy preferred in decompensated patients [^1143zLET] [^116HXRPz] [^111qDoR8] [^111nx5pU].

Liver biopsy is **not routinely indicated** in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) [^1143zLET] and is reserved for cases of diagnostic uncertainty, atypical presentations, or when alternative etiologies are suspected [^111qDoR8]. Biopsy is most often used to **confirm alcoholic hepatitis** when clinical criteria are incomplete or confounded [^116HXRPz], and to distinguish ALD from other liver diseases such as NAFLD, autoimmune hepatitis, or drug-induced liver injury [^114NASYt]. It is also considered when noninvasive fibrosis assessment is inconclusive or discordant [^1126vhyv], or when precise staging is required for clinical trials or research [^111qDoR8]. Routine biopsy is not recommended for simple steatosis or established cirrhosis without diagnostic uncertainty [^114DsDsk] [^116Wxnis].

---

## Indications for liver biopsy in alcoholic liver disease

### Diagnostic uncertainty

- **Atypical clinical presentation**: When clinical features do not fit classic ALD patterns (e.g. AST/ALT ratio < 1.5, bilirubin < 3 mg/dL, or absence of jaundice) [^114mwBou], biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis [^111qDoR8].

- **Confounding factors**: Presence of other liver diseases (e.g. NAFLD, autoimmune hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury) or unclear alcohol use history warrants biopsy to differentiate etiologies [^114mwBou].

- **Alcoholic hepatitis (AH)**: Clinical diagnosis of AH is based on recent heavy alcohol use, jaundice, and compatible labs [^116HXRPz]; biopsy is indicated when clinical criteria are incomplete or confounded [^114mwBou].

---

### Assessment of disease severity and staging

- **Fibrosis staging**: Noninvasive tests (FIB-4, transient elastography) are first-line for fibrosis assessment [^1155DZgq]; biopsy is reserved for indeterminate or discordant results [^1126vhyv].

- **Severe alcoholic hepatitis**: Biopsy can help confirm diagnosis and guide therapy (e.g. corticosteroids) in severe cases with high mortality risk [^116HXRPz] [^113PEmbT].

- **Clinical trials and research**: Biopsy is often required for precise staging and grading in clinical trials or research settings [^111qDoR8].

---

### Differentiation from other liver diseases

Biopsy helps **distinguish ALD from other liver diseases** with similar presentations, including:

| **Condition** | **Differentiating features** |
|-|-|
| Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) | - Histology similar to ALD <br/> - Absence of significant alcohol use [^111SfEXq] |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | - Interface hepatitis <br/> - Positive autoimmune serology [^notfound] |
| Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) | - Recent drug exposure <br/> - Histologic patterns of injury [^notfound] |
| Wilson's disease | - Low ceruloplasmin <br/> - Elevated copper <br/> - Kayser-Fleischer rings [^notfound] |

---

## Situations where liver biopsy is not indicated

Routine biopsy is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Simple steatosis**: Alcoholic steatosis without inflammation or fibrosis is typically diagnosed clinically and with imaging; biopsy is unnecessary [^111L6gsn].

- **Established cirrhosis**: When cirrhosis is clearly established clinically and radiologically, biopsy rarely adds diagnostic value [^116Wxnis].

- **Mild, uncomplicated ALD**: Patients with mild, stable disease and no atypical features generally do not require biopsy [^1143zLET].

---

## Risks and limitations of liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is **invasive** and carries risks, including:

- **Bleeding**: Particularly in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia [^112DWr7d].

- **Infection**: Rare but serious complication [^notfound].

- **Sampling error**: Small samples may not reflect disease severity or distribution [^112q9NFX].

- **Patient discomfort**: Pain and anxiety are common [^notfound].

---

## Noninvasive alternatives to liver biopsy

Noninvasive tests are **increasingly used** to assess fibrosis and steatosis in ALD:

- **Transient elastography**: Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) is recommended to assess fibrosis severity in ALD [^113xQUus].

- **Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)**: Useful when ultrasound-based elastography is inconclusive or technically limited [^113SitcU].

- **Blood-based biomarkers**: FIB-4 and ELF score are recommended for initial fibrosis assessment [^1143zLET].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize a **selective approach** to liver biopsy in ALD:

- **ACG 2024**: Recommends biopsy only in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or when noninvasive tests are inconclusive [^1126vhyv] [^1143zLET].

- **EASL 2018**: Recommends biopsy for diagnostic uncertainty, precise staging, or clinical trials [^111qDoR8].

- **AASLD 2025**: Emphasizes noninvasive assessment for fibrosis staging, reserving biopsy for specific scenarios [^114h6MUJ].

---

Liver biopsy is **not routinely indicated** in ALD and is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, atypical presentations, or when alternative etiologies are suspected. It is most often used to confirm alcoholic hepatitis, differentiate ALD from other liver diseases, and assess disease severity when noninvasive tests are inconclusive. Noninvasive tests are the first-line approach for fibrosis assessment, and biopsy is reserved for specific clinical scenarios.

### Role of liver biopsy in the assessment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^116ZvMnm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2004). Low credibility.

Assessments of liver biopsies are important in the diagnosis and management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Histology remains the 'gold standard' for making the important distinction between simple steatosis, which is generally non-progressive and readily reversible, and steatohepatitis, which has the potential to progress to severe fibrosis or cirrhosis. Liver biopsy may also identify other causes of liver disease in patients thought to have fatty liver disease and vice versa. Histological grading and staging of fatty liver disease require further study but these are potentially important approaches for studying disease severity and progression, particularly in the context of clinical trials to assess novel therapeutic approaches.

Goals

We aimed to examine the correlation of pre-biopsy clinical diagnosis with hepatic histopathology.

Background

Liver biopsy provides histologic information and informs physicians about the underlying clinical disease. We hypothesized that expert physicians' pre-biopsy clinical diagnoses may obviate the need for histopathological diagnosis.

Study Methods

Patients undergoing liver biopsy to investigate a liver diagnosis were prospectively identified. In the 80 patients included, an anonymous validated questionnaire inquiring about the most likely clinical diagnosis and liver disease stage was completed prospectively by hepatologists before biopsy performance.

Results

The most common pre-biopsy diagnoses were alcoholic liver disease (19 diagnoses), followed by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis (18 each). Overall, the predicted histologic diagnosis was the same as the histologic diagnosis in 51/80 patients (64%), and thus a new liver disease diagnosis was made in 36% of patients. The diagnosis with the greatest pre-biopsy and post-biopsy diagnosis discrepancy was autoimmune hepatitis, with the correct diagnosis being predicted in 6/18 (33%) of patients (other diagnoses included the following: non-alcoholic steatohepatitis/non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (4), alcoholic liver disease (3), drug-induced liver injury (3), others (2)). For fibrosis staging, when grouped as no fibrosis (F0), fibrosis (F1-F3), or cirrhosis (F4), the fibrosis stage was correctly predicted in 68% of patients (54/80). Notably, 7 patients (9%) who were initially thought to have no or early-stage fibrosis had F4 fibrosis, and 6/80 (8%) patients who were considered to have a liver disease diagnosis before their biopsy had normal histology.

Conclusions

Although hepatology experts often predict the correct underlying liver disease diagnosis, histopathological diagnoses different from expected are common.

### Spectrum of liver histology in presumed decompensated alcoholic liver disease [^117UMmLR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In presumed decompensated alcoholic liver disease (ALD; liver decompensation, heavy alcohol intake, and negative results of noninvasive screening for other causes), liver biopsy is often performed to assess severity of liver injury and to rule out other liver diseases.

Aim

The aim of the study is to describe the spectrum of liver histology in such patients.

Methods

We reviewed all patients with presumed decompensated ALD seen between 1998 and 2004, in whom liver tissue was available for histology (N = 110).

Results

A total of 104 of the 110 patients had at least one of the histological features suggestive of ALD: fat, Mallory's hyalin, neutrophilic infiltrate, and hepatocyte ballooning. These features were more prevalent in tissue obtained within a month after presentation with decompensation than in that obtained before decompensation or more than 1 month after. These features were also associated with more severe liver dysfunction. Histology revealed a major additional diagnosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome) in only one case. In 41 patients biopsied within a month of first presentation with decompensation, Child score and Maddrey discriminant function (DF), but none of the histological features, were predictive of survival by Cox multivariate analysis. Of the 26 of these 41 patients with a Maddrey DF > 32, 22 (85%) had alcoholic hepatitis.

Conclusions

In patients with presumed decompensated ALD, other liver diseases are uncommon. Routine liver biopsy is of limited added value but biopsy should be considered in those in whom the noninvasive workup, or failure to recover despite abstinence, raises the possibility of other liver diseases.

Management of alcoholic hepatitis

Providing more efficacious therapies for patients with AH is one of the most urgent needs in clinical hepatology. The current first line therapy (i.e. prednisolone) was proposed in 1971, but novel targeted therapies are needed. Currently, there are no reliable non-invasive diagnostic tools for AH in patients with decompensated ALD. The classical profile of AH comprises elevated serum AST up to twice the upper limit of the normal range, although rarely above 300 IU/ml, with an AST/ALT ratio typically greater than 2. Biological parameters indicating impaired liver function include hypoalbuminemia, elevated bilirubin, high INR and prothrombin time. The presence of acute kidney injury, often due to superimposed hepatorenal syndrome, is associated with a high risk of death. In addition, patients with AH frequently disclose leukocytosis and elevated temperature resulting from a systemic inflammatory response syndrome.

In routine practice as in many published clinical trials, the diagnosis of AH relies on clinical and biological criteria. However, such strategy carries a 10–50% risk of misclassifying patients with or without ASH. In the setting of clinical trials, the diagnosis of AH through liver biopsy has been recommended by EASL guidelines, and liver biopsy may be considered in patients with aggressive forms of ALD requiring specific interventions or when the diagnosis remains in doubt. A transjugular route is often preferred due to frequent coexisting ascites and/or coagulopathy. Recently, a histological scoring system has been proposed for predicting short-term survival in patients with AH. The resulting Alcoholic Hepatitis Histological Score comprises four parameters that are independently associated with patients' survival: fibrosis stage, PMN infiltration, type of bilirubinostasis and the presence of megamitochondria (Fig. 3). By combining these parameters in a semi-quantitative manner, this histological score is able to stratify patients into low, intermediate, or high risk for death within 90 days.

### Paediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: an approach to pathological evaluation [^116LK6e7]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an increasingly important healthcare issue along with the rising rates of obesity worldwide. It is the most common chronic liver disease in the paediatric population and the fastest growing indication for liver transplant in young adults. The pathogenesis is complex with contributions from multiple factors and genetic predisposition. While non-invasive laboratory tests and imaging modalities are being increasingly used, the liver biopsy continues to play a crucial role in the diagnosis and prognosis of NAFLD. Histologically, the assessment of paediatric fatty liver disease requires special considerations with respect to a periportal predominant pattern seen in prepubertal patients, as well as a different set of disease processes in the differential diagnosis. In this review, we provide a summary of current knowledge on the epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical course of paediatric NAFLD as well as the clinical guidelines on diagnosis and management. We discuss the indications and limitations of liver biopsy, histological patterns seen in paediatric NAFLD, other entities to be considered in the differential diagnosis, and conclude with appropriate triaging of liver biopsies and essential elements of pathology reporting.

Diagnosis of alcoholic liver disease

In its early stages, ALD is a silent disease and can only be detected by laboratory tests or imaging techniques. There are few programs aimed at early detection of ALD at its asymptomatic stages. Some patients with early ALD can show stigmata of alcohol abuse such as bilateral parotid gland hypertrophy, muscle wasting, malnutrition, Dupuytren's sign, and signs of peripheral neuropathy. In patients with cirrhosis, most physical findings are not specific of the etiology. However, some signs such as gynecomastia and extensive spider angiomas may be more frequently seen in those with alcohol as the main cause of liver disease. The diagnosis of ALD is frequently suspected upon documentation of excessive alcohol consumption (> 40–50 g/day) and the presence of clinical and/or biological abnormalities suggestive of liver injury. Laboratory blood tests such as mean corpuscular volume, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) can indicate early ALD whereas advanced ALD is suspected if there is decreased albumin, increased INR, elevated bilirubin level or low platelet count. There are several laboratory markers that estimate persistent alcohol intake. Among them, carbohydrate deficient transferrin and GGT are the most frequently used markers to detect previous alcohol consumption. In patients with ALD, the AST/ALT ratio typically is greater than 1. This ratio is typically greater than 2 in AH and can also be found in patients with advanced cirrhosis regardless of the etiology.

Liver biopsy is not clearly indicated in patients with early stages of ALD or when established cirrhosis is revealed by clinical, analytical and imaging data. The liver biopsy can be done percutaneously in most patients but requires a transjugular approach in patients with a low platelet count and/or a prolonged prothrombin time. The precise indications of liver biopsy are not well established in routine practice. However, it is suggested in patients with aggressive forms of ALD such as AH requiring specific therapies (e.g. corticosteroids and/or pentoxifylline) and in patients with other cofactors suspected of contributing to liver disease. In the setting of clinical trials, the assessment of liver histology by performing a liver biopsy is recommended. The typical findings in patients with ALD include steatosis, hepatocellular damage (ballooning and/or Mallory-Denk bodies), an inflammatory infiltrate basically composed of PMN cells that predominates in the lobules, and a variable degree of fibrosis and lobular distortion that may progress to cirrhosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^113kVZ5f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages and data on the prevalence and profile of patients with early disease are limited. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease. Prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. AH presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice, and in severe cases may transition to acute on chronic liver failure when the risk for mortality, depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures, may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH and long-term mortality is related to severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures in patients hospitalized with ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation, a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis, may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

Alcoholic hepatitis — liver biopsy role and classification indicate that a NIH-sponsored consensus proposed defining AH as definite, probable, or possible based on clinical features, confounding serology for other liver disease etiology, and liver histology; definite AH was categorized as a compatible clinical diagnosis with liver biopsy confirming the existence of criteria of AH, probable AH as classic clinical syndrome without confounding serology, and possible AH as clinically suspicious with confounding factors or uncertain alcohol use. It was proposed that patients with possible AH should undergo liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, especially if specific pharmacologic interventions are proposed.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: non-invasive investigation and risk stratification [^114gvEPF]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a histological spectrum of liver disease, from simple steatosis through to cirrhosis. As the worldwide rates of obesity have increased, NAFLD has become the commonest cause of liver disease in many developed countries, affecting up to a third of the population. The majority of patients have simple steatosis that carries a relatively benign prognosis. However, a significant minority have non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and have increased liver related and cardiovascular mortality. Identifying those at risk of progressive disease is crucial. Liver biopsy remains the gold standard investigation for assessing stage of disease but its invasive nature makes it impractical for widespread use as a prognostic tool. Non-invasive tools for diagnosis and disease staging are required, reserving liver biopsy for those patients where it offers clinically relevant additional information. This review discusses the non-invasive modalities available for assessing steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. We propose a pragmatic approach for the assessment of patients with NAFLD to identify those at high risk of progressive disease who require referral to specialist services.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^116hgTmC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Disease spectrum of alcoholic liver disease — ALD comprises a broad spectrum of diseases ranging from asymptomatic or early ALD (defined as fatty liver or alcoholic steatosis), to ASH and advanced ALD (defined as AH, cirrhosis and its complications such as ascites, portal hypertension-related bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and HCC). There is no specific biomarker for the diagnosis of ALD, diagnosis requires excluding other liver diseases in a patient with heavy alcohol use. For early alcoholic liver disease, Liver function tests and ultrasound examination should be performed among patients with harmful alcohol use and/or AUD.

Alcoholic fatty liver disease — evaluation and diagnostic features include minimal aminotransferase elevations with AST typically greater than ALT, possible γ-glutamyl transpeptidase elevation, and typically normal serum bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio (INR); diagnosis of hepatic steatosis is based on imaging and liver biopsy is not routinely required. A proportion of patients with biopsy-proven steatohepatitis develop hepatic fibrosis (20–40%) and cirrhosis (8–20%), and one-third of patients with asymptomatic forms of ASH have significant liver fibrosis.

AH should be diagnosed in keeping with recognised clinical criteria; patients suspected as having AH but who have confounding factors or do not fulfil all criteria should be considered for liver biopsy

The diagnosis of AH has been controversial in the past. Previously it had been argued that a diagnosis of AH could only be made with confirmatory histology. For most AH patients this would require a transjugular liver biopsy the availability of which is variable and for which there is a technical failure rate of 3.2% and a diagnostically suboptimal sample obtained in up to 12%. In addition, histological features of steatohepatitis may be present in patients with chronic liver disease without an acute illness. AH is primarily a clinical diagnosis with recent onset jaundice being a cardinal feature. In order to standardise the clinical features of AH the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has published criteria which have received general acceptance. Onset of jaundice (serum bilirubin > 3 mg/dL or 50 µmol/L) within 8 weeks and excessive alcohol consumption within 60 days of presentation are key. The liver biochemistry should be compatible with AH with a raised AST, an AST-to-ALT ratio of > 1.5 and neither value > 400 IU/L. Fulfilment of these criteria without any confounding factors equates to a diagnosis of 'probable' AH which suffices for most clinical situations. A 'definite' diagnosis of AH is when these clinical features are fulfilled and there is additional confirmatory histology. However, if confounding factors are present then the level of diagnostic certainty falls to 'possible' AH in which case additional confirmatory histology would be recommended to make the diagnosis. Examples of such factors would be incompatible liver biochemistry, possible ischaemic liver injury (secondary to hypotension or cocaine use within 7 days), possible metabolic liver injury (Wilson's disease), possible drug induced liver injury (suspect drug within 30 days of jaundice) and uncertainty regarding timing of onset of jaundice. Liver biopsy rarely changes the diagnosis in individuals who meet the clinical criteria or history of alcohol excess.

It should be noted that while these criteria have been accepted and form part of guidelines, the threshold of serum bilirubin recommended is lower than that of most historical clinical studies of AH. These have tended to use a threshold of 80 µmol/L (4.7 mg/dL) or more. Therefore, the applicability of previous clinical studies to those with lower levels of serum bilirubin is unclear.

Discussion

Few studies have determined the natural history of biopsy-proven fatty liver disease and compared the long-term prognosis of these two major groups of fatty liver disease due to alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Our study has several methodological strengths. First, all patients had biopsy proven fatty liver disease and histology was re-evaluated based on validated scores. We believe we have included the vast majority of patients with biopsy-proven fatty liver disease in the whole population of Iceland during this period as at least 95% of the population lives in the catchment area of the National University Hospital. The fact that all the patients underwent a liver biopsy is also a weakness, especially when evaluating disease outcome. Previous studies have shown that NAFLD patients diagnosed with liver biopsy have a worse prognosis compared with patients diagnosed with ultrasonography. Therefore, studying patients recruited from the pathology registry involves a selection bias. It must be stressed that the indications for the liver biopsy was not always clear, although most cases were because of elevated liver function tests and/or hepatomegaly or suspected alcoholic liver disease, and this in turn can give a selection bias. Also the indication for biopsy in NAFLD and AFLD may differ between conditions and between practitioners and might explain some of the differences in disease outcome.

The main limitation of the study was its retrospective design and data was not systematically registrered and was therefore sometimes missing or unavailable. In addition the search for the code M-50080 (fatty liver) is limiting in itself as the more serious steatosis with fibrosis and even cirrhosis might be coded as something else than just fatty liver. Since this was a retrospective study on liver biopsies it is not possible to standardize the size of the needle biopsies. Therefore the size is very variable and the range can be considerable, but should be similar to the standards observed in pathology departments in general. Samples less than 2 mm in diameter would have been excluded from the study, but no such samples came into the study.

The slides used for pathological estimation were the original slides and recuts or restaining of slides was not done except for a few exceptional cases where the original slides were unavailable or when a Masson-Trichrome stain had not been performed originally. Occationally the colours of the slides had faided somewhat. This however we do not anticipate having significant effect on the results, especially since ballooning degeneration increases cell size and this is not greatly affected by fading colours.

Methods

Population and case finding

In this retrospective study, a search was undertaken in a computerized diagnoses database from 1984 (when the pathology registry commenced their electronic registration) to 2009, in the Department of Pathology at the National University Hospital (NUH) of Iceland and identified all liver biopsies analysed and registrated in the SNOMED coding-system, T-56000 and the M-50080 as having fatty change. The SNOMED (Systemized Nomenclature of Medicine) is a coding system used in the pathology laboratories in Iceland to specify: Procedure, Topography, Morphology, Disease and Etiology. This is a very valuable coding system for retrieving data and pathology reports from past years, like biopsies of the liver (T-56…) showing fatty change (M-50080).

The catchment area of the NUH covers > 95% of the population in Iceland.

All medical records from these patients were examined with respect to the following exclusion criteria: 1) presence of acute or chronic liver disease: PBC, autoimmune hepatitis, alfa-1-antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis and viral hepatitis. 2) jejunoileal bypass operation. 3) use of drugs known to be associated with fatty liver disease such as methotrexate, amiodarone, tamoxifen and high doses of corticosteroids. 4) malignancy at the time of index liver biopsy. 5) age under eighteen years at the time of index liver biopsy. 6) gallstone surgery at the time of index liver biopsy. The patients with gallstone surgery at the time of index liver biopsy were excluded to better represent the patients who would undergo a liver biopsy in clinical practice and not just the incidental finding of fatty liver during an operation.

Indications for the index biopsy in the cohort were elevated liver tests, mainly serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or hepatomegaly or suspected alcoholic liver disease. A total of 420 patients met the inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups, non-alcoholic and alcoholic group respectively (Figure 1).

What care should you receive after your liver biopsy?

Biopsies are usually done on the day and do not necessitate an overnight stay. You are expected to lie on your side and are observed for at least 3 hours to check there is no further bleeding. Any pain or discomfort experienced can usually be treated with painkillers.

The report may take 2 weeks or so to come back but if special tests are required, may be longer

Informed consent

Consent should be obtained from all patients prior to a liver biopsy in accordance with national guidelines. Consent must be voluntary, informed and the patient must have the mental capacity to decide. Information should be given orally and supplemented in written form using language that is comprehensible. The patient should be aware, in advance, of the benefits and risks of the procedure.

Where a biopsy is undertaken solely or partly for research purposes, patients must be fully informed and the procedure approved by the appropriate ethics committee/body in alignment with hospital regulations.

Monitoring after the liver biopsy

Patients are monitored so pain can be treated appropriately, and any complications detected and attended to early.

Discharge should happen only if your condition is stable — that is, when your circulation is acceptable/stable, there is no evidence of bleeding, blood pressure is normal and you do not have complaints of pain or shortness of breath.

Prior to discharge, you should be given oral and written instructions regarding further monitoring and day to day activities. This should include advice to rest and not drive motor vehicles, not to operate heavy machinery, not undertake strenuous activity or lift heavy objects for 48 hours.

If you experience any symptoms that would suggest discomfort, infection or injury, you should be instructed to contact the hospital and be provided with contact details how to do this.

What happens to the sample after the liver biopsy?

After the liver biopsy the sample is sent to a laboratory where it is assessed by a pathologist. It may take 2 weeks or more to obtain the report.

Samples from liver biopsies should be stored for 30 years. Reviewing biopsies over time can inform how the liver disease is progressing.

### Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure: part I. diagnosis and evaluation [^114Huvyo]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with the majority of preventable cases attributed to excessive alcohol consumption, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Cirrhosis often is an indolent disease; most patients remain asymptomatic until the occurrence of decompensation, characterized by ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, or variceal bleeding from portal hypertension. Physical examination of patients with cirrhosis may reveal a variety of findings that necessitate a hepatic- or gastrointestinal-based work-up to determine the etiology. Some patients already may have had laboratory or radiographic tests that incidentally uncovered signs of cirrhosis and its comorbidities. No serologic or radiographic test can accurately diagnose cirrhosis. A significant correlation has been demonstrated between persistently elevated liver function tests and biopsy-proven underlying hepatic disease; thus, a more targeted serologic work-up is indicated in patients whose liver function test results are persistently abnormal. Unnecessary medications and surgical procedures should be avoided in patients with cirrhosis. Referral for liver biopsy should be considered only after a thorough, non-invasive serologic and radiographic evaluation has failed to confirm a diagnosis of cirrhosis; the benefit of biopsy outweighs the risk; and it is postulated that biopsy will have a favorable impact on the treatment of chronic liver disease.

### Severe alcoholic relapse after liver transplantation: what consequences on the graft? A study based on liver biopsies analysis [^116TLxyw]. Liver Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major indication for liver transplantation (LT), but up to 20% of patients experience severe alcoholic relapse. The aims of this study were to evaluate the impact of severe alcoholic relapse on the graft (based on histological examination) and to identify predictive factors associated with recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis (RAC). From 1990 to 2010, 369 patients underwent LT for ALD at Edouard Herriot Hospital (Lyon, France) and survived more than 1 year. All patients who presented severe alcoholic relapse and histological follow-up were included. Liver biopsies were performed at 1 and 5 years and at every 5 years after LT, and when clinically indicated. The median follow-up after LT was 11 years (range, 3–18 years). Severe alcoholic relapse was observed in 73 (20%) of the 369 patients, from whom 56 patients with histological evaluation were included. RAC was diagnosed in 18 (32%) of the 56 patients included, which represents 5% of the 369 patients transplanted for ALD. The median delay between LT and RAC was 6 years (range, 3–10 years) and 4.5 years (range, 2–8 years) after severe alcoholic relapse. The median cumulated years of alcohol use before RAC was 3.5 years (range, 2–7 years). The cumulative risk for F4 fibrosis was 15% at 3 years, 32% at 5 years, and 54% at 10 years after severe alcoholic relapse. A young age at LT (≤ 50 years old) and an early onset of heavy drinking (within the first 3 years after LT) were associated with RAC. In conclusion, severe alcoholic relapse usually occurs in the first years after LT and is responsible for accelerated severe graft injury. Liver Transplantation 22 773–784 2016 AASLD.

### Treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis [^114XtQgh]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a syndrome of jaundice and liver failure that occurs in a minority of heavy consumers of alcohol. The diagnosis usually is based on a history of heavy alcohol use, findings from blood tests, and exclusion of other liver diseases by blood and imaging analyses. Liver biopsy specimens, usually collected via the transjugular route, should be analyzed to confirm a diagnosis of AH in patients with an atypical history or presentation. The optimal treatment for patients with severe AH is prednisolone, possibly in combination with N-acetyl cysteine. At present, only short-term increases in survival can be expected-no treatment has been found to increase patient survival beyond 3 months. Abstinence is essential for long-term survival. New treatment options, including liver transplantation, are being tested in trials and results eagerly are awaited.

Indications for liver biopsy

Liver biopsy is usually done in one of two situations: for the assessment of diffuse liver disease or to diagnose a specific abnormality seen on cross-sectional imaging using a targeted biopsy. The purposes of a liver biopsy are outlined in box 1.

Box 1
Purposes of liver biopsy

Help clarify diagnosis

Determine severity of liver damage

Determine the nature and/or grade of tumour

Help predict prognosis in a person with a known diagnosis

Inform treatment decisions

Monitor disease progression or response to treatment

Obtain liver for non-histological assessment (microbiology, biochemical, other)

Support research

Non-invasive methods to aid clinical decisions are preferred by patients rather than liver biopsy. With current virological, biochemical, serological and imaging investigations, many diagnoses and management decisions do not rely on histological information. As the indications for liver biopsy change, clinical teams need to ensure the decision to biopsy remains appropriate. Indications for liver biopsy in many conditions is outlined in specific guidelines. For disease-specific indications, see online supplementary appendix A.

A liver biopsy done for clinical (rather than research) purposes, can be justified only when

The information gained is of value for management of the patient.
The patient is fully informed about indications, risks, benefits, alternatives and follow-up plans and has given informed consent.
The procedure is done as safely as practicable.
The operator is competent to perform the technique.
The sample(s) are of adequate quality and size.
The biopsy is examined by a histopathologist sufficiently competent to interpret the histology.

The operator and the histopathologist must be given all the relevant information, and the histopathologist should have access to a specialist referral pathway for unusual or complex biopsies, including post-transplant biopsies. These topics are discussed in detail below.

Recommendations

All healthcare professionals involved in requesting, obtaining and interpreting the liver biopsy need to be aware of the indication(s) for the biopsy (strength of recommendation STRONG; quality of evidence WEAK).
Where a biopsy is done outside guidelines or protocols, there should be multiprofessional discussions (which should include histopathologists where appropriate) prior to biopsy, and the decision recorded in the medical notes (strength of recommendation STRONG; quality of evidence WEAK).

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcoholic hepatitis [^114MeRu5]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is increasing in incidence in the UK. It is the commonest cause of liver-related deaths, predominantly in people below the age of 60. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is an acute form of ALD with high mortality when severe. Jaundice and coagulopathy are clinical hallmarks of severe AH. Histology findings are characterised by parenchymal inflammation and hepatocellular damage although biopsy is only required when diagnostic uncertainty exists; clinical findings are usually sufficient for accurate diagnosis. Patients with AH should be stratified as non-severe or severe using non-invasive scoring systems such as the discriminant function or the Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score. In patients with non-severe AH, abstinence is the mainstay of treatment, and it is important that steps are taken to help patients stop drinking. Severe AH requires specialist treatment. Consensus guidelines recommend the use of prednisolone although this remains subject to clinical trials. Pentoxifylline may have a survival benefit if corticosteroids are contraindicated. Nutritional support and N-acetylcysteine should be considered for use in conjunction with corticosteroids although evidence of benefit is not conclusive. Patients with severe disease who do not respond to therapy within a week have a very poor outcome. Recent data have shown a survival benefit of liver transplantation in this group although this remains experimental at present. Current and future research should focus on targeted therapies for severe AH and those who fail first-line treatment.

### Medical liver biopsy: background, indications, procedure and histopathology [^112MsYXr]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Indications for performing a liver biopsy

The advent of non-invasive tools such as serum biomarkers and elastography has given clinicians additional tools for estimating the severity of fibrosis. While this has resulted in reduced overall need for liver biopsy, histological analysis of the hepatic parenchyma remains an important investigation.

Broadly, the indications for medical liver biopsy fall into two groups. First, establishing a diagnosis, which includes ruling out other diagnoses or determining the predominant pathology if more than one cause of liver injury is present. Second, liver biopsy allows assessment of disease severity including staging and grading. Staging pertains to the severity of fibrosis: although non-invasive tests increasingly have a role to play, biopsy is generally considered the 'gold-standard' test provided a satisfactory sample is obtained. Grading involves determining the severity of the underlying disease process.

Biopsies are occasionally carried out in acute liver failure. Biopsy in this setting would be determined on a case-by-case basis; recent guidance suggests that it can be considered to rule out infiltrative malignancy, alcohol-related pathology and cirrhosis.

Liver biopsy solely for research purposes

Material obtained from a liver biopsy taken specifically for research has provided invaluable information for understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of disease. However, when the patient will derive no direct therapeutic benefit from the procedure and will only accrue the risks of that procedure, the patient should be fully aware of this and give written consent.

If part of the liver biopsy done for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes is taken for research, or if additional passes will be done to obtain material for research purposes, the patient must be given this information and give full consent. The procedure will also need approval from the appropriate research ethics committee (or equivalent) and hospital board.

Recommendations

Patients should be given information about the risks and benefits of the procedure, in advance of the procedure where possible (strength of recommendation STRONG; quality of evidence HIGH).
Information should be given verbally and supplemented by information in written form or other media using language understood by the patient (strength of recommendation STRONG; quality of evidence HIGH).
Information on risks should be readily understood and the following is recommended 'of 1000 people like you having a liver biopsy, X will develop (complication)' (strength of recommendation MODERATE; evidence WEAK)
Consent should be confirmed in writing and local and national guidelines followed (strength of recommendation STRONG; evidence HIGH).

Histological findings in NAFLD

The liver biopsy is the Gold standard for diagnosis of NASH or NAFLD. Performing a liver biopsy on every patient with suspected NAFLD remains controversial. The general indications for performing a liver biopsy in patients with NAFLD confirm or exclude the diagnosis. To many, the liver biopsy is considered to be the golden standard in diagnosing NAFLD, but a pre-emptive diagnosis is mostly made up using the medical history, laboratory work and imaging of the patient. A liver biopsy can be very helpful in assessing the amount of hepatic damage in general, but also in patients that remain to have an unclear diagnosis after non-invasive assessments.

Limitations of liver biopsy are sampling error variability, inter and intra-observer variability, and risk and complications — problems with a pathological diagnosis that may lead to misdiagnosis and staging inaccuracies. Many studies have shown sampling variability and uneven distribution of NASH histologic lesions during the evaluation of paired biopsies.

The NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) is a validated score that is used to grade disease activity in patients with NAFLD. The NAS has several components and each of them has a minimum and maximum score; steatosis (0 to 3), lobular inflammation (0 to 3), hepatocellular ballooning (0 to 2). Fibrosis is not included in the NAS. In the original study that derived the NAS, scores of 0 to 2 occurred in cases mainly considered not diagnostic of NASH; scores of 3 to 4 were evenly divided among those considered not diagnostic, borderline, or positive for NASH; and scores of 5 to 8 occurred in cases that were considered mainly diagnostic of NASH.

Treatment

The treatment of NAFLD and related diseases (including but not limited to components of MS) consists of several tiers of which conservative and surgical therapies are known treatments. Very often the treatment of patients with NAFLD consists of a multimodal intervention targeting multiple aspects like weight loss, lifestyle modifications and possible medication optimisation.

### NAFLD: reporting histologic findings in clinical practice [^113rrUMw]. Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The role of liver biopsy in NASH has evolved along with the increased recognition of the significance of this disease, and the unmet medical need it presents. Drug development and clinical trials are rapidly growing, as are noninvasive tests for markers of steatosis, inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Liver biopsy evaluation remains necessary for both drug development and clinical trials as the most specific means of diagnosis and patient identification for appropriate intervention. This White Paper, sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease NASH Task Force, is a focused review of liver biopsy evaluation in fatty liver disease in subjects with presumed NAFLD for practicing clinical hepatologists and pathologists. The goal is to provide succinct and specific means for reporting the histopathologic elements of NASH, distinguishing NASH from nonalcoholic fatty liver without steatohepatitis, and from alcohol-associated steatohepatitis when possible. The discussion includes the special situations of NASH in advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis, and in the pediatric population. Finally, there is discussion of semiquantitative methods of evaluation of lesions of "disease activity" and fibrosis. Tables are presented for scoring and a suggested model for final reporting. Figures are presented to highlight the histopathologic elements of NASH.

### Non-invasive diagnosis of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A critical appraisal [^112vrDxd]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one in every three subjects in the occidental world. The vast majority will not progress, but a relevant minority will develop liver cirrhosis and its complications. The classical gold standard for diagnosing and staging NAFLD and assessing fibrosis is liver biopsy (LB). However, it has important sample error issues and subjectivity in the interpretation, apart from a small but real risk of complications. The decision to perform an LB is even harder in a condition so prevalent such as NAFLD, in which the probability of finding severe liver injury is low. In an attempt to overcome LB and to subcategorize patients with NAFLD in different prognoses allowing better management decisions, several non-invasive methods have been studied in the last decade. The literature is vast and confusing. This review will summarize which methods have been tested and how they perform, which tests are adequate for clinical practice and how they can change the management of these patients.

### Diagnosis and treatment of alcohol-associated liver diseases: 2019 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111L6gsn]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol-associated steatosis — presentation, testing, and management: Patients with alcohol-associated steatosis are usually asymptomatic, and a palpably enlarged liver may be found in the absence of jaundice or stigmata of advanced liver disease. Among the common liver enzymes, elevations of aspartate aminotransferase and GGT are the best indicators of recent excessive alcohol consumption. Hepatic steatosis is readily identified on sonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the liver, and MRI is more accurate for quantifying fat than other radiologic techniques, with the added advantage that MRI can assess fat over the entire volume of the liver. Liver biopsy is rarely needed for the diagnosis of alcohol-associated steatosis, and treatment entails abstinence.

### Assessment of prognosis in alcoholic liver disease: can serum hyaluronate replace liver biopsy? [^111srmmm]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

1. Only 15–20% of chronic alcohol misusers ever develop cirrhosis. 2. Currently it is not possible to predict clinically who will develop progressive fibrotic alcoholic liver disease. 3. Liver biopsy is currently the gold standard diagnostic test in alcoholic liver disease, but it has associated morbidity and mortality. 4. Serum hyaluronic acid is a simple non-invasive test that may be able to give an estimate of the severity of fibrosis in alcoholic liver disease. The full clinical assessment of alcoholic liver disease includes liver biopsy, since accurate clinical prediction of the severity of liver damage is extremely difficult in all except very advanced cases. Unfortunately, liver biopsy has an associated complication rate and is contraindicated in, or unacceptable to, some patients. A reliable non-invasive test of the severity of fibrotic disease would be clinically useful at initial clinical assessment in some patients with alcoholic liver disease. Such a test would be more useful in subsequent monitoring of disease progression, and in particular may diminish the need for follow-up liver biopsy. Serum hyaluronic acid has been put forward as such a non-invasive test. Based on current evidence, serum hyaluronic acid may well be a useful adjunctive test in the assessment of certain categories of alcoholic liver disease patients, but at present it is unlikely to displace liver biopsy as the investigation of choice in alcoholic liver disease.

### Early liver biopsy, intraparenchymal cholestasis, and prognosis in patients with alcoholic steatohepatitis [^113PEmbT]. BMC Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) is an acute inflammatory liver disease associated with a poor outcome. In patients with a severe form of ASH, as defined by a Maddrey's score (also reported as Maddrey's discriminant function) ≥ 32, a 4-week course of corticosteroids significantly reduces the short-term mortality by approximately 25%.

Decompensated cirrhosis is a common clinical presentation of ASH in Western Europe, but the diagnosis of ASH using only clinical and biological criteria is very challenging for the physician. Accordingly, ASH but also other situations such as infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, or drug-induced hepatitis are common precipitants of acute deterioration in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, a condition referred to as acute-on-chronic liver failure. Therefore, when a severe form of ASH is suspected, as assessed by the Maddrey's discriminant function or the MELD score, a liver biopsy is strongly recommended to make a definite diagnosis and to guide steroid therapy.

Histologically, ASH is defined by the presence of steatosis (macro- and/or microvesicular), hepatocellular injury (ballooning, apoptosis), and infiltration of the liver lobule by polynuclear neutrophils. Mallory-Denk hyaline bodies, megamitochondria, perisinusoidal fibrosis, mild iron deposits, some degree of ductular reaction (also described as cholangiolar proliferation corresponding to proliferation of hepatic progenitors), and intraparenchymal cholestasis are also described but not required for diagnosis. Equivalent terms used for intraparenchymal cholestasis include bile pigments accumulation, bilirubinostasis, intralobular cholestasis or cholestatic alcoholic hepatitis. Liver biopsy is mostly performed in patients with presumed ASH to exclude other causes of liver disease and to confirm the presence of ASH. Whether the full spectrum of histological alterations observed in liver biopsies of patients with ASH has a clinical significance remains unclear. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore the prognostic value of several histological features observed on liver biopsy performed early after hospital admission in a large number of patients with recent active alcohol intoxication, documented ASH and no associated sepsis.

Patients

The study population included 163 patients with ASH admitted to our institution between April 2004 and April 2007, selected according to the algorithm provided in Figure 1. One hundred and forty two patients were selected from control arms of previous interventional or observational cohorts[-] and 21 patients had a liver biopsy performed as part of the diagnostic work-up of an acute deterioration of liver function in patients with alcoholic liver disease. In all cases, the purpose of liver biopsy was to confirm a presumed diagnosis of ASH.

Figure 1
Flowchart of patients' selection. Abbreviation: DF: discriminant function.

To be eligible, patients had to present with a history of heavy recent alcohol intake (> 80 gr per day), no radiological evidence of bile duct alterations, no documented hepatocellular carcinoma, no positive serology for hepatitis A, B, C or HIV, no disease associated with iron overload and no documented infection at the time of hospital admission and of liver biopsy. The main reason for excluding patients with concomitant infection is the commonly accepted role of sepsis-associated cholestasis as a confounding factor for the histological analysis. In addition, infection in decompensated cirrhotic patients with ASH is a major determinant of poor outcome. Therefore, infection was actively sought in all patients at time of hospital admission, as recommended. The evaluation included a diagnostic paracentesis, urine and blood cultures, and a chest radiograph. A neutrophil count > 250/mm 3 in ascites, whether or not associated with a positive culture, was diagnosed as a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and considered an exclusion criterion. Similarly, patients with microbiological evidence of infection in urine or blood, or with a pulmonary infiltrate on chest X-ray were not eligible for the analysis. During follow-up, patients were monitored closely for signs of infection, in particular for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as the most common site of infection in this patient population and received immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics in case of confirmation of diagnosis. Patients who received steroids were also administered preventive antibiotherapy with daily oral norfloxacin, in accordance to local guidelines. The diagnosis of ASH was based on histology in all patients, and the biopsy was performed early after hospital admission. All patients received standard medical care including nutritional therapy and support regarding alcohol abstinence during follow-up, as recommended. Patients with ASH and a Maddrey's score ≥ 32 or a MELD score ≥ 18 were identified as high risk for short-term mortality and were all treated by prednisone 40 mg daily for 28 days in addition to standard medical therapy. Patients' characteristics are summarized in table 1.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) risk enrichment and biopsy indications — MRE or corrected T1 (cT1) may help identify patients with "at-risk" NASH, defined as NASH with NAFLD activity score ≥ 4 and fibrosis stage ≥ 2. Liver biopsy should be considered when noninvasive tests (NITs) suggest significant fibrosis (≥ F2), when additional evaluation suggests "at-risk" NASH (eg, FAST, MEFIB, MAST, or cT1), when NIT assessment is indeterminate, when aminotransferases are persistently elevated (> 6 mo), or when alternate diagnoses are suspected; in patients with confirmed or suspected advanced disease, an ELF > 11.3 is a predictor of future liver-related events.

### Medical liver biopsy: background, indications, procedure and histopathology [^111SfEXq]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Fatty liver disease

Fatty liver is defined by an abnormal deposition of fat (or steatosis) within more than 5% of hepatocytes — this is best appreciated in figure 2. The two most common causes of fatty liver are excessive alcohol consumption and in association with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD). Other causes include drugs, coeliac disease, parenteral nutrition, starvation and HIV. Steatosis alone does not necessarily have any significant sequelae; however, inflammation (steatohepatitis) may result which can lead to fibrosis.

Biopsies are undertaken in both alcohol-related and non–alcohol-related aetiologies of fatty liver disease, although importantly it is usually not possible to tell the two aetiologies apart histologically. In alcohol-related liver disease, biopsy may be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or to accurately stage the disease. Liver biopsy used to be recommended in the context of severe alcoholic hepatitis to both confirm the presence of steatohepatitis and rule out other causes of liver injury; however, recent international guidelines and general opinion may be shifting away from this approach.

Alcohol consumption thresholds in suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) — By definition, NAFLD indicates the lack of evidence for ongoing or recent consumption of significant amounts of alcohol. For NASH clinical trials eligibility, significant alcohol consumption was recommended as > 21 standard drinks per week in men and > 14 standard drinks per week in women over a 2-year period preceding baseline liver histology, and a standard alcoholic drink contains about 14 g of pure alcohol. Ongoing or recent alcohol consumption > 21 standard drinks on average per week in men and > 14 standard drinks on average per week in women is a reasonable threshold for significant alcohol consumption when evaluating patients with suspected NAFLD.

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) — clinical spectrum and histology — has a broad range of presentation in which patients may exhibit few signs or symptoms or present with liver failure; AH per se is a clinical syndrome with a distinct histopathological correlate, called ASH. The histological features of AH may be present in patients with no symptoms and mild laboratory abnormalities, and its histological features consist of neutrophilic lobular inflammation, degenerative changes in hepatocytes (ballooning and Mallory-Denk bodies), steatosis, and pericellular fibrosis. However, these features are variable in individual cases and are often co-existent with frank cirrhosis.

Pathological considerations

Liver histology continues to provide information for diagnosis and prognosis of the patient where this cannot be obtained by non-invasive means (see box 1). This can be achieved only if the biopsy is of sufficient length and quality and examined by a suitably experienced histopathologist.

The scope and use of non-invasive tests is increasing, radically altering the need for liver biopsy. In particular, the number of biopsies obtained to assess disease severity when the diagnosis is established is falling. However, liver histology remains useful when clinical parameters and non-invasive tests suggest that there is more than one potential aetiological agent or give conflicting information.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcoholic liver disease [^111YKHvC]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline: Alcoholic liver disease — clinical spectrum, diagnosis, severity, and management highlights are as follows: Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) comprises a clinical-histologic spectrum including fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), and cirrhosis with its complications, and most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages with limited data on early disease. Diagnosis of ALD requires documentation of chronic heavy alcohol use and exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and prolonged abstinence is the most effective strategy to prevent disease progression. Alcoholic hepatitis presents with rapid onset or worsening of jaundice and, in severe cases, may transition to acute on chronic liver failure with risk for mortality that may be as high as 20–50% at 1 month depending on the number of extra-hepatic organ failures. Corticosteroids provide short-term survival benefit in about half of treated patients with severe AH, and long-term mortality is related to the severity of underlying liver disease and is dependent on abstinence from alcohol. General measures for hospitalized ALD include inpatient management of liver disease complications, management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, surveillance for infections and early effective antibiotic therapy, nutritional supplementation, and treatment of the underlying alcohol-use disorder. Liver transplantation is a definitive treatment option in patients with advanced alcoholic cirrhosis and may also be considered in selected patients with AH cases, who do not respond to medical therapy. There is a clinical unmet need to develop more effective and safer therapies for patients with ALD.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis medical patient journey from the perspective of hepatologists, gastroenterologists and patients: a cross-sectional survey [^113dfp96]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the inflammatory form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Both NAFLD and NASH are characterized by identification of > 5% hepatic steatosis in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption and other etiologies. NASH is characterized by steatosis accompanied by hepatocyte inflammation and injury (ballooning), which can perpetuate the development of fibrosis. The extent of liver fibrosis is the greatest predictor of hepatic morbidity and mortality. Both NAFLD and NASH can develop progressive hepatic fibrosis, though this is more likely in the context of NASH.

Globally, 25% of people are estimated to have NAFLD and 2–6% are estimated to have NASH. In the US, NAFLD prevalence is estimated at 37%; among patients with NAFLD, approximately 8% have advanced liver fibrosis. The prevalence of NASH is increasing, but more concerning is the disproportionate increase in those with advanced fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hepatic decompensation predicted by modeling studies. In the United States, NASH is currently the leading indication for liver transplant in women and those > 65 years of age and is predicted to become the overall leading indication for liver transplant. While there are currently no FDA approved pharmacologic treatments for NASH, management focused on optimal control of comorbidities, using available therapies that may have additive benefit in NASH, as well as implementation and sustained support for lifestyle change can improve liver health and overall health in patients with NASH.

NASH is underdiagnosed as patients are often asymptomatic or present with non-specific symptoms. According to 2018 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidance, NAFLD can be diagnosed by imaging or liver biopsy while NASH requires a liver biopsy. Many patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) are hesitant to use liver biopsies due to costs and associated risks. The requirement for liver biopsy to confirm diagnosis could be contributing to the under-diagnosis of NASH; liver biopsies are potentially dangerous, resource-intensive, and have limited scalability. The field is looking to non-invasive tests (NITs) to identify those at most risk, who can then be targeted for therapy or more confidently exclude those who do not need specialty care. Noninvasive risk stratification algorithms using calculations (e.g. Fibrosis-4 Index [FIB4]) followed by liver stiffness measurements in those with type 2 diabetes mellitus or high risk, are being proposed and refined to aid HCPs in their management.

### Treatment of alcoholic liver disease [^114Ga5P5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) remains a major cause of liver-related mortality in the US and worldwide. The correct diagnosis of ALD can usually be made on a clinical basis in conjunction with blood tests, and a liver biopsy is not usually required. Abstinence is the hallmark of therapy for ALD, and nutritional therapy is the first line of therapeutic intervention. The role of steroids in patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis is gaining increasing acceptance, with the caveat that patients be evaluated for the effectiveness of therapy at 1 week. Pentoxifylline appears to be especially effective in ALD patients with renal dysfunction/hepatorenal syndrome. Biologics such as specific anti-TNFs have been disappointing and should probably not be used outside of the clinical trial setting. Transplantation is effective in patients with end-stage ALD who have stopped drinking (usually for ≥ 6 months), and both long-term graft and patient survival are excellent.

### Extensive testing or focused testing of patients with elevated liver enzymes [^113vf1Rq]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Many patients have elevated serum aminotransferases reflecting many underlying conditions, both common and rare. Clinicians generally apply one of two evaluative strategies: testing for all diseases at once (extensive) or just common diseases first (focused).

Methods

We simulated the evaluation of 10,000 adult outpatients with elevated with alanine aminotransferase to compare both testing strategies. Model inputs employed population-based data from the US (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) and Britain (Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies). Patients were followed until a diagnosis was provided or a diagnostic liver biopsy was considered. The primary outcome was US dollars per diagnosis. Secondary outcomes included doctor visits per diagnosis, false-positives per diagnosis and confirmatory liver biopsies ordered.

Results

The extensive testing strategy required the lowest monetary cost, yielding diagnoses for 54% of patients at $448/patient compared to 53% for $502 under the focused strategy. The extensive strategy also required fewer doctor visits (1.35 vs. 1.61 visits/patient). However, the focused strategy generated fewer false-positives (0.1 vs. 0.19/patient) and more biopsies (0.04 vs. 0.08/patient). Focused testing becomes the most cost-effective strategy when accounting for pre-test probabilities and prior evaluations performed. This includes when the respective prevalence of alcoholic, non-alcoholic and drug-induced liver disease exceeds 51.1%, 53.0% and 13.0%. Focused testing is also the most cost-effective strategy in the referral setting where assessments for viral hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease have already been performed.

Conclusions

Testing for elevated liver enzymes should be deliberate and focused to account for pre-test probabilities if possible.

Lay Summary

Many patients have elevated liver enzymes reflecting one of many possible liver diseases, some of which are very common and some of which are rare. Tests are widely available for most causes but it is unclear whether clinicians should order them all at once or direct testing based on how likely a given disease may be given the patient's history and physical exam. The tradeoffs of both approaches involve the money spent on testing, number of office visits needed, and false positive results generated. This study shows that if there are no clues available at the time of evaluation, testing all at once saves time and money while causing more false positives. However, if there are strong clues regarding the likelihood of a particular disease, limited testing saves time, money and prevents false positives.
