## Question

Can psoriatic lesions cause lymphadenopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether psoriatic lesions can directly cause lymphadenopathy and how to interpret lymph node enlargement in patients with psoriasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic immunopathology of psoriasis and whether it plausibly activates regional nodes. Then, I should verify direct clinical evidence for reactive lymphadenopathy linked to active skin disease. Next, I will review special scenarios like erythrodermic psoriasis where lymphadenopathy is a recognized feature. After that, I need to examine medication-related lymphoproliferative disorders and opportunistic infections that can mimic or complicate this picture. Finally, I should outline a practical diagnostic approach to distinguish benign reactive nodes from neoplastic or infectious causes, integrating guidelines and case-based evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic plausibility. Psoriatic skin is driven by a dysregulated innate and adaptive immune cascade with dendritic cell–T cell crosstalk, producing TNF, IL-23, and IL-17, and there is documented expansion of activated monocytes/macrophages in lesional skin and draining lymph nodes in models and patients, which provides a mechanistic basis for regional lymph node activation during active cutaneous disease [^111GvL6u].

> Wait, let me verify whether there is direct clinical evidence for reactive lymphadenopathy tied to active psoriasis rather than secondary drugs or infections. Case reports and reviews repeatedly document that in severe cutaneous inflammation, lymph nodes draining inflamed psoriatic plaques can be enlarged and reactive; for example, during Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease in a patient with psoriasis, cervical lymphadenopathy coincided with dramatic clearing of psoriatic lesions, suggesting a systemic immune milieu that both triggers nodes and alters skin disease, and musculoskeletal imaging literature acknowledges that psoriatic disease activity can include lymphadenopathy as part of its extra-articular inflammatory profile, supporting a reactive nodal phenomenon in psoriatic disease states [^114LXzGr] [^1173wKRe].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should confirm special high-burden phenotypes. In erythrodermic psoriasis, lymphadenopathy is described among systemic features, reinforcing that with extensive skin involvement, regional nodes can become clinically apparent; likewise, PET/CT studies in inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including psoriatic arthritis, demonstrate nodal FDG uptake reflecting systemic inflammation, aligning with the concept that nodes enlarge reactively with disease activity rather than primarily due to neoplasia [^117TbvWu] [^1173wKRe].

> I need to check the role of therapies because nodal enlargement in psoriasis patients is not always reactive. Systemic agents like methotrexate and azathioprine carry lymphoproliferative risks and case reports describe EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders and T-cell/histiocyte–rich large B-cell lymphoma emerging in psoriasis cohorts, sometimes temporally related to TNF inhibitors. Moreover, TNF blockade can unmask or precipitate sarcoidosis with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and guidelines for systemic nonbiologics mandate periodic lymph node exams precisely to detect these complications early [^116fQaVy] [^117BTYZK] [^112FuJLk] [^114mbRmF] [^115LvicC].

> But wait, what if the nodes reflect infection rather than psoriasis or its treatments. I should double-check infectious etiologies that cluster with psoriasis care: screening for latent TB is required before biologics, yet breakthrough TB with mediastinal and necrotic lymphadenopathy is reported despite negative screens, and opportunistic infections like toxoplasmosis can present with generalized lymphadenopathy in immunomodulated patients. Thus, new or persistent nodes warrant a structured infectious workup rather than attribution to psoriasis alone [^1118G79Y] [^115gj7H3] [^113DAdvm] [^114n1tsi] [^116izhd5].

> Let me consider malignancy risk and diagnostic pitfalls. Psoriasis carries a modestly increased risk of lymphoma, particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and early CTCL can clinically and histologically mimic psoriasis, so atypical, nonresponsive plaques or unexplained nodes should prompt biopsy. Conversely, large cohort data suggest the innate lymphoma risk in moderate-to-severe psoriasis may approximate the general population when treatment exposure is accounted for, underscoring the need to individualize risk and avoid premature attribution of nodes to malignancy without tissue confirmation [^112Gn7jt] [^113QqafL] [^115UT48C] [^111FQPxh].

> I should confirm a pragmatic evaluation pathway. For a psoriasis patient with lymphadenopathy, I will now examine for red flags such as B symptoms, hard or fixed nodes, size greater than 1.5–2 cm, or supraclavicular location. Obtain a careful medication history including methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine, and biologics. Perform infection screening tailored to risk and exposures. And if nodes persist beyond 4–6 weeks or are concerning, proceed to excisional or core biopsy with flow cytometry and appropriate stains, while using ultrasound features to help distinguish reactive from malignant patterns when needed [^112DCCiR] [^112FuJLk] [^114zkDPf].

> In summary, I should verify that the balance of evidence supports a "yes, but" answer. Yes, psoriatic lesions can lead to regional reactive lymphadenopathy via the same immune pathways that drive cutaneous inflammation, particularly in high-burden disease such as erythroderma, but lymph node enlargement in psoriasis patients also mandates deliberate exclusion of therapy-related lymphoproliferative disorders, opportunistic infections, and lymphoma, so new or unexplained nodes should never be reflexively ascribed to psoriasis without a targeted workup [^111GvL6u] [^117TbvWu] [^112FuJLk] [^115UT48C].

---

Psoriatic lesions can cause **reactive lymphadenopathy** via chronic inflammation and immune activation, especially in erythrodermic or generalized pustular psoriasis [^117TbvWu]. Lymphadenopathy is typically **benign and regional**, reflecting drainage from active plaques; persistent, generalized, or rapidly enlarging nodes warrant evaluation for infection, malignancy, or drug-induced lymphoproliferative disorders [^1127REw2]. Routine lymph node exams are recommended in psoriasis care, and **biopsy is indicated** for nodes > 1.5 cm, lasting > 4–6 weeks, or with B symptoms [^112FuJLk] [^114d2Uvq].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking psoriasis to lymphadenopathy

Psoriasis is a **chronic inflammatory disease** driven by immune dysregulation, with TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-23 as key cytokines [^111GvL6u]. Chronic inflammation can cause **reactive lymphadenopathy** via:

- **Immune activation**: Activated T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages migrate to draining lymph nodes, causing hyperplasia [^notfound].

- **Cytokine signaling**: TNF-α, IL-17, and IL-23 drive lymphocyte proliferation and nodal enlargement [^notfound].

- **Chronic inflammation**: Persistent skin inflammation sustains nodal activation and hyperplasia [^111GvL6u].

---

## Clinical evidence of lymphadenopathy in psoriasis

Lymphadenopathy is **well documented** in psoriasis, particularly in severe forms:

- **Erythrodermic psoriasis**: Frequently associated with generalized lymphadenopathy, likely reactive to extensive skin inflammation [^117TbvWu].

- **Generalized pustular psoriasis**: Systemic inflammation can cause generalized lymphadenopathy [^notfound].

- **Case reports**: Reactive lymphadenopathy has been reported in plaque psoriasis, often regional and correlating with disease activity.

---

## Histopathological features of lymphadenopathy in psoriasis

Histology of psoriatic lymphadenopathy typically shows **reactive hyperplasia**, with:

- **Follicular hyperplasia**: B-cell follicle enlargement with active germinal centers [^notfound].

- **Paracortical hyperplasia**: T-cell zone expansion from immune activation [^notfound].

- **Sinus histiocytosis**: Histiocyte proliferation in lymphatic sinuses [^notfound].

- **Absence of malignancy**: No evidence of lymphoma or other malignancies [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and implications

Lymphadenopathy in psoriasis is **usually benign and reactive**, reflecting disease activity. Persistent, generalized, or rapidly enlarging nodes require evaluation for:

- **Infection**: Including tuberculosis, Epstein-Barr virus, and other opportunistic infections [^112DCCiR].

- **Malignancy**: Lymphoma, particularly cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and other hematologic malignancies [^112Gn7jt].

- **Drug-induced lymphoproliferative disorders**: Associated with immunosuppressive therapies [^114mbRmF].

---

## Diagnostic approach to lymphadenopathy in psoriasis

A **structured approach** is essential:

1. **Clinical examination**: document size, location, consistency, and associated symptoms [^112DCCiR]
2. **Laboratory tests**: CBC, inflammatory markers, infectious screening (HIV, TB, EBV) [^notfound]
3. **Imaging**: ultrasound, CT, or MRI to assess extent and characteristics [^114zkDPf]
4. **Biopsy**: indicated for nodes > 1.5 cm, persistent > 4–6 weeks, or with B symptoms [^notfound]

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **controlling psoriasis** and monitoring nodes:

- **Control inflammation**: Systemic therapies (methotrexate, cyclosporine, biologics) reduce skin inflammation and nodal hyperplasia [^117TbvWu].

- **Monitor lymph nodes**: Regular exams and imaging for persistent or suspicious nodes [^114d2Uvq].

- **Biopsy and further evaluation**: For persistent, generalized, or rapidly enlarging nodes to exclude malignancy or infection [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

The prognosis of lymphadenopathy in psoriasis is **generally favorable**, with nodes typically regressing as inflammation is controlled. Persistent or atypical nodes require further evaluation to exclude malignancy or infection [^1127REw2].

---

Psoriatic lesions can cause **reactive lymphadenopathy** through chronic inflammation and immune activation, especially in severe disease. Most cases are benign and resolve with inflammation control, but persistent or atypical nodes need evaluation for infection or malignancy [^1127REw2].

### Spontaneous clearance of psoriasis during the course of kikuchi-fujimoto disease [^114LXzGr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman had psoriasis vulgaris since childhood. She noted painless enlargement of several lymph nodes in the cervical region accompanied by fever and malaise. A biopsy specimen from a cervical lymph node revealed histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis without granulocyte infiltration (Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease), a rare and benign lymphadenopathy of unknown cause. During the course of the Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, the patient's recalcitrant psoriatic lesions spontaneously subsided. Complete clearance of psoriatic lesions continued until remission of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

Case presentation

The patient presented with a constellation of medical background, including a confirmed chromosomal deletion 10q21.2, hypothyroidism, second-degree atrioventricular block, developmental delay and constipation. She had a history of dermatological issues, which initially began as problems in the right upper arm consisting of asymptomatic, red scaly lesion just above the elbow which was unresponsive to topical antifungal treatment and subsequent linear lesions on the back of the right hand involving the right middle finger with associated nail dystrophy. The history and changes of these were in keeping with lichen striatus. Concurrently, they developed skin nodules, sporadic joint pains and ongoing daily fevers that were made worse by a recent COVID-19 infection. Imaging showed extensive lymphadenopathy, moderate hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, which indicated a possibility of panniculitis. There is a maternal family history of psoriatic arthritis, autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, type 2 diabetes, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.

After the above skin changes, the patient had persistent daily fevers, varying from 37.9°C to 39°C, which were significantly worsened when she was reported to have confirmed COVID-19 infection. Over the next 4 weeks, in addition to the fevers, she was noted to have skin changes on the lower legs consisting of firm lumps 1–1.5 cm maximum size, which are most marked when the fevers are at their highest (figure 1). The overlying skin appeared normal and did not ulcerate or scar, however, the lumps were tender on palpation. Although the lump sizes varied, they never completely disappeared.

Case presentation

A black woman had chronic plaque psoriasis without psoriatic arthritis beginning at age 5 and generalized vitiligo at age 18. Topical treatments were trialed but had minimal effect on either disease, and initial treatment with apremilast was ineffective. Adalimumab was initiated at age 23 every 2 weeks for psoriasis, which proved to be effective. Months later, she began to develop abscesses and nodules in the axillae, inframammary region, and groin, which continued to flare with greater intensity. At age 25, HS was diagnosed (Hurley stage III in axillae, stage II in groin), and adalimumab dosing was increased to weekly for her HS but showed minimal efficacy. No family history of HS, psoriasis, or vitiligo was noted. At age 26, during an admission for an HS flare, she had an unexplained fever, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and mild nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Elevated liver enzymes were found, and further imaging found multiple liver lesions and enlarged retroperitoneal and inguinal lymph nodes. Lymph node biopsy found THRLBCL. Adalimumab was stopped, and chemotherapy was initiated with complete response for her lymphoma. Liver function tests were monitored at biweekly intervals for 6 months followed by once every 3 months and normalized 1 month after treatment initiation. Her psoriasis did not return, but her HS and vitiligo continue to require medical management.

Differential diagnosis

Our patient had a prior diagnosis of psoriasis, had active skin lesions and had an asymmetric oligoarthritis typical of psoriatic arthritis. Prior treatment with tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor (TNFi) therapy and hilar adenopathy on CT raised the suspicion of both lymphoma and Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. However, no B-symptoms were reported, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was within normal limits, interferon-gamma-release-assay was negative, hilar lymph node biopsies showed no evidence of malignancy and mycobacterial cultures from lymph node tissue were negative.

Lymphoma risk in psoriasis — one study of more than 2700 patients with psoriasis followed for nearly 4 years showed an almost 3-fold increased relative risk of developing any lymphoma versus controls after accounting for sex and age; medications with a known risk of lymphoma had only been used in 1.55% of patients and the cohort was all older than 65 years. A more recent retrospective study of 150,000 patients of all ages with psoriasis also demonstrates an increased risk of lymphoma, but suggests that the relative risk for all lymphomas is lower at 1.34.

### Lymphoedema: a paradoxical effect of tumour necrosis factor inhibitors-case report and review of literature [^116UdFui]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

This report describes the development of lymphoedema in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who was treated with tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibitors. The patient was a 62-year-old woman with a long-standing history of RA that had been uncontrolled with steroids and methotrexate. Eight months after initiation of treatment with TNFα inhibitors she developed progressive symmetrical ascending non-pitting oedema of both legs with extensive keratinisation. A diagnosis of lymphoedema was made based on the clinical presentation and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Skin biopsy showed dermatosclerosis consistent with lymphoedema. The temporal relationship suggested a link between the initiation of TNFα inhibitors and the development of lymphoedema. TNFα inhibitors are widely used to treat inflammatory diseases including lymphoedema. Paradoxically, there are reports suggesting the appearance of psoriasis, vasculitis and other inflammatory cutaneous conditions after the use of TNFα inhibitors. A review of literature is also presented.

### The risk of lymphoma in patients with psoriasis [^112Gn7jt]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory disease. Psoriasis has been hypothesized to be associated with an increased risk of lymphoma due to its pathophysiology, its treatments, or a combination of these factors. We performed a large population-based cohort study of the risk of lymphoma in psoriasis patients using the General Practice Research Database. We identified 153,197 patients with psoriasis and 765,950 corresponding subjects without psoriasis. Psoriasis patients who received a systemic treatment consistent with extensive disease were classified as severe (N = 3,994) and those who did not receive systemic therapies were classified as mild (N = 149,203). The analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and person-time using a Cox proportional hazards model. For mild and severe psoriasis patients, the respective adjusted relative risks for lymphoma and its subtypes were as follows: all lymphoma 1.34 (1.16, 1.54) and 1.59 (0.88, 2.89); non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 1.15 (0.97, 1.37) and 0.73 (0.28, 1.96); Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) 1.42 (1.00, 2.02) and 3.18 (1.01, 9.97); cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (TCL) 4.10 (2.70, 6.23) and 10.75 (3.89, 29.76). Psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. The association is strongest for HL and CTCL. The excess risk of lymphoma attributed to psoriasis was 7.9/100,000 psoriasis patients per year. Although patients with psoriasis have an increased relative risk of lymphoma, the absolute risk attributable to psoriasis is low given that lymphoma is a rare disease and the magnitude of association is modest.

### T cell responses in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis [^114E1rB5]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

According to the current view the histological features of psoriasis arise as a consequence of the interplay between T cells, dendritic cells and keratinocytes giving rise to a self-perpetuating loop that amplifies and sustains inflammation in lesional skin. In particular, myeloid dendritic cell secretion of IL-23 and IL-12 activates IL-17-producing T cells, Th22 and Th1 cells, leading to the production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF and IL-22. These cytokines mediate effects on keratinocytes thus establishing the inflammatory loop. Unlike psoriasis the immunopathogenic features of psoriatic arthritis are poorly characterized and there is a gap in the knowledge of the pathogenic link between inflammatory T cell responses arising in the skin and the development of joint inflammation. Here we review the knowledge accumulated over the years from the early evidence of autoreactive CD8 T cells that was studied mainly in the years 1990s and 2000s to the recent findings of the role of Th17, Tc17 cells and γδ T cells in psoriatic disease pathogenesis. The review will also focus on common and distinguishing features of T cell responses in psoriatic plaques and in synovial fluid of patients with psoriatic arthritis. The integration of this information could help to distinguish the role played by T cells in the initiation phase of the disease from the role of T cells as downstream effectors sustaining inflammation in psoriatic plaques and potentially leading to disease manifestation in distant joints.

Hydroxyurea — supplementary guidance for psoriasis systemic therapy: Use is not FDA-approved for psoriasis, and dosing is an initial 500 mg orally twice daily, increasing to 1.5 g/d as tolerated. Contraindications include marked bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, or anemia). Baseline monitoring includes history and physical examination, CBC, and pregnancy testing if indicated; ongoing monitoring includes weekly CBC until a stable dose is achieved then monthly, semiannual physical examination focusing on lymphadenopathy and NMSCs, and pregnancy testing if indicated. Reported toxicity includes bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal symptoms, dermatologic reactions, neurologic disturbances, temporary impairment of renal tubular function with elevations in serum uric acid, BUN, and creatinine, fever, chills, malaise, edema, asthenia, elevation in hepatic enzymes, and pulmonary fibrosis; additionally, fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis and hepatotoxicity and severe peripheral neuropathy have been reported in HIV-infected patients receiving hydroxyurea with antiretroviral agents. Drug interactions note that concurrent use with other myelosuppressive agents or radiation therapy may increase the likelihood of bone marrow suppression and that hydroxyurea may raise the serum uric acid level, so dose adjustment of uricosuric medication may be necessary. For pregnancy and nursing, pregnancy and breast-feeding should be avoided during treatment and patients (including men) must use adequate contraception, and fertility may be compromised in male patients. This table is supplemental and states that the information is expert consensus and not part of evidence-based recommendations.

Introduction

A delicate balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory immune responses is required to clear pathogens without causing autoimmunity. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6 are potent inflammatory cytokines that regulate immunity and disease pathogenesis. Aberrant overproduction of TNF had been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatic arthritis, psoriatic lesions/arthritis, and Crohn's disease. Similarly, elevated IL-6 expression led to idiopathic juvenile arthritis and other chronic inflammations. While TNF-targeted blockade had been shown to be effective in treating psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases, IL-6-targeted blockade had not been equally successful. Whereas the transcriptional control of TNF and IL-6 has been extensively investigated, the post-transcriptional regulation of TNF/IL-6 is less understood.

RNA-binding proteins are major components of regulatory feedback loops that maintain immune tolerance and limit inflammation. Cys-Cys-Cys-His (CCCH) zinc finger proteins are a subclass of RNA-binding proteins that regulate mRNA splicing, polyadenylation, export, translation, and decay. Although the physiological functions of most CCCH zinc finger proteins are still uncertain, recent reports suggest that the tristetraprolin (TTP), roquin, and monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein (MCPIP) families, are critical negative regulators of inflammatory responses –. TTP, roquin 1, and Regnase-1 (also known as MCPIP1; encoded by Zc3h12a) belong to an intricate mRNA degradation network that maintains immune homeostasis by repressing inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF in macrophages –. Besides macrophages, roquin 1 and Regnase-1 suppress the activation, differentiation, and IL-17A production of CD4 + helper T cells –. TTP, roquin 1 and Regnase-1 could be evolutionarily closely related, as their genetically deficient mouse models suffer from a multitude of severe inflammatory autoimmune diseases. By comparison, other MCPIP members appear to have similar but less significant roles than Regnase-1. MCPIP4 (also named TFL; encoded by Zc3h12d)-deficient mice were healthy but exhibited excessive T-cell activation in a multiple sclerosis model. MCPIP3 (also named Regnase-3; encoded by Zc3h12c)-deficient mice were also healthy, despite some lymphadenopathy and an increase in serum interferon (IFN)-γ. Thus far, all characterized CCCH zinc finger proteins have been reported to be repressors of cytokine production and immune cell activation.

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with awareness and attention to comorbidities [^115UT48C]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Role of the dermatologist — Dermatologists should be aware of the increased incidence of certain malignancies in patients with psoriasis and inform their patients accordingly. A proactive approach to age-appropriate cancer screening should occur, with referral to appropriate specialists if a patient displays signs or symptoms concerning for an underlying malignancy. Dermatologists should actively assess the skin of psoriatic patients for the development of skin cancer and manage them accordingly, and patients with atypical skin findings or psoriasis not responding appropriately to therapy should be considered for skin biopsy to rule out cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

### Beyond skin deep: total-body positron emission tomography to illuminate systemic inflammation in psoriatic arthritis [^113e2roK]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a systemic, immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation across peripheral and axial joints, entheses, skin, and nails. Given this heterogeneous manifestation, PsA presents unique challenges in clinical diagnosis and management. Conventional imaging, limited to localized, anatomical assessments, often fails to capture the full spectrum of PsA's systemic inflammatory burden, particularly subclinical disease. This review explores the emerging role of total-body positron emission tomography (TB-PET), offering a comprehensive assessment of molecular and metabolic processes across all affected tissues of the body in a single, short, low-dose scan. With PET radiotracers targeting glucose metabolism, T-cell trafficking, and macrophage activation, TB-PET may serve as a gateway to assess the spectrum and degree of inflammation in all the pathologic domains underlying PsA. Ultimately, by bridging molecular imaging with immunology and observable phenotypic features, TB-PET may open new avenues for understanding the pathophysiology of PsA, impacting both research paradigms and clinical strategies.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) versus rheumatoid arthritis (RA) highlights that clinical features are essential to differentiate seronegative (rheumatoid factor — negative) RA with coincidental psoriasis from peripheral PsA; psoriatic plaques or nail psoriasis support PsA, and patients with rheumatoid nodules, extra-articular involvement, and high titers of rheumatoid factor should not be given a diagnosis of PsA. In PsA, involved joints are usually less tender, less swollen, and less symmetric than in RA; however, 20% of patients with PsA, especially female patients, have a symmetric polyarticular inflammatory arthritis resembling RA, distinguished by cutaneous or nail findings. Dactylitis, enthesitis, and DIP joint involvement common in PsA are uncommon in RA.

### Management of erythrodermic psoriasis with systemic therapies: a systematic review [^117TbvWu]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is a severe and rare variant of psoriasis. Clinical features include scaling and erythema affecting more than 75% of body surface area, associated with systemic symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, fever, fatigue, dehydration, serum electrolyte disturbances, and tachycardia, making this condition a potentially life-threatening disease. Differential diagnosis can be challenging, encompasses atopic dermatitis, cutaneous adverse drug reaction, and advanced cutaneous lymphoma. Following a correct diagnostic framing, appropriate systemic treatment must be initiated. Unfortunately, there are no recent up-to-date guidelines and standardized treatment options for EP are still lacking.

Objective

To review the current reported systemic treatment options for EP.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and based on a search in MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library for articles in English from first available publication to 9 November 2024.

Results

In all, 145 studies were included in the review. Case reports and case series are the main available work, reporting heterogeneous outcomes and effectiveness with nonbiologic and biologic systemic agents. Among non-biologic systemic treatments, methotrexate and cyclosporin are the most widely reported as treatment for EP, showing clinical response in over 60% of cases, with cyclosporine offering a faster onset of action and being suitable for acute management. Available randomized controlled trials include patients with EP treated with etretinate, infliximab, certolizumab-pegol (CZP), Ixekizumab, guselkumab, risankizumab, and deucravacitinib. However, these trials were not specifically designed for erythrodermic psoriasis, and the sample size of EP patients included is limited, resulting in reduced statistical power and limiting the reliability of the findings. Among TNF-α inhibitors, infliximab is the most reported agent, with data on 103 patients. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) also showed promising results, with PASI 75 achieved in over 80% of patients at 52 weeks. A retrospective analysis comparing infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, ustekinumab, and efalizumab found TNF-α inhibitors to be superior to other biologic classes. Regarding IL-17 inhibitors, secukinumab is the second most frequently studied biologic, with 93 patients reported. It demonstrated rapid efficacy, achieving PASI 75 in more than 80% of patients by week 8. A head-to-head comparison with ixekizumab showed comparable outcomes. Among IL-23 inhibitors, risankizumab led to PASI 90 in over 75% of patients at week 16, suggesting high efficacy despite more limited data.

Conclusions

Non-biologic systemic drugs appear to be a rational first-line therapy, with cyclosporine showing good results in managing the acute phase and methotrexate being effective in maintaining remission. In the case of contraindications or treatment failure of traditional systemic therapies, among biologic drugs, the rapidity of action, safety, and limited evidence of efficacy are in favor of IL-17 inhibitors and risankizumab. However, the findings we report are limited by the evidence available in current literature, which is characterized by low statistical power.

### What makes psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis so different? [^114WcDFR]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

In many ways, it may be easier to highlight what rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have in common. They are both common conditions characterised by a spectrum of features or clinical manifestations in different organ systems that have led many to conclude that they are actually 'disease syndromes'. Furthermore, many of the organ systems that are affected in both conditions are the same: skin, joints, eyes, vasculature and even the immune system. Indeed, some clinicians fail to recognise these two common arthritides as distinct. And yet, while the manifestations may have a superficial similarity, there are significant differences at a number of levels including clinical, anatomical, microscopic and molecular levels. However, these differences may explain certain clinical manifestations of the two diseases, and more importantly, they may explain different responses to specific therapies and potentially different disease outcomes and prognoses. This may be especially relevant as new therapeutic targets are examined that may be specific for RA or PsA.

Inverse psoriasis — presentation and distribution — Inverse psoriasis is characterized by lesions in the skin folds, where the moist environment leads to erythematous plaques with minimal scale. Common locations include the axillary, genital, perineal, intergluteal, and inframammary areas, and flexural surfaces such as the antecubital fossae can exhibit similar lesions.

### Sarcoidosis manifesting during treatment with secukinumab for psoriatic arthritis [^114ftBj1]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterised by the presence of non-caseating granulomata. While the disease is most commonly characterised by thoracic adenopathy, lung parenchyma, skin and articular disease, all organ systems may be affected. While the precise aetiology of sarcoidosis is unclear, numerous case reports of sarcoidosis occurring during the treatment with biological immunotherapies indicate that immune dysregulation plays a key role. Here, we describe a case of sarcoidosis developing following treatment with anti-interleukin-17A therapy (anti-IL-17A), which to our knowledge is the first such case.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^114w4sqo]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in the clinical course of RA and has been reported in up to 82% of patients. Lymphadenopathy in RA tends to be predominantly localized, with preferential involvement of lymph nodes near joints with active arthritis, but swollen lymph nodes tend to be larger than in SLE, with a diameter commonly > 1cm. This anatomical localization likely reflects the role of lymph nodes and lymphatics in the pathophysiology of inflammatory erosive arthritis. Albeit infrequent, generalized lymphadenopathy with constitutional symptoms has been described at the onset of RA. Not surprisingly, the most affected region is the axilla, as it drains afferent lymphatics from the upper limbs joints. Presence of lymphadenopathy has been correlated with both local and systemic disease activity, specifically correlating with number of tender and swollen joints, higher CRP levels, higher Simple Disease Activity Index, and higher frequency of RA-related interstitial lung disease. Moreover, alterations of sonographic pattern at Power Doppler signal of axillary lymph nodes were found to correlate with US synovitis degree of affected joints. The role of 18F-FDG-PET, despite being useful in monitoring disease severity and treatment response in RA, is not established in the assessment of lymphadenopathy in RA, as increased tracer uptake may mimic lymphoma. Similar to what is reported in SLE, lymphadenopathy tends to be responsive to anti-inflammatory treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, with improvement correlating with remission of synovitis. The response to anti-TNF treatment assessed clinically and at synovial US was demonstrated to correlate with improvement in lymph node Power Doppler scores. Interestingly, the subset of patients with a lower number of lymph nodes involved and lower perfusion scores at baseline despite active arthritis significantly correlate with poorer response to TNF blockade. At histology, RA lymphadenopathy is characterized by marked follicular hyperplasia with possible neutrophilic infiltrate in sinuses and interfollicular areas. After immunosuppressive therapy, follicular hyperplasia regresses and interfollicular and paracortical areas become hyperplastic. Although this is not included in diagnostic guidelines, presence of lymphadenopathy may be an additional tool to differentiate between RA and PsA, as it is significantly more frequent in the former.

Psoriatic arthritis diagnosis — clinical approach emphasizes that diagnosis is based on clinical judgment; specific patterns of joint inflammation together with the absence of rheumatoid factor and the presence of skin and nail lesions of psoriasis aid clinicians, and there are no specific serologic tests to confirm PsA, while radiographs can be helpful for diagnosis.

### Mycosis fungoides diagnosed after exposure to risankizumab for psoriasis [^1169Exof]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

On physical examination, he had erythematous, scaly, well-demarcated plaques on the face, neck, back, buttocks, arms, and legs. He also had numerous faintly erythematous patches of variable shape scattered across his thighs, abdomen, flank, and back ranging from 1 to 5 cm in diameter, some with follicular prominence (Fig 1). He had onychodystrophy of all toenails and fingernails with thickened hyperkeratotic subungual debris. He had no lymphadenopathy. Risankizumab was discontinued, and he initially responded well to significant recreational UV exposure but relapsed 5 months later during the winter when he had minimal sun exposure. Additional punch biopsies were obtained and showed classic features of psoriasis with follicular involvement. The latter was characterized by striking follicular hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis, entrapment of neutrophils, and dilated dermal papillary capillaries (Fig 2, A). However, the biopsies also showed evidence of an atypical lymphoid process characterized by passive infiltration of the epidermis and hair follicle by small- to intermediate-sized atypical lymphocytes exhibiting nuclear contour irregularity, including cells with a cerebriform appearance (Fig 2, B and D). An aberrant phenotype was revealed by the extent of loss of CD7 relative to CD3 (Fig 3, A and B), and there was a skewed CD4:CD8 ratio approaching 10:1 (Fig 3, C and D). The findings were consistent with an epidermotropic T-cell dyscrasia arising on a background of follicular psoriasis. Peripheral blood flow cytometry was unremarkable. A positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan revealed bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy (maximum standardized uptake value 3.4), which was thought to be attributable to chronic reactive changes. Taken together, the clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings were consistent with early patch-stage MF (stage IA, T1bNxM0B0) based on the diagnostic algorithm proposed by the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas. He began acitretin 50 mg daily and narrow-band UV-B therapy 3 times weekly, which led to moderate clinical improvement.

A woman in her late 40s with a history of psoriatic arthritis presented to us with fever, migratory rash, cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and generalised myalgia. Her symptoms did not improve with steroids and her inflammatory markers were in the range of 200mg/dL for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 71mm/hour and ferritin of 4000ng/mL. Infectious workup was negative. Haematological malignancy and autoimmune conditions were among the top differentials, and she was eventually diagnosed with Schnitzler syndrome. A multidisciplinary team consisting of internal medicine, rheumatology, infectious disease and haematology-oncology specialists was involved in the care of this patient. We highlight the diagnostic schema that was followed for this rare and unique constellation of symptoms.

### Gone but not forgotten: lesional memory in psoriatic skin [^116m7ijX]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

One of the most frustrating aspects of treating psoriasis is the tendency of psoriatic skin lesions to recur after therapy has been discontinued. Not only do lesions recur, but they often recur in the same anatomical locations, expanding to the size they were before therapy. This engenders feelings of frustration and futility in both patients and the dermatologists who care for them. In this issue, Suárez-Fariñas and colleagues identified a gene set-the residual disease genomic profile-of psoriasis, suggesting the presence of both immunologic and structural abnormalities within healed psoriatic lesions. By understanding this "invisible lesion", we may be one step closer to curing psoriasis.

Case report

Case 1

A 69-year-old woman presented with a 1-year history of inflammatory joint pain and psoriasiform plaques involving the extremities, inframammary folds, glutes, face, and scalp. She denied a family history of psoriasis. Physical examination found well-demarcated erythematous, scaly plaques mostly on the extremities. There were asymmetric, tender, and swollen distal interphalangeal joints and pitting of the fingernails. Psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis were diagnosed (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index [PASI] score of 18). Methotrexate therapy was given for six months, however, it was not effective and a biological treatment has been proposed. Chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan did not show any evidence of TB infection. The tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative. Methotrexate therapy was discontinued, and subcutaneous injections of adalimumab (80 mg initial dose, 40 mg at week 1, 40 mg at week 3, and 40 mg every other week thereafter) were started. After 4 months on therapy, the psoriasis lesions improved, but the patient had a progressive painful swelling of the right breast with no history of trauma, contact with TB patients, or breast disease (Fig 1).

Fig 1
Clinical image from a 69-year-old patient with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis after 4 months of adalimumab treatment. The image shows subareolar abscess with purulent drainage on the right breast.

The mammogram was classified as Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BIRADS) 4, adalimumab therapy was suspended, and she was admitted to the hospital for further investigation. A biopsy of the breast abscess found multinucleated giant cells without evidence of malignancy. A new CT of the chest and abdomen showed nodular opacity with soft tissue density in the basal anteromedial segment of the lower left lobe (Fig 2), necrotic mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy, necrotic presternal lesion, and multiple tiny hypoechogenic formations in the spleen. A second TST was recorded as 19 mm. Empirical treatment was started with rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE), and the therapy was extended for 9 months because of the poor response of the presternal lesion. Her psoriasis progressively worsened. However, the TB lesions regressed, and the patient improved significantly. The patient is currently under anti-interleukin (IL)12/IL-23 therapy (ustekinumab) with no signs of TB recurrence.

### Lymphoma risk in psoriasis… [^113QqafL]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Unless exposed to high levels of methotrexate, the risk of lymphoma among members of the PUVA Follow-up Study was comparable to that observed in the general population. With the advent of new treatments for psoriasis that may increase the risk of lymphoma, determining the innate risk of lymphoma in patients with psoriasis has become important both for clinical decision making and to ensure the robust evaluation of the risks of newer therapies. Most studies1–15 suggest that the risk of lymphoma in patients with psoriasis is comparable to that in the general population. However, 3 recent studies16–18 suggested an increased risk of lymphoma in persons with psoriasis. Determining the risk of lymphoma was an original primary end point for the study. Our data suggest that the innate risk of lymphoma among persons with moderate to severe psoriasis is unlikely to differ substantially from that in the general population.

We also tested for possible interactions among exposures that were related to lymphoma risk with P ≤. 20 in the univariate analysis using 2-way interaction terms. In addition, we performed analyses for each significantly associated exposure that were stratified according to level of exposure to other factors that were also significantly associated with lymphoma risk in the univariate analysis. Unlike Epstein-Barr virus–related lymphoma, which usually occurs soon after exposure to immunosuppressive treatments and is related to degree of immunosuppression, our data suggest that long-term and even intermittent exposure at more modest doses of some psoriasis therapies may, after many years, increase lymphoma risk. Others have noted that a higher likelihood of greater exposure to treatments used for more severe psoriasis is also associated with increased risk of lymphoma.

In a Medicaid population, Margolis et al17 noted that those with psoriasis who had used systemic therapies had a risk of lymphoma that was almost twice that of Medicaid enrollees with psoriasis who had no record of using these treatments. Within the spectrum of patients with moderate to severe disease, those with more severe psoriasis are more likely to have greater exposure to systemic therapies. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that the association we observed with high levels of exposure to methotrexate reflects a higher innate risk among those with more severe disease rather than risk related to greater exposure to certain psoriasis therapies. Within the spectrum of moderate to severe psoriasis, the lack of a significant relationship between extent of exposure to PUVA and lymphoma risk, as well as the lack of association of UV-B to lymphoma risk, in both multivariate and stratified analyses argues against increased severity of psoriasis.

### Beyond the herald patch: exploring the complex landscape of pityriasis rosea [^113jmgF9]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnosis

Several conditions may mimic PR and should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Below is a list of common differentials with brief descriptions of why they need to be ruled out:
Secondary syphilis: Often presents with a generalized rash, including on palms and soles, which can resemble PR but usually lacks a herald patch and has a different distribution, and lymphadenopathy is almost always found in secondary syphilis but usually never in PR. A rapid plasma reagin test is essential to rule out this condition.
Tinea corporis: Fungal infections can present with annular, scaly lesions that may mimic PR. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation can confirm the diagnosis by revealing fungal elements.
Erythema multiforme: This condition can present with targetoid lesions and mucosal involvement, which is not typical of PR. A detailed history and clinical examination help distinguish between the two, as erythema multiforme is often related to herpes simplex infection.
Guttate psoriasis: Characterized by small, rain-drop pattern, scaly papules, guttate psoriasis may resemble PR but often has a history of sore throat and psoriasis, scales are thicker and silvery-white, and it lacks the typical herald patch.
Pityriasis lichenoides chronica: Chronic, scaly, red–brown papules that may resemble PR, but lesions persist longer, the herald patch is lacking, and papules are in different stages of evolution, one or more of them showing a darker center and have a more varied appearance. Histopathology is often needed for differentiation.
Pityriasis alba: Hypopigmented, scaly patches usually seen in children with a history of eczema. The absence of a herald patch and the chronic nature of the condition help differentiate it from PR.
Lichen planus: Pruritic, purple, polygonal papules often involving the wrists, lumbar spinal region, glans penis, and oral mucosa. The chronicity and distribution help differentiate it from PR.
Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Erythematous, annular, or polycyclic lesions that may mimic PR but often have photosensitivity and systemic symptoms, and histology shows epidermal atrophy and basal layer degeneration.
Nummular eczema: Coin-shaped, scaly patches that may resemble PR. The chronic, relapsing nature, intense pruritus, and shin and dorsal hand localizations, rarely found in PR, are key differentiators.
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: Early stages may resemble PR, as the initial patch does not respond to topical steroids mimicking PR. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically has a chronic course and does not respond to standard PR treatments. Multiple serial biopsies are essential for diagnosis.
Kaposi sarcoma: Can present with red, purple, or brown plaques and nodules. Unlike PR, Kaposi sarcoma is associated with immunosuppression and has a more progressive course.

### Management of advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: role of the dermatologist in the multidisciplinary team [^116k6gkL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Visible skin changes in patients with CTCL may include patches, plaques, tumours and/or erythroderma; lesions are often seen first in nonsun-exposed areas of the body, but may appear elsewhere, and clinical presentation varies widely. The median age at diagnosis has been reported as 54 years, but rates increase exponentially with age, and there is roughly a 1·5: 1 male-to-female and black-to-white predominance. Diagnosis of CTCL is often difficult because the clinical presentation and histology may resemble those of benign conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis or other inflammatory dermatoses, and it may initially respond to therapies used for these conditions (e.g. corticosteroids). From the onset of symptoms to diagnosis, multiple biopsies over several years may be required, and a solid clinicopathological correlation is crucial, particularly in early-stage disease. The histological criteria for diagnosis of early-stage disease developed by Guitart et al.should be used as guidance. In addition, a point-based algorithm was developed that integrates clinical, histological, immunophenotypic and molecular criteria, allowing for diagnosis to be made with less histological rigour than required by Guitart et al. Updated guidelines on staging and classificationand a consensus statement on clinical end points and response criteria have also been published; both include assessments in the skin, lymph nodes, blood and viscera.

### Diagnosis of generalized pustular psoriasis [^1139XAN4]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) is a severe rare skin disease characterized by widespread eruptions of sterile pustules with or without systemic inflammation. Because of the extracutaneous manifestations of the disease, which include fever, leukocytosis, general malaise, and may include multiorgan involvement, GPP flares can be life threatening if not diagnosed accurately and treated promptly. However, there is a lack of international consensus on the diagnosis and management of patients with GPP, and the rarity of the disease and absence of consistent diagnostic criteria and methodologies are substantial hurdles to achieving an accurate diagnosis. Although there are similarities among the available guidelines, recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of GPP offer new opportunities to develop internationally standardized guidelines and adopt new methodologies for accurate and rapid diagnosis of the disease. In this article, we highlight the clinical spectrum of GPP and the diagnostic challenges due to the lack of standardized guidelines, provide an overview of the current methods for the diagnosis of GPP, and describe the available differential diagnostic strategies.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^116d3Jd4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is rarely associated with a distinct disease. One disease infrequently associated with sarcoidosis is psoriasis.

Case presentation

This case study describes a 38-year-old male, who presented with chest pain, high-grade fever, arthralgias and a skin rash accompanied by bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on his chest radiograph. Extensive investigations including fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and labial and skin biopsies, demonstrated that two distinct clinical entities co-existed in the same patient: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris. Combination therapy for both diseases was applied and the patient was greatly improved.

Conclusion

This is the first well-documented case of sarcoidosis and psoriasis in the same patient, reported on the basis of safe and widely-used techniques that were not available until fairly recently. These disorders might share common pathogenic mechanisms that could explain their co-existence in the patient.

### A cutting edge overview: psoriatic disease [^114CAAT8]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a lifelong skin disease, affecting about 2% of the global population. Generalized involvement of the body (erythroderma), extensive pustular lesions, and an associated arthritis known as psoriatic arthritis (PsA) are severe complications of psoriasis. Genetic, immunologic, and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis. A complete understanding of the pathogenesis of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis is lacking. Cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors like NGF, neuropeptides, and T cell receptors all act in an integrated way to evolve into unique inflammatory and proliferative processes typical of psoriasis and PsA. Management of psoriasis requires exemplary skin care along with careful monitoring of arrays of comorbidities which includes arthritis and coronary artery disease. In many ways, psoriasis can be considered a model autoimmune disease. This statement itself is ironic considering that it was not recognized as immune mediated until relatively recently. Fortunately, the immunobiology has made enormous strides and there are now excellent therapeutic options for patients. In this thematic review, we have attempted to provide summaries of not only basic science and clinical research, but also an overview of future research directions.

### Special article: 2018 American College of Rheumatology / National Psoriasis Foundation guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^115UJG2z]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Active and severe psoriatic arthritis definitions — Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on 2 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis, and for the purposes of these recommendations severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity that encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥ 1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor, long-term damage that leads to limitation in function, spine involvement, highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life, and rapidly progressive disease.

### Cyclosporine (cycloSPORINE, modfied) [^111kw9TZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

There were two lymphoproliferative malignancies; one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma which required chemotherapy, and one case of mycosis fungoides which regressed spontaneously upon discontinuation of cyclosporine. There were four cases of benign lymphocytic infiltration: 3 regressed spontaneously upon discontinuation of cyclosporine, while the fourth regressed despite continuation of the drug. The remainder of the malignancies, 13 cases (0.9%), involved various organs.

Patients should not be treated concurrently with cyclosporine and PUVA or UVB, other radiation therapy, or other immunosuppressive agents, because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression and the subsequent risk of malignancies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS). Patients should also be warned to protect themselves appropriately when in the sun, and to avoid excessive sun exposure. Patients should be thoroughly evaluated before and during treatment for the presence of malignancies remembering that malignant lesions may be hidden by psoriatic plaques. Skin lesions not typical of psoriasis should be biopsied before starting treatment. Patients should be treated with cyclosporine capsules (modified) only after complete resolution of suspicious lesions, and only if there are no other treatment options (see Special Monitoring for Psoriasis Patients).

### Adalimumab-induced Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disorder on FDG PET / CT [^114mbRmF]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Adalimumab is a fully human chimeric tumor necrosis factor inhibitor used to treat immune-mediated disorders such as psoriatic arthritis. We present a 51-year-old woman with psoriatic arthritis on methotrexate and infliximab for 12 years. Adalimumab replaced infliximab because of worsening symptoms. Following 3 doses administered 1 week apart, rapidly enlarging cervical lymph nodes developed. Biopsy revealed Epstein-Barr virus-related polymorphic lymphoproliferative disorder. F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated widespread hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy; follow-up at 5 weeks off adalimumab revealed almost complete resolution of this adenopathy. This is most consistent with Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphoproliferative disorder secondary to tumor necrosis factor α inhibition.

A 26-year-old man undergoing therapy with 45mg ustekinumab (Stelara) for chronic psoriasis vulgaris was referred by his general practitioner to an infectious diseases department for fatigue, fever, night sweating, generalised lymphadenomegaly and unexplained weight loss. Physical examination revealed bilateral occipital, cervical, axillary and inguinal lymphadenomegalies in addition to splenomegaly. Preliminary investigation revealed elevated Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase and an inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio. Whole-body spiral CT scanning with and without contrast showed splenomegaly and highlighted supradiaphragmatic and subdiaphragmatic lymphadenopathies. A complete Infectious Disease Test Panel revealed high levels of anti- Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. Immunoglobulin G avidity was negative. Peripheral blood lymphocyte phenotyping was performed to exclude underlying lymphatic neoplasia. The diagnosis of severe acute toxoplasmosis infection in the setting of immune response modifiers was made. Ustekinumab was suspended indefinitely and the patient underwent monthly serological tests to monitor the immune response until all symptoms resolved and the serological testing was negative for Toxoplasma.

Our patient was a 35-year-old woman, who had undergone right radically modified mastectomy and axillary-lymph-nodes dissection in June 2004. The stage of the patient was T2N0M0. She was treated with six cycles of FAC (5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, cyclofosfamid), tamoxifen after chemotherapy. In June 2008, right axillary lymphadenopathy progressed and was treated with docetaxel and capecitabine after a hand-foot reaction was observed in the patient as an adverse reaction to capacitabine; the treatment was continued with only trastuzmab between February 2009 and April 2010. The addition of vinoralbine was needed due to the newly developed right paratracheal lymphadenopthy in April 2010. After six cycles of chemotherapy we achieved stable disease; she received only trastuzumab; later on, in control thorax CT, multiple metastatic models were observed in April 2011 and thus lapatinip plus capecitabine treatment was started. After one cycle of chemotherapy her psoriatic lesions were aggravated and we had to stop the treatment.

Discussion

THRLBCL development following adalimumab administration was reported once before in a case of severe psoriasis resistant to other immunosuppressive regimens. Although similar reports exist, the cumulative evidence to date has shown little to no effect of adalimumab treatment on lymphoma development, THRLBCL or otherwise. Conversely, HS (2- to 4-fold increase), psoriasis (1.4-fold increase), and vitiligo (3-fold increase) are each independently associated with increased lifetime risk of lymphoma. Although the specific mechanisms remain elusive, this observation is postulated to be the result of chronic lymphocyte activation that increases the probability of a monoclonal subset arising. Interestingly, risk of lymphoma development in rheumatoid arthritis patients increases with increasing inflammatory disease activity; patients with low and medium inflammatory activity exhibited up to an approximately 8-fold (odds ratio, 7.7 [95% confidence interval, 4.8–12.3]) increased risk, but those with high activity demonstrated up to approximately 71-fold (odds ratio, 71.3 [95% confidence interval, 24.1–211.4]). This finding is compelling, as it suggests that although most patients will not observe a clinically significant lymphoma risk within their lifetime, those with high inflammatory burdens, such as our patient with long-standing, severe psoriasis and HS, may experience extremely high odds of lymphoma development. Such dermatology patients may benefit from screening for lymphoproliferative disease, if only through a brief assessment of clinical symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, unexplained fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

THRLBCL is a rare, aggressive variant of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is histologically characterized by few neoplastic B-cells within a stroma of mostly histiocytes and T cells, primarily CD4 +. Gene expression studies highlight an interferon-γ–dominant signature that differentiates this lymphoma subtype from the more common Hodgkin disease, which may drive the recruitment of the reactive phagocytes to the stroma. Assessment of subtype-specific relative risks show that specific inflammatory diseases associate highly with certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes but not others, suggesting that underlying disease-specific pathways may exist that explain these connections. To this regard, vitiligo is well known to be driven by excessive interferon-γ signaling and may have played a role in propagating this unique histologic variant, but little direct evidence exists to date. HS and psoriasis share overactivity of the interleukin-23/T-helper cell 17/interleukin-17 immune axis, but the relevance of that pathway in this context is unclear.

### Subclinical psoriatic arthritis and disease interception-where are we in 2024? [^115BBbU6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-clinical PsA phase: recent advances in definitions and nomenclature

PsA usually appears in patients with skin PsO and is often preceded by a preclinical phase characterized by immunological abnormalities, arthralgia and imaging abnormalities before receiving a formal diagnosis. Three working groups have proposed various terminologies to explain the transition from PsO to a formal diagnosis of PsA (Fig. 1). The first one, made by Scher et al. proposed five distinct phases to explain the continuum PsO–PsA. The initial stage is represented by a patient with PsO and predisposing factors for PsA, such as genetics, obesity and PsO severity. However, there is no full consensus on these risk factors, which are represented in Table 1 and discussed below. An intermediate phase is proposed only by Scher et al. (Fig. 1) and is characterized by the abnormal activation of the immune system, notably involving the IL-23–IL-17 axis and TNF production. This activation could be triggered by factors originating from cutaneous tissue, intestinal mucosa (specifically the microbiome) and/or the entheses. Phase 3 corresponds with 'subclinical PsA' characterized by clinically asymptomatic imaging changes and phase 4 corresponds to a prodromal phase typified by arthralgia and fatigue. The final phase 5 is represented by a clinical diagnosis of PsA.

### Miliary tuberculosis in a paediatric patient with psoriasis [^112aCLz9]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Cases of disseminated or military tuberculosis, a disease caused by the acid-fast bacillus M. tuberculosis, secondary to TNF-α inhibitors are becoming more commonplace, though they remain rare in paediatric patients. However, the increasing use of immunomodulatory medications such as TNF-α inhibitors is increasing the risk of presentation. Testing for latent tuberculosis remains imperative prior to initiating immunomodulatory therapy, but it is unable to prevent all infections. Well-established treatment guidelines exist, but not all antituberculosis drugs have been well-studied in children. Furthermore, as was the case here, treatment regimens must be altered when there is CNS involvement.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one-quarter of the world's population is infected with M. tuberculosis. The incidence in the USA has fallen dramatically from 52.6/100 000 persons in 1953 to 2.9/100 000 persons in 2016. Children constitute approximately 14% of new cases. The falling rates of tuberculosis, and the low incidence in children, likely played a role in the patient's delayed diagnosis. Risk factors for infection include Asian descent, recent immigration to the USA, diabetes, immunodeficiency, homelessness and incarceration. In the majority of infected persons, infection is followed by latent disease with no clinical symptoms. In children under 10 years, age of exposure is inversely correlated with the probability of developing clinical disease; nearly 50% of exposed infants under 1 year become symptomatic. There is a smaller peak of infection in adolescence, with the vast majority of these patients developing pulmonary disease.

The spectrum of clinical disease caused by M. tuberculosis includes asymptomatic infection (latent tuberculosis), respiratory symptoms (pulmonary tuberculosis), and multisystem disease with or without pulmonary involvement (miliary tuberculosis). The age at acquisition strongly influences the form of disease that develops in the child, with one study looking at children ages 0–18 years showing that more than 60% present with disseminated disease. For children with pulmonary disease, the hallmark clinical symptoms in all age groups are chronic cough, fever and weight loss. Cough is rarely productive in infants or children, but may be in adolescents. Infants more typically present with examination features compatible with pneumonia, whereas adolescents typically lack physical findings. Chest X-ray may be diagnostic, though CT has higher sensitivity. Thick-walled cavitary lesions with ipsilateral hilar or paratracheal lymphadenopathy, miliary nodules and pleural effusions are all suggestive of pulmonary tuberculosis.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^115qaLad]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Sarcoidosis is rarely associated with a distinct disease. One disease infrequently associated with sarcoidosis is psoriasis.

Case Presentation

This case study describes a 38-year-old male, who presented with chest pain, high-grade fever, arthralgias and a skin rash accompanied by bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on his chest radiograph. Extensive investigations including fiber-optic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and labial and skin biopsies, demonstrated that two distinct clinical entities co-existed in the same patient: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris. Combination therapy for both diseases was applied and the patient was greatly improved.

Conclusion

This is the first well-documented case of sarcoidosis and psoriasis in the same patient, reported on the basis of safe and widely-used techniques that were not available until fairly recently. These disorders might share common pathogenic mechanisms that could explain their co-existence in the patient.

### Miliary tuberculosis in a paediatric patient with psoriasis [^1151Wqds]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In the emergency department, her initial vital signs were: temperature 39.2°C, heart rate of 140 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, blood pressure of 115/61 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air and weight 54.6 kg. On examination, she was tired and chronically ill-appearing, but non-toxic. Her physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia without murmur, bounding radial pulses and mild respiratory distress with asymmetrically (right > left) diminished basilar aeration. She does not have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites or peripheral oedema. The remainder of her examination was normal. Laboratory studies were remarkable for normocytic anaemia, lymphopenia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated prothrombin time and elevated inflammatory markers. Electrolytes, transaminases, thyroid profile and urine pregnancy test were normal. HIV antibody and viral load were negative. Review of records shows that her outside chest X-ray was remarkable for rounded opacities scattered throughout both lungs and a right upper lobe cavitary lesion. A chest CT was obtained, which reveals a cavitary right upper lobe mass (figure 1).

Figure 1
Contrast-enhanced CT of the chest shows a 3 cm round right upper cavitary lesion as well as prominent miliary nodules within the right upper lobe on axillary section (panel A). Further sections show multiple large necrotic mediastinal lymph nodes (panel B). coronal reformatting allows visualisation of the cavitary lesion (panel C) and miliary nodules (panel D) in plane with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Lymphoma — malignancy risk context and caution: Patients with psoriasis may have an increased risk of lymphoma (particularly Hodgkin's lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma). A consensus panel reviewing clinical trials concluded that the overall risk of malignancies including lymphoma was not increased over baseline levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with TNF inhibitors, but trials are underpowered for rare cancers; nevertheless, numerous anecdotal lymphomas have been reported with TNF inhibitors and many resolved after drug discontinuation, so one should carefully consider the decision to use TNF antagonist in patients with a history of malignancy, particularly lymphoma.

### Toxoplasmosis in a patient receiving ixekizumab for psoriasis [^116izhd5]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Case report

Our patient presented with a 3-month history of dry cough and rhinorrhea associated with tender left axillary lymphadenopathy. She had a history of chronic plaque psoriasis without joint disease since the age of 17 years, affecting her scalp, face, elbows, trunk, knees, and genital region. She was receiving treatment with ixekizumab at a dose of 80 mg every month. She also had a history of depression. She was not receiving any other medications. The patient denied owning cats but did report consuming rare meat regularly. She had no other risk factors for toxoplasmosis.

Serologic testing was positive for anti- Toxoplasma immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG), with a Toxoplasma IgG index of 79.80 (> 8.79 = positive), a Toxoplasma IgM index of 50.00 (> 7.99 = positive), and a low Toxoplasma avidity index of 0.06 (< 0.20 = low). Results of additional serologic investigations were negative, including those for HIV, cytomegalovirus, Bartonella, Epstein-Barr virus, and Q fever. Ultrasonography of the left axilla demonstrated an enlarged axillary lymph node with a thickened hypoechoic cortex, consistent with a reactive lymph node. An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was performed. Histopathologic features were in keeping with reactive adenopathy most likely caused by toxoplasmosis, without evidence of necrosis or lymphoid atypia (Fig 1).

The patient attended the infectious diseases clinic for further evaluation. Serial paired serology demonstrated an increasing IgG titre, a declining IgM titre, and a low Toxoplasma IgG avidity index, supportive of recent primary infection. Owing to concern for disseminated Toxoplasma infection in an immunocompromised patient, a 14-day treatment course with pyrimethamine, leucovorin, and clindamycin was completed. Our patient remains without recurrence of lymphadenopathy and Toxoplasma infection 5 years posttreatment. She continues to follow up in the dermatology clinic every 3 months while on ixekizumab.

### Pulmonary sarcoidosis associated with psoriasis vulgaris: coincidental occurrence or causal association? Case report [^111yeMLF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 38-year-old male, a heavy smoker, was admitted to our department, because of fever (38.4°C), weakness, arthralgias, non-pitting edema of the lower extremities and chest discomfort for the previous two weeks. The arthralgias were partially responsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patient also reported skin eruptions on his elbows and lower extremities that had appeared six months previously. His past medical history was unremarkable.

On physical examination, sharply demarcated erythematous plaques covered by silvery white scales were observed on the right elbow and the lower extremities below the knees (figure 1). The patient's ankles were painful and edematous. On palpation, firm and painless subcutaneous nodules could be found on the occipital part of the scalp. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.

Basic laboratory tests were normal except for an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (57 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (45.2 mg/l). Further investigations, which included serum complement analysis, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmatic antibodies, immunoglobulin levels, and serological tests for hepatitis A, B and C and human immunodeficiency virus, disclosed no apparent pathologies. PPD skin test was negative. Neither arterial blood gases nor pulmonary function tests showed significant abnormalities. Radiographic examination, using x-ray and high resolution computed tomography of the chest, revealed bilateral hilar and right paratracheal lymphadenopathy with small nodules along the bronchovascular bundles. Fiber-optic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were performed. BAL fluid analysis revealed lymphocytosis (35%) with an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio (4.2). Microbiological and cytological examinations were negative. Transbronchial lung biopsies were non-diagnostic.

A labial biopsy and biopsies from the cutaneous lesions were also obtained. The labial biopsy demonstrated the presence of small epithelioid (sarcoid form) granulomas (figure 2), while the skin biopsies were typical of psoriasis (figure 3). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples with periodic acid-Schiff staining was negative. We concluded that the patient suffered from two separate clinical entities: pulmonary sarcoidosis and psoriasis vulgaris.

The articular manifestations responded partially to NSAIDs. Consequently, a short course of 30 mg prednisone daily and topical therapy to manage the psoriatic lesions were applied. This resulted in a significant clinical improvement. Three months after his discharge the patient remains asymptomatic.

### Coexistence of psoriasis and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [^111FQPxh]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

It has been reported that individuals with psoriasis are at an increased risk of developing cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, the increased risk of lymphoma in these patients has been questioned because CTCL in its early stages may be incorrectly labelled as psoriasis, thus introducing potential for misclassification bias. We retrospectively reviewed patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CTCL seen in a tertiary cutaneous lymphoma clinic (n = 115) over a 5-year period and found that 6 (5.2%) patients had clinical evidence of coexisting psoriasis. This demonstrates that there is a small cohort of individuals who develop both psoriasis and CTCL.

Tuberculosis remains relatively rare in children compared with adults but select paediatric patient-populations remain at an increased risk, one such population being immunosuppressed children. Given the growing availability and application of immunomodulatory medications for both autoimmune and transplant indications, there exists a growing population of children who are at an increased risk for the acquisition and deleterious effects of tuberculosis.

### Biologics for psoriasis: what is new? [^112kcYVJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Etiology of psoriasis is unclear but environmental, genetic, and immune factors act significant roles in the pathogenesis of this disease. Helper T cells (TH), plasmoid, and dermal dendritic cells play a prominent role in the development of classical psoriatic lesions. Interleukin stimulation is another important process in the pathogenesis of the disease that directly influences keratinocytes and leading to the formation of psoriatic pattern in the skin. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α which releases from keratinocytes activates dendritic cells in the early stages of complex pathogenesis of psoriasis. Activated keratinocytes also produce other proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b and IL-6), antimicrobial peptides, and various chemokines. TNF activates dendritic cells that produce IL-23, leading to TH17 differentiation. TH17 cells secrete IL-17A, which has been shown to promote psoriatic skin changes. Consequently, after clarification of these main pathological mechanisms, anti-IL therapies have been accepted as a major treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis. Here, actual information will be presented about biological agents currently in clinical use or being tested for clinical application for treatment of patients with psoriasis.

### Fluorodeoxyglucose PET / CT of arthritis in rheumatic diseases: a pictorial review [^1173wKRe]. Radiographics (2020). Medium credibility.

Rheumatic diseases are various painful conditions that affect joints, bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and muscles. Arthritis is a typical condition of rheumatic disease. Although rheumatoid arthritis is a representative rheumatic disease, various diseases other than rheumatoid arthritis can also affect joints, and differential diagnosis of rheumatic diseases is often difficult owing to the similar clinical manifestations. However, accurate diagnosis is crucial for an appropriate treatment strategy. The utility of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT has been established, and it is widely used for assessing malignancies. In addition to accumulating in tumor cells, FDG also accumulates in inflammatory tissue, allowing FDG PET/CT to demonstrate arthritis. PET/CT allows evaluation of whole-body articular and extra-articular lesions in one examination, representing a key advantage over US and MRI, which allow assessment of only a few regions because of their limited field of view. Although FDG PET/CT is sensitive for detecting inflammatory lesions, the uptake itself is nonspecific; therefore, knowledge of characteristic uptake patterns is necessary to narrow the differential diagnosis in rheumatic disease. Furthermore, pathognomonic extra-articular findings such as vasculitis, skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and chondritis play an important role in achieving accurate diagnosis. The authors present the FDG PET/CT appearances of (a) rheumatoid arthritis and allied disorders (polymyalgia rheumatica, remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema, adult-onset Still disease), (b) spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease arthritis, SAPHO [s ynovitis, a cne, p ustulosis, h yperostosis, and o steitis] syndrome, chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis), and (c) miscellaneous systemic disorders with arthropathy (relapsing polychondritis, multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemophilia). © RSNA, 2020.

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^113weMdP]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Treatment

A working diagnosis of multisystemic sarcoidosis or possible overlap of sarcoidosis with psoriasis was made after considering the following:
Her initial presentation of acute anterior uveitis, an apparent psoriasiform rash, acute-onset polyarthritis with tenosynovitis without other features of psoriasis (the patient's back pain did not appear to be inflammatory, no psoriatic nail changes were observed, no history of dactylitis, absence of HLA-B27).
A positive family history of sarcoidosis in an identical twin.
Presence of paratracheal, subcarinal and bilateral lymphadenopathy in the absence of respiratory symptoms and lung pathology on CT.
Multiple liver hypodensities with evidence of non-caseating granuloma on liver biopsy, in the absence of fungal and mycobacterial organisms on special staining of the tissue samples.
Lytic-sclerotic lesions in T9 and T12 with increased uptake on MRI and bone scan, with no evidence of malignancy on bone biopsy.
No evidence of haematological malignancy on bone marrow examination.
No gross malignant lesions on CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis.
Supportive test results of: Elevated serum ACE Non-reactive T-spot Negative HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C screen, venereal disease research laboratory.

The patient was given high-dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day) as well as oral azathioprine 50 mg daily. However, despite an escalation of azathioprine to a dose equivalent of 2 mg/kg/day her transaminitis and abdominal discomfort did not improve, and hence her immunosuppressive therapy was switched to mycophenolate mofetil (750 mg daily) and she was eventually tapered off systemic glucocorticoids altogether.

### Psoriatic arthritis: clinical spectrum and diagnostic procedures [^11568Qer]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis presents with a broad clinical spectrum of symptoms. Symmetrical polyarthritis with joint pain and joint swelling is one pattern of clinical manifestations that often indicates erosive progressive disease. Unlike in rheumatoid arthritis, the distal interphalangeal joints are regularly involved. Sometimes, the disease focuses on the larger joints of the lower extremities; iliosacral and intervertebral joints and tendons can also be involved. Thus, inflammatory back pain as well as any other prolonged joint pain in a patient with psoriasis is suspicious of psoriatic arthritis. This article reviews the clinical spectrum and diagnostic procedures that can lead to the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis.

Methotrexate — toxicity profile and risk mitigation: "Common and generally minor toxicities of methotrexate include nausea, anorexia, stomatitis, and fatigue that most often occur at the time of methotrexate administration". These effects "may be minimized by administering methotrexate by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection, splitting the dose, folate supplementation, or by administering the dose with food or at bedtime". Major toxicities are "myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and pulmonary fibrosis". In reported fatalities, "Of 164 possible methotrexate-associated fatalities, 67 were caused by myelosuppression, 30 were caused by pulmonary fibrosis, and 8 were caused by hepatotoxicity". Pulmonary fibrosis is noted as severe and "much less common in patients with psoriasis than in patients with rheumatoid arthritis". Additional reported risks include "Hepatitis, reactivation of tuberculosis (TB), and lymphoma, especially the B-cell type that is commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection", and "These observations suggest that practitioners need to maintain a high index of suspicion for these infections in patients being treated with methotrexate".

Question 2: Which of the following is true regarding this disorder?
A. The lesion is usually asymptomatic.
B. The disease has the potential for distant metastasis.
C. Lymphadenopathy is seen in more than 90% of patients.
D. It is often seen in young or middle-age adults.
E. The disease usually presents with multiple lesions.

Answers:
A. The lesion is usually asymptomatic – Incorrect. Most cases of ALHE are symptomatic. Patients may complain of pruritus, bleeding and pain.
B. The disease has the potential for distant metastasis – Incorrect. Metastatic disease in ALHE has not yet been reported.
C. Lymphadenopathy is seen in more than 90% of patients – Incorrect. ALHE is associated with reactive lymphadenopathy in only 5% to 20% of patients. Lymphadenopathy, however, is a characteristic feature of Kimura disease.
D. It is often seen in young or middle-age adults – Correct. ALHE is often seen in young or middle-age adults.
E. The disease usually presents with multiple lesions – Incorrect. Only about 20% of patients present with multiple lesions.

Question 3: Which of the following is the most effective treatment for this patient?
A. Intralesional or systemic glucocorticoids
B. Pulsed dye laser
C. Surgical excision
D. Cryotherapy
E. Electrosurgery

Answers:
A. Intralesional or systemic glucocorticoids – Incorrect. With the recurrence rates reaching as high as 79% and 87%, intralesional and systemic corticosteroids are not considered effective treatment options.
B. Pulsed dye laser – Incorrect. The recurrence rate of around 50% makes pulsed dye laser an acceptable treatment option for ALHE. This technique is especially used for elderly, debilitated patients and poor surgical candidates including patients requiring systemic anticoagulation or those with multiple lesions.
C. Surgical excision – Correct. Current literature recommends the use of surgical excision as the most effective treatment modality for ALHE, which will lead to a significantly lower treatment failure rate (ie, 40%) compared with other available treatment modalities.
D. Cryotherapy – Incorrect. Although cryotherapy can potentially be an option in the treatment of ALHE, its 80% reported failure rates makes this modality a less-favorable option among experts.
E. Electrosurgery – Incorrect. Similar to cryotherapy, electrosurgery has been associated with failure rates as high as 88% in published evidence, which makes it an unfavorable option in the treatment of ALHE.

### Distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from psoriatic arthritis [^112Bo5ke]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Accurate diagnosis of PsA and RA is important because, although these diseases have a number of overlapping clinical, serological and radiographic features, differences in underlying pathogenesis and response to therapy translate into substantially different clinical outcomes. An understanding of the various clinical characteristics, triggering factors, comorbidities and extra-articular manifestations of PsA and RA can aid in the determination of the correct diagnosis. Use of laboratory and imaging techniques can be particularly helpful in distinguishing between these two diseases. Once an accurate diagnosis has been made, clinicians can decide which therapy should be used to provide maximal improvements in the signs and symptoms of RA or PsA based on patient and disease characteristics.

### A new variant in CTLA4 highlights the heterogeneous phenotype of CTLA4 haploinsufficiency [^113DUyTG]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Index Case

An 18-year-old female patient was referred to our internal medicine department following severe necrotic dermohypodermitis of the left leg caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The severity of the lesion required intensive care unit hospitalization and invasive surgery. Notably, she had been diagnosed with immune thrombopenia (ITP) at 14 years of age, followed by autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), together presenting as Evans syndrome. In terms of infection, she experienced early-onset herpes zoster and chronic Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) viremia. A genetic assessment for inborn errors of immunity was performed due to the presence of atypical manifestations, including hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and hypogammaglobulinemia. A previously unreported c.379T > G variant in CTLA4 was thereby identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing. These findings motivated the initiation of abatacept, a recombinant CTLA4 protein developed to treat rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis that has also been used as a treatment for CTLA4 haploinsufficiency. Treatment prevented relapses or new manifestations of the disease for more than 4 years.

### Secondary syphilis mimicking marginal zone B-cell lymphoma [^117CXHt8]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case demonstrates the importance of analyzing the clinical presentation and histologic findings together to accurately diagnose syphilis and differentiate it from other inflammatory, infectious, or malignant processes. In this case, secondary syphilis was mistaken for MZL. Typically, MZL presents with a solitary or multifocal erythematous to violaceous papules, plaques, or nodules on the trunk or extremities. Pathology reveals diffuse infiltrates of atypical marginal zone B cells in the dermis and subcutis with CD20, B-cell lymphoma 2, and CD79a positivity and B-cell monoclonality. The patient's biopsy displayed similar findings with no evidence of spirochetes. These histopathologic findings in addition to the presence of so-called "B symptoms" and lymphadenopathy led to the diagnosis of MZL. However, the clinical presentation of diffuse papular rash involving the entire body, including the palms and soles, did not match the typical clinical manifestations of MZL.

Although the patient's biopsy was representative of MZL, it is well known that histologic findings associated with secondary syphilis are highly variable and nonspecific. Syphilis specimens have been mistaken for mycosis fungoides, psoriasis, lichen planus, reticulohistiocytomas, and pityriasis rosea. Similarly, syphilis has previously been reported to histologically mimic lymphoid neoplasms. Most recently, a study analyzed the histopathologic features distinguishing secondary syphilis from its mimickers, but imitators of B-cell lymphomas were lacking.

While detection of a dominant B-cell clone can indicate the presence of a B-cell malignancy, prominent B-cell clones may emerge in response to antigen stimulation. Clonal B-cell proliferation may ensue during the later stages of adaptive B-cell immunity, and particularly when a restricted number of epitopes are present on the eliciting antigens. Indeed, monoclonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements have been detected in cases of exposure to both pathogenic or autoreactive antigens including Borrelia -associated infections, morphea, and Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate among others.

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^112wjJ17]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We report a case of a woman who was admitted with a suspicion of metastatic malignancy of unknown primary origin. A few months prior to her admission, she presented to a rheumatologist with acute anterior uveitis, psoriasiform rashes and polyarthritis. A diagnosis of psoriatic arthropathy was made and she was treated accordingly. Soon after she presented with persistent back and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for which she had a CT scan done with evidence of hilar lymphadenopathy, liver hypodensities and lytic-sclerotic bone lesions. She was referred to our hospital for further investigations and management. After re-exploring her clinical presentation and further investigations (including a liver biopsy), a diagnosis of multisystemic sarcoidosis with ocular, reticuloendothelial, hepatic and skeletal involvement was made. The patient was started on systemic glucocorticoids and second line immunosuppressants and demonstrated significant clinical improvement with resolution of her liver granulomata on imaging and improvement in her back pain. The case illustrates the importance of a thorough clinical assessment, review of investigations and an open mind in the evaluation of a patient.

### Physical examination… [^112DCCiR]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Physical Examination The physical examination should be regionally directed by knowledge of the lymphatic drainage patterns and should include a complete lymphatic examination looking for generalized lymphadenopathy. Skin should be examined for unusual lesions that suggest malignancy and for traumatic lesions, which can be sites of infectious inoculation. Splenomegaly, while rarely associated with lymphadenopathy, focuses the differential on a limited number of disorders, most commonly infectious mononucleosis, 8 but also the lymphomas, the lymphocytic leukemias, and sarcoidosis. AXILLARY LYMPHADENOPATHY Because the upper extremities that axillary lymph nodes drain are commonly exposed to local infection and injury, most axillary lymphadenopathy is nonspecific or reactive in etiology. Infectious sources of prolonged lymphadenopathy such as toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis rarely manifest with lymphadenopathy alone.

17 although this can be the first region discovered by the patient. Antecubital or epitrochlear lymphadenopathy can suggest lymphoma, or melanoma of the extremity, which first metastasizes to the ipsilateral regional lymph nodes. 18, 19. Generalized adenopathy infrequently occurs in patients with neoplasms, but it is occasionally seen in patients with leukemias and lymphomas, or advanced disseminated metastatic solid tumors. Hodgkin's lymphoma and most metastatic carcinomas typically progress through nodes in anatomic sequence. Patients who are immunocompromised and those with AIDS have a wide differential for generalized lymphadenopathy, including early human immunodeficiency virus infection, activated tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, and Kaposi's sarcoma, which can present with lymphadenopathy before visible skin lesions appear.
22. Painful or tender lymphadenopathy is non-specific but typically represents nodal inflammation from an infection.

In rare cases, painful or tender lymphadenopathy can result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a neoplastic node or from pressure on the nodal capsule caused by rapid tumor expansion. Lymphadenopathy is classically described as a node larger than 1 cm, although this varies by lymphatic region. Palpable supraclavicular, iliac, or popliteal nodes of any size and epitrochlear nodes larger than 5 mm are considered abnormal.

### Autoinflammation in psoriatic arthritis: time to better define the multifaceted enemy [^1163STEu]. RMD Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a very heterogeneous disease involving the skin, joints, eyes, gastrointestinal and cardiometabolic systems. In the perspective of 'psoriatic syndrome' or 'psoriatic disease', PsA is a distinct, important and complex entity. PsA is a mysterious disease and still bears many aspects to explore. For instance, although we know many things about the relationship between psoriasis (PsO) and PsA — even though we have a long road to go — it took about 18 centuries for the literature to report this relationship after the papers published about PsO. On the other hand, the mystery is being explored day by day, especially about pathogenesis. Till now, current literature has been focused on the autoimmune aspects of PsA pathogenesis, for example, human leucocyte antigens and clonal expansions of CD8 + T cells. Although a few genome-wide association studies and small studies found PsA and PsO susceptibility genes related to innate immunity, no study has focused on the individual patient-level role of autoinflammatory disorder genes in PsA patients.

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence-and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^112M1z3S]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Acitretin (2011)

Recommendations Acitretin is recommended for induction therapy in moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis, although it is not recommended as a first‐choice monotherapy (Table S7; see Supporting Information). In patients with a good clinical effect at the end of induction therapy (16 weeks), maintenance therapy is suggested with the lowest effective dose. Table S8 (see Supporting Information) details blood tests and their timing.

Women of childbearing age should not be treated with acitretin because of the teratogenic characteristics of the drug. Contraception is recommended during and up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation (modified in 2017).

Fumarates (2017)

Recommendations

Fumarates are recommended as induction and long‐term therapy for moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S9; see Supporting Information). In general, the long‐term safety profile of fumarates is favourable, but the evidence is relatively limited. 12, 13, 14 Acetylsalicylic acid (e.g. 80 mg) is suggested to treat flushing as an undesired side‐effect of therapy. 15

The incidence of progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy during treatment with fumarates is unknown, but seems related to prolonged periods of lymphocytopenia. In addition to monitoring for lymphocytopenia (Table S10; see Supporting Information), we recommend being alert for neurological symptoms during fumarate therapy and referring a patient to a neurologist if needed. Table S11 (see Supporting Information) details recommended dosing.

Apremilast (2017)

Recommendations Apremilast is suggested as induction therapy and long‐term therapy in moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S12; see Supporting Information). Long‐term safety data are relatively scarce.

In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL min −1) 30 mg once daily is recommended. Table S13 and Table S14 (see Supporting Information) detail blood tests and dosing for apremilast, respectively.

Adalimumab (2017)

Recommendations Adalimumab is recommended as induction therapy and long‐term therapy in moderate‐to‐severe plaque‐type psoriasis (Table S15; see Supporting Information). Increasing the dose of adalimumab from 40 mg per 2 weeks to 40 mg per week is suggested for patients with an insufficient response to adalimumab 40 mg per 2 weeks. This dosage increase is according to the label change (November 2015). Table S16 (see Supporting Information) details blood tests for all biologics.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^113jwyaL]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Key points

Psoriatic arthritis is a heterogeneous disease with multiple musculoskeletal and dermatological manifestations.
In up to 15% of patients, psoriatic arthritis precedes the skin disease or occur simultaneously.
Identifying the early form of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) leads to better outcome.
Patients with psoriasis can suffer other forms of arthritis beyond psoriatic arthritis, which must be excluded before treatment.
Focus of research on efficient tools for diagnosis, monitoring and prognostication of PsA is due to introduction of new effective therapies and a treat-to-target-strategy.

### Multisystemic sarcoidosis-important lessons learnt from one of the great imitators [^1178Wro9]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Family history

The patient's mother has a history of psoriasis. During her admission, she discovered that her identical twin sister, who is residing in USA, had been diagnosed with sarcoidosis with lung involvement and acute anterior uveitis 4 years prior.

There is no known family history of malignancy, autoimmune disorders, tuberculous infection.

Review of systems

The patient developed anorexia with an unintentional weight loss of 4 kg 3 months before her admission. She denied any history of recurrent or persistent fevers and night sweats. She also experienced dryness of her eyes and mouth in the 2 months leading up to her admission. While she still experienced some aching and early morning stiffness in the small joints of her hands, wrists, elbows, knees and ankles, these have largely improved compared with her initial presentation. She no longer had any skin rashes and denied any history of brittle or deformed nails in the past.

She denied any yellowing of her sclera, change in her stool consistency and calibre as well as change in her bowel habits. She also denied any tea coloured urine and clay coloured stools.

The rest of her review of systems was unremarkable.

Physical examination

The patient was afebrile and normotensive. She appeared comfortable.

There were no rashes, subcutaneous nodules and postinflammatory skin changes, including over the axillae where the patient noted skin thickening and dysaesthesia initially. No psoriatic nail changes were seen. Salivary pooling was decreased, but there were no enlarged salivary glands. No ocular redness was noted.

Multiple mobile, non-tender subcentimetre cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes were found. There were no palpable axillary and inguinal lymph nodes.

Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. Neurological examination of the central and peripheral nervous system was normal. A formal ocular examination by an ophthalmologist was requested that showed no evidence of active uveitis, any sequelae of the previous episode of anterior uveitis and retinal vasculitis.

On abdominal examination, there was tender hepatomegaly with smooth edges. There was no splenomegaly nor any stigmata of chronic liver disease.

There was no dactylitis, synovitis, tenosynovitis and enthesitis. There was tenderness over the spinous processes of the T9–T12 vertebrae and pain on rotation of the thoracic spine. Examination of the sacroiliac joints and cervical spine was unremarkable. Examination of the lumbar spine was limited by pain over the thoracic spine.

The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^111BfqA5]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Lymphadenopathy is a frequent clinical finding in rheumatology practice and can often be interpreted as a clinical marker of disease activity. Moreover, lymphadenopathy can be the initial or more prominent manifestation of rare rheumatologic diseases, such as IgG4-RD and CD, the complications of which are potentially life-threatening. Early recognition and prompt treatment of these diseases may significantly impact on mortality and morbidity. Nevertheless, since rheumatologic patients are at higher risk of infectious and neoplastic complications, a careful differential diagnosis is of the utmost importance.

### Multi-modality data-driven analysis of diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis [^115SPRHf]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic and incurable inflammatory diseasewith different clinical subtypes, such as psoriasis vulgaris, erythrodermic psoriasis, and pustular psoriasis. Around 25.0% of psoriasis patients will develop psoriatic arthritis (PsA), which is a chronic inflammatory joint disease associated with psoriasis and is featured by its irreversible joint symptoms in addition to skin lesions. However, psoriasis can develop many other musculoskeletal symptoms that are unrelated to PsA, including osteoporosis, gout, fibromyalgia, soft tissue rheumatism, osteoarthritis, etc. leading to inevitable misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. It is estimated that up to 24.6% of PsA patients suffer from moderate to severe symptoms. The clinical manifestations of PsA are diverse and can invade peripheral joints of the limbs, the trunk joints, and the attachment points of bones, tendons, and even muscles. Such invasions often lead to different degrees of swelling, pain, and discomfort in the axial joint or limb joint, bringing great pain and posing a heavy disease burden to the patient's life. While the early damage to the joints often appears as joint synovitis and progressive cartilage, the damage may progress to irreversible bone destruction in the middle and late stages, eventually leading to disability. In addition to the similar skin lesions as psoriasis causes, PsA patients are also at greater risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiometabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and liver diseasethan healthy individuals. The chronic painful muscle and joint stimulation can also lead to increased anxiety and even depression in PsA patients.

### The immunology of psoriasis-current concepts in pathogenesis [^111GvL6u]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Role of Monocytes and Macrophages

In murine models, psoriatic inflammation is associated with the expansion of activated monocytes and macrophages in lesional skin and draining lymph nodes. These activated macrophages are a key source of TNF-α. Likewise, the lesional skin of psoriasis patients is characterized by the accumulation of activated macrophages in both the epidermis and dermis, especially in the late phase of psoriatic inflammation.

Macrophages in psoriasis are "classically activated" by IFN-γ and produce IL-23p19, IL-12/23p40, iNOS, and TNF-α. Moreover, IL-17 activates the pro-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes/macrophages and sensitizes them toward pathogen-derived TLR4 ligands. Monocytes are attracted to inflamed psoriatic skin by different chemokines and cytokines. Moreover, there is an expansion of immunomodulatory immature myeloid cells called myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), especially monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), in the peripheral blood and skin lesions of psoriatic patients that correlate with the clinical severity of psoriasis. However, the role of MDSCs in the pathogenesis of psoriasis is unknown.

The Role of Mast Cells

Mast cells are key effector cells in acute allergic reactions and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, their expansion and activation contribute to psoriatic inflammation. In psoriasis, mast cells express and release IL-17 and IL-22. Notably, analysis of psoriatic skin biopsies revealed that mast cells constitute most of the IL-17-containing and IL-22-containing cells in psoriatic lesions. Psoriatic mast cells degranulate and form mast cell-extracellular traps (MCETosis) after stimulation with IL-1β and IL-23 which trigger the release of IL-17. Notably, mechanical injury induces a pro-inflammatory response of mast cells which secrete tryptase, IL-6, IL-17, IL-18, and IL-36γ and activate KCs initiating psoriatic inflammation in the Koebner phenomenon.

FAEs — efficacy and adverse effects include that more participants achieved PASI 75 with FAEs. Adverse effects, mainly GI disturbance and flushing, were more prevalent in patients taking FAEs compared with placebo (76% vs 16%; RR, 4.72; 95% CI, 2.45–9.0). GI complaints, including nausea, vomiting, esophageal, and stomach pain, can occur in up to two-thirds of patients. A modest lymphopenia is invariably present but does not appear to be of significant clinical concern. Increases in liver function test results, triglycerides, cholesterol, and creatinine are possible, necessitating regular laboratory monitoring. There are rare cases of renal disease that have been reported with FAEs, although this was not experienced in any randomized controlled trials and FAEs may not be the cause.

Erythrodermic psoriasis — diagnostic approach emphasizes distinguishing mimickers and targeted laboratory evaluation. Often, the diagnosis is made by the patient's history and subtle clues with skin biopsy aiding selected cases, and erythrodermic psoriasis may closely resemble atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and pityriasis rubra pilaris. Screening for HIV can be useful, and obtaining blood for flow cytometry, Sézary cell count, and possibly T-cell receptor gene rearrangement clonality can also be useful. The most difficult differential diagnosis is often pityriasis rubra pilaris, which commonly presents as diffuse erythroderma with psoriatic-like scale in young persons.

### Lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice: a pragmatic approach [^116MnaDB]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Lymphadenopathy is a common clinical finding and diagnostic challenge within general medicine and rheumatology practice. It may represent a primary manifestation of an underlying immune-mediated disease or indicate an infectious or neoplastic complication requiring differing management. Evaluating lymphadenopathy is of particular relevance in rheumatology, given that lymph node enlargement is a common finding within the clinical spectrum of several well-known rheumatologic disorders including RA, SLE and SS. In addition, lymphadenopathy represents a hallmark manifestation of rare immunological diseases such as Castleman disease and IgG4-related disease that must be considered in the differential diagnosis because effective targeted treatments can now impact the prognosis of these conditions. In this review we present an overview of the clinical significance of lymphadenopathy in common and rare rheumatologic diseases and propose a practical approach to lymphadenopathy in the rheumatology practice. Differential diagnosis of Castleman disease and therapeutic options for this condition of increasing rheumatologic interest will be discussed in detail.

### Role of diagnostic imaging in psoriatic arthritis: how, when, and why [^112vzsMm]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Usually, the skin manifestation of psoriasis precedes that of arthritis by 10 years on average. But an unexpected clinical scenario occurs in up to 15% of patients when arthritis and psoriasis occur simultaneously or psoriatic arthritis precedes the skin disease.

Initial reports about PsA emphasized a benign course in most patients, but it is now recognized that psoriatic arthritis often leads to joint damage and a reduced quality of life. New effective treatments may halt this progression, and consequently, treatment goals have evolved from simple reduction of pain to achieving full remission or minimal disease activity. This emerging treat-to-target strategy paradigm emphasize a need for early diagnosis; sensitive imaging techniques may be of value in this process.

Our purpose is to review the role of imaging techniques in the diagnosis, follow-up and prognosis of psoriatic arthritis making emphasis on early acute inflammatory lesions on US and MRI.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for psoriatic arthritis, more specifically with respect to pretreatment evaluation, EULAR 2023 guidelines recommend to screen for latent tuberculosis before initiating biological or targeted synthetic DMARDs. Consider screening for latent tuberculosis before initiating conventional synthetic DMARDs, immunosuppressants, and/or corticosteroids (according to dose and duration) in patients at increased risk for latent tuberculosis. Follow national and/or international guidelines for screening latent tuberculosis, including a CXR and IGRA over tuberculin skin test where available.

### Ultrasound imaging of the axilla [^114zkDPf]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

In physiological conditions, color/power Doppler shows a unipolar perfusion pattern of the lymph node with flow signals entering through the hilum and regularly branching toward the peripheral portion. Benign lymphadenopathy usually preserves the aforementioned spatial architecture of the microvasculature, but increases the amount/intensity of flow signals (Additional file 11: Video 11). On the other hand, malignant lymphadenopathy is characterized by a multipolar vascularization, anarchic distribution of the flow signals (Additional file 12: Video 12) and vessels at the level of the more cortical zones of the lymph node until the capsular coat (Additional file 13: Video 13). In fact, neoplastic cells reach the target lymph node passing through the afferent lymphatic channels and distribute with a peripheral to central progression inside it. The aforementioned "invasion mechanism" can be considered the main reason for the multipolar perfusion and subcapsular vascular signals commonly characterizing the malignant lymph nodes. The role of the resistive index has been described in the pertinent literature referring to lower vascular resistance in normal and inflammatory reactive lymph nodes compared to malignant ones. Of note, also a completely different appearance with very poor or absent vascularization on color/power Doppler can characterize a malignant lymph node due to mechanical disruption of the microvasculature related to necrotic and/or fibrotic phenomena.

It is paramount to keep in mind that focal sonographic abnormalities of the cortex of lymph node — e.g. nodular thickenings (Additional file 14: Video 14), calcific depositions, foci of necrosis — can characterize both benign and malignant lymphadenopathies; for this reason, their presence should be always integrated with the clinical findings. In this sense, considering the wide spectrum of non-neoplastic disorders presenting axillary adenopathy — mastitis, cellulitis, hidradenitis, local infections (e.g. tuberculosis, mononucleosis, cat scratch disease), autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriasis, scleroderma and dermatomyositis) and granulomatous diseases (e.g. sarcoidosis, tuberculosis and silicone-induced granulomatous adenitis) should be always considered in the differential diagnosis.

### Trimethylpsoralen bath PUVA is a remittive treatment for psoriasis vulgaris… [^115XMEN2]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Furthermore, following TMP bath PUVA therapy, the numbers of epidermal CD1a+ Langerhans cells were markedly reduced, and CD86+ cells were eliminated. Through in vitro assays, TMP was found to be about 10000-fold more active as a lymphotoxic agent compared with 8-methoxypsoralen. Additionally, at physiologic concentrations, lymphocytes were killed more readily by TMP PUVA than were keratinocytes. Previous studies have suggested that T lymphocytes may be the major cellular target of PUVA therapy. 18, 19 Accordingly, we sought to determine the lymphocyte-depleting effects of TMP PUVA therapy in psoriatic tissue and to measure direct lymphotoxic effects of TMP in vitro. The effects of TMP bath PUVA therapy on CD3+ lymphocytes in psoriatic lesions are presented in Table 1. Two weeks after starting PUVA treatment, there was a striking reduction in intraepidermal T lymphocytes, but only a modest reduction in T lymphocytes located in the papillary dermis. In contrast, CD1a+ cells are mostly located in more differentiated regions of lesional epidermis and numerous CD86+ cells are also present in these areas. Following TMP bath PUVA therapy, there was a marked reduction in the number of CD1a+ cells in the epidermis, and CD86+ cells were eliminated. Hence, Langerhans cells appear to be depleted from psoriatic lesions by TMP bath PUVA treatment. Cultures showed T-lymphocyte size and granularity shifts that typify apoptosis19 and subgenomic DNA fragmentation using flow cytometry. 18 Based on relative concentrations of psoralens required to produce cytotoxicity, mitogen-activated T lymphocytes appeared to be about 10000-fold more sensitive to TMP than to 8-MOP.

Finally, the relative sensitivity of epidermal keratinocytes vs lymphocytes to TMP PUVA therapy was measured using flow cytometry–based viability and cell counting assays. As was the case for 8-MOP PUVA therapy, 18 lymphocytes were killed by TMP PUVA therapy, but keratinocytes were relatively resistant.
