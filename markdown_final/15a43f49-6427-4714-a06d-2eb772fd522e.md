## Question

give me a physical exam for abdominal pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step protocol for the physical examination of patients presenting with abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should structure a focused history to anchor the examination. Next, I will outline the general examination and the core abdominal exam sequence of inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation. After that, I will consider targeted special maneuvers, adjunct examinations such as DRE, hernia, and pelvic/GU evaluations, and vascular assessment. I will then weigh special population nuances, the role of serial examinations and analgesia, integration with labs, and when to escalate to imaging and consultation, closing with documentation and reassessment principles.

> Let me first confirm priorities around resuscitation and safety. I need to ensure airway, breathing, and circulation are stabilized before relying on examination findings, because exam-guided decisions are valid only after hemodynamic stability is achieved, and resuscitation and early source control should proceed in parallel when bleeding or sepsis is suspected [^112BidjC] [^1175KzQd].

> Next, I should review the focused history because it guides the pretest probabilities I carry into the exam. Wait, let me verify classic symptom anchors that meaningfully change likelihoods: biliary colic presents as episodic, severe right upper quadrant or epigastric pain lasting at least 15–30 minutes, radiating to the right back or shoulder, often responsive to analgesics, and Murphy's sign helps when cholecystitis is suspected [^112ZUeFZ] [^11434QyY]. For appendicitis, I should confirm migration from periumbilical discomfort to the right lower quadrant with evolving localized peritoneal irritation and psoas or Rovsing's signs later in the course, keeping in mind that early appendicitis can be nonlocalizing and labs can be nondiagnostic [^111mMYUn]. But wait, what if this is obstruction from sigmoid volvulus; a history of progressive distention, constipation, and vomiting with prior similar episodes would raise suspicion, particularly in older, institutionalized patients, though these are guideline statements with lower evidence quality [^notfound].

> Now I will examine the patient generally before focusing on the abdomen. I need to check overall appearance, vital signs, hydration, and mental status, scan the skin for jaundice or pallor, and inspect the chest because pneumonia, myocardial ischemia, or lower lobe pathology can mimic abdominal pain, so I should not jump to premature closure on an intra-abdominal source [^112BidjC] [^116UPRpu].

> Moving to the abdomen, I will start with inspection because it is noninvasive and can reveal key clues. I need to look for contour changes such as distention, surgical scars that suggest adhesions, visible hernias, pulsations that might suggest an aortic aneurysm, localized discoloration, and visible peristalsis suggesting obstruction, while remembering that focal abdominal wall tenderness with a small, well-localized point should prompt me to consider abdominal wall pain rather than visceral pathology [^112BidjC] [^111dEmsX].

> Auscultation comes before palpation; I should listen for normal, hyperactive, hypoactive, or absent bowel sounds, recognizing that patterns can be nonspecific yet may support suspected ileus or peritonitis when integrated with the rest of the exam, and I'll be careful not to overinterpret a single finding without corroboration from other elements of the exam and history [^116zKZYC] [^115BjHzp].

> I will now examine by percussion to estimate organ size, differentiate tympany from dullness for gas versus fluid or mass, and elicit percussion tenderness as a gentle way to screen for peritoneal irritation; I should also check costovertebral angle tenderness when pyelonephritis is on the differential, verifying that these maneuvers are consistent with the patient's tolerance and clinical context [^116zKZYC] [^112BidjC].

> For palpation, I need to start lightly and away from the area of maximal pain, watching for voluntary versus involuntary guarding and rigidity, and I should confirm rebound or percussion tenderness cautiously to avoid undue discomfort; the presence of involuntary guarding or board-like rigidity increases concern for peritoneal irritation and should prompt me to pause and consider early imaging and consultation if indicated [^112BidjC].

> With deep palpation, I will characterize masses for size, mobility, and tenderness, assess for organomegaly, and carefully evaluate the aortic pulsation and estimated width; hold on, I should verify that any suspicion of abdominal aortic aneurysm is handled with caution and prompt imaging rather than aggressive palpation, and I will integrate femoral pulse findings as part of the vascular assessment [^112P1ZYZ] [^112BidjC].

> Next, I should review targeted special maneuvers when localization suggests a particular diagnosis. For right upper quadrant pain, I will elicit Murphy's sign to support acute cholecystitis suspicion, acknowledging that this should be integrated with fever, leukocytosis, and imaging when appropriate [^11434QyY]. For appendicitis, I will verify psoas and Rovsing's signs and local tenderness at McBurney's point, remembering that a negative special test does not exclude early disease, so I need to correlate with trajectory and ancillary data [^111mMYUn]. But wait, if focal tenderness persists despite muscle tensing or worsens with tensing during a Carnett test, that should push me toward an abdominal wall etiology, avoiding unnecessary imaging or surgery when other red flags are absent [^111dEmsX] [^114yQZUV].

> I should confirm peritoneal irritation by triangulating gentle percussion tenderness, cough tenderness, and rebound cautiously, while keeping a high index of suspicion for mesenteric ischemia when pain is out of proportion to exam, especially in vascular risk profiles or atrial fibrillation, and I must not be reassured by a deceptively benign abdominal exam in early ischemia [^112BidjC] [^116XRpkA].

> Hold on, I should verify when a digital rectal examination is necessary and safe. I will perform DRE when lower abdominal pain, GI bleeding, suspected obstruction, prostatitis, or anorectal pathology is on the table, but I need to avoid prostatic massage in acute bacterial prostatitis, and for suspected rectal foreign bodies, I should obtain an abdominal X-ray first to prevent examiner injury from sharp objects, then proceed with careful DRE to assess position and sphincter status as guided by practice statements [^114bP7Lv] [^111ePsdn] [^116W73HM]. In patients with suspected hemorrhoidal or anorectal variceal bleeding, I should confirm that DRE is used to rule out other sources of bleeding in line with guideline recommendations [^116ZDTPq] [^112WAsT7].

> I will now examine for hernias at the inguinal, femoral, umbilical, and incisional sites with standing and Valsalva as tolerated, and I need to ensure a genitourinary and pelvic examination is performed when indicated, especially in adolescent and reproductive-age females where pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, ruptured cysts, or ectopic pregnancy are critical considerations; I should double-check that pregnancy testing and sexual history are obtained and documented [^112BidjC] [^112bKzau].

> For vascular assessment, I need to palpate the aorta and assess femoral and popliteal pulses; I should confirm that suspicion for AAA prompts expedited imaging, and I will remember that popliteal or femoral aneurysms warrant evaluation for concomitant AAA per society guidelines [^112P1ZYZ].

> Let me consider special populations because the same findings may carry different weights. In children, fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, guarding, rigidity, or rebound are red flags for surgical disease, and ultrasound-first strategies are typical, while infants and toddlers have unique differentials like malrotation or intussusception; I should confirm these nuances while acknowledging variable evidence quality [^115iWwmA]. In older adults, I need to maintain low thresholds for imaging and admission due to atypical presentations and higher morbidity, keeping mesenteric ischemia, perforation, and AAA on the radar [^112BidjC]. In pregnancy, I should consider obstetric causes and use ultrasound first, then MRI when needed to avoid ionizing radiation, verifying that local resources and expertise inform modality choice [^114uoLGH]. In neutropenic patients or those with postoperative fever and nonlocalized pain, I should favor contrast-enhanced CT per ACR guidance, balancing contrast contraindications when necessary [^1174tgeC] [^112TdBTm] [^1158fzNi].

> Next, I should review the role of serial examinations because evolving pathology often declares itself over time. I need to ensure consistent examiners reassess tenderness, peritoneal signs, vitals, and labs in trauma and nonoperative settings, typically over at least 24–48 hours in select trauma patients, with clear thresholds to escalate care if deterioration occurs [^1145kqPe] [^111cv44m]. Hmm, wait a minute, does analgesia undermine exam utility; the best available evidence suggests judicious opioid analgesia does not impair diagnostic accuracy or mask peritoneal signs, so I should treat pain promptly while continuing careful reassessment [^1165TtKU] [^112mUce2].

> I will now examine how to integrate labs with the physical exam. I should confirm core tests based on the differential, including CBC, CRP, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing when relevant, recognizing that abnormal liver function tests may support biliary disease and microscopic hematuria may suggest urinary tract pathology, while normal early labs do not exclude appendicitis or other serious disease [^112BidjC] [^1111Jzaz]. Hold on, I should verify that red flags such as persistent abnormal vitals, escalating pain with peritoneal signs, rising inflammatory markers, or distention with obstipation push me toward imaging, consultation, and possible operative evaluation rather than prolonged observation [^116oZzjU].

> When should I escalate to imaging; I need to ensure my choice aligns with anatomic localization and patient factors. For right upper quadrant pain, ultrasound is first-line to evaluate biliary disease, with Murphy's sign complementing imaging findings [^11434QyY]. For right lower quadrant pain, I should consider ultrasound first in children and pregnancy, followed by CT if nondiagnostic, while for generalized, left upper quadrant, or lower abdominal pain in adults, contrast-enhanced CT is often appropriate, with tailored alternatives if contrast is contraindicated [^112BidjC] [^112TdBTm]. In postoperative patients with nonlocalized pain and fever, I should favor contrast-enhanced CT to evaluate for abscess, leak, or hemorrhage, and in trauma, I need to remember FAST may miss bowel and mesenteric injuries, necessitating repeat exams and CT when suspicion remains [^1158fzNi] [^116ys8nC]. Let me verify broader trends to avoid low-yield tests; abdominal radiography is generally limited for significant disease, whereas cross-sectional imaging use has increased and is associated with more specific diagnoses, particularly in older adults, though stewardship remains important [^111svvmD] [^111Ho9b8].

> I should confirm that my documentation and communication are precise and reproducible. I need to record the location and quality of tenderness, presence of peritoneal signs, results of special maneuvers and DRE, and explicitly track changes on serial examinations, while arranging timely reassessment or outpatient reevaluation in select low-risk, undifferentiated presentations with robust return precautions and clear triggers for escalation [^114SRLF5] [^112BidjC].

A focused physical exam for abdominal pain should begin with **vital signs and general appearance** to detect instability or distress [^112BidjC], then proceed in the order of **inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation** [^116zKZYC] to localize tenderness, assess peritoneal signs, and identify masses or organomegaly. Special tests (**Murphy, Rovsing, psoas, obturator, Carnett**) help narrow the differential [^111mMYUn] [^11434QyY]. Perform a digital rectal and pelvic exam when indicated [^112WAsT7] [^112MHYVB]. Always **reassess after analgesia** [^112mUce2] [^1165TtKU], as it does not mask diagnostic accuracy.

---

## General assessment

Record temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and assess general appearance for distress level, pallor, diaphoresis, jaundice, and mental status changes. Identify **red flags** such as hypotension, tachycardia, fever, altered mental status, and severe distress [^112BidjC].

---

## Inspection

- **Positioning**: Supine with knees slightly flexed; expose from xiphoid to pubic symphysis.
- **Contour**: Flat, scaphoid, distended, protuberant.
- **Skin changes**: Scars, striae, ecchymosis (Cullen, Grey-Turner), jaundice, rashes.
- **Pulsations**: Visible pulsations (consider AAA) [^112P1ZYZ].
- **Peristalsis**: Visible peristalsis (suggests obstruction) [^112BidjC].

---

## Auscultation

During auscultation, assess **bowel sounds** (normal, hyperactive, hypoactive, or absent) and listen for **bruits** — aortic, renal, iliac, or femoral — which suggest vascular disease [^116zKZYC].

---

## Percussion

Percuss the abdomen to distinguish tympany, which suggests gas or obstruction, from dullness, which suggests fluid (ascites) or mass. Estimate liver span (normal 6–12 cm at the midclavicular line) and assess splenic percussion; dullness in Traube's space suggests splenomegaly [^116zKZYC].

---

## Palpation

- **Light palpation**: Identify tenderness, guarding, rebound.
- **Deep palpation**: Identify masses, organomegaly, deep tenderness.
- **Peritoneal signs**: Rebound tenderness, involuntary guarding, rigidity [^112BidjC].
- **Murphy sign**: Inspiratory arrest with RUQ palpation (cholecystitis) [^11434QyY].
- **Rovsing sign**: LLQ palpation causing RLQ pain (appendicitis) [^111mMYUn].
- **Psoas sign**: Pain with right hip extension (retrocecal appendicitis).
- **Obturator sign**: Pain with internal rotation of flexed hip (pelvic appendicitis).
- **Carnett sign**: Increased pain with tensed abdominal wall (abdominal wall pain) [^111dEmsX].

---

## Special tests

- **Ascites**: Fluid wave, shifting dullness [^116zKZYC].
- **Hernias**: Inguinal, femoral, umbilical, incisional.
- **AAA**: Palpable pulsatile mass [^112P1ZYZ].
- **Rectal exam**: Masses, tenderness, occult blood [^112WAsT7].
- **Pelvic exam**: Masses, cervical motion tenderness, adnexal tenderness [^112MHYVB].

---

## Reassessment

Include **analgesia** [^112mUce2] [^1165TtKU] and reassess, as it does not mask diagnostic accuracy. Also perform **serial exams** to detect evolving pathology [^111cv44m].

### Perfecting the gastrointestinal physical exam: Findings and their utility and examination pearls [^116zKZYC]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

The physical examination of the patient is the cornerstone of the practice of medicine, and the skills to complete a thorough abdominal examination are critical in the care of patients. When performed correctly, the abdominal examination can be revealing when it comes to the overall health of the patient as well as acute pathology. The examination of the abdomen has the potential to minimize further testing or radiation and serves as a key diagnostic tool. In this article, we will discuss each portion of the abdominal examination in detail as well as pathologic findings, abdomen-specific signs, special patient populations, and clinical pearls.

### Effect on diagnostic efficiency of analgesia for undifferentiated abdominal pain [^112mUce2]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

The question of whether it is safe to provide analgesia for patients with undifferentiated acute abdominal pain is marked by longstanding controversy over the possible masking of physical findings. The goal of this review is to assess the pertinent studies.

- **Method**: A Medline search was performed in April 2002, using the terms 'analgesia', 'abdominal pain', 'acute abdomen', and 'morphine'. Additional articles were identified using the bibliographies of papers found through Medline. All articles reporting clinical trials of analgesia and its effects on diagnosis or physical examination were reviewed.

- **Results**: A total of eight trials (one reported only as an abstract) were identified. Because of significant disparity in trial design, no formal analysis, such as meta-analysis, was performed. However, detailed review of the trials revealed a striking consistency in results. In no study was there an association between analgesia and diagnostic impairment or dangerous masking of the findings of physical examination.

- **Conclusion**: The literature addressing early pain relief for abdominal pain is characterized by weaknesses, but there is a common theme suggesting that analgesia is safe. Pending further research, which should address some of the shortcomings of extant studies, a practice of judicious provision of analgesia appears safe, reasonable, and in the best interests of patients in pain.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Unlike CT, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation, representing a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X-rays are poorly sensitive and specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that utilization of imaging modalities increased as they became more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5-fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain became the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age. Yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visits has been shown to receive an X-ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults. This occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growth of these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized at the time of writing that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X-ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends.

Consider obtaining MRI as another imaging modality to provide clinically useful information in this clinical setting.

### Evaluation of gastrointestinal injury in blunt abdominal trauma "FAST is not reliable": the role of repeated ultrasonography [^116ys8nC]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Rapid diagnosis and treatment of abdominal injury is an important step to prevent death in patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT). Physical examination is frequently unreliable in the setting of acute trauma. Many previous reports show that emergency ultrasound is effective in the diagnosis of hemoperitoneum. The FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma) technique has now gained popularity and is accepted as a diagnostic modality for the evaluation of patients with trauma. Our previous experience showed that the sensitivity of FAST in the diagnosis of BAT is 95.4%.

MacGahan et al. reported free fluid in only three patients with isolated bowel and mesenteric injury in a series of 500 trauma patients. Several articles indicate that some important abdominal organ injuries can be missed by ultrasonography. Dolich et al. reported a large number of abdominal injuries (33%) requiring operation that were missed in ultrasound examination.

Shanmuganathan et al. showed that 34% (157 patients) of 467 patients with BAT had no free fluid in emergency ultrasound. He studied more than 11,000 patients with BAT and concluded that the FAST technique may frequently miss patients with surgically correctable injuries. Previous reports indicate a limited value for FAST in the diagnosis of certain types of injuries such as diaphragmatic rupture, and pancreatic and mesenteric injury.

MacGahan JP et al. demonstrated a sensitivity of 44% for the diagnosis of isolated gastrointestinal injury by FAST. They also showed that free abdominal fluid was not detected in the majority of patients with isolated bowel and mesenteric injury.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111zfZQK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In a previous study, older patients with abdominal pain compared to all other reasons for visit were found to have a lower probability of being triaged to the "emergent" (ESI 2) acuity on arrival but were more likely to be admitted directly to the operating room, suggesting undertriage. In this analysis, triage categories varied by age group, suggesting recognition of the increased risks and resource utilization among older adults with abdominal pain; future work focused on outcomes could help determine whether this proportional increase is sufficient to account for the rise in the risk and time sensitivity of ED abdominal pain presentations with age.

ED visits for abdominal pain increased across all age groups. There are a number of potential factors that might underlie these trends, including substitution from other sites of care due to declining primary care, colorectal surgeon, or GI specialist access; greater patient demand for medical evaluation for a given level of abdominal discomfort; an increase in the incidence of acute abdominal pain and the etiologies which cause it in the population; or a change in the classification of patient's symptoms at triage to favor abdominal pain over other reasons for visit. If patients are lowering their threshold to visit the ED for abdominal pain due to changing patient preferences, increased access to ED care, or declining access to alternative sites of evaluation, this would raise concerns of poor resource utilization across the health system. This explanation is belied by the increasing proportion of abdominal pain ED visits.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111Ho9b8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Cross-sectional imaging in the emergency department has increased substantially over more than a decade. Rising rates of emergency general surgery diagnoses suggest that this increase in imaging may be resulting in additional diagnoses of intervenable disease. We urgently need data sources that link ED visitation to 30-day outcomes to determine whether these rising rates of imaging-driven diagnoses lead to improvements in health.

### WSES consensus guidelines on sigmoid volvulus management [^115BjHzp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 1**: Initial evaluation should include a focused history and physical examination. A full panel of blood tests, including blood gas and lactate levels, is also important to check for signs of bowel ischemia. Grade of recommendation: Strong recommendation, based on low- or very-low-quality evidence, 1C.

Symptoms of sigmoid volvulus include abdominal pain, constipation, and vomiting (a late sign). In 30–41% of cases, patients report previous episodes of abdominal distention. This symptom triad is more common in endemic volvulus than in sporadic volvulus (88% versus 33%).

In the "volvulus belt" countries, the clinical presentation may be acute with peritonitis and shock. In such cases, the prognosis is poor as colonic necrosis and perforation may have already occurred by the time the patient seeks care. In contrast, in Western countries, patients typically present 3 to 4 days after the onset of symptoms. The classic patient is elderly, institutionalized, and on psychotropic medications that cause chronic constipation. The history should include risk factors such as a previous history of sigmoid volvulus, present in 30–40% of cases.

Classically, the clinical examination will identify abdominal distension, diminished bowel sounds, and often an empty rectum on digital examination. However, the examination is often difficult due to the abdominal distension resulting from colonic obstruction.

### Epiploic appendagitis: the emergency department presentation [^111J3Vdw]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We performed a structured retrospective chart review to describe the clinical characteristics of Emergency Department (ED) patients diagnosed with epiploic appendagitis (EA) by history, physical examination, and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. EA is a disease caused by inflammation of the appendix epiploica, which is subserosal adipose tissue along the colon. It may mimic surgical causes of acute abdominal pain but is treated conservatively with pain management.

Nineteen patients were diagnosed with EA, with follow-up performed on 85%. All had focal, nonmigratory symptoms. Common findings included left lower quadrant pain and guarding, along with normal temperature and white cell count. Notably, no patient required an operation. This preliminary work characterizes some common clinical features of ED patients diagnosed with EA.

As the use of emergency CT scans for abdominal pain increases, clinicians will encounter this condition more often. These features should prompt the clinician to consider a CT scan in patients with similar signs and symptoms. An accurate diagnosis may avoid unnecessary surgery.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for the efficient throughput of patients. Decision-making in patients with abdominal pain, based on clinical and laboratory evaluation alone, can result in unnecessary interventions or delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, including ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), are most often used and can assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to positively affect the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, lead to changes in management decisions, and increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of exposure to radiation in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence-based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has made available guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation in the use of imaging with patient-tailored guidelines may not be sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification.

### Approach to chronic abdominal pain in cystic fibrosis [^1128q29G]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2017). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) presents challenges for both patients and physicians, as the differential diagnosis can be complex. Most gastrointestinal manifestations of CF are associated with regional abdominal pain. Understanding pain localization, which necessitates knowledge of gut development and innervation, is crucial for comprehending the pathophysiology of abdominal pain in CF. The location of the pain, alongside clinical presentation, shapes the differential diagnosis and guides evaluation and management.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^115CmY7q]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a very common presentation in the emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and is familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost-effectiveness, it would be beneficial to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain. Identifying parameters that indicate no significant intra-abdominal pathology can encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, and most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who lack the classical features of appendicitis and show no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history, physical examination, initial imaging, and laboratory findings helps determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, warranting more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain

While most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture is equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If a patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in those where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies, which may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain, are now best managed laparoscopically.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is needed to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article discusses some of these diagnoses, including can't-miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^113jvDyY]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Of all patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED), approximately 10% have complaints of acute abdominal pain. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. Previously, these patients were thought to have an acute abdomen, and surgery was indicated. Nowadays, not all patients with acute abdominal pain, even if accompanied by abdominal tenderness and rigidity, will undergo surgery, while others without abdominal rigidity might be operated on.

Diagnostic imaging is widely used in the work-up of patients with acute abdominal pain. Ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) are frequently used alongside clinical and laboratory evaluation. The American College of Radiology suggests an abdomen/pelvis CT with contrast medium in patients with acute abdominal pain. Others favor ultrasound as the primary imaging technique mainly because it is easily accessible and does not expose patients to ionizing radiation. Ionizing radiation exposure from CT is associated with the risk of radiation-induced cancer, which is a significant drawback, especially as CT is increasingly used in the diagnostic work-up of young patients. This may prompt the evaluation of alternative imaging strategies alongside CT, such as ultrasound and MRI. However, it is critical that diagnoses are not missed or delayed, and thus the most accurate imaging technique should be utilized.

A previous evaluation of diagnostic strategies for unselected patients with acute abdominal pain favored a conditional CT strategy for the detection of urgent conditions, with ultrasound first.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^114xNMUg]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Inclusion began in March 2005, and 1101 patients were included over the subsequent 21 months. For six months, we recorded invited patients who declined participation at the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam. Of the patients approached, 2% (4 out of 188) refused to participate. Data collection could not be completed for 80 patients. We found no significant differences between these 80 patients and those included in terms of age, sex, time, or type of presentation.

The mean age of the remaining 1021 patients was 47 years, with a range from 19 to 94 years; 55% (n = 565) were female. Most patients (75%; n = 766) had been referred to the emergency department by a general practitioner. Additionally, 17% (n = 169) were self-referrals, 7% (n = 73) were referred by other medical specialties, and 1% (n = 13) were presented by emergency services.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP, which is pain with cramping characteristics, generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here. The algorithm also seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin.

For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.

### Emergency department evaluation of abdominal pain in female adolescents [^112bKzau]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in an adolescent female patient should include consideration of all potential sources of pain, including gynecologic etiologies. The goal of our study was to determine the frequency of evaluation of gynecologic causes of abdominal pain in adolescent girls seen in a pediatric emergency department.

- **Study design**: A retrospective review was performed of girls between 12 and 21 years of age presenting to the emergency department or urgent care centers at a single pediatric institution with the chief complaint of abdominal pain during 2016. Frequency analyses of demographic and clinical characteristics are presented.

- **Results**: A total of 1082 girls presented with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. Menarche was documented in 85% of patients, sexual history in 52% of patients, and assessment of contraception use in 28%. Pregnancy testing was performed in 77%. Sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing was performed in 31%, and in only 73% of patients who reported being sexually active. Imaging was performed in 52%. In the subgroup of patients who reported being sexually active and presented with abdominal pain and vaginal discharge, only 37% had a pelvic examination performed. In multivariable modeling, Black patients were significantly more likely than White patients to have STI testing performed (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 1.39; confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.70) and to undergo a pelvic examination (aRR = 2.45; CI = 1.34–4.50), and less likely to undergo imaging (aRR = 0.69; CI = 0.59–0.81).

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality.

This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and the physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Abdominal pain caused by a potentially fatal attraction [^116TGm64]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^115iWwmA]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis. In infants and toddlers, clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel's diverticulum, or intussusception.

In school-aged children, constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common. In female adolescents, clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion. Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test.

Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for diagnosing cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cysts, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Abdominal wall pain: Clinical evaluation, differential diagnosis, and treatment [^111dEmsX]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal wall pain is often mistaken for intra-abdominal visceral pain, resulting in expensive and unnecessary laboratory tests, imaging studies, consultations, and invasive procedures. These evaluations generally are nondiagnostic, and lingering pain can become frustrating to both the patient and the clinician. Common causes of abdominal wall pain include nerve entrapment, hernia, and surgical or procedural complications. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is the most common and frequently missed type of abdominal wall pain. This condition typically presents with acute or chronic localized pain at the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis that worsens with position changes or increased abdominal muscle tension.

Abdominal wall pain should be suspected in patients with no symptoms or signs of visceral etiology and a localized small tender spot. A positive Carnett test, in which tenderness stays the same or worsens when the patient tenses the abdominal muscles, suggests abdominal wall pain. A local anesthetic injection can confirm the diagnosis when there is 50% postprocedural pain improvement. Point-of-care ultrasonography may help rule out other abdominal wall pathologies and guide injections.

The management of abdominal wall pain depends on the etiology. Reassurance and patient education can be helpful. Local injection with an anesthetic and a corticosteroid is an effective treatment for anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome, with an overall response rate of 70% to 99%. For refractory cases that require more than two injections, surgical neurectomy generally resolves the condition.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: 50 years on [^11752d88]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to address the ongoing diagnostic challenges posed by Emergency Department (ED) patients with abdominal pain. This research, focusing on demographics, evaluation, and outcomes, provides insights into stability and change over a 50-year period at a single institution.

The study represents the fourth iteration of this analysis, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the inaugural investigation. The medical records of 1,000 adult patients who visited a tertiary care ED in 2022 with abdominal pain as their chief complaint were reviewed. Data extracted included demographics, diagnosis, disposition, and the usage of imaging and laboratory testing. Comparisons were made between the current and previous studies whenever feasible.

The results indicated a significant increase in the usage of computed tomography (CT) scans (+69%) and ultrasounds (+32%), alongside a notable decline in the use of abdominal radiographs (-68%) over the past 15 years. This trend of increased imaging was associated with longer evaluation times, extended lengths of stay, and increased charges. Noteworthy findings included the sustained low frequency of missed surgical illness relative to 1972, although the proportion of patients hospitalized (approximately 29%) has shown minimal change.

Over the past 50 years, the evaluation of abdominal pain in the ED has improved in terms of diagnosing acute surgical illnesses. However, this process has become less efficient and more costly. Remarkably, the percentage of patients hospitalized has remained stable.

In this series, a clinician extemporaneously discusses the diagnostic approach to sequentially presented clinical information, with additional commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process integrated throughout the discussion.

Clinical information: A 43-year-old Mexican woman presented to the emergency department with abdominal pain. Her illness had begun 1 week earlier with fevers to 38.9°F and an intermittent frontal headache without photophobia or other neurological symptoms. Two days prior to presentation, she began experiencing left upper quadrant (LUQ) abdominal pain described as sharp, unremitting, and radiating to the midepigastrium, right upper quadrant, and left flank. The pain did not change with eating, but she did report episodic nausea and vomiting. She denied hematemesis, dysuria, or diarrhea. Her last menstrual period had begun 3 weeks earlier, and she denied recent sexual activity. One day prior, she had been diagnosed with gallstones at another emergency department and treated with oral metoclopramide and hydrocodone-acetaminophen.

### Abdominal pain: General imaging strategies [^117Qx3DU]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is the most common condition necessitating surgical admission to a pediatric hospital. The vast majority of cases are due to either appendicitis or acute non-specific abdominal pain; however, there are many other conditions presenting with acute abdominal pain in childhood that can mimic appendicitis. Some of these conditions are rarely encountered in adult practice.

Plain abdominal radiographs are still initially obtained for many children presenting with abdominal pain. However, in the absence of associated symptoms such as vomiting, ultrasonography (US) is more likely to elucidate the underlying cause of pain than plain-film radiography. While computed tomography (CT) is extensively used in investigating adults with abdominal pain, its widespread use in children should be avoided in the interest of radiation protection.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonlocalized abdominal pain [^114uoLGH]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

The range of pathology in adults that can produce abdominal pain is broad and necessitates an imaging approach to evaluate many different organ systems. Although localizing pain prompts directed imaging and management, clinical presentations may vary and result in nonlocalized symptoms. This review focuses on imaging the adult population with nonlocalized abdominal pain, including patients with fever, recent abdominal surgery, or neutropenia.

Imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis to evaluate for infectious or inflammatory processes of the abdominal viscera and solid organs, abdominal and pelvic neoplasms, and screen for ischemic or vascular etiologies is essential for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Often the first-line modality, CT quickly evaluates the abdomen and pelvis, providing accurate diagnoses and management of patients with abdominal pain. Ultrasound and tailored MRI protocols may be useful as first-line imaging studies, especially in pregnant patients. In the postoperative abdomen, fluoroscopy may help detect anastomotic leaks or abscesses. While often performed, abdominal radiographs may not alter management.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation).

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^112p7nKs]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (e.g. acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are necessarily related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

A practical approach to the management of chronic abdominal pain is necessary given the high prevalence and impact of this issue. This article describes a method that has evolved based on clinical experience and literature review:

- **Identifying predominant bloaters and abdominal wall pain**: Exclusion of organic disease, including consideration of laparoscopy for diagnosis.
- **Consideration of chronic functional abdominal pain and pharmacotherapies**: First and second line pharmacotherapies should be considered.
- **Seeking specialist care**: Referral to a pain clinic, psychiatry, or behavioral therapy is recommended.

### Assessment and management of recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department [^1135CNW3]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain accounts for a significant proportion of attenders and high-impact users in the emergency department. Due to the heterogeneity of presentation and the broad spectrum of possible causes, abdominal pain presents a significant clinical challenge within the emergency department, particularly as distress and pain are commonly elevated.

Patients in this group are routinely prescribed opiate-based interventions and undergo repeated investigations in a 'better safe than sorry' culture, which saturates the field of persistent physical symptoms. This approach is contributing to the growing problem and fueling a cycle of repeated attendance and failure to resolve the underlying issues.

This article reviews the clinical and psychophysiological understanding of recurrent abdominal pain, critiquing guidelines and approaches to diagnosis and management. We offer an alternative evidence-based biopsychosocial approach using the mnemonic 'ERROR', recommending five steps for the assessment and clinical management of recurrent abdominal pain in the emergency department.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112EpQGz]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

In this study, relying solely on clinical diagnosis would have resulted in a high number of false-positive urgent diagnoses, whereas using ultrasonography as the only imaging method would have led to an unacceptably high number of missed urgent conditions. In comparison, computed tomography (CT) following clinical evaluation demonstrated better accuracy. The use of CT conditional on a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result had the highest sensitivity for detecting urgent conditions and would result in the lowest overall exposure to radiation. Alternatively, employing imaging strategies based on patients' characteristics or the location of pain would have decreased accuracy compared to the conditional CT strategy.

We acknowledge several potential limitations of this analysis. The study design, with its extensive diagnostic investigation for all enrolled patients, carefully collected data, and diagnoses assigned after each step, allowed for comparison of imaging strategies without requiring a randomized clinical trial with multiple groups. However, our approach did not permit a direct evaluation of the effects of imaging on patient management and outcomes. In this study, management after completing the diagnostic protocol was consistently based on the results of all diagnostic tests.

A key consideration is the pre-imaging selection of patients, which should be remembered when attempting to generalize these results. Most patients were referred to the emergency department by general practitioners, and those discharged without imaging from the emergency department were not included in the study results.

### The diagnostic pursuit of gastrointestinal symptoms [^1175j15p]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

This article attempts to model the reasoning underlying the process of diagnostic workup in patients with gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Diagnostic reasoning consists of two consecutive and repetitive steps. Test procedures help to contract a list of multiple competing diagnoses to one focal diagnosis. Subsequently, the focal diagnosis is expanded into a second list of new diagnoses that are more precise than those on the first list. In this process of expansion, the focal diagnosis serves as a test with its own sensitivity values to generate the second list of associated diagnoses. The cycle of contraction and expansion repeats until the focal diagnosis of the last contraction is no longer expansible or until the diagnostic knowledge gained from further expansion loses therapeutic relevance. This process can be formalized using Bayes' formula.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes, such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain, should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability.

Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases.

Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and the index of suspicion for specific etiologies. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered.

### Peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain: Can physical examination limit diagnostic testing [^114yQZUV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The emergency department evaluation of patients with abdominal pain is most appropriately directed at identifying acute inflammation, infection, obstruction, or surgical disease. Doing so commonly involves "routine" (and often extensive) diagnostic imaging and laboratory testing. Benign mimics of serious visceral abdominal pain that can be diagnosed by physical exam and confirmed with local anesthetic injections have been identified over the last century. These syndromes derive from painful irritation of the intercostal nerves by a mobile rib below, or from impingement of the cutaneous branches of those same intercostal nerves as they penetrate the abdominal wall. These peripheral neuropathic mimics of visceral abdominal pain continue to go unrecognized and underdiagnosed.

- **Methods**: Our purpose is to review the affirmative diagnosis of non-visceral abdominal pain by physical examination.

- **Results**: The consequences of failure to identify these conditions are considerable. In the search for a diagnosis that is literally at the provider's fingertips, patients frequently undergo months to years of fruitless and often invasive diagnostic tests, not uncommonly including unsuccessful surgeries.

- **Conclusions**: With proper consideration of and appropriate testing for visceral etiologies, a carefully directed physical examination may yield an affirmative diagnosis in a percentage of these common emergency department patients.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: Missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the emergency department. It is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The emergency medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation, including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination are necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^117PDmzo]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain, and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated.

The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, known as the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain.

The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Abdominal pain in physical therapy practice: 3 patient cases [^112FKycm]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

- **Study design**: Resident's case problem.

- **Background**: Abdominal pain is a common symptom, but it is not a common diagnosis for patients referred to physical therapists for examination and intervention. For patients with primary symptoms of abdominal pain, a thorough evaluation must be performed to determine if symptoms are musculoskeletal in nature or of nonmusculoskeletal origin, which would warrant referral to a different healthcare provider. This report describes the management of three adults with primary complaints of abdominal pain who were referred for physical therapy evaluation and treatment.

- **Diagnosis**: Two of the patients had secondary symptoms of hip and/or low back pain and had previously undergone extensive medical testing for their chronic abdominal pain, without a definitive diagnosis. A physical therapy evaluation was conducted, and treatment, including manual physical therapy and exercise, was administered to address all relative impairments once the physical therapist determined that the patients' symptoms were of musculoskeletal origin. The third patient in this series was referred to a physical therapist with a diagnosis of greater trochanteric versus iliopsoas bursitis. However, the patient had abdominal pain that was more acute in nature, with history and physical examination findings concerning for nonmusculoskeletal origin. Both patients with abdominal pain of musculoskeletal origin showed marked improvement in pain and disability after seven treatment sessions. The third patient was referred to her appropriate healthcare provider for further evaluation.

### Effects of morphine analgesia on diagnostic accuracy in emergency department patients with abdominal pain: A prospective, randomized trial [^1165TtKU]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

Because of concerns about masking important physical findings, there is controversy surrounding whether it is safe to provide analgesia to patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain. The purpose of this study was to address the effects of analgesia on the physical examination and diagnostic accuracy for patients with abdominal pain.

- **Study design**: The study was a prospective, double-blind clinical trial in which adult Emergency Department (ED) patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain were randomized to receive placebo (control group, n = 36) or morphine sulphate (MS group, n = 38). Diagnostic and physical examination assessments were recorded before and following a 60-minute period during which study medication was titrated. Diagnostic accuracy and physical examination changes were compared between groups using univariate statistical analyses.

- **Results**: There were no differences between control and MS groups with respect to changes in physical or diagnostic accuracy. The overall likelihood of change in severity of tenderness was similar in MS (37.7%) as compared with control (35.3%) patients (risk ratio [RR] 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–1.78). MS patients were no more likely than controls to have a change in pain location (34.0% versus 41.2%, RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.50–1.36). Diagnostic accuracy did not differ between MS and control groups (64.2% versus 66.7%, RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73–1.27). There were no differences between groups with respect to the likelihood of any change occurring in the diagnostic list (37.7% versus 31.4%, RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.71–2.05).

Patients typically present with 12 to 24 hours of mid-abdominal pain, which may migrate to the right lower quadrant. In the early course of appendicitis, the physical examination may reveal nonlocalizing, mid-abdominal pain without peritoneal irritation. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite, abdominal distention, nausea, vomiting, malaise, obstipation, fever, and chills.

Patients may also have certain physical signs associated with appendicitis. The psoas sign is an irritation of the iliopsoas muscle in the abdomen, a classic finding of acute appendicitis, which can be elicited by performing passive extension of the right hip with the patient laying on their left side. The Rovsing's sign can also be seen in acute appendicitis and is observed when deep palpation of the left lower quadrant elicits pain in the right lower quadrant. Patients presenting later in the course of the disease process may develop peritoneal inflammation with localized guarding and rebound tenderness adjacent to the appendix in the right lower quadrant.

Standard laboratory tests should include a complete blood count, urine analysis, and routine chemistry if the patient requires further imaging or operative management. It is important to note that the white blood count may not be elevated in early acute appendicitis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, specifically with respect to history and physical examination, the ESGO 2017 guidelines recommend performing a physical examination. This includes abdominal, vaginal, and rectal examinations; assessment of the breast, groins, axilla, and supraclavicular areas; and auscultation of the lungs in patients with suspected ovarian cancer.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^1111Jzaz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

The study shows that patients presenting with abdominal pain without vomiting, guarding, or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra-abdominal pathology and can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function tests were helpful in indicating the possibility of biliary colic, and microscopic hematuria may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common in emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illnesses without a clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However, high white blood cell counts and a left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years. For children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain, the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated white blood cell count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness, pain migration, and vomiting may help differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease. In such cases, patients tend to have raised white blood cell counts and demonstrate signs of peritonism, making clinical differentiation between the two diagnoses difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically, and patients commonly undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions, ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that considers the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and guides further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

Certain elements of the history and physical examination are helpful; for example, constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction. However, other factors, such as anorexia, have little predictive value for appendicitis. The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended for assessing right upper quadrant pain, while computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain.

It is also important to consider special populations, such as women who are at risk of genitourinary diseases that may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Studies of the symptom abdominal pain — a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MiJLT]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision-making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases, and chances of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.

- **Aim**: We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on the prevalence, etiology, or prognosis of abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. We included all types of study designs except for qualitative studies. Studies focused solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies. Mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients, the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common etiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2–18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6–13.2%), urological causes (5.3%), and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%), or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.

- **Conclusion**: There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary.

### Guideline no. 403: Initial investigation and management of adnexal masses [^113oWrvy]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ovarian cancer, specifically concerning history and physical examination, the SOGC 2020 guidelines recommend conducting a physical examination. This examination should include the lymph nodes and respiratory system to rule out pleural effusion or consolidation, a breast and axillary examination to rule out breast malignancy, and an abdominal examination to assess for ascites, omental caking, and organomegaly, as well as a pelvic examination. The pelvic examination should include bimanual and rectovaginal assessments to evaluate mass size, contour, mobility, and any abnormalities in the parametrial, bladder, and rectal areas.

### Abdominal pain in the geriatric patient [^114gznyP]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

With an aging population, emergency department clinicians can expect an increase in geriatric patients presenting with abdominal pain. Compared with younger patients, this patient population is less likely to present with classic symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory values of abdominal disease. However, the morbidity and mortality associated with elderly patients presenting with abdominal pathologic conditions are significant. For this reason, the clinician must be familiar with some subtle and not-so-subtle differences when caring for the geriatric patient with abdominal pain to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^114SRLF5]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Approximately 4–5% of patients evaluated at an emergency department (ED) present with acute abdominal pain. Some patients that require admission for surgical or medical treatment are easily recognized. Others may present during the early stages of surgical pathology, making it difficult to distinguish them from patients with mild self-limiting disease. Judgment errors in evaluating these patients with an ambivalent presentation may lead to therapeutic delay, potentially increasing morbidity and even mortality. For this reason, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) are often used to aid in the diagnostic process and subsequent clinical decision-making. However, cross-sectional imaging may not be beneficial in diagnosing all patients seen in the ED for acute abdominal pain, as these examinations are costly, time-consuming, and, in the case of CT, expose the patient to ionizing radiation.

- **Outpatient re-evaluation**: Another method often used for differentiating mild disease from more serious pathology in ambivalent cases is outpatient re-evaluation. Re-evaluation can allow the disease to present itself through natural progression, permitting surgical cases to become more typical and thus identifiable. In patients with nonspecific abdominal pain or mild nonsurgical diagnoses, the symptoms will regress, allowing the patient to be safely discharged from follow-up.

The present study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of standard outpatient re-evaluation in a large series of patients with acute abdominal pain seen in our ED but who were not…

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^112QDC5r]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

When diagnosing and investigating functional abdominal cramping pain (FACP) in primary care, it is crucial to rule out organic pathology.

- **Ruling out organic pathology**: The first step is to identify "red flags" or alarm signals indicative of structural organic disease, necessitating a referral to a specialist. Upon initial presentation of symptoms, potentially serious organic diseases must be excluded. Patients showing any indicators of organic disease should be referred to a specialist for further examination.

- **Investigations and diagnosis**: A comprehensive evaluation of family history, medication use, pain characteristics, and eating/bowel habits is essential for all patients presenting with FACP symptoms. In selected cases, and at the clinician's discretion, a physical examination (including assessment of bowel sounds and digital rectal examination), laboratory tests, and psychosocial assessment may also be warranted. Abdominal ultrasound investigations could prove beneficial.

### Imaging of acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain: Differential diagnoses beyond appendicitis [^111Ttnh6]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Evaluation of acute right lower quadrant pain remains a common and challenging clinical scenario for emergency medicine physicians due to frequent nonspecific signs, symptoms, and physical examination findings. Therefore, imaging has evolved to play a pivotal role in the emergency setting. While appendicitis is a common cause of acute pain, there are numerous other important differential considerations with which the radiologist must be aware. The purpose of this review is to list an anatomy-based, encompassing differential diagnosis in addition to acute appendicitis for right lower quadrant pain; demonstrate the key imaging findings of numerous differential considerations; and describe helpful imaging and clinical features useful in narrowing the differential diagnosis.

### Physical examination is a poor screening test for abdominal-pelvic injury in adult blunt trauma patients [^115iN5Vu]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2010). Low credibility.

To determine if physical examination can reliably detect or exclude abdominal or pelvic injury in adult trauma activation patients, trauma registry and medical record data were retrospectively reviewed for all adult blunt trauma patients with a Glasgow coma scale score > 8, from June 30, 2005, to December 31, 2006. Attending surgeons' dictated admission history and physical examination reports were individually reviewed. Patients' subjective reports of abdominal pain were recorded as present or absent. Exam findings of the lower ribs, abdomen, and pelvis were each separately recorded as positive or negative and were compared with findings on a subsequent objective evaluation of the abdomen (OEA). "Clinically significant" injuries were defined as those that would change patient management.

One thousand six hundred sixty-three patients were studied. Of patients with a negative abdominal exam, 10% had a positive OEA. When abdominal pain was absent, and exam of the lower ribs, abdomen, and pelvis was normal, OEA was positive in 7.6%, and 5.7% had a clinically significant injury. While a positive abdominal exam was predictive of a positive OEA (P < 0.01), a negative exam, even when broadened (pain, lower ribs, abdomen, pelvis), did not exclude significant injuries.

In conclusion, ten percent of trauma activation patients with a negative abdominal exam have occult abdominal/pelvic injuries. Even when exam of the lower ribs, abdomen, and pelvis are all negative and abdominal pain is absent, 5.7% have occult injuries that would change management. OEA should be used liberally.

### Approach to abdominal imaging in 2022 [^111Gw6LE]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain represents 5% to 7% of all emergency department presentations. Many patients require imaging for diagnosis, and choosing the appropriate imaging modality is a crucial decision point. Modern medicine offers a fantastic array of options, including abdominal radiograph, computed tomography, MRI, and ultrasonography. However, the plethora of alternatives can be paralyzing. This article introduces the commonly available modalities, discusses the advantages and disadvantages, and presents recommendations for commonly diagnosed conditions.

### Multi-detector computed tomography of acute abdomen [^116w2ht4]. European Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is one of the most common causes for referrals to the emergency department. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain characterizing the "acute abdomen" requires rapid and accurate identification of a potentially life-threatening abdominal pathology to provide a timely referral to the appropriate physician. While the physical examination and laboratory investigations are often non-specific, computed tomography (CT) has evolved as the first-line imaging modality in patients with an acute abdomen. Because the new multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanner generations provide increased speed, greater volume coverage, and thinner slices, the acceptance of CT for abdominal imaging has increased rapidly. The goal of this article is to discuss the role of MDCT in the diagnostic work-up of acute abdominal pain.

### Laboratory tests in the patient with abdominal pain [^116BE929]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common presenting complaints to the emergency department (ED). More often than not, some degree of laboratory testing is used to narrow the differential diagnosis based on the patient's history and examination. Ordering practices are often guided by evidence, habit, consulting services, and institutional/regional culture. This review highlights relevant laboratory studies that may be ordered in the ED, as well as commentary on indications and diagnostic value of these tests.

### A randomized, controlled trial of routine early abdominal computed tomography in patients presenting with non-specific acute abdominal pain [^116WvLTW]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of an initial early computed tomography (CT) examination versus standard practice (SP) on the length of hospital stay, diagnostic accuracy, and mortality of adults presenting with acute abdominal pain.

- **Materials and methods**: Two hundred and five adults presenting with acute abdominal pain were randomized to undergo either an early CT examination or SP, which comprised supine abdominal and erect chest radiography. One hundred and ninety-eight patients (99 in each arm) were included in the analysis. The primary endpoint was the duration of inpatient stay; secondary endpoints were diagnostic certainty and mortality.

- **Results**: There was no significant difference in the length of hospital stay between the two arms (p = 0.20). At randomization, 36% (35 of 96) of CT patients and 49% (48 of 98) of SP patients were correctly diagnosed. Twenty-four hours after randomization, the correct diagnosis had been established in 84% of CT patients and 73% of SP patients. This refinement in diagnostic certainty was significantly better in the CT group (p < 0.001). There was no difference in mortality between the two trial arms (p = 0.31).

- **Conclusion**: Early abdominal CT in patients with acute abdominal pain improves diagnostic certainty but does not reduce the length of hospital stay and 6-month mortality.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lower gastrointestinal bleeding, more specifically with respect to clinical assessment, ACG 2016 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused history, performing a physical examination, and obtaining laboratory evaluation at the time of patient presentation to assess the severity of bleeding and its possible location and etiology. Obtain initial patient assessment and perform hemodynamic resuscitation simultaneously.

### Management of rectal foreign bodies [^116W73HM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients may present with vague abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, or discomfort, and sometimes constipation. Signs of infection or perforation might be evident in complicated cases. A physical examination should include a thorough abdominal assessment to evaluate for signs of peritonitis or the ability to palpate an object transabdominally. The rectal foreign body can sometimes be palpated in the left or right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

Rectal examination is crucial for diagnosis, but it should be conducted after an abdominal X-ray to prevent accidental injury from sharp objects to the examiner. The foreign body may be palpable in the distal rectum. While bright red blood per rectum is often observed, it is not universally present. Careful attention should also be given to the status of the sphincter, with particular consideration for patients without a prior history of foreign body placement, as well as those in nonvoluntary cases.

In instances where there is no sphincter injury, the rectal sphincter might exhibit increased tone secondary to muscular spasm due to the foreign object. Any obvious damage to the sphincter, including visible injury to both the internal and external sphincter, should be meticulously examined.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra-abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain [^116oZzjU]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Early diagnostic laparoscopy and treatment result in accurate, prompt, and efficient management of acute abdominal pain. This technique reduces the rate of unnecessary laparotomy and right iliac fossa gridiron incisions, and increases the diagnostic accuracy in these patients; however, this approach is expensive with significant use of resources and potential morbidity. Diagnostic laparoscopy also avoids extensive preoperative investigations and averts delays in operative management.

Morino et al. assessed the role of diagnostic laparoscopy and concluded that, compared with clinical observation, early laparoscopy did not show a clear benefit in women with non-specific abdominal pain. They reported a higher number of diagnoses and a shorter hospital stay in the laparoscopy group. In another study, patients without evidence of guarding, normal temperature, and normal white cell count were observed; a practice proven to reduce the rate of negative appendectomy. Non-specific abdominal pain is the most common diagnosis in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain (25–35% of all patients), and of those patients, only a quarter need surgical intervention. Clinical scores developed to recognize acute appendicitis are useful, but those scores can only be used with clinical judgment. If there is any suspicion of serious pathology, the patient should undergo a diagnostic laparoscopy.

The study shows the likely groups of patients with non-specific abdominal pain are those with normal white cell count, no history of vomiting, and absent signs of…

### Acute mesenteric ischemia: Guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^116XRpkA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Severe abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings should be assumed to be acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) until disproven. The key to early diagnosis is maintaining a high level of clinical suspicion. The clinical scenario of a patient complaining of excruciating abdominal pain with an unrevealing abdominal exam is classic for early AMI.

If the physical exam demonstrates signs of peritonitis, there is likely irreversible intestinal ischemia with bowel necrosis. In a study of AMI, 95% of patients presented with abdominal pain, 44% with nausea, 35% with vomiting, 35% with diarrhea, and 16% with blood per rectum. Approximately one-third of patients present with the triad of abdominal pain, fever, and hemocult-positive stools. Other patients, particularly those with delayed diagnosis, may present in extremis with septic shock. Clinical signs of peritonitis may be subtle. Accordingly, one must have a high index of suspicion, because such findings almost always are predictive of intestinal infarction.
