## Question

How long does amiodarone last once stopped

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long amiodarone lasts once it is stopped. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacokinetics, especially the long half-life and tissue distribution. Then, I should verify the biphasic elimination and what that means clinically. Next, I will consider the active metabolite and how it contributes to persistence. After that, I should translate this into practical timelines for drug interactions, antiarrhythmic effect, and organ-specific toxicities. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting guidance and synthesize a cautious, clinically useful answer with monitoring advice.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacokinetics. Amiodarone exhibits multi-compartment kinetics with a very large volume of distribution and extensive tissue accumulation, especially in fat and highly perfused organs, which drives prolonged persistence after discontinuation [^115iy61E]. The FDA labeling reports a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 53 days for the parent drug, with a range of roughly 26 to 107 days, and the active metabolite desethylamiodarone has a similar long half-life around 61 days, so both parent and metabolite contribute to lingering effects [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].

> Wait, let me verify the biphasic pattern because this is easy to misstate. Initially, plasma levels fall by about 50% within 2.5 to 10 days as drug leaves well-perfused compartments, but this is followed by a much slower terminal phase reflecting release from poorly perfused tissues, which is why measurable drug and effects can persist for months after stopping therapy [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E]. I should double-check that this biphasic model is consistently described across labels and reviews, and yes, multiple FDA sources align on this point, reinforcing the clinical implication that early declines do not equal clearance [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical effect tracking plasma levels. The antiarrhythmic effect is tissue-mediated and correlates more closely with desethylamiodarone accumulation than with parent drug levels, which helps explain why antiarrhythmic benefit and toxicity can persist even as plasma concentrations decline in the early phase [^115iy61E]. I need to ensure I emphasize that recurrence of arrhythmia after stopping amiodarone is variable and unpredictable, and that if amiodarone is restarted, control may be regained quickly due to residual tissue stores, which is a practical clue to ongoing tissue presence [^111bf2wS].

> Next, I should review drug–drug interaction implications because clinicians often ask when it is safe to start interacting agents. The FDA warns that because of the long half-life, drug interactions can persist for weeks to months after discontinuation, so agents with narrow therapeutic windows or QT liability still carry risk during this window [^116FNwa9]. For dofetilide, a specific example, labeling advises waiting until amiodarone plasma levels are below 0.3 mcg/mL or until at least three months have passed since stopping amiodarone, underscoring the need for a conservative washout in sensitive scenarios [^113WDsTi]. But wait, what if rapid switching is necessary in select patients? Observational data suggest that a 7-day washout may be feasible in ICD patients when carefully monitored, yet this remains off-label and should be individualized with inpatient initiation and ECG monitoring given torsades risk [^111UTwFE].

> I will now examine organ-specific toxicities that can persist. Pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic injury, and neurologic effects can all persist beyond discontinuation because of tissue accumulation and slow release. For example, thyroid abnormalities and abnormal thyroid tests may persist for weeks to months after withdrawal, and liver injury can evolve or remain apparent after stopping therapy, so ongoing surveillance is prudent even after cessation [^115WEmNJ] [^111ZdqcT]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline quantifies this persistence; while exact timelines vary by organ and patient factors, endocrine guidance consistently notes prolonged effects requiring individualized follow-up and, in some cases, continuation of management despite drug withdrawal [^115WEmNJ] [^117NzRB4].

> But wait, what if the question is about when the antiarrhythmic effect is "gone"? The FDA notes that antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after discontinuation, and the time to arrhythmia recurrence is variable and unpredictable, which means there is no single "clearance day" for clinical effect [^111bf2wS]. I should confirm that this aligns with clinical experience; indeed, case series and practice patterns reflect that patients may remain arrhythmia-free for weeks to months after stopping and then recur, consistent with the slow depletion of tissue stores and the metabolite's activity [^111bf2wS].

> Let me synthesize a practical, cautious timeline while acknowledging variability. For most patients, a reasonable working estimate is that clinically meaningful drug exposure and interaction risk persist for at least 2 to 3 months after stopping, with the tail end of elimination extending toward 6 months in some cases, particularly with long-term or high-dose therapy and in those with higher fat stores or impaired metabolism [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E]. I should double-check that this aligns with authoritative guidance; the ACC/AHA/ACCP guideline explicitly lists an oral half-life of 26–107 days, supporting a several-month window of caution for interactions and toxicity surveillance, and the dofetilide label's 3-month washout is a pragmatic anchor for high-risk switches [^112EFACu] [^113WDsTi]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the terminal half-life could be as short as 2–3 weeks in some patients, but I should correct that: the lower bound of the terminal phase is about 26 days, and many patients cluster around 40–55 days, so even "fast" eliminators still have multi-week to multi-month persistence of tissue drug [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].

> Next, I should review clinical actions that should follow discontinuation. I need to ensure we advise ongoing monitoring for bradycardia, conduction effects, thyroid dysfunction, hepatic injury, and pulmonary symptoms for several months, and to anticipate that drug interactions may persist, requiring dose adjustments of concomitant medications such as warfarin, digoxin, and statins during and after the washout period [^116FNwa9] [^116YPiry]. For patients in whom a new antiarrhythmic is planned, I should confirm agent-specific washout rules; in addition to dofetilide's 3-month guidance, sotalol and other agents often require several half-lives of clearance from prior therapy, and given amiodarone's unpredictable kinetics, a conservative approach is safest when feasible [^113WDsTi] [^116YPiry].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Amiodarone's effects persist for weeks to months after discontinuation due to extensive tissue distribution and a long terminal half-life for both parent drug and desethylamiodarone; practically, allow at least 2–3 months of caution for interactions and toxicity, recognize that some effects can extend to 6 months in select patients, and individualize decisions about starting interacting drugs or declaring "washout" complete based on clinical context and, when available, drug-specific thresholds like the dofetilide example [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E] [^112EFACu] [^113WDsTi].

Amiodarone persists in the body for **weeks to months** after discontinuation due to its long terminal half-life (26–107 days) [^1119uY8x] and extensive tissue accumulation [^115iy61E]. Plasma levels drop by about 50% within 2.5–10 days, but the drug continues to be released from fat and other tissues, so **clinically significant effects can persist for 1–3 months** or longer [^1119uY8x] [^111bf2wS]. This prolonged presence means drug interactions and adverse effects (e.g. bradycardia, QT prolongation, thyroid dysfunction) may continue after stopping therapy, so clinicians should monitor patients and adjust interacting medications accordingly [^116FNwa9] [^1153wCQy].

---

## Pharmacokinetics and elimination

- **Half-life**: The terminal elimination half-life of amiodarone is 26–107 days, with a mean of ~53 days [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].
- **Biphasic elimination**: After chronic therapy, plasma levels fall by ~50% within 2.5–10 days, followed by a slow terminal phase with a half-life of 26–107 days [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].
- **Metabolite**: Desethylamiodarone (DEA), an active metabolite, has a similar half-life (~61 days) and contributes to prolonged effects [^1119uY8x] [^115iy61E].
- **Tissue accumulation**: Amiodarone accumulates in fat and highly perfused organs (liver, lung, spleen), creating a large volume of distribution (~60 L/kg) and sustaining release after discontinuation [^115iy61E].

---

## Clinical implications of prolonged persistence

- **Antiarrhythmic effect**: Antiarrhythmic effects can persist for weeks to months after stopping, with variable and unpredictable recurrence of arrhythmias [^111bf2wS].
- **Drug interactions**: Interactions may persist for weeks to months after discontinuation, requiring caution with new medications [^116FNwa9] [^1153wCQy].
- **Adverse effects**: Bradycardia, QT prolongation, thyroid dysfunction, and pulmonary toxicity can persist or emerge after stopping therapy [^1153wCQy] [^115WEmNJ].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Monitoring**: Continue monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions for several weeks to months after discontinuation [^1153wCQy] [^115WEmNJ].
- **Dose adjustments**: Reduce doses of interacting drugs (e.g. warfarin, digoxin) during and after amiodarone therapy due to persistent interactions [^116YPiry] [^1131Fa2J].
- **Alternative therapies**: When switching antiarrhythmics (e.g. to dofetilide), wait until amiodarone levels are low or at least 3 months have passed to avoid interactions [^113WDsTi].

---

## Factors influencing persistence

Several factors influence how long amiodarone remains in the body:

| **Factor** | **Effect on persistence** |
|-|-|
| Dose and duration | Higher doses and longer therapy increase tissue accumulation and prolong effects [^notfound] |
| Patient age | Older patients may have slower clearance and prolonged effects |
| Body composition | Higher fat content increases accumulation and prolongs elimination [^115iy61E] |
| Hepatic function | Impaired hepatic function slows metabolism and prolongs effects [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring special consideration

- **Pregnancy**: Amiodarone can persist for months; avoid breastfeeding and plan pregnancies accordingly [^1133fjFt] [^111uBAQt].
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Thyroid abnormalities may persist after discontinuation, requiring ongoing monitoring and management [^115WEmNJ] [^117NzRB4].
- **Neurologic toxicity**: Neurologic effects (e.g. ataxia) may persist and recover slowly after stopping therapy [^112tyM2E].

---

Amiodarone persists in the body for **weeks to months** after discontinuation, with clinically significant effects lasting 1–3 months or longer. Clinicians should monitor for ongoing adverse effects and drug interactions during this period and adjust concomitant medications as needed.

### Effects of dronedarone started rapidly after amiodarone discontinuation [^111DPb7Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple studies have shown that amiodarone is effective in treating atrial fibrillation (AF), but is associated with a relatively high incidence of side effects; however, due to amiodarone's long elimination half-life (20–100 days), physicians may hesitate to start other drugs until it has fully cleared.

Hypothesis

A rapid switch from amiodarone to dronedarone is feasible.

Methods

EURIDIS and ADONIS were double-blind, multinational, parallel-group trials comparing the efficacy and safety of dronedarone with placebo over 12 months. This retrospective subanalysis of EURIDIS/ADONIS compared the effects of dronedarone in patients discontinuing amiodarone within 2 days before randomization ("rapid switch") with results in patients who had received no amiodarone during the 2 months preceding randomization.

Results

In total, 1237 patients were enrolled ("rapid switch", n = 154; "no amiodarone", n = 1014). In both the "rapid switch" and the "no amiodarone" groups, dronedarone users had significantly lower AF recurrence than patients receiving placebo (HR = 0.64, 95% CI, 0.44–0.95; P = 0.0224 and HR = 0.79, 95% CI, 0.67–0.92; P = 0.0027, respectively). Dronedarone users had a higher incidence of bradyarrhythmic events than placebo-treated patients. A "rapid switch" from amiodarone to dronedarone was associated with a higher incidence of serious heart failure events and heart failure hospitalizations versus all other groups. Overall event rates were low and there was no significant difference in total adverse event rates or deaths between groups.

Conclusion

In this patient population, a switch from amiodarone to dronedarone within a 2-day time frame might be feasible in certain patient categories, but further investigation is warranted.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

There is no well-established relationship between plasma concentration and effectiveness, but it does appear that concentrations much below 1 mg/L are often ineffective and that levels above 2.5 mg/L are generally not needed. Plasma-concentration measurements can be used to identify patients whose levels are unusually low, and who might benefit from a dose increase, or unusually high, and who might have dosage reduction in the hope of minimizing side effects.

Effects on abnormal rhythms are not seen before 2 to 3 days and usually require 1 to 3 weeks, even when a loading dose is used. There may be a continued increase in effect for longer periods still. There is evidence that the time to effect is shorter when a loading-dose regimen is used.

Consistent with the slow rate of elimination, antiarrhythmic effects persist for weeks or months after amiodarone hydrochloride is discontinued, but the time of recurrence is variable and unpredictable. In general, when the drug is resumed after recurrence of the arrhythmia, control is established relatively rapidly compared to the initial response, presumably because tissue stores were not wholly depleted.

### Amiodarone after surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation: is it really necessary? A prospective randomized controlled trial [^11142CQA]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Prophylactic antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment is a well-established practice after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF), but it is controversial after surgical ablation. This prospective randomized controlled trial examined whether amiodarone after surgical ablation reduced atrial arrhythmia recurrence within the first 3 months after surgery.

Methods

Ninety patients were randomized to receive (n = 45) or not receive (n = 45) amiodarone after surgical ablation. Rhythm status was ascertained via clinical follow-up and 72-hour continuous monitoring at 6 and 12 weeks, using Heart Rhythm Society guidelines. Primary outcome was defined as atrial arrhythmia recurrence, cardioversion, ablation, or crossover from no-amiodarone to amiodarone as a result of atrial arrhythmia during follow-up. An intention-to-treat approach was used.

Results

The 2 study groups were similar in traditional predictors for failure, including left atrium size (5.0 vs 5.1 cm, P = 0.734), median AF duration (23 vs 20 months, P = 0.513), and long-standing persistent AF (44% vs 33%, P = 0.280). The primary outcome occurred in 52% of the no-amiodarone group (23 of 44) and 19% of the amiodarone group (8 of 43; P = 0.001). Cumulative freedom from primary outcome was greater in the amiodarone group (81.4% vs 47.7%, P < .001). Amiodarone was discontinued in 18 patients randomized to amiodarone for side effects, bradycardia, or noncompliance.

Conclusions

Prophylactic amiodarone reduced early atrial arrhythmia recurrence. These results are consistent with catheter AF ablation findings and should inform recommendations for prophylactic class I/III AAD after surgical AF ablation, regardless of discharge rhythm status. As previously recommended, monitoring for side effects and amiodarone discontinuation by 3 months, for patients in sinus rhythm, is warranted.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^116FNwa9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Because of amiodarone's long half-life, expect drug interactions to persist for weeks to months after discontinuation of amiodarone.

Drug interactions with amiodarone are described in Table 1 below.

Avoid coadministration of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmics and drugs known to prolong the QT interval. (7)
Amiodarone is a substrate for CYP3A and CYP2C8, so inhibitors and inducers affect amiodarone exposure. (7)
Amiodarone inhibits P-glycoprotein and CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A, increasing exposure to other drugs. (7)

### 2019 HRS / EHRA / APHRS / LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias [^114oLDKJ]. Heart Rhythm (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Close follow-up of patients after VT catheter ablation is critically important because complications can be detected and addressed during this period, and decisions regarding postprocedure management are made. These decisions relate to whether to perform NIPS, whether to maintain the patient on an AAD, and how to best program and follow ICDs in patients with such devices.

Another important decision after VT catheter ablation is whether to maintain a patient on an AAD, and if so, what medication to choose and for what duration. No RCTs have specifically addressed these issues, and RCTs of VT catheter ablation implemented different protocols related to postprocedure use of AADs (Table 9). In 3 clinical trials of VT catheter ablation, preablation AADs (mostly amiodarone) were continued either for 3 to 6 months or for an unspecified period of time. In 3 other clinical trials of VT ablation, the use of AADs post-VT catheter ablation was either discouraged or left to the discretion of the treating physician. In the SMASH-VT trial, no patient received an AAD (other than beta blockers) before the primary endpoint was reached. Given this variability in the use of AADs post-VT ablation in prior RCTs, there is no standard of care for their use in this scenario; as such, decisions in this regard should be individualized based on patient characteristics and findings of the PES at the end of the VT catheter ablation (or later), keeping in mind the toxicities of these medications and their potential detrimental effects on survival. In particular, given its toxicities, many favor discontinuing amiodarone after ablation. In fact, amiodarone use had decreased in several prospective cohort studies of VT ablation, and dose reduction or discontinuation had been feasible in patients who were not inducible post ablation in 1 single-center experience.

### Continuous vs episodic prophylactic treatment with amiodarone for the prevention of atrial fibrillation: a randomized trial [^116fjBXm]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Amiodarone effectively suppresses atrial fibrillation but causes many adverse events.

Objective

To compare major events in patients randomized to receive episodic amiodarone treatment with those who received continuous amiodarone treatment while still aiming to prevent atrial fibrillation.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized trial of 209 ambulatory patients with recurrent symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation, conducted from December 2002 through March 2007 at 7 Dutch medical centers.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either episodic or continuous amiodarone treatment after electrical cardioversion following amiodarone loading. Episodic amiodarone treatment was discontinued after a month of sinus rhythm and reinitiated if atrial fibrillation relapsed (1 month peri-electrical cardioversion). In the continuous treatment group amiodarone was maintained throughout.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary end point was a composite of amiodarone and underlying heart disease-related major events. The secondary end points were all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Results

After a median follow-up of 2.1 years (range, 0.4–2.5 years), 51 (48%) of those receiving episodic treatment vs 64 (62%) receiving continuous treatment had sinus rhythm (P = 0.05). There were 85 atrial fibrillation recurrences (80%) among the episodic treatment group vs 56 (54%) in the continuous treatment group (P < .001). No significant difference existed in the incidence of the primary composite end point between each group (37 [35%] episodic vs 34 [33%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] -10.2 to 10.6). However, there were nonstatistically significant differences in the incidence of amiodarone-related major events (20 [19%] episodic vs 25 [24%] continuous; incidence rate difference, -2.0; 95% CI, -8.7 to 4.6) and underlying heart disease-related major events (17 [16%] episodic vs 9 [9%] continuous; incidence rate difference, 3.6; 95% CI, -1.6 to 8.7). All-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations were higher among those receiving episodic treatment (56 [53%] vs 35 [34%], P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In this study population, there was no difference in the composite of amiodarone and cardiac major adverse events between groups. However, patients receiving episodic treatment had a significantly increased rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence and a significantly higher rate of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^11344LQ9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Amiodarone is considered a class III antiarrhythmic drug, but it possesses electrophysiologic characteristics of all four Vaughan Williams classes. Like class I drugs, amiodarone blocks sodium channels at rapid pacing frequencies, and like class II drugs, amiodarone exerts a noncompetitive antisympathetic action. One of its main effects, with prolonged administration, is to lengthen the cardiac action potential, a class III effect. The negative chronotropic effect of amiodarone in nodal tissues is similar to the effect of class IV drugs. In addition to blocking sodium channels, amiodarone blocks myocardial potassium channels, which contributes to slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness. The antisympathetic action and the block of calcium and potassium channels are responsible for the negative dromotropic effects on the sinus node and for the slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness in the atrioventricular (AV) node. Its vasodilatory action can decrease cardiac workload and consequently myocardial oxygen consumption.

Amiodarone hydrochloride prolongs the duration of the action potential of all cardiac fibers while causing minimal reduction of dV/dt (maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential). The refractory period is prolonged in all cardiac tissues. Amiodarone hydrochloride increases the cardiac refractory period without influencing resting membrane potential, except in automatic cells where the slope of the prepotential is reduced, generally reducing automaticity. These electrophysiologic effects are reflected in a decreased sinus rate of 15 to 20%, increased PR and QT intervals of about 10%, the development of U-waves, and changes in T-wave contour. These changes should not require discontinuation of amiodarone hydrochloride as they are evidence of its pharmacological action, although amiodarone hydrochloride can cause marked sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest and heart block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hemodynamics

In animal studies and after intravenous administration in man, amiodarone hydrochloride relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reduces peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and slightly increases cardiac index. After oral dosing, however, amiodarone hydrochloride produces no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even in patients with depressed LVEF. After acute intravenous dosing in man, amiodarone hydrochloride may have a mild negative inotropic effect.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^111wLztb]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

### A randomized placebo-controlled trial of pre-treatment and short-or long-term maintenance therapy with amiodarone supporting DC cardioversion for persistent atrial fibrillation [^114SdYis]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

The efficacy of cardioversion (DCCV) for restoration of sinus rhythm (SR) in persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) is limited by a high relapse rate. Relapse may be reduced by amiodarone but no placebo-controlled trials of efficacy have been performed and the appropriate duration of therapy is unknown.

Methods and Results

In this double-blind study, 161 subjects with persistent AF were randomized to one of three groups-placebo (n = 38); amiodarone 400mg BD for 2 weeks prior to DCCV and 200mg daily for 8 weeks followed by placebo for 44 weeks (n = 62, short-term amiodarone); amiodarone 400mg BD for 2 weeks then 200mg daily for 52 weeks (n = 61, long-term amiodarone). Spontaneous reversion to SR occurred before DCCV in 21% (26/123) patients on amiodarone and none of the 38 patients on placebo (absolute difference 21%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 10 to 29%, P = 0.002). At 8 weeks following DCCV, 51% (63/123) patients on amiodarone remained in SR compared to 16% (6/38) taking placebo (difference-35% 95% CI: -48 to -18%, P < 0.001). At 1 year, 49% (30/61) patients on long-term amiodarone were in SR compared to 33% (21/62) taking short-term amiodarone (difference-15%, 95% CI: -31 to 2%, P = 0.085). There was no difference in adverse event rate or quality of life scores between groups.

Conclusions

Amiodarone pre-treatment before electrical DCCV for persistent AF allows chemical conversion in one-fifth of patients without altering the efficacy of subsequent DC conversion. Amiodarone is more effective than placebo in the maintenance of SR when continued for 8 weeks following successful DCCV. More patients taking long-term amiodarone remained in SR at 52 weeks, but more had serious adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy. Eight weeks of adjuvant therapy with amiodarone following successful DCCV may be the preferred option.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Amiodarone is considered a class III antiarrhythmic drug, but it possesses electrophysiologic characteristics of all four Vaughan Williams classes. Like class I drugs, amiodarone blocks sodium channels at rapid pacing frequencies, and like class II drugs, amiodarone exerts a noncompetitive antisympathetic action. One of its main effects, with prolonged administration, is to lengthen the cardiac action potential, a class III effect. The negative chronotropic effect of amiodarone in nodal tissues is similar to the effect of class IV drugs. In addition to blocking sodium channels, amiodarone blocks myocardial potassium channels, which contributes to slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness. The antisympathetic action and the block of calcium and potassium channels are responsible for the negative dromotropic effects on the sinus node and for the slowing of conduction and prolongation of refractoriness in the atrioventricular (AV) node. Its vasodilatory action can decrease cardiac workload and consequently myocardial oxygen consumption.

Pacerone prolongs the duration of the action potential of all cardiac fibers while causing minimal reduction of dV/dt (maximal upstroke velocity of the action potential). The refractory period is prolonged in all cardiac tissues. Amiodarone hydrochloride increases the cardiac refractory period without influencing resting membrane potential, except in automatic cells where the slope of the prepotential is reduced, generally reducing automaticity. These electrophysiologic effects are reflected in a decreased sinus rate of 15% to 20%, increased PR and QT intervals of about 10%, the development of U-waves, and changes in T-wave contour. These changes should not require discontinuation of Pacerone as they are evidence of its pharmacological action, although Pacerone can cause marked sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest and heart block [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Hemodynamics

In animal studies and after intravenous administration in man, amiodarone hydrochloride relaxes vascular smooth muscle, reduces peripheral vascular resistance (afterload), and slightly increases cardiac index. After oral dosing, however, amiodarone hydrochloride produces no significant change in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), even in patients with depressed LVEF. After acute intravenous dosing in man, amiodarone hydrochloride may have a mild negative inotropic effect.

Results

In total, 279 individuals initiated amiodarone treatment in the calendar year 2014. Of those, 17 were not euthyroid when starting amiodarone and were excluded from the study. The remaining 262 comprised the study's population. The mean age was 72.1 years (SD, 1.3), with a mean treatment duration of 2.2 years (SD, 0.26). The mean dosage was 193 mg daily (SD, 7.2), and 71% of the population were male (Table 1).

Baseline characteristics and reasons for amiodarone discontinuation.

AIT was diagnosed in 24 patients (9.2% (95% CI: 5.6%–12.7%)), of whom 20 were male (83.3%) and 4 (16.7%) female. It occurred after a median of 2.7 (IQR, 2.2–3.3) years, and the mean age at diagnosis was 66.0 years (SD, 4.7). The 5‐year cumulative incidence of AIT was 19.0% (95% CI: 11.9%–25.5%) (Fig. 1), and the highest yearly incidence, 9.8% (95% CI: 6.8%–12.8%), occurred during the third treatment year (Table 2). Increasing age reduced the cumulative incidence of AIT, HR 0.46 (95% CI: 0.32–0.66), whereas a higher dose of amiodarone increased it, HR 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1–3.5). Gender had a neutral effect, HR 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4–4.0).

Amiodarone and sotalol — ventricular arrhythmia suppression and outcomes: Amiodarone blocks potassium repolarization currents and can inhibit or terminate ventricular arrhythmias, but the overall long-term survival benefit is controversial and the SCD-HeFT trial showed no survival benefit compared with placebo; chronic administration carries complex drug interactions and multi-organ adverse effects, with longer duration and higher dose increasing the likelihood of discontinuance. Sotalol is effective in suppressing ventricular arrhythmias but has greater proarrhythmic effects and has not been shown to provide a clear increase in survival; worsening ventricular arrhythmias occur in 2% to 4% of treated patients.

### Amiodarone therapy for atrial rhythm control: insights gained from a single center experience [^111JhZKr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone has been advocated as an effective "long-term" therapy for atrial rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to assess the sustainability of this therapeutic strategy.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-center cohort (n = 168) with symptomatic AF who were treated with amiodarone and followed for 3 years. The incidence of amiodarone cessation was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years and attributed principally to drug inefficacy, intolerance, or toxicity. A gradual diminution in the number of patients on therapy was observed, such that by 3 years, only 45% remained. This was attributable to inefficacy (25%), intolerance (12%), or toxicity (18%). Pulmonary toxicity was surprisingly common, occurring in at least 7% of patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the notion of amiodarone as a reasonable "destination" therapy for AF.

Elimination

Following single dose administration in 12 healthy subjects, amiodarone hydrochloride exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics with a mean apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life of 58 days (range 15 to 142 days) for amiodarone and 36 days (range 14 to 75 days) for the active metabolite (DEA). In patients, following discontinuation of chronic oral therapy, amiodarone hydrochloride has been shown to have a biphasic elimination with an initial 50% reduction of plasma levels after 2.5 to 10 days. A much slower terminal plasma-elimination phase shows a half-life of the parent compound ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days and most patients in the 40- to 55-day range. In the absence of a loading-dose period, steady-state plasma concentrations, at constant oral dosing, would therefore be reached between 130 and 535 days, with an average of 265 days. For the metabolite, the mean plasma-elimination half-life was approximately 61 days. These data probably reflect an initial elimination of drug from well-perfused tissue (the 2.5- to 10-day half-life phase), followed by a terminal phase representing extremely slow elimination from poorly perfused tissue compartments such as fat.

The considerable inter-subject variation in both phases of elimination, as well as uncertainty as to what compartment is critical to drug effect, requires attention to individual responses once arrhythmia control is achieved with loading doses because the correct maintenance dose is determined, in part, by the elimination rates. Individualize maintenance doses of Pacerone tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

Metabolism

Amiodarone is metabolized to DEA by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme group, specifically CYP3A and CYP2C8. The CYP3A isoenzyme is present in both the liver and intestines. In vitro, amiodarone and DEA exhibit a potential to inhibit CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP2C8. Amiodarone and DEA have also a potential to inhibit some transporters such as P-glycoprotein and organic cation transporter (OCT2).

Excretion

Amiodarone is eliminated primarily by hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion and there is negligible excretion of amiodarone or DEA in urine. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.

Distribution

Amiodarone hydrochloride is highly protein-bound (approximately 96%). Amiodarone hydrochloride has a very large but variable volume of distribution, averaging about 60 L/kg, because of extensive accumulation in various sites, especially adipose tissue and highly perfused organs, such as the liver, lung, and spleen.

One major metabolite of amiodarone hydrochloride, DEA, has been identified in man; it accumulates to an even greater extent in almost all tissues. No data are available on the activity of DEA in humans, but in animals, it has significant electrophysiologic and antiarrhythmic effects generally similar to amiodarone itself. DEA's precise role and contribution to the antiarrhythmic activity of oral amiodarone are not certain. The development of maximal ventricular class III effects after oral amiodarone hydrochloride administration in humans correlates more closely with DEA accumulation over time than with amiodarone accumulation.

Elimination

Following single dose administration in 12 healthy subjects, amiodarone hydrochloride exhibited multi-compartmental pharmacokinetics with a mean apparent plasma terminal elimination half-life of 58 days (range 15 to 142 days) for amiodarone and 36 days (range 14 to 75 days) for the active metabolite (DEA). In patients, following discontinuation of chronic oral therapy, amiodarone hydrochloride has been shown to have a biphasic elimination with an initial 50% reduction of plasma levels after 2.5 to 10 days. A much slower terminal plasma- elimination phase shows a half-life of the parent compound ranging from 26 to 107 days, with a mean of approximately 53 days and most patients in the 40- to 55-day range. In the absence of a loading-dose period, steady-state plasma concentrations, at constant oral dosing, would therefore be reached between 130 and 535 days, with an average of 265 days. For the metabolite, the mean plasma- elimination half-life was approximately 61 days.

### A short-term, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dronedarone versus amiodarone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation: the DIONYSOS study [^116qRXEu]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

We compared the efficacy and safety of amiodarone and dronedarone in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF).

Methods

Five hundred and four amiodarone-naïve patients were randomized to receive dronedarone 400 mg bid (n = 249) or amiodarone 600 mg qd for 28 days then 200 mg qd (n = 255) for at least 6 months. Primary composite endpoint was recurrence of AF (including unsuccessful electrical cardioversion, no spontaneous conversion and no electrical cardioversion) or premature study discontinuation. Main safety endpoint (MSE) was occurrence of thyroid-, hepatic-, pulmonary-, neurologic-, skin-, eye-, or gastrointestinal-specific events, or premature study drug discontinuation following an adverse event.

Results

Median treatment duration was 7 months. The primary composite endpoint was 75.1 and 58.8% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively, at 12 months (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–1.98; P < 0.0001), mainly driven by AF recurrence with dronedarone compared with amiodarone (63.5 vs 42.0%). AF recurrence after successful cardioversion was 36.5 and 24.3% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively. Premature drug discontinuation tended to be less frequent with dronedarone (10.4 vs 13.3%). MSE was 39.3 and 44.5% with dronedarone and amiodarone, respectively, at 12 months (HR = 0.80; 95% CI 0.60–1.07; P = 0.129), and mainly driven by fewer thyroid, neurologic, skin, and ocular events in the dronedarone group.

Conclusion

In this short-term study, dronedarone was less effective than amiodarone in decreasing AF recurrence, but had a better safety profile, specifically with regard to thyroid and neurologic events and a lack of interaction with oral anticoagulants.

### Nexterone (amiodarone hci) [^114oV3x1]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to rats at dosages of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg per day (about 0.3, 0.7 and 1.3 times the human intravenous maintenance dose of 0.5 mg/min on a body surface area basis) during gestation days 8 to 16 (organogenesis). Maternal toxicity (manifest as reduced weight gain and food consumption) and embryotoxicity (manifest as increased resorptions, decreased live litter size and fetal body weights, and delayed sternal and metacarpal ossification) were observed in the 100 mg/kg group. The delayed ossification was reversible and related to decreased fetal weight. Fetal thyroid tissues appeared normal in all groups.

Nonteratogenic Effects

Very high concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone may be found in testes. An elevated follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone levels, suggestive of testicular dysfunction, have been reported in men on long-term amiodarone treatment.

While planning pregnancy after discontinuation of amiodarone treatment, consider the long half-life of amiodarone and its metabolite DEA.

8.2 Labor and Delivery

It is not known whether the use of amiodarone during labor or delivery has any immediate or delayed adverse effects. Preclinical studies in rodents have not shown any effect on the duration of gestation or on parturition.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

In a total of 1836 patients in controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 14% of patients received amiodarone HCl injection for at least one week, 5% received it for at least 2 weeks, 2% received it for at least 3 weeks, and 1% received it for more than 3 weeks, without an increased incidence of severe adverse reactions. The mean duration of therapy in these studies was 5.6 days; median exposure was 3.7 days.

The most important treatment-emergent adverse effects were hypotension, asystole/cardiac arrest/ electromechanical dissociation (EMD), cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, bradycardia, liver function test abnormalities, VT, and AV block. Overall, treatment was discontinued for about 9% of the patients because of adverse effects. The most common adverse effects leading to discontinuation of amiodarone HCl injection therapy were hypotension (1.6%), asystole/cardiac arrest/EMD (1.2%), VT (1.1%), and cardiogenic shock (1%).

The following table lists the most common (incidence ≥ 2%) treatment-emergent adverse events during amiodarone HCl injection therapy considered at least possibly drug-related. These data were collected in clinical trials involving 1836 patients with life-threatening VT/VF. Data from all assigned treatment groups are pooled because none of the adverse events appeared to be dose-related.

### Amiodarone discontinuation or dose reduction following catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia in structural heart disease [^112ofdfR]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to examine long-term outcomes in patients with structural heart disease in whom amiodarone was reduced/discontinued after ventricular tachycardia (VT) ablation.

Background

VT in patients with structural heart disease increases morbidity and mortality. Amiodarone can decrease VT burden, but long-term use may result in organ toxicities and possibly increased mortality. Catheter ablation can also decrease VT burden. Whether amiodarone can be safely reduced/discontinued following ablation remains unknown.

Methods

We studied consecutive patients undergoing VT ablation from 2008 to 2011, typically followed by noninvasive programmed stimulation several days later. Patients were divided into 3 groups by amiodarone use: group A-amiodarone reduced/discontinued following ablation; group B-amiodarone not reduced; group C-not on amiodarone at time of ablation. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared between groups.

Results

Overall, 231 patients (90% male; mean age: 63.4 ± 12.9 years; 53.7% ischemic cardiomyopathy) were included (group A: 99 patients; group B: 29 patients; group C: 103 patients). Group B patients were older with more advanced heart failure. Group A patients less frequently had inducible VT at the end of ablation or noninvasive programmed stimulation. In follow-up, 1-year VT-free survival was similar between groups (p = 0.10). Mortality was highest in group B (p < 0.001). Higher amiodarone dose after ablation (hazard ratio: 1.23; 95% confidence interval: 1.03 to 1.47; p = 0.02) was independently associated with shorter time to death.

Conclusions

After successful VT ablation, as confirmed by noninducibility at the end of ablation and noninvasive programmed stimulation, amiodarone may be safely reduced/discontinued without an unacceptable increase in VT recurrence. Reduction/discontinuation of amiodarone should be considered an important goal of VT ablation.

### Long-term maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with current symptomatic atrial fibrillation: amiodarone vs propafenone, both in low doses [^1175b5ov]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of amiodarone and propafenone when used for the prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with refractory AF.

Design

Prospective, randomized, single-blind trial.

Setting

Tertiary cardiac referral center.

Patients

One hundred forty-six consecutive patients (72 men; mean age, 63 ± 10 years [± SD]) with recurrent symptomatic AF.

Interventions

We studied 146 patients after restoration of sinus rhythm; patients were randomized to amiodarone, 200 mg/d, or propafenone, 450 mg/d. Follow-up clinical evaluations were conducted at the first, second, fourth, and sixth months, and at 3-month intervals thereafter. The proportion of patients relapsing to AF and/or experiencing side effects was calculated for each group using the Kaplan-Meier method. End point of the study was recurrence of AF or occurrence of side effects necessitating discontinuation of medication.

Measurements and Results

Of 146 patients, 72 received amiodarone and 74 received propafenone. The two groups were clinically similar. Of the 72 patients receiving amiodarone, AF developed in 25 patients, after an average of 9.8 months, compared to 33 of the 74 patients receiving propafenone after an average of 3.8 months. Twelve patients receiving amiodarone and 2 patients receiving propafenone had side effects necessitating withdrawal of medication while still in sinus rhythm.

Conclusions

Amiodarone tends to be more effective than propafenone in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with AF, but this advantage is offset by a higher incidence of side effects.

### Long-term comparison of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus amiodarone: eleven-year follow-up of a subset of patients in the Canadian implantable defibrillator study (CIDS) [^115mymRF]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is superior to amiodarone for secondary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death. However, the magnitude of this benefit over long-term follow-up is not known. Thus, our objective was to evaluate the long-term consequences of using amiodarone versus an ICD as first-line monotherapy in patients with a prior history of sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest.

Methods and Results

A total of 120 patients were enrolled at St Michael's Hospital in the Canadian Implantable Defibrillator Study (CIDS) and were randomly assigned to receive either amiodarone (n = 60) or an ICD (n = 60). The treatment strategy was not altered after the end of CIDS unless the initial assigned therapy was not effective or was associated with serious side effects. After a mean follow-up of 5.6 ± 2.6 years, there were 28 deaths (47%) in the amiodarone group, compared with 16 deaths (27%) in the ICD group (P = 0.0213). Total mortality was 5.5% per year in the amiodarone group versus 2.8% per year in the ICD group (hazard ratio of amiodarone: ICD, 2.011; 95% confidence interval, 1.087 to 3.721; P = 0.0261). In the amiodarone group, 49 patients (82% of all patients) had side effects related to amiodarone, of which 30 patients (50% of all patients) required discontinuation or dose reduction; 19 patients crossed over to ICD because of amiodarone failure (n = 7) or side effects (n = 12).

Conclusions

In a subset of CIDS, the benefit of the ICD over amiodarone increases with time; most amiodarone-treated patients eventually develop side effects, have arrhythmia recurrences, or die.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders**: use caution, as amiodarone can cause thyroid abnormalities, including hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.
- **Bradycardia**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest, especially in the presence of electrolytic disorders or concomitant use of antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes.
- **Conduction disorders**: use caution in patients undergoing surgery, as amiodarine may increase sensitivity to the myocardial depressant and conduction effects of halogenated inhalational anaesthetics.
- **Infusion site phlebitis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of infusion site phlebitis.
- **Interference with implanted cardiac devices**: use caution in patients with implanted defibrillators or pacemakers, as chronic use of antiarrhythmic drugs may affect pacing and defibrillation thresholds.
- **Peripheral neuropathy**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy.
- **Persistence of adverse effects**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks after discontinuation due to the long half-life of amiodarone.
- **Photosensitivity of skin, skin discoloration**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can induce photosensitization and cause blue-gray discoloration of the skin with long-term use.
- **Visual disturbances**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, and corneal microdeposits.

Amiodarone and liver injury

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug used in the treatment of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, including AF, which is associated with asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemical tests in up to 30% of patients after intravenous administration, or among those who use amiodarone long term. Symptomatic hepatitis or liver failure and cirrhosis from amiodarone is fortunately very rare (0–3% of amiodarone users), but the risk is higher for prolonged users and with high doses. In a meta-analysis of approximately 740 patients on low-dose amiodarone for at least 1 year, there were no statistically significant increases in gastrointestinal or liver-related adverse events compared with placebo. Amiodarone-induced liver injury includes steatosis and steatohepatitis and can be difficult to distinguish from NAFLD. Because amiodarone concentrates in the liver and has a relatively long half-life, amiodarone-induced liver injury can take time to resolve and may even become apparent after amiodarone has been discontinued.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Ventricular arrhythmia suppression — antiarrhythmic medications and comparative evidence: The most common antiarrhythmic medications used for suppression of VA include amiodarone and sotalol, while mexiletine, quinidine, and ranolazine are occasionally used. Amiodarone appears to be more effective than sotalol and has a low rate of ventricular proarrhythmia, but has an increased risk of medication-related adverse effects that lead to its discontinuation in many patients within 18 to 24 months from initiation of therapy. Data supporting effectiveness of sotalol for suppression of VA are conflicting, but given its more favorable adverse effect profile than amiodarone, it may be a better first-line antiarrhythmic medication in appropriate patients; however, sotalol is generally avoided in patients with a severely reduced LVEF < 20% due to its negative inotropic effects and the risk of torsades de pointes. In a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 674 patients with HF and ≥ 10 PVCs/h and an LVEF ≤ 40% randomly assigned to receive amiodarone (336 patients) or placebo (338 patients), there was no significant difference in overall mortality or sudden cardiac death (SCD) between the 2 arms.

Oral amiodarone is associated with a conversion rate between 15% and 40% over a period of 28 d. In a comparative study, amiodarone and propafenone showed similar rates (40%) in persistent AF averaging 5 mo in duration, and all amiodarone conversions occurred after 7 d, with responses between 1 and 14 d. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, visual disturbances, thyroid abnormalities, nausea, constipation, phlebitis with peripheral IV administration, and serious toxicity including death due to bradycardia ending in cardiac arrest.

### Nexterone (amiodarone hci) [^116DeVCQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

NEXTERONE should be administered only by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias, who are thoroughly familiar with the risks and benefits of amiodarone therapy, and who have access to facilities adequate for monitoring the effectiveness and side effects of treatment.

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone and its metabolite desethylamiodarone, the potential for adverse reactions or interactions, as well as observed adverse effects, can persist following amiodarone withdrawal.

5.1 Hypotension

Hypotension is the most common adverse reaction seen with intravenous amiodarone. In clinical trials, treatment-emergent, drug-related hypotension was reported as an adverse effect in 288 (16%) of 1836 patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Clinically significant hypotension during infusions was seen most often in the first several hours of treatment and was not dose related, but appeared to be related to the rate of infusion. Hypotension necessitating alterations in intravenous amiodarone therapy was reported in 3% of patients, with permanent discontinuation required in less than 2% of patients.

Treat hypotension initially by slowing the infusion; additional standard therapy may be needed, including the following: vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. Monitor the initial rate of infusion closely and do not exceed the recommended rate [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

### Severe ataxia caused by amiodarone [^112tyM2E]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Neurologic toxicity is an infrequently reported and under-recognized consequence of amiodarone, symptoms of which may include tremor, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, proximal weakness, and ataxia. The investigators report the rapid and complete remission of 4 months of progressively debilitating ataxia with the discontinuation of small-dose amiodarone in an elderly woman with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite the long half-life of amiodarone, her symptoms began to reduce after several days, and she was walking without assistance within 1 week. Wider recognition of this syndrome may avoid unnecessary and lengthy diagnostic evaluation and promote earlier neurologic recovery.

### Amiodarone versus placebo and class Ic drugs for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis [^114K7uPf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

This meta-analysis compared amiodarone with placebo and class Ic drugs for the cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), defined as lasting less than seven days.

Background

Despite the lack of trials that support its efficacy convincingly, amiodarone is widely used for conversion of recent-onset AF.

Methods

We searched Medline and EMBASE databases, as well as the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register for randomized trials on recent-onset AF comparing amiodarone to placebo or class Ic drugs. Data were combined according to a fixed effect model. The primary end point was the rate of conversion at 24 h. To study time-dependency of the drugs, efficacy at 1 to 2 h, 3 to 5 h, 6 to 8 h, and at 24 h was analyzed.

Results

We found six studies randomizing amiodarone versus placebo (595 patients) and seven studies versus class Ic drugs (579 patients). There was no significant difference between amiodarone and placebo at 1 to 2 h, but significant efficacy was found after 6 to 8 h (relative risk [RR] 1.23, p = 0.022) and at 24 h (RR 1.44, p < 0.001). Efficacy with amiodarone was inferior to class Ic drugs for up to 8 h (RR 0.67, p < 0.001) but no difference was seen at 24 h (RR 0.95, p = 0.50). There were no major adverse effects.

Conclusions

Amiodarone is superior to placebo for cardioversion of AF, and even though the onset of conversion is delayed, its efficacy is similar at 24 h compared with class Ic drugs. These results favor amiodarone as a reasonable alternative for patients with recent AF in whom class Ic and other, more rapidly acting antiarrhythmic drugs cannot be used.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^116HBQYm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone hydrochloride inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone hydrochloride-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing amiodarone hydrochloride and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Amiodarone hydrochloride causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2 to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Dofetilide 0.125mg [^113WDsTi]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The maximum recommended dose in patients with a calculated creatinine clearance greater than 60 mL/min is 500 mcg BID; doses greater than 500 mcg BID have been associated with an increased incidence of Torsade de Pointes.

A patient who misses a dose should NOT double the next dose. The next dose should be taken at the usual time.

Cardioversion: If patients do not convert to normal sinus rhythm within 24 hours of initiation of dofetilide therapy, electrical conversion should be considered. Patients continuing on dofetilide after successful electrical cardioversion should continue to be monitored by electrocardiography for 12 hours post cardioversion, or a minimum of 3 days after initiation of dofetilide therapy, whichever is greater.

Switch to Dofetilide from Class I or other Class III Antiarrhythmic Therapy

Before initiating dofetilide therapy, previous antiarrhythmic therapy should be withdrawn under careful monitoring for a minimum of three (3) plasma half-lives. Because of the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of amiodarone, dofetilide should not be initiated following amiodarone therapy until amiodarone plasma levels are below 0.3 mcg/mL or until amiodarone has been withdrawn for at least three months.

Stopping Dofetilide Prior to Administration of Potentially Interacting Drugs

If dofetilide needs to be discontinued to allow dosing of other potentially interacting drug(s), a washout period of at least two days should be followed before starting the other drug(s).

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation — trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

### Evaluation of deprescribing amiodarone after new-onset atrial fibrillation in critical illness [^113tts4X]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies have shed light on the continued prescription of inpatient medications upon hospital discharge, despite the original intent of short-term inpatient therapy. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic associated with significant adverse effects with long-term use, is commonly used for new-onset atrial fibrillation in critical illness (NAFCI). Although it is often preferred in this setting of hemodynamic instability, a prescription for long-term use should be carefully considered, preferably by a cardiologist. This study was conducted to evaluate the incidence of patients discharged on amiodarone without a cardiology consult or referral after being initiated on amiodarone for NAFCI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients newly prescribed amiodarone for NAFCI over a 2-year period. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who were continued on amiodarone upon hospital discharge without review by or outpatient referral to a cardiologist.

Results

Of the 100 patients who met inclusion criteria, 59 patients were prescribed amiodarone upon hospital discharge. Of these, 48 patients (81.4%) had converted to normal sinus rhythm with the resolution of critical illness. Of 100 patients, 23 received prescriptions for amiodarone upon discharge without a cardiology consult or referral.

Conclusion

Amiodarone was frequently continued upon discharge without referral to a cardiologist in patients initiated on this therapy for NAFCI. This may contribute to unnecessary long-term therapy, thereby increasing the risk for significant side effects, drug interactions, and increased healthcare costs. This study suggests that careful medication reconciliation through all transitions of care, including discharge, is essential.

### Persistent severe amiodarone-induced photosensitivity [^113fT5Zv]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, a benzofuran derivative, has been used therapeutically as an antiarrhythmic and coronary vasodilator in Europe since 1964. One of its commoner side effects is cutaneous photosensitivity; more rarely, after ingestion of the drug for around 12 months, a slate-grey or violaceous discoloration of sun-exposed sites may gradually develop. Both of these side effects usually resolve within 2 years of discontinuation of the drug. We now present a woman who developed both photosensitivity and a slate-grey discoloration whilst taking amiodarone; on discontinuation of the drug, the dyspigmentation gradually resolved, but the photosensitivity has persisted and the patient remains symptomatic more than 17 years later.

### Amiodarone hci [^115WEmNJ]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Amiodarone HCl injection should be administered only by physicians who are experienced in the treatment of life-threatening arrhythmias, who are thoroughly familiar with the risks and benefits of amiodarone therapy, and who have access to facilities adequate for monitoring the effectiveness and side effects of treatment.

Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T 4) to triiodothyronine (T 3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T 3 levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T 3 (rT 3) in clinically euthyroid patients. It is also a potential source of large amounts of inorganic iodine. Because of its release of inorganic iodine, or perhaps for other reasons, amiodarone can cause either hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. Thyroid function should be monitored prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction. Because of the slow elimination of amiodarone and its metabolites, high plasma iodide levels, altered thyroid function, and abnormal thyroid-function tests may persist for several weeks or even months following amiodarone withdrawal.

Hypothyroidism has been reported in 2 to 4% of patients in most series, but in 8 to 10% in some series. This condition may be identified by relevant clinical symptoms and particularly by elevated serum TSH levels. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Hypothyroidism is best managed by amiodarone dose reduction and/or thyroid hormone supplement. However, therapy must be individualized, and it may be necessary to discontinue amiodarone tablets in some patients.

### Safety of rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide in atrial fibrillation patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator [^111UTwFE]. Heart Rhythm (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug commonly used for treatment of atrial fibrillation. Drug guidelines mandate a 3-month waiting period before initiating dofetilide after amiodarone use. Whether patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can be rapidly switched from amiodarone to dofetilide is not known.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide is safe in atrial fibrillation patients with an ICD.

Methods

In this retrospective observational study, we assessed the feasibility and the short- and long-term safety of rapid switching from amiodarone to dofetilide in hospitalized atrial fibrillation with an ICD.

Results

The study included a total of 179 patients who were followed for 12.6 ± 2.2 months. All patients had drug initiation during hospitalization. Dofetilide resulted in successful cardioversion in 66% (118/179). Twenty percent of patients (36/179) required dofetilide dose adjustments in the initiation phase because of QT prolongation and decreased creatinine clearance. A total of 6.1% of patients (11/179) required drug discontinuation. The incidence of torsades de pointes was 1.1% (2/179) during initiation. One patient (0.5%) had self-terminating ventricular tachycardia at follow-up. No other significant adverse events were noted during follow-up.

Conclusion

Atrial fibrillation patients with an ICD can be rapidly switched to dofetilide after 7 days of discontinuation of amiodarone without significant arrhythmia-related complications. Prospective studies with large sample sizes, especially of women, should be performed to further validate these findings.

### Amiodarone induced thyroid dysfunction: a high cumulative incidence in a nationwide cohort study in Iceland [^116Nzegx]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The early onset of AIH has been demonstrated in other studies. The high incidence in the first treatment year raises the question of whether the transient hypothyroid period at the start of treatment could be prolonged beyond 90 days in some instances. Two placebo‐controlled randomized trials showed that more than 10% of patients have elevated TSH after 3 months of treatment, but not all required treatment. The 2018 European Thyroid Association guidelines recommend treating patients with overt AIH but evaluating ScAIH on an individual basis. Subclinical elevations are very common in amiodarone patients, and this field requires more investigations to aid in clinical decision‐making.

The main strength of this study is its completeness, including all individuals diagnosed with thyroid disease during the study period having detailed information on the subjects with clinical endpoints adjudicated with chart review that should give a fair estimate of true values. By gaining information through medical records, we were able to exclude coding errors influencing the results and made it possible to exclude abnormal thyroid function tests that were not related to amiodarone treatment. It made data about complications achievable and collected the actual dates and reasons for amiodarone discontinuation. The main limitation is the small sample size with relatively few cases, which limits statistical power, making statistical comparison difficult.

We conclude that 38.5% of patients taking amiodarone for 5 years or longer acquire thyroid dysfunction. The risk is continuous during this period, with the highest risk of AIH in the first treatment year and AIT in the third treatment year. Frequent monitoring with thyroid function tests should be considered during these high‐risk periods. The high cumulative incidence and the complications of AIT are reminders to use amiodarone with care and only when other treatment options are clearly inferior.

### Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction in children: insights from the THYRAMIO study [^114tepcz]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic agent according to the Vaughan Williams classificationthat prolongs the duration of the action potential of cardiomyocytes by blocking ions channels. While this agent is preferred over other antiarrhythmics for the management of supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia because of its efficacy, it triggers a wide array of adverse effects that affects, among other organs, thyroid.

Two properties of the amiodarone molecule explain its effects on the thyroid. First, each 200 mg pill of amiodarone releases 6 mg of free iodine into the circulation (compared with the 0.15 mg that is needed daily) and second, amiodarone bears a significant structural resemblance to the thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). Due to these properties, 20% of adults under therapy develop thyroid disorders, as amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism (AIH) or amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). AIH may induce the need for substitution therapy whereas AIT is more delicate to treat since it may favor tachyarrhythmias and lead to amiodarone discontinuation.

### First clinical experience with the rapid-, short-acting amiodarone derivative E 047 / 1 after cardiac surgery [^115a3HZC]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Amiodarone is very effective against a variety of dysrhythmias but has poor pharmacodynamic properties and many undesired side-effects. Its short- and rapid-acting derivative E 047/1 may circumvent some of these drawbacks. It is easier to titrate while retaining the high efficacy of amiodarone and may have acceptable influences on haemodynamics and cardiac conduction in patients who develop serious, destabilizing ventricular tachydysrhythmias after cardiac surgery.

Methods

Testing E 047/1 was performed prospectively in two consecutive phase II open, clinical studies. Out of 504 patients scheduled for surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery grafting and/or valve repair, 35 developed serious, haemodynamically destabilizing ventricular dysrhythmias (Lown 2-Lown 4b) after surgery and were treated with a 1 mg kg(-1) (pilot study, n = 15) or randomized to a 2 or 3 mg kg(-1) bolus of E 047/1, followed by a 1 mg kg(-1) h(-1) continuous infusion for 2 h (n = 10 in each group). Dysrhythmias, PQ, QTc intervals and haemodynamics using the thermodilution technique were evaluated for up to 24 h after drug initiation.

Results

At the time of final inclusion the patients had between 6 and 12 (or more) ventricular ectopics per minute. Within the first 2–3 min of application in the pilot trial E 047/1 induced a decrease of ventricular dysrhythmias to between 0 and 4 per min, a decrease that held for the duration of treatment. The area under the curve decreased from 434 (322, 855; median, quartiles) to 114 (9, 477, P < 0.01) events per hour. In the randomized trial, E 047/1 administered in either dose rapidly reduced ventricular dysrhythmias at least as effectively as in the pilot trial 565 (478, 701) to 33 (8, 238, P < 0.05) after a 2 mg bolus; 482 (339, 482) to 95 (13, 540, P < 0.01) events per hour after a 3 mg bolus. Approximately 4–6 h after drug termination, dysrhythmias reappeared in the majority of patients. In only three patients did the incidence of dysrhythmias return to inclusion criteria levels. In contrast to the pilot trial, in the randomized trial there was a slight increase of mean pulmonary artery pressure, central venous pressure and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure and a slight decrease of LCWI in both groups. E 047/1 did not cause QTc prolongation.

Conclusions

E 047/1 appears to be a safe alternative to amiodarone in the perioperative setting of cardiac surgery when serious, destabilizing dysrhythmias occur.

### Amiodarone hci [^111uBAQt]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

In a teratology study in which amiodarone was administered by continuous IV infusion to rats at dosages of 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg per day (about 0.4, 0.7, and 1.4 times the MRHD when compared on a body surface area basis), maternal toxicity (as evidenced by reduced weight gain and food consumption) and embryotoxicity (as evidenced by increased resorptions, decreased live litter size, reduced body weights, and retarded sternum and metacarpal ossification) were observed in the 100 mg/kg group.

Amiodarone HCl injection should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

Amiodarone and one of it's major metabolites, desethylamiodarone (DEA), are excreted in human milk, suggesting that breast-feeding could expose the nursing infant to a significant dose of the drug. Nursing offspring of lactating rats administered amiodarone have demonstrated reduced viability and reduced body weight gains. The risk of exposing the infant to amiodarone should be weighed against the potential benefit of arrhythmia suppression in the mother. The mother should be advised to discontinue nursing.

Labor and Delivery

It is not known whether the use of amiodarone during labor or delivery has any immediate or delayed adverse effects. Preclinical studies in rodents have not shown any effect on the duration of gestation or on parturition.

### Continuation of amiodarone delays restoration of euthyroidism in patients with type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis treated with prednisone: a pilot study [^114mB8fd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a destructive thyroiditis usually responsive to glucocorticoids. Whether continuation of amiodarone affects treatment outcome is unsettled.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the outcome of glucocorticoid treatment in type 2 AIT patients who continued or withdrew amiodarone.

Design

This was a matched retrospective cohort study.

Setting

The study was conducted at a university center.

Patients

Eighty-three consecutive patients with untreated type 2 AIT participated in the study. After matching with patients continuing amiodarone (AMIO-ON, n = 8), patients interrupting amiodarone were randomly selected in a 4:1 ratio (AMIO-OFF, n = 32).

Intervention

All patients were treated with oral prednisone. Patients whose thyrotoxicosis recurred after glucocorticoid withdrawal were treated with a second course of prednisone.

Main Outcome Measure

Time and rate of cure were measured.

Results

Median time to the first normalization of serum thyroid hormone levels did not significantly differ in AMIO-ON and AMIO-OFF patients (24 and 31 d, respectively; P = 0.326). Conversely, median time for stably restoring euthyroidism was 140 d in AMIO-ON patients and 47 d in AMIO-OFF patients (log rank, P = 0.011). In fact, AIT recurred in five of seven AMIO-ON patients (71.4%) and in only three of 32 AMIO-OFF patients (9.4%, P = 0.002), requiring readministration of prednisone. One AMIO-ON patient never reached thyroid hormone normalization during the study period. Factors associated with glucocorticoid failure were thyroid volume and amiodarone continuation.

Conclusions

Prednisone restores euthyroidism in most type 2 AIT patients, irrespective of amiodarone continuation or withdrawal. However, continuing amiodarone increases the recurrence rate of thyrotoxicosis, causing a delay in the stable restoration of euthyroidism and a longer exposure of the heart to thyroid hormone excess.

### US antiarrhythmic drug treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation: an insurance claims-based report [^113yj379]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present analysis suggests that there is at least some level of suboptimal guideline concordance for patients with and without structural heart disease (CAD/HF or no CAD/HF, respectively). This outcome appears to be driven by very high use of amiodarone in first‐line settings as well as the use of class IC agents (flecainide, propafenone) in patients with CAD.

The EAST‐AFNET 4 (Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention) trial supports first‐line use of AADs for managing AF. 15 Still, it is acknowledged that guidelines for the maintenance of sinus rhythm are based on Level of Evidence C, which obliges the clinician to be flexible in practice regarding both safety and efficacy considerations from variable levels of evidence. For example, in the pivotal AFFIRM (Atrial Fibrillation Follow‐up Investigation of Rhythm Management) First Antiarrythmic Drug Substudy, 16 amiodarone was found to be more effective at maintaining sinus rhythm than both sotalol and class I AADs, but the study did not assess effectiveness versus dofetilide or dronedarone. Serious adverse drug effects were uncommon within the 1‐year time frame of the primary end point of the AFFIRM substudy, although adverse effects that led to discontinuation of a drug were frequent. Amiodarone is associated with risk of complications (including cardiovascular and extracardiac adverse events such as pulmonary and liver toxicity), hyper‐ and hypothyroidism, photosensitivity, neuropathy, blindness, and a blue discoloration of the skin. 10, 17 Amiodarone initiation also requires loading, monitoring of respiratory functions, and repeated laboratory tests, adding to patient and healthcare system burden. In our analysis, amiodarone was the most used AAD in first‐line treatment despite guideline recommendations for other agents for most patients with AF. Alongside anticoagulation for stroke prevention and rate control considerations, this is consistent with findings indicating the persistence of this practice during the past 2 decades. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 An explanation for this observation and lower use of other AADs includes the legacy of the treatment 18 coupled with amiodarone's strong antiarrhythmic effects, specific risks associated with dofetilide and sotalol use, and potential cost considerations. 5, 19 Thus, patients treated with amiodarone in real‐world practice may reflect considerations of costs and time for drug loading even if resulting in an AAD recommendation outside the guidelines.

### Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders [^117NzRB4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders:

- **Definition**: Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran, is a potent antiarrhythmic medication that can alter thyroid hormone metabolism and may precipitate hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.
- **Pathophysiology**: Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders are caused by either deiodination, which releases large amounts of iodine that can impair thyroid function, or by direct cytotoxicity on thyroid cells by amiodarone or its metabolite.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients taking amiodarone ranges from 5% to 14%.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders include high cumulative doses of amiodarone, longer duration of treatment, a higher baseline TSH level, older age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), pre-existing thyroid disease (autonomous thyroid nodules or latent Graves' disease).
- **Disease course**: Amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is similar to iodine-induced hypothyroidism and typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. It can also lead to myxedema coma, severe bradycardia, prolonged atrioventricular conduction, peripheral edema, and severe muscle cramps. On the other hand, amiodarone-associated hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, presents with symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, muscle weakness, anorexia, restlessness, tremor, and congestive HF.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders is generally favorable. Most patients can recover thyroid function once amiodarone is stopped, but some may require long-term management due to persistent thyroid dysfunction.

### Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in adults with congenital heart disease – clinical presentation and response to therapy [^113dn8XU]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The development of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) can threaten the hemodynamic stability of adult patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Here, we describe the natural history and treatment response of AIT in this at-risk population.

Methods

We studied retrospectively all cases of AIT that occurred in CHD patients at our institution after a minimum of 3 months on amiodarone. Subjects were identified from the cohort of adults with CHD who were treated at the Mayo Clinic Adult CHD clinic between 1987 and 2009.

Results

We identified 23 cases of AIT: 7 were type 1, 13 were type 2, and 3 were undefined due to insufficient data. Most patients were symptomatic (17 of 23, 74%), with arrhythmia and weight loss as the most common symptoms. The majority (12 of 23, 52%) were initially observed; 10 patients (43%) were treated medically and 1 patient (5%) underwent thyroidectomy. Four patients from the observation group eventually required active treatment and 3 patients from the medical group required surgery. Asymptomatic patients tended to resolve under observation (5 of 7, 71.4%) rather than progress to active treatment (0 of 4) (P = 0.06). Discontinuation of amiodarone, AIT type, or use of perchlorate did not impact AIT duration.

Conclusion

AIT in CHD patients exhibits a wide range of severity and sensitivity to medical therapy. Asymptomatic patients display a trend toward AIT resolution with observation alone. Amiodarone continuation does not appear to impact management outcome or disease duration. Additional studies in this high-risk population could identify elements of pathophysiology that would point toward better disease prevention and treatment.

Our review of submitted postmarketing adverse event reports found that patients can develop a serious and life-threatening symptomatic bradycardia when either Harvoni or Sovaldi combined with another direct-acting antiviral is taken together with amiodarone. The reports included the death of one patient due to cardiac arrest and three patients requiring placement of a pacemaker to regulate their heart rhythms. The other patients recovered after discontinuing either the hepatitis C drugs or amiodarone, or both. The cause of these events could not be determined. Information about this serious risk of bradycardia has been added to the.

More Info for Health Care Professionals
- Postmarketing cases of serious and life-threatening symptomatic bradycardia, as well as one fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker insertion, have been reported when amiodarone is given with either Harvoni or Sovaldi combined with another hepatitis C drug, such as daclatasvir, an investigational direct acting antiviral, or Olysio. Data Summary FDA reviewed post-marketing reports of bradycardia submitted by the manufacturer Gilead Sciences and from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database. Reports included the use of amiodarone with either Harvoni or Sovaldi in combination with other direct-acting antivirals, such as investigational drug daclatasvir or Olysio.

Six of the 9 patients experienced symptomatic bradycardia within the first 24 hours, and the remaining 3 patients experienced it within the first 2 to12 days following hepatitis C treatment initiation. One patient had a fatal outcome due to cardiac arrest, and 3 patients required pacemaker intervention. In 3 of the patients, rechallenge with hepatitis C treatment in the setting of continued amiodarone therapy resulted in recurrence of symptomatic bradycardia. In one patient, discontinuation of amiodarone followed by rechallenge with hepatitis C treatment after 8 weeks did not result in recurrent bradycardia. Drug Safety Communication.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^114cKj3S]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Amiodarone for ventricular tachycardia in pregnancy — the registry frequency, fetal effects, and management recommendations emphasize monitoring and minimizing exposure. The ROPAC database reported the use of amiodarone in 7.1% of cases of VT in the setting of maternal heart disease. The most common fetal complication is fetal hypothyroidism, which is typically transient and effectively treated with short-term therapy, therefore fetal monitoring for signs of clinical hypothyroidism is necessary. Amiodarone also has potential for direct neurotoxicity with possible neurodevelopmental abnormalities, and dose and duration of amiodarone therapy should be minimized as much as possible.

### Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction [^1116srL1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Reintroduction of amiodarone in patients with a history of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is rarely used. To date, the risk of AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is unpredicted. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of AIT recurrence. Retrospectively, from 2000 to 2011, all euthyroid patients with a history of AIT with amiodarone reintroduction were included. Type and severity of the first AIT, amiodarone chronology, and thyroid function evolution after reintroduction of amiodarone were investigated: 46 of 172 patients with AIT history needed amiodarone reintroduction. At first AIT episode, the mean age was 62.2 ± 16 years with male gender predominance; 65% of patients were classified as type 1 AIT. AIT recurred in 14 patients (30%), 12 patients developed hypothyroidism (26%), and 20 patients remained euthyroid (44%). Characteristics of type 1 AIT during the first episode, namely briefer exposure period to amiodarone and longer duration of treatment to normalize thyroid hormones, were predictive of AIT recurrence; 73% of patients (8 of 11) with previous episode of type 1 AIT, who did not receive a preventive thioamide treatment, developed a second episode of AIT. Thioamide preventive treatment could be useful to prevent type 1 AIT recurrence. In conclusion, AIT recurrence after amiodarone reintroduction is 4 times more frequent in patients with type 1 AIT history. Thyroid ablation before amiodarone reintroduction in patients with a history of type 1 AIT is preferred. Preventive thioamide treatment could be suggested in patients with type 1 AIT history pending for surgery.

### Clinical observations with the amiodarone / warfarin interaction: dosing relationships with long-term therapy [^1131Fa2J]. Chest (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

The interaction between amiodarone and warfarin has only been described in patients being followed up for relatively short time periods. The objectives of this study were to characterize the interaction between these two agents in a clinical situation over a longer period of time in a larger cohort of patients, and to determine the relationship between the maintenance dose of amiodarone and the resultant need to adjust the dose of warfarin.

Design

This was an observational trial of a cohort of patients receiving a stable warfarin regimen in whom oral amiodarone was initiated. Patients received both amiodarone and warfarin for at least 1 year, and the dosage of warfarin was adjusted as clinically necessary to achieve an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3. Data from a total of 43 patients were analyzed.

Results

At baseline, prior to initiation of amiodarone, the warfarin dose was 5.2 ± 2.6 mg/d. The magnitude of the interaction between these two agents peaked at 7 weeks, which resulted in a 44% mean maximum reduction in the warfarin dose. The warfarin dose inversely correlated with the maintenance dose of amiodarone (r(2) = 0.94, p < 0.005). Minor bleeding episodes occurred in five patients (12%). For patients receiving amiodarone maintenance doses of 400, 300, 200, or 100 mg/d, it is recommended that the daily warfarin dose be reduced by approximately 40%, 35%, 30%, or 25%, respectively.

Conclusions

The magnitude of the amiodarone/warfarin interaction is highly dependent on the maintenance dose of amiodarone. This relationship can aid clinicians in adjusting the dose of warfarin patients receiving long-term amiodarone treatment.

### Evaluation of the hemodynamic effects of intravenous amiodarone formulations during the maintenance phase infusion [^114sF2te]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Two of the excipients in intravenous formulations of amiodarone, polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol, have been shown to cause hypotension. A newer formulation of amiodarone, which contains cyclodextrin, is devoid of these excipients.

Objective

To evaluate the change in mean arterial pressure when utilizing 2 intravenous amiodarone formulations.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort analysis conducted at an academic medical center. Patients received intravenous amiodarone containing either polysorbate 80/benzyl alcohol (control) or cyclodextrin (cyclodextrin). Patients received these formulations based on a standard institutional protocol of 1 mg/min for 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min for at least 18 hours or until discontinued by the provider. All data were collected from the medical record and included changes in blood pressures, time to lowest systolic blood pressure, concurrent antihypertensive use, and number of patients requiring treatment for hypotension.

Results

A total of 160 patients (120 control, 40 cyclodextrin) were included. There was a statistically significant difference in mean arterial pressure between the groups receiving the control formulation of amiodarone compared with the cyclodextrin formulation across the 24-hour maintenance phase infusion (P < 0.001). There was a significant difference between formulations with regard to the change in mean arterial pressure during the 0- to 6-hour and 12- to 18-hour time blocks. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of patients receiving fluid boluses for treatment of hypotension (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

The excipients in the formulation of intravenous amiodarone may have a significant role in the hypotensive effects seen throughout the duration the maintenance phase infusion.

In our study, comparison of a drug versus placebo and the interaction between drug versus placebo and time made it possible to explore any potential time effect that is independent of any drug effect, as well as the time influence on drug effect (versus placebo). While the probability of ROSC at the time of hospital arrival decreased over time for amiodarone, lidocaine, and placebo, the rate of decrease was faster with amiodarone relative to placebo and lidocaine. The decrease in ROSC rate with longer time to placebo is likely attributable to early placebo administration correlating with shorter times for any intervention. In the majority of cardiovascular emergencies, the effectiveness of time‐sensitive interventions is dependent on the timing of administration and can affect clinical outcomes. In prolonged VF, ischemic injury may suppress myocardial function and prevent ROSC even after VF termination. The global myocardial ischemia precipitated by VF and antiarrhythmic drugs' adverse effects can lead to hypotension and bradycardia after VF termination. At shorter times after VF onset, the potential adverse effects of amiodarone (negative inotropic effect) may be blunted by its effectiveness in improving the probability of successful, durable defibrillation. Conversely, at later times, treatment with amiodarone might decrease the likelihood of ROSC potentially because of its adverse effects on hemodynamics. However, in the primary analysis of the ROC ALPS trial, there was no evidence of any overall decrease in survival at hospital discharge in the amiodarone group compared with placebo or lidocaine. This may be related to the efficacy of amiodarone in preventing ventricular tachyarrhythmias in the immediate postresuscitation period (refibrillation) or reversal of these transient adverse events. Similarly, the benefit of lidocaine in cardiac arrest most likely relates to its efficacy in minimizing arrhythmia recurrences, once an organized rhythm is restored by other means such as defibrillation.

### Amiodarone is safe and highly effective therapy for supraventricular tachycardia in infants [^111xnjeQ]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical effectiveness of amiodarone must be weighed against the likelihood of adverse effects. Adverse effects are less common in children than in adults, yet there have been no large studies assessing the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in the first 9 months of life. We sought to assess the safety and efficacy of amiodarone as primary therapy for supraventricular tachycardia in infancy.

Methods

We evaluated the clinical course of 50 consecutive infants and neonates (1.0 ± 1.5 months, 35 male) treated with amiodarone for supraventricular tachyarrhythmias between July 1994 and July 1999. At presentation, congenital heart disease, congestive heart failure, or ventricular dysfunction were present in 24%, 36%, and 44% of the infants, respectively. Infants received a 7- to 10-day load of amiodarone at either 10 or 20 mg/kg/d. If this failed to control the arrhythmia, oral propranolol (2 mg/kg/d) was added. Patients were followed up for 16.0 ± 13.0 months, and antiarrhythmic drugs were discontinued as tolerated.

Results

Rhythm control was achieved in all patients. Of the 34 patients who have reached 1 year of age, 23 (68%) have remained free of arrhythmia, despite discontinuation of propranolol and amiodarone. Growth and development remained normal for age. Higher loading doses of amiodarone were associated with an increase in the corrected QT interval, but no proarrhythmia was seen. There were no side effects necessitating drug withdrawal.

Conclusions

Amiodarone is an effective and safe therapy for tachycardia control in infancy.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^1137Z9YZ]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to rhythm control, pharmacological cardioversion, choice of agent, ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV amiodarone for pharmacological cardioversion in patients with AF, recognizing that time to conversion is generally longer than with other agents (8–12 hours).

### Safety, side effects and relative efficacy of medications for rhythm control of atrial fibrillation in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^1123U1Bi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC), atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, often poorly tolerated and difficult to treat. Limited data exists regarding safety or efficacy of drug therapy for AF rhythm control in HC patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients with HC followed > 6 months, treated with amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, or disopyramide for rhythm control of non-postoperative AF. The duration followed on each medication, reasons for discontinuing, and incidences of adverse events were recorded. Confounding factors including maximum ventricular septal thickness, age, left ventricular ejection fraction, and gender were assessed. Ninety-eight patients had 130 drug treatments (defined as a continuous time on 1 drug); 23 patients were treated with > 1 medication. The probability of remaining on a single antiarrhythmic drug at 1 year was 62% and at 3 was 42%. Maximum ventricular septal thickness (hazard ratio 1.05, p = 0.03) and presence of resting outflow gradient (hazard ratio 2.50, p = 0.002) were associated with discontinuation of therapy. Patients treated with amiodarone or sotalol had no serious safety events suggesting that these medications may be reasonably safe. Amiodarone was least likely to be discontinued for inefficacy (8.5%), but likely to be discontinued for side effects (19%). The probability of remaining on sotalol was 74% at 1 year and 50.0% at 3 and it was only discontinued for side effects in 2%. A small number of patients were treated with disopyramide and dofetilide. In conclusion, our data suggest that amiodarone and sotalol are likely safe, and that sotalol may be particularly attractive given its low rate of side effects and low rate of discontinuation.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^112jfcN2]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis — monitoring is advised: we suggest thyroid function tests before and at 1 and 3 months after initiation of amiodarone, and at 3–6 month intervals thereafter (RECOMMENDATION 90, 2/+00). Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurs in up to 6% of patients in iodine-sufficient areas and in up to 10% in iodine-deficient areas.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs-clinical use and clinical decision making: a consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on cardiovascular pharmacology, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and international society of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy (ISCP) [^114d8MrJ]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone — thyroid effects and monitoring during antiarrhythmic therapy are described as follows: Amiodarone is widely used and it interferes with thyroid function (because of iodine content), and treatment may result in elevation of TSH with increased T4/free T4 and decreased T3, so an increase in T4 alone does not constitute an evidence of hyperthyroidism; thyroid function tests should be evaluated at baseline and every 6 months during amiodarone therapy; positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are markers of risk for the development of amiodarone‑induced hypothyroidism (AIH); for AIH, stopping amiodarone or adding hormone replacement are acceptable strategies; in amiodarone‑induced thyrotoxicosis, amiodarone should be stopped.

### Arrhythmias after heart transplantation: mechanisms and management [^116FFq52]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 3.
Management of early or late atrial arrhythmia after HT. CAV indicates cardiac allograft vasculopathy; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; ID, infectious disease; and RF, radiofrequency ablation. Although rejection may underlie some cases of early AF, late AF or flutter is associated with rejection, significant graft vasculopathy, or secondary causes.

Most HT series report that after treatment of the initial episode of AF, the majority of patients are free of recurrent AF. Thus, prolonged antiarrhythmic drug therapy is generally not indicated. Standard antiarrhythmic drugs include amiodarone and less commonly procainamide and flecainide. Antiarrhythmic agents are rarely prescribed for > 3 months and the choice is narrow, especially because of increased risk of drug interactions in the heart transplant patient. Amiodarone may be used after HT but is associated with significant drug interaction with cyclosporine or tacrolimus, requiring close monitoring of immunosuppressant levels, which can become elevated. Because of amiodarone's long half-life, close monitoring of immunosuppressant levels is also required for several weeks after discontinuation of the antiarrhythmic drug. As in other situations, amiodarone is not a preferred drug for long-term use because of its side-effect profile. Dronaderone, because of its significant interaction with the calcinuerin inhibitors, is generally contraindicated in this setting. Rate control can be achieved with β-blockers and calcium channel blockers, but these should be used with caution because of risk of bradycardia and interaction with immunosuppressants, respectively. Adenosine should be administered only if strongly indicated and at low dose (3 mg, unless the patient has indwelling pacing leads) because of the risk of significant sustained bradycardia or asystole. Warfarin can either increase or decrease cyclosporine levels, and monitoring of both prothrombin time and cyclosporine levels is required on a more frequent basis. Anticoagulation in the early phase after HT is problematic because of the need to perform frequent endomyocardial biopsies. Patients may be maintained on subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin during this period. The recent availability of direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran) may represent a more feasible alternative because of rapid onset of action.

AF after HT, especially when occurring > 30 days postoperatively is a marker of higher long-term mortality rate. For this reason and because of the relative rarity of AF after HT, late AF occurrence should prompt evaluation for LV dysfunction, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, or acute rejection, as outlined in Figure 3.

### Hepatic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a patient receiving long-term low-dose amiodarone therapy [^116LPWDm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Much of the literature focuses on the toxic effects of this medication in the setting of rapid loading or long-term therapy with high maintenance doses. However, patients have been known to develop multi-organ toxicities with long-term low-dose therapy.

Case Report

We present a 90-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing low-dose amiodarone therapy for a period of 18 months without medical follow-up who developed signs and symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in association with hyperammonemia. Upon discontinuation of the medication and treatment of the hyperammonemia, the patient had a rapid decline in symptoms and a return to his baseline status.

Conclusion

Identifying toxicity early and correcting it rapidly may prevent life-threatening sequelae associated with amiodarone toxicity.

### Amiodarone use and all-cause mortality in patients with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device [^111rMfYi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone Use After LVAD Implant

Among patients in the amiodarone group, the drug was continued after LVAD implantation in 70%. In patients not on amiodarone, it was started after LVAD implantation in 36%. All‐cause mortality based on before and after LVAD implantation amiodarone status is depicted in Figure 2. Patients in the amiodarone group who were continued on it after LVAD implantation had higher rates of all‐cause mortality compared with those in whom it was discontinued (log‐rank P = 0.03; Figure 2). Interestingly, patients with amiodarone use before LVAD implantation had higher mortality rates compared with those in whom amiodarone was started after LVAD implantation. Following LVAD implantation, patients in the amiodarone group continued to have a higher incidence of VA (51% versus 37%, P = 0.003; Table 2), but all‐cause and cardiac hospitalizations and incidence of AA were comparable between the groups.

Predictors of Mortality

On multivariable Cox regression analysis accounting for age, baseline comorbidities, type of cardiac implantable electronic device, before LVAD VAs, and use of other antiarrhythmic medications, amiodarone use at baseline was the only variable that was independently associated with all‐cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.68 [95% CI, 1.1–2.5]; P = 0.01; Table 3).
