## Question

pediatric lab workup for abdominal pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the pediatric lab workup for abdominal pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to stratify the presentation into acute versus chronic and identify red flags. Then, I should verify which core labs are universally indicated and which are targeted based on the differential. Next, I will examine the role and limitations of CBC, inflammatory markers, and pancreatitis enzymes. After that, I need to check age- and sex-specific additions such as pregnancy testing and STI screening. Finally, I will integrate imaging stewardship and synthesize a practical algorithm, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus uncertain.

> Let me first confirm the foundational approach: most pediatric abdominal pain is benign and self-limited, so I should avoid reflexive broad testing and anchor on history, exam, and targeted labs, reserving imaging for selected cases and using ultrasound first to minimize radiation exposure [^85c06970] [^88e1d68e].

> I will now examine the initial triage into acute versus chronic and screen for alarm features, because this determines the breadth of the workup. Acute pain is less than about 2 weeks, whereas chronic or recurrent pain spans months; alarm signs such as weight loss, GI bleeding, persistent fever, jaundice, localized rigidity, or bilious vomiting push me toward more aggressive evaluation and imaging, whereas their absence supports a conservative, watchful approach [^85c06970] [^d21b0141].

> Next, I should review the core labs that are reasonable in most children with acute abdominal pain. Wait, let me verify the essentials: urinalysis to assess for UTI or hematuria, a CBC to evaluate for leukocytosis or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to assess electrolytes, renal function, and glucose are commonly recommended. In adolescents, a pregnancy test is indicated when relevant, and CRP can be added when appendicitis is suspected, though I need to remember CRP adds limited standalone value early on [^85c06970] [^b87db431] [^031de284].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about CBC and inflammatory markers. I should double-check their diagnostic performance for appendicitis. Fever and rebound tenderness increase the likelihood of appendicitis, and a WBC less than 10,000/µL lowers the likelihood, but no single lab rules in or out appendicitis reliably; combining clinical features with labs and selective imaging yields the best balance of sensitivity and specificity, and CRP may be more informative after 24–48 hours of symptoms [^affc2d07] [^031de284].

> For suspected pancreatitis, I need to ensure I order the right enzymes and thresholds. Diagnosis requires at least two of compatible abdominal pain, serum amylase or lipase at least three times the upper limit of normal, or imaging consistent with pancreatitis; I should also obtain liver enzymes, triglycerides, and calcium in a first attack to evaluate etiology, and I should avoid ordering both amylase and lipase routinely because concurrent testing rarely adds value beyond lipase alone in the ED setting [^42bd0a22] [^867070b7] [^e6d054fc].

> Let me consider chronic or recurrent abdominal pain carefully. Functional abdominal pain is common and, in the absence of alarm features, does not require routine labs; however, if alarm features are present or the pain persists, a focused panel including CBC, ESR or CRP, fecal calprotectin, and celiac serology is reasonable, with the caveat that adding routine hemoglobin, ESR, and CRP to fecal calprotectin and anti-tTG may not meaningfully increase diagnostic yield for organic disease in all settings [^d21b0141] [^e4f012b4] [^37a768ea].

> I should confirm age- and sex-specific additions. In adolescent females, I need a pregnancy test and should consider STI testing when indicated, and I should maintain a low threshold for pelvic ultrasound given the prevalence of gynecologic etiologies; in younger children, I must remember that appendicitis is less common and presentations are atypical, so I should be cautious and correlate labs with serial exams and imaging when suspicion persists [^85c06970] [^b87db431] [^2d810538].

> But wait, what if the pain localizes to the right upper quadrant or I suspect biliary disease. In that case, I should add liver enzymes, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase to evaluate for hepatitis, cholecystitis, or obstruction, aligning with the anatomic differential and the principle of tailoring labs to suspected pathology rather than ordering a blanket panel [^ca81ec2a].

> I need to ensure I integrate imaging stewardship. Ultrasound is the preferred first-line modality for suspected appendicitis and many other intra-abdominal processes in children, with CT reserved for nondiagnostic ultrasound or equivocal cases; I should avoid routine abdominal radiography because it rarely changes management and exposes children to radiation without benefit [^88e1d68e] [^ff310e3f] [^28aadd1a].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it aligns with evidence. For acute pain without red flags, start with urinalysis, CBC, and BMP, add CRP if appendicitis is suspected, and layer in targeted tests such as lipase, liver panel, or pregnancy test based on the differential; for chronic pain without alarms, prioritize clinical diagnosis and reserve labs for those with alarm features or persistent symptoms; throughout, use ultrasound first and escalate to CT only when necessary to balance diagnostic yield against radiation risk [^85c06970] [^88e1d68e] [^d21b0141].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan acknowledges uncertainty and follow-up. Many children will not receive a specific diagnosis, and a minority will have persistent pain; in low-risk presentations, conservative management with clear return precautions and timely reassessment is appropriate, and I should communicate that additional testing rarely changes outcomes in the absence of alarm features or evolving findings [^8a70fada] [^d21b0141].

The pediatric lab workup for abdominal pain should be **guided by history, exam, and risk** [^85c06970], not routine panels. Order **CBC, urinalysis, and pregnancy test** when appendicitis, UTI, or pregnancy is suspected [^85c06970] [^b87db431]; add CRP/ESR, stool studies, or pancreatic enzymes only when indicated by specific concerns [^ca81ec2a] [^42bd0a22]. Avoid **routine labs** in stable, afebrile children with nonspecific pain, as they rarely change management [^8a70fada] [^e4f012b4]. Use clinical judgment and reserve imaging for persistent or severe cases [^88e1d68e] [^205718c0].

---

## Indications for laboratory testing

Laboratory testing is **not routinely indicated** for all pediatric patients with abdominal pain [^e4f012b4]. It should be reserved for patients with specific clinical features or risk factors, including:

- **Alarm symptoms**: Weight loss, persistent fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic severe diarrhea, significant vomiting, or growth failure [^e54cc008] [^d21b0141].
- **Localized or severe pain**: Particularly if suggestive of surgical conditions such as appendicitis or pancreatitis [^85c06970] [^42bd0a22].
- **Persistent or recurrent pain**: Especially if functional abdominal pain is suspected but alarm symptoms are present [^d21b0141] [^e4f012b4].
- **Specific clinical suspicions**: Such as urinary tract infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or pancreatitis [^85c06970] [^42bd0a22].

---

## Essential laboratory tests

When laboratory testing is indicated, the following tests are commonly recommended:

| **Laboratory test** | **Indication** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Complete blood count (CBC) | Suspected appendicitis, infection, or inflammatory conditions | - Leukocytosis suggests infection or inflammation [^affc2d07] <br/> - Anemia may indicate chronic disease or bleeding [^538d3404] |
| Urinalysis | Suspected urinary tract infection or renal involvement | Detects hematuria, pyuria, bacteriuria, and proteinuria [^notfound] |
| Pregnancy test (β-hCG) | Adolescent females with abdominal pain | Rules out pregnancy-related complications [^notfound] |
| C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) | Suspected inflammatory or infectious conditions | Elevated levels indicate inflammation or infection [^notfound] |
| Stool studies (ova and parasites, fecal occult blood) | Suspected gastrointestinal infection or bleeding | Identifies parasitic infections or gastrointestinal bleeding [^d21b0141] |
| Pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase) | Suspected pancreatitis | Elevated levels support diagnosis of pancreatitis [^42bd0a22] |
| Liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin) | Suspected hepatobiliary disease | Assesses liver function and detects hepatobiliary pathology [^401bb3aa] |

---

## Laboratory tests based on clinical suspicion

Additional laboratory tests may be indicated based on **specific clinical suspicions**:

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: CBC, ESR, CRP, liver function tests, and stool studies for occult blood and calprotectin [^f25dac09].
- **Pancreatitis**: Serum amylase and lipase, liver enzymes, triglycerides, and calcium levels [^42bd0a22] [^401bb3aa].
- **Metabolic disorders**: Serum ammonia, urine organic acids, and specific metabolic panels if suspected [^695fa488].
- **Sexually transmitted infections**: Adolescents with suspected pelvic inflammatory disease or sexual exposure [^d21b0141].

---

## Limitations and risks of laboratory testing

Routine laboratory testing in pediatric abdominal pain has several **limitations and risks**:

- **Low diagnostic yield**: Routine labs rarely identify the cause of nonspecific abdominal pain [^8a70fada].
- **False positives**: Can lead to unnecessary further testing, anxiety, and interventions [^notfound].
- **Cost and resource utilization**: Unnecessary testing increases healthcare costs and resource use [^eca6bff6].
- **Patient discomfort**: Blood draws and other tests can cause distress in children [^01f6c3e9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **targeted approach** to laboratory testing in pediatric abdominal pain:

- **American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)**: Recommends limited laboratory testing in children with chronic abdominal pain, focusing on CBC, ESR/CRP, stool studies, and urinalysis only when indicated by clinical features [^d21b0141].
- **North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN)**: Recommends targeted laboratory testing based on clinical suspicion, avoiding routine broad panels [^notfound].
- **American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP)**: Emphasizes clinical judgment and selective use of laboratory tests in the emergency department setting [^efd7d759].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Routine laboratory testing is not indicated** for all pediatric patients with abdominal pain [^e4f012b4].
- **Use clinical judgment** to guide the selection of laboratory tests based on history, physical examination, and clinical suspicion [^ca81ec2a].
- **Essential tests** include CBC, urinalysis, and pregnancy test when indicated [^85c06970].
- **Additional tests** should be reserved for specific clinical suspicions or alarm symptoms [^d21b0141].
- **Avoid unnecessary testing** to minimize false positives, reduce costs, and limit patient discomfort [^205718c0].

---

The pediatric lab workup for abdominal pain should be **individualized and evidence-based**, with testing guided by clinical suspicion and the presence of alarm symptoms. Routine laboratory testing is not necessary for all patients and should be avoided in stable, afebrile children with nonspecific pain.

Context

Evaluation of abdominal pain in children can be difficult. Rapid, accurate diagnosis of appendicitis in children reduces the morbidity of this common cause of pediatric abdominal pain. Clinical evaluation may help identify (1) which children with abdominal pain and a likely diagnosis of appendicitis should undergo immediate surgical consultation for potential appendectomy and (2) which children with equivocal presentations of appendicitis should undergo further diagnostic evaluation.

Objective

To systematically assess the precision and accuracy of symptoms, signs, and basic laboratory test results for evaluating children with possible appendicitis.

Data Sources

We searched English-language articles in MEDLINE (January 1966-March 2007) and the Cochrane Database, as well as physical examination textbooks and bibliographies of retrieved articles, yielding 2521 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they (1) provided primary data on children aged 18 years or younger in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis was considered; (2) presented medical history data, physical examination findings, or basic laboratory data; and (3) confirmed or excluded appendicitis by surgical pathologic findings, clinical observation, or follow-up. Of 256 full-text articles examined, 42 met inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Twenty-five of 42 studies were assigned a quality level of 3 or better. Data from these studies were independently extracted by 2 reviewers.

Results

In children with abdominal pain, fever was the single most useful sign associated with appendicitis; a fever increases the likelihood of appendicitis (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4–4.8) and conversely, its absence decreases the chance of appendicitis (LR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16–0.64). In select groups of children, in whom the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected and evaluation undertaken, rebound tenderness triples the odds of appendicitis (summary LR, 3.0; 95% CI, 2.3–3.9), while its absence reduces the likelihood (summary LR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14–0.55). Midabdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant (LR range, 1.9–3.1) increases the risk of appendicitis more than right lower quadrant pain itself (summary LR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.5). A white blood cell count of less than 10,000/microL decreases the likelihood of appendicitis (summary LR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17–0.30), as does an absolute neutrophil count of 6750/microL or lower (LR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.03–0.16). Symptoms and signs are most useful in combination, particularly for identifying children who do not require further evaluation or intervention.

Conclusions

Although the clinical examination does not establish a diagnosis of appendicitis with certainty, it is useful in determining which children with abdominal pain warrant immediate surgical evaluation for consideration of appendectomy and which children may warrant further diagnostic evaluation. More child-specific, age-stratified data are needed to improve the utility of the clinical examination for diagnosing appendicitis in children.

### Using quantitative methods to improve the diagnostic workup for abdominal pain in children [^eca6bff6]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. We applied quantitative decision-making methods to this process and sought to determine if their use provided measurable benefit.

Methods

After obtaining institutional review board approval, we recorded key elements of the history, physical examination, laboratory, and imaging evaluations along with the cost and the time spent in the emergency department (ED) for children presenting with abdominal pain. Initially, data were collected (group 1, n = 1366 patients) and then presented to the ED pediatricians. For subsequent patients, ED physicians received a sheet specific to that patient's age and sex reporting the most common diagnoses and the elements of the evaluation that had proven most useful (group 2, n = 624 patients). We compared the difference in length of stay and costs before and after intervention, between study groups, by age groups, and separately by sex using a 2-factor analysis of variance.

Results

The diagnostic workup cost less in boys aged 2 to 12 years after the intervention. In boys and girls older than 12 years, the cost trended lower.

Discussion

This study demonstrates that ED physicians equipped with specific information were able to complete their diagnostic evaluation of children presenting with abdominal pain at a lower cost.

### Acute abdominal pain in children: evaluation and management [^85c06970]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children is a common presentation in the clinic and emergency department settings and accounts for up to 10% of childhood emergency department visits. Determining the appropriate disposition of abdominal pain in children can be challenging. The differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain, including gastroenteritis, constipation, urinary tract infection, acute appendicitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, testicular torsion, and volvulus, and the diagnostic approach vary by age. Most causes of acute abdominal pain in children are self-limited. Symptoms and signs that indicate referral for surgery include pain that is severe, localized, and increases in intensity; pain preceding vomiting; bilious vomiting; hematochezia; guarding; and rigidity. Physical examination findings suggestive of acute appendicitis in children include decreased or absent bowel sounds, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing sign, and right lower quadrant rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory evaluation may include urinalysis; complete blood cell count; human chorionic gonadotropin, lactate, and C-reactive protein levels; and a comprehensive metabolic profile. Ultrasonography, including point-of-care ultrasonography, for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain in children is the preferred initial imaging modality due to its low cost, ease of use, and lack of ionizing radiation. In addition to laboratory evaluation and imaging, children with red-flag or high-risk symptoms should be referred for urgent surgical consultation. Validated scoring systems, such as the Pediatric Appendicitis Score, can be used to help determine the patient's risk of appendicitis.

### Evaluation of abdominal emergencies [^9985c86c]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Early primary assessment and abdominal examination can often be enough to triage the patient with abdominal pain into those with less severe underlying pathologic condition from those with more acute findings. A focused history of the patient can then allow the clinician to develop their differential diagnosis. Once the differential diagnoses are determined, diagnostic imaging and laboratory findings can help confirm the diagnosis and allow for expeditious treatment and intervention.

### Final comment… [^538d3404]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of abdominal pain in children has five components. The relative value of each component depends on the child's age and, in some cases, on the level of cooperation of the child and parents. The five components include the history, a physical examination, laboratory testing, results of imaging studies and response to empiric therapy. This approach is summarized in. LABORATORY TESTING The routine screening laboratory evaluation of abdominal pain in children includes the complete blood cell count with differential and erythrocyte sedimention rate to evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis and chronicity. Platelet counts are frequently elevated in inflammatory diseases. Urinalysis and routine urine culture are indicated. A sample to check the stool for blood is obtained during the rectal examination and the result is often confirmed with three additional outpatient sample cards used at home.

Since excessive undigested carbohydrates may contribute to abdominal pain, an empiric trial of lactose elimination or reduction of excessive juice intake is often appropriate. 5 Empiric trials of antispasmotic, anxiolytic or antidepressant medications are not indicated. Trials of antacids are rarely of value since symptomatic relief is limited to children with esophagitis, and compliance with a full course of therapy is rarely achieved. If the history and physical examination suggest the pain has a peptic origin, a trial of therapy with histamine H₂ blockers may be indicated before confirmatory investigations are started. The management of recurrent abdominal pain begins with the acknowledgement that the pain is real, that extensive investigations are not warranted and that the child must emphasize normality by remaining in school, continuing activities and resuming a normal diet. Psychologic evaluation and management will be necessary if the degree of incapacity persists.

In older children and adolescents, a component of recurrent abdominal pain syndrome is seen in cases of depression or panic disorder with a learned symptomatic conversion reaction and associated weight loss. The performance of laboratory tests with negative results may increase the level of anxiety in older children. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Abdominal pain is frequently reported in children with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. The pain, which typically occurs in the lower abdomen, is cramping in nature and increases after meals or activity. The pain is reduced by eating smaller meals, which contributes to the anorexia and growth impairment that occur in children with inflammatory bowel disease.

### Abdominal pain in children [^efde89e0]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is one of the most common reasons pediatric patients seek emergency care. The emergency physician must be able to distinguish diagnoses requiring immediate attention from self-limiting processes. Pediatric patients can be challenging, particularly those who are preverbal, and therefore, the clinician must rely on a detailed history from a parent or caregiver as well as a careful physical examination in order to narrow the differential diagnosis. This article highlights several pediatric diagnoses presenting as abdominal pain, including surgical emergencies, nonsurgical diagnoses, and extraabdominal processes, and reviews the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of each.

Chronic abdominal pain is a common problem seen by pediatricians and pediatric gastroenterologist alike. There should not be evidence of underlying organic pathology, with diagnosis based upon the Rome IV criteria. Although it frequently occurs, routine diagnostic testing is not always necessary. Providing assurance and helpful coping strategies is key in the management of chronic abdominal pain. Sometimes other expertise is needed when developing these strategies.

### Management of suspected appendicitis in children [^35f9bc6d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

Acute appendicitis is the most important cause of abdominal pain in children and is the commonest that requires emergency surgery. Prompt diagnosis, immediate referral and expeditious surgery should be undertaken to reduce the risk of a perforated appendix. The initial presentation may be atypical or be similar to another pathological process which makes the diagnosis extremely difficult. Risk assessment forms an important part in the management of these cases. We consider the difficulties in making the diagnosis including: (A) the pitfalls of clinical examination; (B) the usefulness of laboratory testing; (C) the relevance of clinical scoring systems; and (D) the controversial issue of imaging.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^205718c0]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Diagnostic stewardship is the effort to optimize diagnostic testing to reduce errors while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment. Originally developed with application to infectious disease, the concept is broadly applicable in emergency medicine where clinicians must balance the harms of overtesting with the dangers of missed diagnoses. Abdominal pain and appendicitis in children are canonical examples. Abdominal pain is among the most common reasons children present to the emergency department (ED), and appendicitis is the most common surgical cause. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis in children with abdominal pain can be dangerous and even life‐threatening, but overtesting is wasteful and sometimes harmful.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is generally confirmed by abdominal imaging. Ultrasound is the safest and most cost‐effective initial imaging modality in the evaluation of children with suspected appendicitisand is recommended by most guidelines. Ultrasound avoids exposure to ionizing radiation, which is particularly harmful to children. However, ultrasound is not always available around the clock across ED settings and is operator dependent, so nondiagnostic scans are common. Cross‐sectional imaging (computed tomography [CT] or, less commonly, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is typically obtained if appendicitis is suspected and ultrasound is either unavailable or nondiagnostic. Clinicians in emergency medicine rely on their expertise and experience as well as diagnostic tools like ultrasound and blood tests. In some cases, ED clinicians may have access to onsite surgical consultation or be able to observe such patients for serial abdominal examinations. These resources help clinicians to reduce cross‐sectional imaging overtesting while guarding against potentially dangerous delayed diagnosis of appendicitis. Using a statewide quality collaborative of diverse community, academic, urban, and rural EDs, our objectives were (1) to describe current practice patterns in use of imaging in the ED evaluation of nontraumatic pediatric abdominal pain and (2) to assess the associated rate of delayed diagnosis of appendicitis among those patients.

### Pediatric appendicitis [^31eb09de]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Appendicitis is one of the most common surgical pathologies in children. It can present with right lower quadrant pain. Scoring systems in combination with selective imaging and surgical examination will diagnose most children with appendicitis. Clinical pathways should be used. Most surgical interventions for appendicitis are now almost exclusively laparoscopic, with trials demonstrating better outcomes for children who undergo index hospitalization appendectomies when perforated. Nonoperative management has a role in the treatment of both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis. This article discusses the workup and management, modes of treatment, and continued areas of controversy in pediatric appendicitis.

### Recurrent abdominal pain in children [^d21b0141]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children is defined as at least three episodes of pain that occur over at least three months and affect the child's ability to perform normal activities. RAP is most often considered functional (nonorganic) abdominal pain, but an organic cause is found in 5% to 10% of cases. Further workup is warranted in children who have RAP and fever, vomiting, blood in the stool, more than three alarm symptoms, or a history of urinary tract infections. Physical examination findings that should prompt further workup include weight loss or failure to grow; jaundice; costovertebral tenderness or back pain with lower extremity neurologic symptoms; liver, spleen, or kidney enlargement; an abdominal mass; or localized tenderness on abdominal examination. Workup may include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, fecal guaiac testing, fecal ova and parasite testing, or urinalysis. Pregnancy testing and screening for sexually transmitted infections should be considered in adolescents or if there are concerns about sexual abuse. Abdominal radiography can be helpful for diagnosing obstruction or constipation. Abdominal ultrasonography identifies an abnormality in up to 10% of children with RAP who meet criteria for further workup, compared with 1% of those who do not meet these criteria. Functional abdominal pain is a clinical diagnosis and no workup is needed. Management of functional abdominal pain focuses on improving quality of life, reducing parent and child concerns about the seriousness of the condition, and reducing the disability associated with pain rather than complete resolution of pain. Although evidence is lacking for most pharmacologic treatments of functional abdominal pain, psychological therapies such as cognitive behavior therapy and hypnotherapy have been shown to be beneficial.

### Diagnostic accuracy of history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and point-of-care ultrasound for pediatric acute appendicitis in the emergency department: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^928e3128]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute appendicitis (AA) is the most common surgical emergency in children. Accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial but challenging due to atypical presentations and the inherent difficulty of obtaining a reliable history and physical examination in younger children.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine the utility of history, physical examination, laboratory tests, Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) and Emergency Department Point-of-Care Ultrasound (ED-POCUS) in the diagnosis of AA in ED pediatric patients. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis and used a test-treatment threshold model to identify diagnostic findings that could rule in/out AA and obviate the need for further imaging studies, specifically computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and radiology department ultrasound (RUS).

Methods

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS up to October 2016 for studies on ED pediatric patients with abdominal pain. Quality Assessment Tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used to evaluate the quality and applicability of included studies. Positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) for diagnostic modalities were calculated and when appropriate data was pooled using Meta-DiSc. Based on the available literature on the test characteristics of different imaging modalities and applying the Pauker-Kassirer method we developed a test-treatment threshold model.

Results

Twenty-one studies were included encompassing 8,605 patients with weighted AA prevalence of 39.2%. Studies had variable quality using the QUADAS-2 tool with most studies at high risk of partial verification bias. We divided studies based on their inclusion criteria into two groups of "undifferentiated abdominal pain" and abdominal pain "suspected of AA". In patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain, history of "pain migration to right lower quadrant (RLQ)" (LR+ = 4.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.59–6.44) and presence of "cough/hop pain" in the physical examination (LR+ = 7.64, 95% CI = 5.94–9.83) were most strongly associated with AA. In patients suspected of AA none of the history or laboratory findings were strongly associated with AA. Rovsing's sign was the physical examination finding most strongly associated with AA (LR+ = 3.52, 95% CI = 2.65–4.68). Among different PAS cutoff points, PAS ≥ 9 (LR+ = 5.26, 95% CI = 3.34–8.29) was most associated with AA. None of the history, physical examination, laboratory tests findings, or PAS alone could rule in or rule out AA in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain or those suspected of AA. ED-POCUS had LR+ of 9.24 (95% CI = 6.24–13.28) and LR- of 0.17 (95% CI = 0.09–0.30). Using our test-treatment threshold model, positive ED-POCUS could rule in AA without the use of CT and MRI, but negative ED-POCUS could not rule out AA.

Conclusion

Presence of AA is more likely in patients with undifferentiated abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ or when cough/hop pain is present in the physical examination. Once AA is suspected, no single history, physical examination, laboratory finding, or score attained on PAS can eliminate the need for imaging studies. Operating characteristics of ED-POCUS are similar to those reported for RUS in literature for diagnosis of AA. In ED patients suspected of AA, a positive ED-POCUS is diagnostic and obviates the need for CT or MRI while negative ED-POCUS is not enough to rule out AA.

### Imaging and laboratory testing in acute abdominal pain [^46e72c1a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

When discussing which laboratory tests or imaging to order in the setting of acute abdominal pain, it is practical to organize information by disease process (eg, acute appendicitis, cholecystitis). Because studies on the accuracy of diagnostic tests are of necessity related to the presence or absence of specific diagnoses, and because clinicians frequently look to tests to help them rule in or rule out specific conditions, this article is organized by region of pain and common abdominal diagnoses. It focuses on the contributions that laboratory testing and imaging make in the emergency management of abdominal complaints.

### Diagnostic imaging of acute abdominal pain in adults [^f9b82a48]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain is a common presentation in the outpatient setting and can represent conditions ranging from benign to life-threatening. If the patient history, physical examination, and laboratory testing do not identify an underlying cause of pain and if serious pathology remains a clinical concern, diagnostic imaging is indicated. The American College of Radiology has developed clinical guidelines, the Appropriateness Criteria, based on the location of abdominal pain to help physicians choose the most appropriate imaging study. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging test of choice for patients presenting with right upper quadrant pain. Computed tomography (CT) is recommended for evaluating right or left lower quadrant pain. Conventional radiography has limited diagnostic value in the assessment of most patients with abdominal pain. The widespread use of CT raises concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation. Strategies to reduce exposure are currently being studied, such as using ultrasonography as an initial study for suspected appendicitis before obtaining CT and using low-dose CT rather than standard-dose CT. Magnetic resonance imaging is another emerging technique for the evaluation of abdominal pain that avoids ionizing radiation.

### Undifferentiated abdominal pain in children presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^881b277b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Although common, little is known about the characteristics and management of undifferentiated abdominal pain (UAP) in the pediatric emergency department (ED). This study was a 12-month retrospective study for "abdominal pain" ED visits. Patients without an identifiable diagnosis were categorized as "UAP", while others with identified disease processes were categorized as "structural gastrointestinal diagnosis (SGID)". We included 2383 (72%) visits with 869 (36.5%) UAP visits and 1514 (63.5%) SGID visits. SGID patients had more laboratory tests (811 [53.6%] vs 422 [48.6%], P = 0.0186), and often had multiple tests performed (565 [69.7%] vs 264 [62.6%], P = 0.0116). Computed tomography and ultrasound scans were more common in SGID (computed tomography: 108 [7.1%] vs 27 [3.1%], P = 0.0004; ultrasound: 377 [24.9%] vs 172 [19.9%], P = 0.0044), and laboratory results (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, albumin, C-reactive protein) were abnormal at significantly higher rates. Analyses revealed the duration of pain as primary covariate in variance of pain etiology. Clinical features, such as duration of pain, may be augmented by laboratory tests to facilitate recognition of UAP in the ED.

### Comparing the evaluation of abdominal pain in adolescent females at a pediatric vs general emergency department [^c4b82ada]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to determine the rates at which gynecologic history and related exams are performed among adolescent females presenting with abdominal pain and whether the rates differ between patients seeking care at a pediatric compared with a general emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of female patients aged 12–21 years who presented to the ED for a chief complaint of abdominal pain at either a single academic children's ED or a single general academic ED during 2016. We examined differences in the rates of gynecologic history and related exams between institutions, before and after adjustment with inverse probability weights.

Results

A total of 837 females met the inclusion criteria for this study, and 627 patients were included in the adjusted analyses. Outcomes more commonly performed at the pediatric institution included documentation of contraception (28% at the general ED vs 43% at the pediatric ED, P < .001), sexually transmitted infection testing (32% at the general ED vs 42% at the pediatric ED, P = 0.04), and radiologic imaging (46% at the general ED vs 70% at the pediatric ED, P < .001). Outcomes that were more commonly performed at the general ED were pelvic exam (26% at the general ED vs 10% at the pediatric ED, P < .001) and complete blood count draw (67% at the general ED vs 39% at the pediatric ED, P < .001). No differences were observed between institutions in the documentation of menarche or sexual activity, the performance of a pregnancy test or CT scan, or the rate of subsequent ED/urgent care visits in the following year.

Conclusion

The rates at which gynecologic history and pelvic examination were performed in adolescent females presenting for abdominal pain at both a general ED and a pediatric ED were low and inconsistent. Providers should have a low threshold for testing for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy. Pelvic examination and diagnostic lab testing should be performed when indicated in the setting of a clinically appropriate history. These efforts would ensure adequate evaluation of adolescent women and reduce unnecessary health resource utilization.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^a46cddf8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal pain is very common presentation to emergency department. It is vital that the physician has an understanding and be familiar with the presentations of common diseases that cause abdominal pain. Patients with acute abdominal pain are a heterogeneous group that consumes a great deal of a surgical department's resources. To streamline efficiency and provide maximum cost effectiveness it would be of benefit to identify clinical and laboratory parameters in patients admitted with acute abdominal pain that would indicate no significant intra abdominal pathology and thereby encourage early discharge back to the community.

Women of childbearing age commonly present with right iliac fossa pain, most of them do not have appendicitis. Those who do not have the classical features of appendicitis with no evidence of peritonism on examination can be safely managed by active observation or diagnostic laparoscopy. This study was designed to identify the clinical and laboratory red flags. Recognizing these red flags in the history and physical examination and the initial imaging and laboratory findings helps to determine which patients may have a serious underlying disease process, and therefore warrant more expedited evaluation and treatment.

### What clinical and laboratory parameters determine significant intra abdominal pathology for patients assessed in hospital with acute abdominal pain? [^0035915f]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current study shows that patients who present with abdominal pain with no vomiting, guarding or raised white cell count are unlikely to have significant intra abdominal pathology and therefore can be considered for early discharge back to the community. Abnormal liver function test was helpful to point out the possibility of biliary colic, so was microscopic hematuria that may reflect urinary tract pathology.

Complaints of acute abdominal pain are common emergency department presentations. Many of these conditions prove to be benign and self-limiting illness, which has no clear explanation. Tenderness and peritonism in the right iliac fossa are not specific for appendicitis but may help to narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with right iliac fossa pain. However high WBC counts and left shift are strongly associated with appendicitis in children aged 1 to 19 years indeed for children older than 4 years with lower abdominal pain; the most common diagnosis in the setting of an elevated WBC count is acute appendicitis.

In females of childbearing age, the presence or absence of bilateral tenderness pain migration and vomiting may help to differentiate acute appendicitis from acute pelvic inflammatory disease where patients tend to have raised white cells count and demonstrate signs of peritonism, which can make the differentiation between the two diagnoses on clinical grounds difficult. Mesenteric adenitis is very difficult to diagnose clinically and commonly patients undergo treatment for presumed appendicitis.

Imaging such as ultrasound is helpful for detection of the cause of lower abdominal pain; in clinical centers where CT scan is routinely performed it reduces the rate of both negative appendicectomy and perforated appendicitis, whoever CT scanning has significant radiation dose for children and young adults and its not always practical or available. On the other hand elderly patients can have atypical presentations; vascular events are more common in this population, and a wide differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Test characteristics of common appendicitis scores with and without laboratory investigations: a prospective observational study [^01f6c3e9]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is the most common non-traumatic surgical emergency in the pediatric population, affecting an estimated 80,000 children in the United States annually, at a rate of 4 per 1,000 children under the age 14 years. Early diagnosis may decrease risk of progression to perforation, abscess formation and sepsis, which are major causes of childhood morbidity. Despite its high incidence, diagnosing appendicitis can be difficult due to the non-specific or atypical nature of its symptoms. Numerous scoring systems, such as the Alvarado score (AS), the Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) and Lintula score (LS) (Table 1) have been developed in an attempt to assist clinicians in recognizing which children presenting with abdominal pain are at greatest risk of having appendicitis. These clinical scores are based on elements of history and physical exam, with the vast majority of scores incorporating basic laboratory investigations including the White Blood Cell (WBC) and Neutrophil counts (NC).

Table 1
Alvarado score, Pediatric appendicitis score and Lintula score

Components based on laboratory investigation have been underlined

The use of the WBC count in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is subject to several limitations. First, children with abdominal pain often first present to care to a primary care provider or walk-in clinic where laboratory resources may not available. From the patient perspective, bloodwork causes pain, distress, as well as anxiety. In addition, the time required for completion of the WBC and NC may increase time to diagnosis and surgical consultation. Moreover, routine performance of these tests may lead to unwarranted health care costs. Finally, the reported sensitivities and specificities of the WBC and NC range from 60 to 100% and 20–53% respectively. Given the aforementioned limitations of the WBC and NC for the diagnosis of appendicitis, scores relying exclusively on clinical signs and symptoms may be of benefit. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity, specificity and predictive values (test characteristics) of the Alvarado Score, Pediatric Appendicitis Score and the Lintula Score in a pediatric emergency department (ED) setting, when calculated exclusively on clinical features.

### Prognosis of chronic or recurrent abdominal pain in children [^5eecd182]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic abdominal pain (CAP) or recurrent abdominal pain is common in childhood and is rarely associated with organic disease. With modern diagnostic technology, new organic abnormalities are found in children with CAP. Thus far a causal relation between these abnormalities and CAP has not been established. The additional prognostic value of extensive testing of children with CAP is a subject of debate.

Objectives

To investigate how often abdominal pain persists in children with CAP and to investigate whether medical tests such as laboratory tests, imaging, and endoscopy have additional prognostic value to history taking and clinical examination.

Materials and Methods

A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO for prospective cohort studies published from 1960 until October 2005. The most common medical key words for CAP were used in our search strategy. The methodological quality of studies was determined. Clinical heterogeneity between studies was analyzed. The percentages of children with abdominal pain after follow-up were pooled.

Results

The search yielded 2620 citations, of which 18 studies met the inclusion criteria. In total, 1331 children were followed up for 5 years (median, range 1–29 years). In total, 29.1% (95% CI 28.1–30.2) of patients with CAP had abdominal pain after follow-up. The prognosis of CAP diagnosed clinically was similar to that diagnosed after additional medical testing.

Conclusions

CAP persisted in 29.1% (95% CI 28.1–30.2) of children. In the absence of alarming symptoms, additional diagnostic testing did not influence the prognosis of CAP.

Abdominal pain is a challenging presentation in children. Examination findings and etiology vary greatly, spanning a vast spectrum from flatulence to frank peritonitis with septic shock. Here, we discuss a 10-year-old boy with 24 hours of progressively worsening lower abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. History and physical examination findings were consistent with appendicitis. However, physicians were surprised when the single-view abdominal radiograph showed an unanticipated, somewhat perplexing discovery.

### Standard outpatient re-evaluation for patients not admitted to the hospital after emergency department evaluation for acute abdominal pain [^318f658e]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Patients presenting with acute abdominal pain at the ED need to be diagnosed correctly and treated accordingly. As the majority of patients will have self-limiting pathology not requiring surgical intervention, most will not require an admission to the hospital. Patients with abdominal pathology requiring surgical treatment, however, should not be missed. To diagnose patients with abdominal pain, many diagnostic modalities can be used to complement the "basic" clinical evaluation of patient history, physical examination, and blood and urine analysis. Diagnostic measures such as US, CT, laparoscopy, and clinical observation have all been reported in the literature. Ultrasound, for example, can assist in the diagnosis of many gastrointestinal causes of acute abdominal pain, and its routine use by surgeons for such patients has been shown to increase diagnostic accuracy. Computer tomography has also been reported to increase diagnostic accuracy and reduce hospital admissions by 24%, and it is said to be the best predictor of the need for an urgent intervention. The use of cross-sectional imaging for all patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, however, is costly, time consuming, and, in the case of CT, exposes patients to ionizing radiation. The last issue is important as the growing use of CT is steadily increasing the collective dose of medical radiation to which patient populations are subjected. Even though the cancer risk from an abdominal CT is small for the individual, the increasing use of the modality may create a future health concern, especially for children. The indications for ordering a CT should therefore always be carefully scrutinized by medical personnel, especially when other diagnostic modalities can attain similar results.

### Heterogeneity in the evaluation of suspected MIS-C: a cross-sectional vignette-based survey [^71198b42]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) is an emerging complication of COVID-19 which lacks a definitive diagnostic test and evidence-based guidelines for workup. We sought to assess practitioners' preferences when initiating a workup for pediatric patients presenting with symptoms concerning for MIS-C.

Methods

In a cross-sectional vignette-based survey, providers were presented with clinical vignettes of a patient presenting with 24 h of fever from a community with high rates of COVID-19. Respondents were asked about their general practices in pursuing a workup for potential MIS-C including testing obtained, criteria for diagnosis, and timing to confirm or rule out the diagnosis.

Results

Most of the 174 respondents were physicians from the United States at academic medical centers. The majority of providers would not initiate MIS-C workup for fever and non-specific symptoms unless the fever lasted more than 72 h. Skin rash, abdominal pain, and shortness of breath were symptoms that raised greatest concern for MIS-C. Most providers would obtain COVID-19 PCR or antigen testing, plus blood work, in the initial workup. The list of laboratory studies providers would obtain is extensive. Providers primarily rely on cardiac involvement to confirm a MIS-C diagnosis, and establishing a diagnosis takes 24–48 h.

Conclusions

Significant heterogeneity exists amongst providers as to when to initiate the MIS-C workup, the order and content of the workup, and how to definitively diagnose MIS-C. A diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity for MIS-C and refined evidence-based guidelines are needed to expedite diagnosis and treatment.

### Pitfalls in appendicitis [^fb49f575]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of appendicitis is fraught with potential pitfalls, and despite its prevalence, appendicitis continues to be a condition at high risk for missed and delayed diagnosis. There is no single historical or physical finding or laboratory test that can definitively make the diagnosis. This article discusses the value of presenting signs, symptoms, laboratory testing, and the rational use of various imaging modalities, such as CT scanning and ultrasound. Challenges of special populations, such as children, the elderly, and pregnant patients, are also discussed. Although appendicitis continues to be a source of medical legal risk and misdiagnosis, a clear understanding of the strengths and limitations of all tests in suspected appendicitis can improve the emergency physician's diagnostic accuracy in this high-risk disease.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined using the recently released Rome IV criteria. These are not diagnoses of exclusion. If there are no alarm signs, the diagnosis may be made with a focused evaluation. Treatment of these disorders requires a biopsychosocial approach to the disorder and an individualized and multipronged treatment plan.

Pediatric blunt abdominal trauma imaging algorithms describe efforts to minimize unnecessary imaging, noting two recent multicenter studies that defined criteria for predicting children at very low risk for intraabdominal injury. The PECARN used history and physical examination alone to identify children at very low risk of intraabdominal injury requiring acute interventions, and Streck et al. used clinical data readily available in the trauma bay to identify children at very low risk for intraabdominal injury and for whom a CT scan is not necessary. The Streck et al. prediction rule, in descending order of significance, includes aspartate aminotransferase > 200 U/L, abnormal abdominal examination, abnormal chest radiograph, report of abdominal pain, and abnormal pancreatic enzymes. The Streck et al. rule had a negative predictive value of 99.4 percent for intraabdominal injury and 100 percent for patients with intraabdominal injury that required acute interventions.

GRACE-2 scope and purpose — intended population and setting specify an evidence-based, transparent approach for clinicians for the evaluation and management of adult patients with low-risk recurrent undifferentiated abdominal pain in the ED. The guideline is not intended for patients with unstable vital signs or significant history or physical examination findings suggesting acute abdominal pathology or other risk factors for severe abdominal disease, and it is also not intended for new, acute presentations with only short-term recurrence such as evolving appendicitis presenting on two or more occasions over a few days. The intended population includes adults with multiple similar presentations of abdominal signs and symptoms recurring over months or years, and GRACE-2 is designed for application in the United States in settings with access to advanced diagnostic imaging, laboratory testing, and specialty referral, noting that differences in international or rural U.S. settings may make recommendations less applicable.

### Infection mimicking appendicitis case report: new differential diagnosis considerations [^54888e46]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Educational Objectives

Appendicitis is a common presentation in pediatric urgent cares, emergency departments, and primary clinic sites that can have various confounding presentations, and this case directs the reader's attention to Dientamoeba fragilis, a parasite that can go overlooked when evaluating and working up acute abdominal pain.
With the rise of global migration and the burgeoning discipline of newcomer medicine, the case report concludes that the role of expanded infectious workups with the consideration of stool ova and parasite testing for abdominal pain in these vulnerable populations is critical for providing high-value care.

### Nonspecific abdominal pain in pediatric primary care: evaluation and outcomes [^8a70fada]. Academic Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the characteristics of children with nonspecific abdominal pain (AP) in primary care, their evaluation, and their outcomes.

Methods

Between 2007 and 2009, a retrospective cohort of children from 5 primary care practices was followed from an index visit with AP until a well-child visit 6 to 24 months later (outcome visit). Using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9), codes and chart review, we identified afebrile children between 4 and 12 years old with AP. Use of diagnostic testing was assessed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the association of index visit clinical and demographic variables with persistent pain at the outcome visit, and receipt of a specific diagnosis.

Results

Three hundred seventy-five children presented with AP, representing 1% of the total population of 4- to 12-year-olds during the study period. Eighteen percent of children had persistent pain, and 70% of the study cohort never received a specific diagnosis for their pain. Seventeen percent and 14% of children had laboratory and radiology testing at the index visit, respectively. Only 3% of laboratory evaluations helped to yield a diagnosis. Among variables considered, only preceding pain of more than 7 days at the index visit was associated with persistent pain (odds ratio 2.15, 95% confidence interval 1.19–3.89). None of the variables considered was associated with receiving a specific diagnosis.

Conclusions

Most children with AP do not receive a diagnosis, many have persistent pain, and very few receive a functional AP diagnosis. Results support limited use of diagnostic testing and conservative management consistent with national policy statements.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^867070b7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — diagnosis and initial evaluation — requires meeting INSPPIRE-based criteria with at least two features, including abdominal pain, enzyme elevation, or imaging findings, and initial imaging should be transabdominal ultrasonography with additional imaging reserved for complicated cases; first-attack testing should include liver enzymes, triglyceride, and calcium levels. Specifically, diagnosis "requires at least 2 of the following: (1) abdominal pain compatible with AP, (2) serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, (3) imaging findings consistent with AP", and "Initial imaging may be accomplished via transabdominal ultrasonography, with other imaging (CT, MRI) reserved for more complicated cases ± tailored to suspected etiology", while "first attack of AP testing should include liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT, ALP, bilirubin), triglyceride level, and calcium level".

### A novel biomarker panel to rule out acute appendicitis in pediatric patients with abdominal pain [^940a8d05]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify a biomarker panel with sufficient sensitivity and negative predictive value to identify children with abdominal pain at low risk for acute appendicitis in order to avoid unnecessary imaging.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 503 subjects aged two to 20 years with < 72 hours of abdominal pain consistent with appendicitis. Blood samples from each patient were analyzed for CBC, differential, and 5 candidate proteins. Biomarker values were evaluated using principal component, recursive partitioning and logistic regression to select the combination that best discriminated between those subjects with and without disease.

Results

The prevalence of acute appendicitis was 28.6%. A mathematical combination of three inflammation-related markers in a panel comprised of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and myeloid-related protein 8/14 complex (MRP 8/14) provided the best discrimination. This panel exhibited a sensitivity of 96.5% (95% CI, 92–99%), a negative predictive value of 96.9% (95% CI, 93–99%), a negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03–0.19), and a specificity of 43.2% (95% CI, 38–48%) for acute appendicitis. Sixty of 185 CT scans (32.4%) were done for patients with negative biomarker panel results which, if deferred, would have reduced CT utilization at initial presentation by one third at the cost of missing five of 144 (3.5%) patients with appendicitis.

Conclusion

This panel may be useful in identifying pediatric patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute appendicitis who are at low risk and can be followed clinically, potentially sparing them exposure to the ionizing radiation of CT.

GRACE-2 scope — recurrent abdominal pain populations and prior workup applicability: The guideline is not intended to apply to patients who have not yet undergone evaluation of potential causes, and instead addresses patients who, despite prior medical evaluation for the cause of pain, have not had a cause identified, noting that ongoing or repeated medical evaluations may have risks and benefits that should be balanced such as cost, radiation exposure, and identification of incidental findings prompting further workup with uncertain benefit. The writing group also considered but ultimately did not include patients for whom the cause of recurrent abdominal pain has been identified or is very likely (e.g., pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, nephrolithiasis), even though these populations may suffer consequences of repeated radiation exposure from imaging and other negative effects of recurrent ED presentations.

### Point-of-care ultrasound for undifferentiated abdominal pain in a pediatric patient: a proposed algorithm [^fb013da3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presentation in the pediatric emergency department and may pose a diagnostic challenge to the physician. Although most abdominal pain is benign, the presence of abdominal pain may represent a surgical emergency. We present an atypical presentation of perforated appendicitis in a child with 2 weeks of abdominal pain, in whom point-of-care ultrasound expedited diagnosis and patient disposition. We then recommend a diagnostic approach for using point-of-care ultrasound in a pediatric patient with undifferentiated abdominal pain.

Fig. 3
Proposal for the management of pediatric abdominal pain in primary care. Legend: We believe that diagnosing AA should primarily rely on clinical scoring. A: For cPAS < 4 with a duration of pain > 48 h, the risk is very low, and patients can be observed at home. If the pain onset is < 48 h, revaluation at 24 h is recommended. B: For intermediate cPAS scores from 4 to 5, inflammatory markers should be assessed. If the pain duration is < 48 h with normal inflammatory marker levels, scheduling imaging such as a ultrasound examination is recommended within 12 h. If one of the inflammatory markers is increased, however, ED admission is recommended. If the pain duration is > 48 h with normal inflammatory marker levels, home observation with a blood test at 48 h can be undertaken. Yet, if the inflammatory markers are increased, especially if the CRP level is above the 50 mg/L cutoff, timely admission to the ED is required. C: Thus, a cPAS score ≥ 6 would correspond to a high risk of AA and a very high risk if there is associated abdominal guarding. Referral to the ED is appropriate from the outset

### PAN-immune inflammation value: a new biomarker for diagnosing appendicitis in children? [^e2527536]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

In this retrospective study, data from 1,514 pediatric patients aged 0–18 years, admitted with abdominal pain to Hitit University Erol Olçok Training and Research Hospital between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, were analysed retrospectively.

Study design

Patients who underwent surgery with a preliminary diagnosis of appendicitis between 2019 and 2023 were classified into three groups based on their histopathological diagnoses: acute appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and negative appendectomy. However, patients presenting with abdominal pain who could not be definitively diagnosed through physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging methods were admitted to the pediatric surgery department for observation due to suspected appendicitis. During the follow-up period, patients who required appendectomy were operated on and classified into the appropriate group based on their histopathological diagnoses: acute appendicitis, perforated appendicitis, and negative appendectomy. Patients who remained clinically stable and were discharged without surgery were classified into the non-surgical treatment group.

Initially, patients were classified into four main groups: non-surgery treatment (n = 624, 41.2%), non-complicated appendicitis (n = 630, 41.6%), complicated appendicitis (n = 136, 9%), and negative appendectomy (n = 124, 8.2%). The complicated, non-complicated appendicitis, and negative appendectomy groups were established based on patients' pathological diagnoses. Subsequently, patients were divided into two main research groups: appendicitis (complicated and non-complicated appendicitis) and non-appendicitis (negative appendectomy and non-surgery treatment), and statistical analyses were performed.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Inclusion criteria: Being in the 0–18 age range, hospitalization in the pediatric surgery department for medical treatment due to abdominal pain, histopathological diagnosis after appendectomy, and availability of CBC data within 24 h before surgery were determined as inclusion criteria.

Exclusion criteria: Patients with a history of chronic inflammatory disease (e.g. Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis), immunodeficiency, or malignancy, those who had a systemic infection or received corticosteroid/immunomodulatory treatment in the last month, and those with missing laboratory data or follow-up records were excluded from the study.

Ethical aspects

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hitit University Faculty of Medicine ([Decision No: [2024–08], Approval Date: [03/04/2024]).

### Current approach to the diagnosis and emergency department management of appendicitis in children [^d6bdc90b]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Concerns about radiation exposure have led to a decrease in the use of computed tomography in suspected appendicitis, with increased reliance on ultrasound. Children with suspected appendicitis should be risk stratified using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms, white blood cell count, and ultrasound in order to guide further evaluation and management. Magnetic resonance imaging is a promising imaging modality but remains costly. Ongoing research is evaluating the role of nonoperative management in children with confirmed appendicitis.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^6783f185]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain in children presents a diagnostic dilemma. Although many cases of acute abdominal pain are benign, some require rapid diagnosis and treatment to minimize morbidity. Numerous disorders can cause abdominal pain. The most common medical cause is gastroenteritis, and the most common surgical cause is appendicitis. In most instances, abdominal pain can be diagnosed through the history and physical examination. Age is a key factor in evaluating the cause; the incidence and symptoms of different conditions vary greatly over the pediatric age spectrum. In the acute surgical abdomen, pain generally precedes vomiting, while the reverse is true in medical conditions. Diarrhea often is associated with gastroenteritis or food poisoning. Appendicitis should be suspected in any child with pain in the right lower quadrant. Signs that suggest an acute surgical abdomen include involuntary guarding or rigidity, marked abdominal distention, marked abdominal tenderness, and rebound abdominal tenderness. If the diagnosis is not clear after the initial evaluation, repeated physical examination by the same physician often is useful. Selected imaging studies also might be helpful. Surgical consultation is necessary if a surgical cause is suspected or the cause is not obvious after a thorough evaluation.

### Childhood functional abdominal pain: mechanisms and management [^c8bc7b56]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain is one of the most common clinical syndromes encountered in day to day clinical paediatric practice. Although common, its definition is confusing, predisposing factors are poorly understood and the pathophysiological mechanisms are not clear. The prevailing viewpoint in the pathogenesis involves the inter-relationship between changes in hypersensitivity and altered motility, to which several risk factors have been linked. Making a diagnosis of functional abdominal pain can be a challenge, as it is unclear which further diagnostic tests are necessary to exclude an organic cause. Moreover, large, well-performed, high-quality clinical trials for effective agents are lacking, which undermines evidence-based treatment. This Review summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathophysiology, risk factors and diagnostic work-up of functional abdominal pain. Finally, management options for children with functional abdominal pain are discussed including medications, dietary interventions, probiotics and psychological and complementary therapies, to improve understanding and to maximize the quality of care for children with this condition.

### Test characteristics of common appendicitis scores with and without laboratory investigations: a prospective observational study [^b51cb782]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design, population and setting

We performed a prospective cohort study of children presenting to the Alberta Children's Hospital ED with suspected appendicitis. Our hospital, located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada is the tertiary care referral centre for southern Alberta, western Saskatchewan and eastern British Columbia. It has a catchment size of approximately 1.8 million patients. The ED provides care to approximately 72,000 patients annually.

Between February 26, 2013 and January 5, 2014, we enrolled children between the ages of 5 and 17 years who a) presented to ACH ED with complaints of abdominal pain for less than 5 days and b) had appendicitis in their differential diagnosis as per the managing ED team. In order to be included in the study, a WBC had to have been ordered. Furthermore, study subjects had to be evaluated by a senior pediatric resident, a Pediatric Emergency Medicine (PEM) fellow or a PEM staff physician.

We excluded patients with abdominal pain for whom appendicitis was not in the differential diagnosis, patients with previous appendectomy or other abdominal surgery, patients with imaging studies that were positive for appendicitis prior to presentation to our hospital, as well as patients who were pregnant, had immunosuppressive disorders, were non-verbal or whose family was unable to complete the consent form due to a language barrier. Children with chronic gastrointestinal comorbidities were not excluded, but comorbidities were recorded as potential confounders.

### The primary care physician's approach to functional abdominal pain in childhood [^f9e9366d]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent abdominal pain in children was defined initially by Apley and updated recently by Rome II criteria. The intent of the Rome II criteria is to provide greater insight into functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Because markers for these disorders are lacking, diagnostic evaluations may vary. In this investigation, the individual approach of the primary care physician to the child with functional abdominal pain (as defined by Rome II criteria) is explored both in a hypothetical and clinical setting.

Study

A clinical vignette and survey involving the evaluation of a school-aged child with prototypical functional abdominal pain was distributed to area primary care physicians (n = 201 completed). The actual physician approach for functional abdominal pain was determined through chart review of children referred to gastroenterology clinic (n = 103).

Results

Physicians favored limited organ-specific testing, with urinalysis, preferred most. Physicians with extreme anticipation of a positive yield requested more testing than their nonanticipatory counterparts (5.7 ± 2.2 vs. 2.0 ± 2.0, P < 0.001). Ultrasound was the only diagnostic test requested with greater frequency in actual subjects than hypothetical (31% vs. 18%, P < 0.005).

Conclusions

In accordance with published guidelines, physicians requested minimal testing for functional abdominal pain. Increased ultrasound requests in the clinic setting may be more reflective of the need for reassurance rather than seeking an organic etiology.

### Acute abdominal pain in children [^b87db431]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for approximately 9% of childhood primary care office visits. Symptoms and signs that increase the likelihood of a surgical cause for pain include fever, bilious vomiting, bloody diarrhea, absent bowel sounds, voluntary guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness. The age of the child can help focus the differential diagnosis. In infants and toddlers, clinicians should consider congenital anomalies and other causes, including malrotation, hernias, Meckel diverticulum, or intussusception. In school-aged children, constipation and infectious causes of pain, such as gastroenteritis, colitis, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections, are more common. In female adolescents, clinicians should consider pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy, ruptured ovarian cysts, or ovarian torsion. Initial laboratory tests include complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein, urinalysis, and a pregnancy test. Abdominal radiography can be used to diagnose constipation or obstruction. Ultrasonography is the initial choice in children for the diagnosis of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, ovarian cyst, ovarian or testicular torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, pregnancy-related pathology, and appendicitis. Appendicitis is the most common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring surgery, with a peak incidence during adolescence. When the appendix is not clearly visible on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^fd5fc10f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

LIMITATIONS

Our study has several limitations. We used the application of a natural language processing tool to identify abdominal pain in the chief complaint or triage note and define the cohort, which may have missed some children presenting without classic symptoms of appendicitis. However, we took additional steps to ensure the validity of our cohort and ensure the majority of appendicitis diagnoses in the sample were captured (Table A2). Additionally, defining potential delays in appendicitis diagnosis as a 7‐day return visit misses patients who presented to EDs outside of the MEDIC data registry for their second visit, and therefore our estimate of delayed diagnosis can be expected to underestimate the true rate (and is indeed lower than other recent U.S.‐based estimates). This bias would tend to underestimate delay rates at general EDs compared with pediatric EDs, as patients at these EDs may be more likely to go to a different ED at the second visit. Further, the majority of appendicitis cases were evaluated in pediatric EDs, which is another source of bias when calculating the rate of delayed diagnosis. Finally, while we quantified delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, we did not assess whether this delay resulted in patient harm or morbidity, including appendiceal perforation, sepsis, bowel resection, or abdominal abscess drainage. It is likely that some cases of diagnostic delay reflect scenarios where shared decision making was utilized and watchful waiting was initially selected over immediate imaging; however, our data set does not contain information about the decision‐making process, the locally available resources, or laboratory testing. Finally, there are other indications for cross‐sectional imaging in the evaluation of pediatric patients with abdominal pain — including renal stones or bowel obstruction — that may account for greater reliance on these studies in certain populations and for which we did not fully assess in this analysis.

CONCLUSIONS

In this retrospective cohort study of 120,000+ ED visits for pediatric abdominal pain, we found that the cross‐sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio varied widely across EDs. In our sample, delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was uncommon. Pediatric EDs had both the lowest imaging and the lowest delayed diagnosis rates, likely partially reflective of the quality of pediatric ultrasound at those sites. Adherence to best practices, improved imaging availability and quality, and strengthened coordination of care across centers may hold promise to improve diagnostic stewardship in the evaluation of children with abdominal pain across EDs.

### Imaging of pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^9ed9ad2b]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this review is to examine the current imaging literature and develop basic imaging guidelines for evaluation of children with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The three following typical clinical scenarios in the imaging evaluation of IBD are considered: patient with an initial diagnosis of suspected IBD, the goals being to determine disease extent and severity and to differentiate Crohn disease from ulcerative colitis; patient with known IBD presenting with new acute symptoms (fever, peritonitis, leukocytosis) requiring urgent evaluation; and patient with known IBD presenting with nonacute symptomatic recurrence (abdominal pain, diarrhea), the goals being to assess the efficacy of the current treatment and to evaluate the possible need for additional medical or surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Imaging of pediatric patients with IBD must balance considerations of diagnostic accuracy against concerns about patient exposure to ionizing radiation and tolerance of the imaging technique. The imaging modality chosen depends on the clinical presentation and expected pathologic finding.

### Diagnostic value of ultrasound in pediatric acute abdominal pain: a cross-sectional study from a tertiary center in Southern iran [^7c54fa90]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute abdominal pain is a common yet diagnostically challenging presentation in pediatric emergency care due to nonspecific symptoms. While ultrasound offers a safe and accessible diagnostic tool, its clinical utility and correlation with laboratory markers remain understudied in many regions, including Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and diagnostic value of ultrasound findings and their association with clinical and laboratory indicators.

Methods

This cross-sectional study included 174 children aged 5–18 years who presented with acute abdominal pain to the emergency department of Namazi Hospital, Shiraz, Iran, between 2021 and 2022. Demographic data, clinical features, laboratory results, and ultrasound findings were recorded. Associations between sonographic abnormalities and clinical/laboratory parameters were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests.

Results

Ultrasound revealed abnormal findings in 59 (33.9%) patients. The most common sonographic diagnoses were abdominal free fluid (7.5%), appendicitis (4.6%), renal stones (2.9%), and intestinal obstruction (2.9%). Right lower quadrant pain and elevated CRP levels (> 20 mg/L) were significantly associated with appendicitis (p = 0.018 and p = 0.012, respectively). Positive urine protein and blood were significantly associated with renal stones (p = 0.01 and p = 0.003). The majority (79.3%) of ultrasounds were normal, highlighting the role of clinical assessment in determining the necessity of imaging.

Conclusions

Ultrasound is a valuable diagnostic tool in pediatric patients with acute abdominal pain, identifying both common and rare conditions. The study highlights the importance of clinical assessment in determining the need for further imaging and the necessity of localized research to inform diagnostic protocols in regional healthcare settings.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^7cf45872]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria for pediatric acute pancreatitis" for pediatric pancreatitis.

The INSPPIRE (International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure) diagnostic criteria is a clinical calculator specifically designed for the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis in pediatric patients. This scoring system is used to identify children who are likely to have acute pancreatitis based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results. The INSPPIRE criteria include abdominal pain characteristic of pancreatitis, serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit of normal, and imaging findings consistent with acute pancreatitis. The clinical utility of this calculator is to provide a standardized method for diagnosing acute pancreatitis in children, which can help guide treatment decisions and predict prognosis. There are no specific exclusion criteria for its use, but it should be noted that it is not intended to replace clinical judgment or to be used in isolation. It should be used in conjunction with a comprehensive clinical assessment.

The INSPPIRE diagnostic criteria are used to evaluate the likelihood of pediatric acute pancreatitis by assessing three specific clinical factors. These factors are:

- Whether abdominal pain suggestive of or compatible with acute pancreatitis is present, characterized by acute onset especially in the epigastric region.
- Whether there is serum amylase and/or lipase activity at least more than three times the upper limit of normal.
- Whether imaging findings are characteristic of or compatible with acute pancreatitis.

For each factor, the response can be either "Yes" or "No". Each "Yes" response contributes 1 point to the total score, while each "No" response contributes 0 points. The points are tallied, resulting in a possible score range from 0 to 3. Here's how it works:

- **Abdominal pain**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Elevated enzyme levels**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points
- **Imaging findings**: "Yes" = 1 point, "No" = 0 points

The total score is the sum of the individual scores from these factors. Depending on the total score, the interpretation is as follows:

- A score of 2 or more suggests that the diagnostic criteria are met, indicating a high likelihood of acute pancreatitis.
- A score of 1 or less suggests that the diagnostic criteria are not met, indicating that acute pancreatitis is unlikely.

Through this simple yet effective scoring system, clinicians can systematically assess the presence of symptoms, biochemical markers, and imaging evidence to guide their diagnosis of pediatric acute pancreatitis.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^210afd1f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Diagnostic stewardship is the effort to optimize diagnostic testing to reduce errors while avoiding overtesting and overtreatment. Abdominal pain and appendicitis in children are essential use cases. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis can be dangerous and even life‐threatening, but overtesting is harmful.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children aged 5–17 years presenting with abdominal pain to 26 EDs within the Michigan Emergency Department Improvement Collaborative (MEDIC) from May 1, 2016, to February 29, 2024. We defined two outcome measures summarized by ED. First, we describe the cross‐sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio, defined as the count of ED visits resulting in any cross‐sectional imaging (CT or MRI) divided by the count of ED visits with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Second, we describe the delayed diagnosis rate, defined by an ED visit for abdominal pain resulting in a discharge and subsequent return visit with a diagnosis of appendicitis within 7 days.

Results

The sample included 120,112 pediatric visits for abdominal pain at 26 EDs; 4967 (4.1%) were diagnosed with appendicitis. The cross‐sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio varied by site, from as low as 0.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1–0.2) at a pediatric site to as high as 7.9 (95% CI 4.8–16.4) at an urban ED. The proportion of pediatric ED visits for abdominal pain that resulted in an identified delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was 0.1% (141/120,112). All but four sites had fewer than 10 cases of delayed diagnosis across the study period.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of 120,000+ ED visits for pediatric abdominal pain, we found that the ratio of visits with cross‐sectional imaging to diagnosed cases of appendicitis varied widely across EDs. Delayed diagnosis of appendicitis was uncommon. Adherence to best practices and improved imaging quality may hold promise to improve diagnostic stewardship for children with abdominal pain across EDs.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms, diagnostic evaluations, and abdominal pathology in children with sickle cell disease [^60535986]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) frequently present with acute pain. The abdomen, a common site of acute SCD-related pain, may be present in a variety of gastrointestinal (GI) pathologies. Limited data exist on prevalence and workup of abdominal pain in patients with SCD during acute pain events.

Objectives

Determine prevalence of GI symptoms, GI-specific evaluation and risks of hospitalization in children with SCD presenting to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalized with abdominal pain.

Methods

Retrospective study of children less than 21 years presenting to the ED or hospitalized with pain in our center over 2 years. Descriptive statistics were used to report clinical characteristics, frequency of GI symptoms, workup by age (< 5 vs. ≥ 5 years), and genotype (sickle cell anemia [SCA] vs. non-SCA). Logistic regression models were used to identify risks associated with hospitalization.

Results

A total of 1279 encounters in 378 patients were analyzed; 23% (n = 291) encounters were associated with abdominal pain. More abdominal pain-associated hospitalizations occurred in older children, SCA, children with lower mean hemoglobin (8.7 ± 1.9 vs. 9.6 ± 1.6 g/dL, p < .001) and higher mean white blood cell (WBC) count (14.9 ± 6.6 vs. 13.2 ± 5.3 × 10 3 /μL, p = .02). We identified that less than 50% of patients presenting to the ED with abdominal pain received a GI-specific evaluation.

Conclusion

Children with SCD frequently present with abdominal pain and other GI symptoms, with limited GI evaluations performed. GI-specific evaluation may increase diagnosis of GI pathologies, rule out GI pathologies, and contribute to the limited knowledge of the abdomen as a primary site of SCD pain.

### Utility of serum amylase in children with abdominal pain in the pediatric emergency department [^e6d054fc]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal pain is among the most common chief complaints seen in pediatric emergency departments (PEDs). This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic utility of amylase and lipase in the evaluation of abdominal pain in the PED.

Methods

Retrospective, cross-sectional study of patients aged 0 to 18 years with amylase and/or lipase while in the PED in 2019. Diagnostic utility of amylase and lipase was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio (LR). The χ² or Fisher exact test was used when appropriate.

Results

We identified 496 PED visits with tests for amylase (0.2%), lipase (53%), or both (46.8%). Abnormal levels for amylase and lipase were 4.6% and 5.6%, respectively. Amylase use in abdominal pain evaluation showed sensitivity of 30%, specificity of 92%, PPV of 26%, NPV of 93%, and LR of 7.1 (P = 0.008). Lipase use in abdominal pain evaluation showed sensitivity of 7.5%, specificity of 94.5%, PPV of 10.7%, NPV of 92%, and LR of 0.251 (P = 0.616). Amylase at 3 times its normal level showed sensitivity of 10%, specificity of 99.5%, PPV of 66.7%, NPV of 92.2%, and LR of 6.35 (P = 0.012), whereas lipase showed a sensitivity of 5%, specificity of 99.3%, PPV of 40%, NPV of 92.2%, and LR of 3.9 (P = 0.048). Identification of a clinically significant diagnosis via coordering of amylase and lipase versus lipase alone was not significant.

Conclusions

Although serum amylase and lipase testing may be suitable for abdominal pain screening, the concurrent use of both does not seem to add any clinically significant value to diagnosis.

### Health supervision in the management of children and adolescents with IBD: NASPGHAN recommendations [^f25dac09]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease evaluation in acutely ill pediatric patients should include laboratory tests and targeted endoscopy. Useful labs include CBC with differential, ESR, CRP, and liver function tests (ALT, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, GGT, albumin); amylase and lipase may be useful when abdominal pain is present or when using agents that can affect the pancreas (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine). Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, so ferritin levels up to 50 ng/mL may still be consistent with iron deficiency; a chemistry panel assists in assessing hydration status and renal function. Patients with persistent or worsening symptoms, especially after a negative infectious workup, should be referred to their primary gastroenterologist, and some may benefit from proctosigmoidoscopy; endoscopic and histologic findings help assess location and severity of inflammation and evaluate for infections such as cytomegalovirus colitis.

### Multiple somatic symptoms linked to positive screen for depression in pediatric patients with chronic abdominal pain [^9ce471b7]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

Abdominal pain is a frequent childhood complaint, comprising 2% to 4% of all reasons for pediatric office visits. Patients referred for evaluation of chronic abdominal pain (CAP) frequently present with comorbid nonspecific somatic symptoms that may complicate the medical evaluation and lead to unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures. We tested the hypothesis that multiple nongastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children presenting with CAP is a marker for clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms.

Methods

Participants were 400 consecutive new patients (ages 8–17 years; 63% female) referred to the pediatric gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of abdominal pain of > 3 months' duration. Patients reported how frequently they experienced 7 non-GI symptoms. Patients were screened for depression with the Children's Depression Inventory.

Results

On the basis of their Children's Depression Inventory scores, 58 (15%) patients had a positive screen for clinically significant depressive symptoms. Patients with a positive versus negative depression screen did not differ by sex, pain duration or laboratory evidence of organic disease. Patient report of ≥ 3 non-GI symptoms maximized sensitivity (71%) and specificity (75%) in prediction of depression screening results. With each addition of a non-GI symptom, the odds of a positive screen for depression doubled.

Conclusions

For patients with and without organic disease findings associated with CAP, the presence of ≥ 3 non-GI symptoms should signal the practitioner to evaluate for depression and may be used as an indicator of the likelihood of depression in the absence of specific inquiry into emotional symptoms.

### Prospective validation of a biomarker panel to identify pediatric ED patients with abdominal pain who are at low risk for acute appendicitis [^d2653ef4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective of the study is to prospectively validate the diagnostic accuracy of a biomarker panel consisting of white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and myeloid-related protein 8/14 levels in identifying pediatric patients with abdominal pain who are at low risk for appendicitis.

Methods

This prospective observational study enrolled subjects aged 2 to 20 years presenting to 29 US emergency departments with abdominal pain suggesting possible acute appendicitis. Blood samples were analyzed for white blood cell, C-reactive protein, and myeloid-related protein 8/14 levels from which the composite biomarker panel results were calculated, then correlated with the final diagnosis either positive or negative for acute appendicitis.

Results

A total of 2201 patients were enrolled, with 1887 completing all aspects of the study. Prevalence of appendicitis in this cohort was 25.3%. The biomarker panel exhibited a sensitivity of 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.1%-98.2%), negative predictive value of 97.4% (95% CI, 95.8%-98.5%), negative likelihood ratio of 0.08 (95% CI, 0.05–0.13), with a specificity of 37.9% (95% CI, 35.4%-40.4%) for appendicitis. The panel correctly identified 534 (37.8%) of 1410 patients who did not have appendicitis with 14 false negatives (2.9%). Overall, 23.7% (132/557) of computed tomographic (CT) scans were done for patients with negative biomarker panel results, including 31.2% (131/420) of patients who had CT but did not have appendicitis.

Conclusion

This biomarker panel exhibited high sensitivity and negative predictive value for acute appendicitis in this large prospective cohort. This panel may be useful in identifying pediatric patients who are at low risk for appendicitis and might be followed clinically, potentially reducing the dependence on CT in the evaluation for acute appendicitis.

### Utility of symptom duration and C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, and absolute neutrophil count in the evaluation of pediatric appendicitis [^031de284]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Appendicitis is a common pediatric surgical emergency, and the diagnosis may be delayed or missed because of nonspecific findings in children. Not all patients with abdominal pain need to be imaged for appendicitis, and laboratory evaluation may improve diagnostic accuracy in this population.

Objective

To determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) and symptom duration could be used to improve diagnosis of appendicitis compared with white blood cell count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC).

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review from June 2017 to 2019 at our tertiary academic children's hospital. A consecutive sample of all children < 18 years of age being evaluated for appendicitis who had magnetic resonance imaging ordered were included. The diagnostic accuracy of WBC, ANC, and CRP were compared for patients with symptom duration ≤ 1 day compared with symptom duration for > 1 day.

Results

Five hundred thirty-nine patients were identified. The sensitivity and specificity of WBC (10,000 cells/μL) was 87.1% and 65.2%, respectively; ANC (7,500 cells/μL) was 86.5% and 70.8%, respectively; and CRP (0.5 mg/dL) were 73.7% and 58.1%, respectively. At > 1 day of symptom duration, the specificity of WBC and ANC increased to 74.9% and 80.9%, respectively, and the sensitivity of CRP increased to 88.9%. Three patients with appendicitis (2.8%) had no laboratory abnormalities.

Conclusions

No laboratory test studied has adequate characteristics to be used alone. CRP adds minimal sensitivity beyond WBC and ANC when symptoms are > 1 day but with poor specificity, making it of limited utility.

A 16-year-old girl presented to her primary care physician with a one-month history of decreased appetite and abdominal pain. She had normal bowel movements and no vomiting, but her periumbilical pain limited her ability to finish most meals. She had gradual weight loss over the previous 2 years, and during the previous 4 years, she intermittently received counseling for depression after the loss of her mother. Her initial physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was referred to a nutritionist, adolescent medicine, and pediatric gastroenterology. Her presentation evolved over time, which ultimately led to a definitive diagnosis.

### Aetiologies and outcomes of patients with abdominal pain presenting to an emergency department of a tertiary hospital in tanzania: a prospective cohort study [^4c5c73a2]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal pain is one of the most important and challenging symptoms that brings a patient to the physician for evaluation. Abdominal pain represents a spectrum of diseases ranging from the most benign and self-limited to surgical emergencies. Abdominal pain is one of the most common presentations to the emergency department. Studies from high income countries suggest that abdominal pain presentation at the ED has an incidence of 7–10%.

In general, only a quarter of the patients with abdominal pain need surgical interventions, in such cases the dilemma remains whether surgery is needed emergently. About 35–41% patients with abdominal pain are admitted while a quarter of the patients are discharged. Even with modern diagnostic tools and improved surgical skills older age and comorbid conditions pose a relatively higher morbidity and mortality. Increased risk is found in populations with diabetes and those who are immunocompromised, children and the elderly; there is six to eight-fold increase in the mortality in the elderly compared to younger patients.

Most information about abdominal pain emergencies comes from High Income Country (HIC) where the most common aetiology is non-specific abdominal pain even after all the appropriate laboratory and imaging investigations, this provides little guidance to the patients in our setting where majority cannot afford all investigations. It is best to base care with findings from Low Income Country (LIC) due to differences in geographical distribution, cultural practices and health care systems.

Information about abdominal pain emergencies in low and middle-income countries is limited.

Lack of documented clinical profiles, presentations and outcomes poses a challenge to creating and meeting the standards of care. This study is to fill the gap in the knowledge about incidence, presentation, causes and mortality from abdominal pain in an established emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Tanzania.

Pediatric chronic pancreatitis — sequelae of disease: The majority of pancreatic fluid collections will resolve spontaneously with supportive care, and intervention is reserved for complications from mass-effect, infection/necrosis or if spontaneous regression of the collection is thought to be unlikely. Children with CP that continue to exhibit abdominal pain, bloating or other gastrointestinal (GI) concerns deserve an appropriate GI workup to evaluate for other etiologies that may explain their symptoms.

### Clinical evaluation of inflammatory and blood parameters in the workup of pediatric chronic abdominal pain [^37a768ea]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the additional value of blood parameters (hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) to anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG), fecal calprotectin, and Giardia lamblia when discriminating a functional from an organic cause in the clinical evaluation of children with chronic abdominal pain.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study included patients (4–18 years of age) with abdominal pain for > 2 months. Data on hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, anti-tTG, fecal calprotectin, alarm symptoms, and diagnosis were collected.

Results

We identified 853 patients, of whom 102 (12%) had an organic disorder. Sensitivity and the area under the curve of strategy 1 (fecal calprotectin, anti-tTG, G lamblia, blood parameters) were 90% (95% CI, 83–95) and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81–0.93), respectively, compared with 88% (95% CI, 81–93) and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79–0.91), respectively, for strategy 2 (fecal calprotectin, anti-tTG, G lamblia) (P = NS). In the presence of ≥ 1 alarm symptoms, the sensitivity of strategies 1 and 2 was 92% (95% CI, 83–96) and 92% (95% CI, 83–96), and the areas under the curve were 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89–0.98) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.97) (P = NS).

Conclusions

To distinguish between a functional and an organic cause for chronic abdominal pain, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be left out from the clinical evaluation as they might have no additional diagnostic yield. However, caution should be taken not to miss extraintestinal infections (2%).

### Clinical features and preventability of delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis [^87214bb7]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Which clinical features are associated with delayed diagnosis of pediatric appendicitis, and to what extent are delays preventable?

Findings

In this case-control study of 748 children, those who experienced delayed diagnosis had less clinically apparent symptoms; among children for whom imaging would have been cost-effective, 22% to 61% received it.

Meaning

These findings suggest that undertesting for appendicitis may account for a considerable fraction of cases of delayed diagnosis of appendicitis.

### Exploring diagnostic stewardship in the emergency department evaluation of pediatric abdominal pain in a statewide quality collaborative [^1a02b797]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

After exclusions, there were a total of 120,112 ED visits for abdominal pain for 94,409 unique patients ages 5–17 and 26 EDs in the analytic sample (Figure 1). Appendicitis was diagnosed in 4967 (4.1%) visits presenting with abdominal pain. Three pediatric centers accounted for 59.9% of visits in the sample. Seventeen urban EDs accounted for 33.9% of the visits, and the remaining 6.2% of visits occurred at the six rural EDs included in this study. Overall, the sample was 59.3% female and 53.3% non‐Hispanic White and had a mean age of 11 years. Table 1 depicts visit‐level sociodemographic characteristics of the study population. Visits for abdominal pain as identified by our natural language processing tool captured the majority of abdominal imaging (95.5%) and appendicitis diagnoses (96.1%) among all pediatric ED visits ages 5–17 (Table A2).

TABLE 1
Visit level characteristics by type of ED.

Among all children identified with abdominal pain, 37,396 (31.1%) underwent abdominal imaging (Figure 2). Ultrasound was obtained in 27.2% (32,676) of visits, while 6.4% (7726) had a CT and 1.9% (2243) had a MRI. Sites varied in their propensity to image, from 12.2% to 50.3% of abdominal pain visits. Across the full study sample, the cross‐sectional imaging:appendicitis visits ratio was 2.0 (9914 ED visits with cross‐sectional imaging divided by 4967 appendicitis cases). The ratio varied by site, from as low as 0.2 (95% CI 0.1–0.2) at a pediatric site to as high as 7.9 (95% CI 4.8–16.4) at an urban ED (Figure 3). Figure A1 similarly depicts this ratio but for ultrasound:appendicitis visits and finds similar marked variation. We report on a sensitivity analysis, where we only include first‐time ED visits across patients, in Table A3.

### Who will be the bastions of pediatric trauma care? [^d78eda4b]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Whereas high-definition axial imaging has become ubiquitous in the evaluation of adult blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), laboratory testing has traditionally been the gatekeeper to proceeding with abdominopelvic CT in pediatric trauma patients. The data to support this practice, however, are highly conflicting, leading to a heterogeneous practice pattern across centers that treat pediatric trauma patients. A study of 14 different pediatric level I trauma centers found large variability in laboratory tests that were ordered across centers and weak correlation between laboratory results and CT use. The American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program Best Practices Guidelines in Imaging recommends screening laboratory tests prior to withholding abdominal CT imaging in children. Another study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine evaluated the role of laboratory markers in predicting injury among children < 18 years who sustained BAT. Among 327 patients, they found significantly higher mean transaminase and lipase values for those with solid organ injury, but most were still within normal range. They recommended that laboratory tests alone should not be used to screen pediatric patients with BAT. A prudent approach to avoiding CT imaging in injured children involves a combination of negative clinical, radiographic and laboratory findings, as each in isolation may not reliably rule out IAI. One study out of Memphis found that combining negative transaminase results with a negative FAST increased negative predictive value for IAI from 83% to 96% when compared with using each modality alone. A multicenter study involving 14 level I pediatric trauma centers used prospective data to develop a prediction rule that used a combination of history, physical exam findings, chest X-ray and liver and pancreatic enzyme levels. Its negative predictive value for identifying IAI requiring intervention was 100%, which was confirmed in a validation study published a year later. The Pediatric Emergency Care Research Network has developed clinical guidelines based on these study findings that combine clinical and laboratory features to identify individuals at high risk for BAT to reduce unnecessary imaging.

### Chronic abdominal pain in children [^e54cc008]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic abdominal pain, defined as long-lasting intermittent or constant abdominal pain, is a common pediatric problem encountered by primary care physicians, medical subspecialists, and surgical specialists. Chronic abdominal pain in children is usually functional, that is, without objective evidence of an underlying organic disorder. The Subcommittee on Chronic Abdominal Pain of the American Academy of Pediatrics and the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition has prepared this report based on a comprehensive, systematic review and rating of the medical literature. This report accompanies a clinical report based on the literature review and expert opinion. The subcommittee examined the diagnostic and therapeutic value of a medical and psychological history, diagnostic tests, and pharmacologic and behavioral therapy. The presence of alarm symptoms or signs (such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent fever, chronic severe diarrhea, and significant vomiting) is associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease. There was insufficient evidence to state that the nature of the abdominal pain or the presence of associated symptoms (such as anorexia, nausea, headache, and joint pain) can discriminate between functional and organic disorders. Although children with chronic abdominal pain and their parents are more often anxious or depressed, the presence of anxiety, depression, behavior problems, or recent negative life events does not distinguish between functional and organic abdominal pain. Most children who are brought to the primary care physician's office for chronic abdominal pain are unlikely to require diagnostic testing. Pediatric studies of therapeutic interventions were examined and found to be limited or inconclusive.

### Influence of age on clinical presentation, diagnosis delay and outcome in pre-school children with acute appendicitis [^2d810538]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study confirms that acute appendicitis in children less than 6 years of age is a rare condition and is still related to a high risk of morbidity, especially appendix perforation, due to the diagnostic delay. This latter in turn is the consequence of non-specific symptoms and the non-pathognomonic clinical-and complementary examination results and increases with younger age.

Less specific, trivialized abdominal pain and dissociation of the inflammatory markers with lower leucocyte- and neutrophil counts and higher C-reactive protein levels in young children contribute to the diagnosis trap of acute appendicitis in preschool children. The greatest caution is therefore mandatory when evaluating a young child with acute abdominal pain and the question of whether it could be acute appendicitis systematically addressed.

### A prospective study to evaluate the contribution of the pediatric appendicitis score in the decision process [^1cc26ffe]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Most previous studies have primarily examined the utility of the PAS score within ED populations, without considering prior consultations in primary care. Primary care physicians often serve as the initial assessors, typically lacking immediate access to extensive laboratory and imaging resources. Depending on their expertise, they are aware of the seriousness and potential morbidity associated with AA. The key question they must address in their practice is: "Should I refer this child for further investigations?". The primary objective of this study was to compare the PAS scores of children presenting at the ED with clinical features suggestive of AA, taking into account whether or not they had a prior consultation in primary care. The secondary endpoint was to assess the potential of combined PAS scores and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels for diagnosing AA and alternative conditions.

### The abdomen does not lie, but the labs might: predictors of intra-abdominal injury on computed tomography imaging in pediatric blunt trauma patients [^79770558]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple studies have indicated that isolated abnormal laboratory results necessitate obtaining abdominal computed tomography (CT) for pediatric patients with blunt abdominal trauma (BAT), regardless of the normal abdominal examination. This study aims to identify the predictors of intra-abdominal injury (IAI) and the role of laboratory tests in CT imaging among pediatric BAT patients.

Methods

This is a retrospective review at a Level II pediatric trauma center (2018–2022). Children (younger than 18 years) who presented with BAT and received abdominal CT imaging were included. Outcomes were rates of IAI and interventions. Multivariable regression analysis was performed.

Results

Over 5 years, 483 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 13 years, 58.2% were male, and the median Glasgow Coma Scale was 15. Overall, 19.3% had abdominal pain; 6.2%, postinjury emesis; 26.1%, abdominal tenderness; and 10.6%, pelvic tenderness. On initial imaging, 7.0% had a positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma examination, and 7.2% had an abnormal plain x-ray. On initial laboratory testing, 7.9% had abnormal serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 3.1% had abnormal hematocrit, 1.2% had abnormal urine analysis, and 0.8% had abnormal lipase. Seventeen percent had at least one IAI, of which 17% underwent intervention. Multivariable regression analysis identified abdominal tenderness, abnormal plain x-ray, positive focused assessment with sonography in trauma, blood transfusion requirements, and abnormal AST as independent predictors of IAI on abdominal CT imaging. Moreover, among patients with IAI, only 37.3% had abnormal laboratory results, and all had at least one of the predictors of IAI (in addition to or other than abnormal AST). Among patients with abnormal laboratory results (n = 57), nine patients had none of the predictors of IAI, out of which none were found to have IAI on abdominal CT.

Conclusion

More than 80% of all abdominal CT imaging had negative results. Our findings highlight the significance of clinical findings in the trauma bay, regardless of laboratory findings, when deciding to order abdominal CT imaging for pediatric BAT patients.

### Definitions of pediatric pancreatitis and survey of present clinical practices [^abf60daa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

There is limited literature on acute pancreatitis (AP), acute recurrent pancreatitis (ARP), and chronic pancreatitis (CP) in children. The International Study Group of Pediatric Pancreatitis: In Search for a Cure (INSPPIRE) consortium was formed to standardize definitions, develop diagnostic algorithms, investigate disease pathophysiology, and design prospective multicenter studies in pediatric pancreatitis.

Methods

Subcommittees were formed to delineate definitions of pancreatitis, and a survey was conducted to analyze present practice.

Results

AP was defined as requiring 2 of the following: abdominal pain compatible with AP, serum amylase and/or lipase values ≥ 3 times upper limits of normal, and imaging findings of AP. ARP was defined as ≥ 2 distinct episodes of AP with intervening return to baseline. CP was diagnosed in the presence of typical abdominal pain plus characteristic imaging findings, or exocrine insufficiency plus imaging findings, or endocrine insufficiency plus imaging findings. We found that children with pancreatitis were primarily managed by pediatric gastroenterologists. Unless the etiology was known, initial investigations included serum liver enzymes, triglycerides, calcium, and abdominal ultrasound. Further investigations (usually for ARP and CP) included magnetic resonance or other imaging, sweat chloride, and genetic testing. Respondents' future goals for INSPPIRE included determining natural history of pancreatitis, developing algorithms to evaluate and manage pancreatitis, and validating diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

INSPPIRE represents the first initiative to create a multicenter approach to systematically characterize pancreatitis in children. Future aims include creation of patient database and biologic sample repository.

Pediatric appendicitis — diagnostic modeling and accuracy: A retrospective review of all patients to a pediatric hospital with abdominal pain over 3 months, with review within 72 hours and follow-up at 2 weeks, used chart review of history, physical, laboratory, and radiologic findings to assess the presence of appendicitis using recursive partitioning and logistic regression. Recursive partitioning identified: girls 5–12 y with guarding and temperature above 38.4°C; boys 5–12 y with tenderness and vomiting; and boys > 12 y with guarding and anorexia. Binary logistic regression found that history and physical examination only had predictive accuracy 94.4%, positive predictive value (PPV) 19%, negative predictive value (NPV) 99.2%, whereas history and physical examination with white blood cell (WBC) count had predictive accuracy 89.1%, PPV 18%, NPV 98.8%. Limitations/comments noted that history and physical examination alone have high predictive accuracy and NPV and that these were less when WBC count included, with pediatrics only, retrospective design, and telephone follow-up.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: diagnostic accuracy study [^5cf33b39]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and for efficient throughput of patients. Decision making in patients with abdominal pain on the basis of clinical and laboratory evaluation alone can result in unnecessary interventions or in delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, of which ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) are the most often used, can assist in clinical decision making. Imaging has been shown to have a positive effect on the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis, to lead to changes in decisions about management, and to increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in patients with abdominal pain has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has been responsible for an increase in hospital costs, and CT has been a growing source of exposure to radiation in adult patients. This calls for a rational, evidence based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has made available guidelines for imaging in patients with abdominal pain and specific locations of abdominal tenderness. This differentiation of use of imaging with patient tailored guidelines may not be sufficient to cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy in patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification of urgent conditions, without exposing patients to unnecessary forms of imaging. Unfortunately, many of the studies on imaging for acute abdominal pain have evaluated investigations in isolation, and several show methodological shortcomings such as retrospective collection of data or differential verification of test results.

We evaluated the added value of plain radiographs, ultrasonography, and computed tomography after clinical evaluation for making urgent diagnoses in patients presenting with abdominal pain. We compared the accuracy and costs of 11 diagnostic strategies, by using data systematically collected in a consecutive series of unselected patients presenting with acute, non-traumatic abdominal pain at the emergency department, all of whom were investigated with a structured overcomplete imaging protocol.
