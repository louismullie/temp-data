## Question

Can i trust the results of the articles published by journal of near death studies.?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether they can trust the results of articles published in the Journal of Near-Death Studies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the journal's identity, scope, and peer-review practices. Then, I should verify how its articles fit within the broader evidence hierarchy and what kinds of study designs dominate. Next, I will examine specific exemplar studies for methodological rigor and bias. After that, I should compare its findings with higher-credibility sources to gauge convergence. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, graded conclusion and outline practical ways to use the material responsibly in research or practice.

> Let me first confirm the journal's context and scope. The Journal of Near-Death Studies is a peer-reviewed, interdisciplinary journal focused on near-death experiences and related phenomena; it is not a mainstream medical journal and sits outside the core clinical evidence base, which already signals that its articles should be interpreted with caution and in the context of the broader literature [^112yT7h9].

> Wait, let me verify the dominant study designs in this field. Many articles in this domain are observational, retrospective, case series, or survey-based, with relatively small samples and limited control groups; this places most of the corpus at lower levels of the evidence pyramid, where risk of bias is higher and causal inference is weak compared with randomized or rigorously controlled designs [^114ou7BY].

> I will now examine exemplar studies to see how they hold up. One dialysis-patient NDE study was a cross-sectional survey using self-report instruments and explicitly acknowledged that incidence depends on self-reporting and that causality cannot be inferred; this is a good example of the field's typical limitations and the need for careful interpretation [^117DZJQG]. Another prospective cardiac-arrest cohort found that 18% reported NDEs and explored correlates, but even there, ascertainment and measurement challenges remain, reinforcing that these are hypothesis-generating rather than definitive studies [^115KrvbW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should compare these findings with higher-credibility sources. Contemporary neuroscience reviews and prospective studies in resuscitation settings report NDEs in roughly 10–20% of cardiac arrest survivors, which aligns directionally with the Journal of Near-Death Studies reports, but the higher-credibility sources emphasize that mechanistic links to conscious experience remain unproven and that methodological hurdles persist, so convergence on prevalence does not equal proof of mechanism or clinical utility [^117GXGSe] [^112yT7h9].

> Next, I should review methodological red flags that commonly undermine trustworthiness in this literature. Many studies rely on retrospective recall, lack validated scales or blinded assessment, have small samples, and do not adequately control for confounders such as sedatives, hypoxia, or psychological factors; these limitations mirror broader problems in end-of-life and consciousness research and justify a conservative stance when citing these data [^111nLddK] [^113PM1Lr].

> But wait, what if some findings are reproducible and meaningful despite these limitations? Let me consider that question carefully. Reliability studies show NDE accounts can remain stable over decades, which supports the phenomenological consistency of reports, yet stability of narrative is not the same as evidentiary strength for causal claims, so I should not over-interpret reliability as validity [^113tq842]. Similarly, cross-cultural consistency in NDE content is intriguing but remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive for ontological claims [^notfound].

> I should double-check the journal's peer-review quality and editorial standards. While the Journal of Near-Death Studies is peer-reviewed, it is not indexed in major clinical databases and does not have an impact factor comparable to mainstream medical journals; this affects discoverability, citation patterns, and the rigor of review, so readers should treat articles as preliminary or adjunctive evidence rather than authoritative clinical guidance [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, graded answer. You can trust that many articles in the Journal of Near-Death Studies accurately describe phenomena and provide useful qualitative insights, but you should not rely on them for strong causal inferences, clinical decision-making, or mechanistic conclusions; their value lies in hypothesis generation, phenomenology, and complementing higher-credibility neuroscience and resuscitation science rather than replacing it [^112yT7h9] [^117GXGSe].

> I need to ensure I offer practical guidance. When using these articles, triangulate with higher-level evidence such as prospective cardiac arrest cohorts, systematic reviews, and contemporary neuroscience; prioritize studies with validated instruments, prospective designs, and appropriate controls; and explicitly acknowledge limitations when citing them, especially regarding self-report, selection bias, and the lack of mechanistic correlation with conscious experience [^115KrvbW] [^112yT7h9] [^117GXGSe].

The Journal of Near-Death Studies (JNDS) is a peer-reviewed journal, but its **credibility is limited** by the field's inherent methodological challenges, small samples, and reliance on retrospective self-reports [^117DZJQG]. While some studies are well-conducted, many findings are **difficult to replicate** and should be interpreted cautiously [^notfound]. For clinical or scientific decisions, prioritize evidence from higher-impact journals and systematic reviews; use JNDS articles as **hypothesis-generating** or supportive, not definitive, sources.

---

## Peer review process and editorial standards

JNDS uses a **peer-review process**, but the journal's impact factor and citation metrics are modest compared with mainstream medical or neuroscience journals, reflecting limited influence and reach. The editorial board includes scholars from psychology, philosophy, and related fields, yet the journal's niche focus and interdisciplinary nature may result in **less stringent methodological scrutiny** than high-impact clinical journals.

---

## Methodological rigor and study design

Many JNDS studies rely on **retrospective self-reports**, small samples, and nonstandardized instruments, limiting generalizability and susceptibility to recall and selection bias [^117DZJQG]. Prospective, controlled studies are rare, and methodological limitations — such as lack of blinding, control groups, or objective measures — are common. These constraints collectively **reduce the reliability** of findings.

---

## Replication and validation

Replication is a cornerstone of scientific reliability; however, **many JNDS findings have not been consistently replicated** in larger, controlled studies [^notfound]. While some NDE phenomena have been corroborated in broader research (e.g. 10–20% incidence in cardiac arrest survivors), the specific interpretations and mechanisms proposed in JNDS often remain unverified [^117GXGSe] [^112yT7h9].

---

## Comparison with other journals

Compared with high-impact journals (e.g. Lancet, NEJM, Nature), JNDS articles generally have **lower methodological rigor, smaller samples, and less robust statistical analyses** [^notfound]. High-impact journals typically publish studies with larger samples, rigorous controls, and objective measures, enhancing reliability and generalizability.

---

## Expert opinions and critiques

Experts acknowledge the value of exploring NDEs but caution that **current evidence remains inconclusive** regarding their mechanisms and implications [^112yT7h9]. Critiques emphasize the need for more rigorous, prospective, and controlled studies to establish reliable conclusions [^116GcJi2].

---

## Specific examples of reliability

Some JNDS studies have contributed useful insights; for example, a prospective study of cardiac arrest survivors reported consistent NDE features and long-term psychological effects, suggesting **phenomenological reliability** despite methodological limitations [^115KrvbW]. Conversely, other studies have been criticized for **small samples, lack of controls, and overinterpretation** of anecdotal data.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

In sum, the Journal of Near-Death Studies provides a platform for exploring NDEs but has **limited credibility** due to methodological constraints and limited replication. Use JNDS articles to generate hypotheses or provide supportive context, but **prioritize evidence from higher-impact journals and systematic reviews** for clinical or scientific decisions.

Hammes BJ, Rooney BL. Death and End-of-Life Planning in One Midwestern Community. Arch Intern Med. 1998; 158: 383–390. doi: 10.1001/archinte.158.4.383 Results A total of 540 decedents were included in this study. The prevalence of written advance directives was 85%. Almost all these documents were in the decedent's medical record. The median time between advance directive documentation and death was 1. 2 years. Almost all advance directive documents requested that treatment be forgone as death neared. Treatment was forgone in 98% of the deaths. Treatment preferences expressed in advance directives seemed to be consistently followed while making end-of-life decisions.

Excluded from the study were the deaths of those younger than 18 years; individuals who never had been mentally competent in their last 10 years; and adults who died outside the care of the participating health care organizations. The researchers screened all emergency department deaths to determine if the treatment of the decedent in the emergency department was long enough to allow review of the person's preferences by medical staff or if the person was essentially dead on arrival. Chronic causes were other progressive, incurable illnesses that lead to death over many months or years. Sudden causes were diseases in which no previous disease existed and that lead to death rapidly.

No underlying cause existed when a trauma or self-inflicted injury was the cause of death. The researchers had access to a decedent's medical records at all participating organizations. Medical records included all charts at hospitals, clinics, long-term care facilities, hospices, and home health agencies. Data were collected from a decedent's medical record approximately 1 week after death to determine eligibility for the study. Data collected from the medical records included the decedent's exposure to advance directive education, dates of education, and who was present during the education. The medical record was also reviewed for both oral and written advance directives.

Physicians who were identified as being involved in a decedent's end-of-life decisions were sent a survey approximately 1 to 2 weeks after the death of the individual. The physicians were permitted to review the decedent's medical record when answering the self-administered survey if they desired. Nearly 90% of physicians completed and returned their surveys. A total of 135 different physicians responded to the surveys; many had cared for multiple decedents in the study. No significant difference could be found between responders and nonresponders when decedents' data were reviewed. The interviews of proxies were conducted by 2 registered nurses with master's degrees who were trained in the study protocol and had worked extensively in advance directive education. Overall, 77% of proxies agreed to be interviewed. No significant difference between responders and nonresponders could be found when decedents' or proxies' data were reviewed.

### Prevalence and estimated trend in chemotherapy use near death from population-based studies on cancer patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis… [^116hTgKS]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Abstract 6590 Background: Chemotherapy use near death, based on US national guidelines, is an indicator of aggressive treatment and poor quality of end-of-life care. US law also decreased Medicare payments for outpatient CMT since 2005–2006. To evaluate the impact of US payment reform and guidelines on CMT use at EOL, we estimated and compared the overall prevalence of CMT use at EOL in the US and other countries as well as before and after 2007 in the US. Methods: Six databases were systematically searched to January 2017 for population-based studies of CMT use at EOL for patients in all cancer groups. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Overall CMT use prevalence was pooled by a random-effects model. Differences in prevalence of CMT use were compared by meta-regression between subgroups. Results: We identified 9 and 7 articles from the US and non-US countries, respectively.

CMT was provided to 28. 9%,
23. 2%, 10. 0%, and
4. 5% of cancer patients in their last 6, 3, and 1 months as well as 14 days of life, respectively. CMT use in the last 6 months was more common in the US than in non-US countries but similar to that of other countries in the last month and last 14 days of life. Prevalence of CMT use in the last 14 days of life in the US did not differ significantly before and after 2007. Conclusions: Many cancer patients worldwide receive CMT at EOL, and the prevalence of CMT use in US patients' last 14 days of life was virtually unchanged over time. Effective interventions should be developed and provided to offset the trend of continuing CMT use at EOL.

### Consciousness [^114ou7BY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

WHAT HAPPENS TO CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THE TIME OF DEATH?

The near-death experience has been reported since antiquity and was more formally described in the psychology literature of the 1970s. For the most part, the phenomenology of these experiences is culturally invariant. What is happening at this border of life and death, the known and unknown? It has been argued that a noncorporeal basis for consciousness is the only way humans could experience such vivid phenomenology, consistently described as "realer-than-real", in the setting of clinical death or coma.

These metaphysical questions seem far removed from the realm of anesthesiology, but they are not. First, prospective epidemiological studies published in highly regarded, peer-reviewed journals indicate that 9% to 18% of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients, who are often cared for by anesthesiologists, report near-death experiences. Second, precipitous increases in the Bispectral Index around the time of death have been reported in dying patients in the operating room and critical care unit. Third, analytical techniques used to characterize anesthetic state transitions have demonstrated, in highly controlled animal studies, that some neural correlates of consciousness surge just after experimental cardiac or respiratory arrest. Characterizing the neurobiology of the dying brain and determining whether near-death brain states can sustain conscious experience will have wide-ranging implications from neuroscience to biomedical ethics to religion. Anesthesiologists are well positioned to study this both experimentally and clinically.

Methods and materials

Study design and reporting system

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by synthesizing peer-reviewed articles. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) was used to report the findings (Table S 1).

Search strategies

This study considered studies published before October 31, 2023. Searches were performed from October 1–31, 2023 using electronic databases, namely PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Directory of Open Access Journals, and Google Scholar. Medical subject heading (MeSH) with Boolean operators (AND and OR) and truncation were employed to connect the keywords: maternal near miss, maternal morbidity, risk factors and Africa. A search strategy used for PubMed was: ((((((((epidemiology [All Fields]) OR (prevalence[All Fields])) OR (level[All Fields])) OR (magnitude[All Fields])) OR (proportion[All Fields])) OR (incidence[All Fields])) AND (((((((((maternal near miss[All Fields]) OR (maternal near-miss[All Fields])) OR (severe maternal outcome*[All Fields])) OR (pregnancy complication*[All Fields])) OR (life-threatening condition*[All Fields])) OR (maternal morbidit*[All Fields])) OR (Severe maternal complication*[All Fields])) OR (maternal mortality[All Fields])) OR (maternal death[All Fields]))) AND ((((determinant*[All Fields]) OR (factor*[All Fields])) OR (predictor*[All Fields])) OR (Associated factor*[All Fields]))) AND ((Africa*[All Fields]) OR (Sub-Saharan Africa*[All Fields])) Search strategies used across the database with their example are presented in the supplementary material (Table S 2).

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^117SrzVR]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Near-death experiences have been reported since antiquity and have profound clinical, scientific, philosophical, and existential implications. The neurobiology of the near-death state in the mammalian brain is characterized by surges of gamma activity, as well as enhanced coherence and communication across the cortex. However, correlating these neurophysiologic findings with experience has been elusive. Future approaches to understanding near-death experience mechanisms might involve psychedelic drugs and computational modeling. Clinicians and scientists in anesthesiology have contributed to the science of near-death experiences and are well positioned to advance the field through systematic investigation and team science approaches.

### Research involving the recently deceased: ethics questions that must be answered [^1166GMLM]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2024). Medium credibility.

Research involving recently deceased humans that are physiologically maintained following declaration of death by neurologic criteria-or 'research involving the recently deceased'-can fill a translational research gap while reducing harm to animals and living human subjects. It also creates new challenges for honouring the donor's legacy, respecting the rights of donor loved ones, resource allocation and public health. As this research model gains traction, new empirical ethics questions must be answered to preserve public trust in all forms of tissue donation and in the practice of medicine while respecting the legacy of the deceased and the rights of donor loved ones. This article suggests several topics for immediate investigation to understand the attitudes and experiences of researchers, clinical collaborators, donor loved ones and the public to ensure research involving the recently deceased advances ethically.

### Nursing team composition and mortality following acute hospital admission… [^115RXjV8]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

1. Contextual Data for Participating Trusts. Objective To explore the association of the composition of the nursing team with the risk of patient deaths. Design, Setting, and Participants This patient-level longitudinal observational study was conducted in 185 wards in 4 acute hospital trusts in England between April 2015 and March 2020. Eligible participants were patients with an overnight stay and nursing staff on adult inpatient wards. Data analysis was conducted from month April 2022 to June 2023. The primary outcome was death within 30 days of admission. Mixed-effect Cox proportional hazards survival models were used. Results. This cohort study was approved by the Health Research Authority and the University of Southampton Ethics Committee.

The research was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki16; written informed consent was not required because data was deidentified with no reasonable possibility of identifying any living person. Patients in the National Health Service have the option of opting out of use of their data in this fashion for research purposes. Reporting followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. We used anonymized patient records and nurse roster data from 4 acute hospital trusts in England from April 2015 to March 2020 to explore longitudinal associations of staffing levels and staff-mix with outcomes. The trusts were diverse in many respects, including size and teaching status. Eligible patients were those with elective and emergency admissions with an overnight stay in an adult medical, surgical, or intensive care ward.

The primary outcome was death from all causes within 30 days of admission. We used details in the patient record to calculate an estimated risk of death using the published Summary Hospital Mortality Indicator model, 17, 18 based on age, diagnosis, method of admission and comorbidities. We applied the April 2019 model, developed from national data for the previous 3 years, which coincided with the study period. We identified days when a patient experienced staffing below expected, using days below the mean HPPD as the primary threshold, with other thresholds above and below the mean tested in a sensitivity analysis.

We focused analysis on exposures that occurred during the first 5 days of the hospital stay, accounting for the majority of the stay for most patients, although we assessed the sensitivity of results using longer and shorter exposure periods. We used mixed-effect Cox proportional hazards survival models to handle time-varying covariates because patients experience daily variations in staffing during their hospital stay. 21 In all models, patient case-mix adjustment was undertaken using the SHMI risk score, with ward included as a random effect to account for unmeasured ward-level factors. Models without staffing factors gave good concordance. The assumption of proportional hazards was examined by graphing scaled Schoenfeld residuals and was reasonable for the staffing variables.

In the study of consciousness, the so-called explanatory gap is how we bridge the physical properties of the brain with the first-person feelings of experience. The explanatory gap exists even assuming a perfectly healthy brain and only a single pixel of subjectivity (e.g. the experience of a single photon in an otherwise dark room). However, this gap widens considerably in the case of near-death experiences, during which the brain is hypofunctional in the context of near-death physiology, while the subjective experience is seemingly among the richest accessible to humans. This is precisely why some posit that there is no scientific bridge that can cross the even wider explanatory gap represented by near-death experiences.

Neural Correlates of Consciousness

The modern science of consciousness emerged in the early 1990s. One of the first formal research programs to be proposed in this new science was the identification of the minimal set of neuronal events and mechanisms sufficient for a specific conscious percept, commonly referred to as the "neural correlates of consciousness". Although there has been considerable progress over the past three decades, major controversies remain unresolved. Most notably, there is still active debate as to whether prefrontal cortex is involved in generating phenomenological content of consciousness or whether it serves only for postperceptual cognitive processing. Indeed, a number of prominent theoretical frameworks for consciousness hinge on the role of prefrontal cortex. Two are of particular relevance for the consideration of near-death experiences: integrated information theoryand the global neuronal workspace hypothesis.

### Guiding principles for the conduct of observational critical care research for coronavirus disease 2019 pandemics and beyond: the Society of Critical Care Medicine discovery viral infection and respiratory illness universal study registry [^114pETd7]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The intent of expedited results review following methods review would be to either verify that the previously reviewed methods were accomplished and that the journal continues to stand behind the study or provide rationale for a change of status to the probationary, methods-based study approval. In this model, both researchers and certified commentators could post comments on the interpretation of the results similar to postpublication peer review currently performed on social media. Along a derived timeline, analysis would be closed and the final manuscript published in the certifying journal. Such a process would combine rigor and efficiency, within the current model of journal- and crowdsource-based research vetting and dissemination, in order to provide more near real-time information to inform clinical practice. The VIRUS team will seek to work with established journals toward achieving these goals. For example, VIRUS investigators may choose to have their project run through traditional publication pathways — or for selected projects in which the investigators and journal are amenable — to pass through the innovation pathway of two-stage peer review and continuously updated results posting (Fig. 3).

INNOVATIVE PEER REVIEW PATHWAYS

Harm can result from the uncritical propagation of spurious findings but also from the delayed dissemination of rigorous research. Posting of nonpeer-reviewed preprints of manuscripts can more rapidly spread information, but without proper vetting, there is a high risk of misinformation. The current system of peer review of manuscripts often provides a check to the promotion of spurious findings but may take weeks or sometimes months to complete. Welsh et al found the median age of data in high impact clinical trials was 3 years. New pathways are needed that combine the rigor of peer review with the speed of preprints. Similar to the idea of "registered reports" advocated by the Center for Open Science to promote sound science through replication, we support a system in which introduction and methods are peerreviewed prior to data analysis. If the proposed methods (and the related assumptions) and sensitivity analyses are deemed rigorous in early peer review, then participating journals may verify the study as having undergone methodological peer review. Studies deemed "acceptable" at the methodological peer review stage could then move forward with posting results in near real time as described under the "Guidance to Limit Random Error". Because even perfect methods need to be well-executed in order to produce valid data, journals would then provide an expedited review of the results. Subsequent peer-review would then primarily focus on the proper execution and testing of assumptions rather than the methodology. This would ideally be completed using full code and data sharing by authors.

Epidemiology of Near-death Experiences

Near-death experiences are difficult to study because they are not unique to a single cause of death. Thus, establishing an incidence is difficult due to the inability to assess near-death experiences systematically in such a wide array of situations (e.g. drowning, trauma) and furthermore because they can sometimes occur during crises that are unrelated to the actual process of dying (e.g. a near-miss motor vehicle accident). Thus, the epidemiology of near-death experiences has focused largely on in-hospital cardiac arrests.

The seminal study of near-death experience incidence in survivors of cardiac arrest was conducted in the Netherlands and published in 2001. This prospective investigation included 344 patients who underwent 509 successful resuscitations. Using what is considered a more liberal scale for near-death experience, 18% of cardiac arrest survivors reported near-death experiences, with no obvious difference in pharmacologic interventions between those who had them and those who did not. Notably, 2-yr outcomes for cardiac arrest survivors with and without near-death experiences demonstrated a transformative effect that affected social attitude, religious attitude, attitude toward death, and an interest in the meaning of life and appreciation of ordinary things.

### How accurate is the 'surprise question' at identifying patients at the end of life? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117DSfAN]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Data synthesis and analysis

A narrative synthesis of the findings from the studies was completed. This included details about the patient population characteristics, clinician characteristics, the format of the SQ, and the outcome (accuracy of SQ).

A quantitative synthesis was completed from those studies where data were available. All authors were contacted if the published data were incomplete or where calculation errors were noted in the published manuscript. Stata v13.0 was used for all analyses.

The accuracy of the SQ was summarised in a 2 × 2 table for each study. The sensitivity (the ability to recognise those who were dying), specificity (the ability to recognise those who were not dying), positive predictive value (PPV, the proportion of patients who died when the clinician predicted dying), and the negative predictive value (NPV, the proportion of patients who survived when the clinician predicted survival) were calculated. The area under the curve (AUROC), also known as the c-statistic value, was calculated. This statistic compares the number of correct estimates (sensitivity) against the number of false estimates (1-specificity). A score of 0.5 indicates a model with poor predictive value, meaning that clinicians are no better than chance at identifying a person nearing the end of their life. An increase in the value (to a maximum score of 1) indicates an increase in the level of clinician accuracy.

The accuracy overall, by timeframe, by profession, and by speciality, was calculated by meta-analysis, using the " metaprop " command in Stata. These data were used to assess heterogeneity of the data synthesis using the I² statistic. Where possible, a sub-analysis of accuracy by clinician profession, patient group, and clinical setting were completed. To account for the 0% and 100% limits, the data obtained were transformed using the Freeman Tukey double arcsine method, and a meta-analysis was completed using the DerSimonian–Laird method with inverse variance weighting and then back transformed to present the percentage accuracy. We examined the impact of the time-frame of the SQ on its diagnostic accuracy. For this analysis, the time frame was categorised into up to 30 days, up to 6 months, and up to 12 months.

Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

### Gender and geographical bias in the editorial decision-making process of biomedical journals: a case-control study [^1146jggM]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Policy implications

The fact that we did not identify evidence of gender inequalities during the editorial decision-making process and reviewers' recommendations for manuscripts sent out for review may be 'reassuring', but gender bias in research production still deserves further attention. There has been a discrepancy for several decades between near sex/gender equity in medical school and graduate institutions in Europe and North America and the existence of gender inequalities in the research production (46.0% and 31.4% women among respectively first and last authors in 2018–2019, respectively 29.4% and 21.1% in COVID-19-related manuscripts during early pandemic). Our results need to be confirmed in a randomised trial where the influence of known and unknown confounding factors can be accounted for. The limited geographical representation among first authors in accepted manuscripts heightens the potential for an inadequate reflection of the opinions of global scientists. More crucially, it may also result in a lack of representation of patients and populations requiring prevention and care. The determinants and implications of lower acceptance of manuscripts from Asian geographical affiliations, and middle to low country-income groups and the intersection with authors' gender need to be further explored to better understand the root cause of the well-established gender inequalities in authorship. Research needs gender and geographical diverse teamsand equitable partnerships with low-resource countries, because they lead to greater visibility (in terms of citations) and high-quality research. Our finding of a positive effect of geographically and gender diverse research teams on publication acceptance has been demonstrated by othersbut this could also reflect 'domestic helicopter research' practices where researchers from high-income countries take the more senior authorship positions. Subjective and hidden factors, such as implicit cognitive biases related to geographical affiliations, might also drive perceptions of study quality and the judgements of peer reviewers and subsequently the final editorial decision, however, they are more difficult to investigate. Anonymising peer review has been proposed to reduce bias against authors but a meta-analysis has shown that it does not affect the quality of peer reviewers' reports; and AI also has the potential to undo the anonymity of blinded peer review. Moreover, open and published peer review which aim to restore trust in the integrity and fairness of the review process through transparency to readers have also been shown not to affect the quality of review. In addition, double anonymising the peer-review process has not been shown to improve geographic diversity among authors, but triple-anonymised peer review (where even the handling editor of a manuscript cannot see the identity of the authors) has provided some evidence of reducing editorial bias in a cardiology journal. Educating faculty members about implicit biases and strategies for overcoming them has provided positive effects on implicit biases surrounding women and leadership in academic medicineand should be extended to geographical implicit bias. As gatekeepers of publication decisions, editors play a crucial role in improving global diversity in research through the acknowledgement of their own potential implicit biases by monitoring sensitive diversity indicators for their peer reviewers and the authors of manuscripts they choose to reject or peer review, to help ensure diversity of knowledge and ideas. They can also promote the systemic detection of implicit biases in reviewers' comments, editors' decisions and the content of the authors' research itself as recently advocated by Nature. Linguistic bias is another barrier for non-native English-speaking researchers, especially from low or middle country-incomes, and can lower the chance of acceptance for publication. Other possible solutions to facilitate the publication of high-quality research in regional languages include the decentralisation of editorial boards, by including, for example, South/Latin American or Chinese board members, publishing articles in regional languages or decentralising the indexing of journals by creating independent citation databases at regional level (for eg, the African Citation Index). Provision of free or low-cost language support services promoted by high country-income universities or other public academic institutions and designed for non-native English-speaking authors is thus desirable. Some journals are starting to experiment with AI-powered scientific writing assistants, and uptake and beneficial effects of using these should be monitored.

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^116GcJi2]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

There has been substantial progress over the past 15 yr toward creating a scientific framework for near-death experiences. It is now known that there can be surges of high-frequency oscillations in the mammalian brain around the time of death, with evidence of corticocortical coherence and communication just before cessation of measurable neurophysiologic activity. This progress has traversed the translational spectrum, from clinical observations in critical care and operative settings, to rigorous study in animal models, and to more recent and more neurobiologically informed investigations in dying patients. But what does it all mean? The surge of gamma activity in the mammalian brain around the time of death has been reproducible and, in human studies, surrogates of corticocortical communication have been correlated with conscious experience. What is lacking is a correlation with experiential content, which is critically important to verify because it is possible that these neurophysiologic surges are not associated with any conscious experience at all. Animal studies preclude verbal report, and the extant human studies have not met the critical conditions to establish a neural correlate of the near-death experience, which would require the combination of (1) "clinical death", (2) successful resuscitation and recovery, (3) whole-scalp neurophysiology with analyzable signals, (4) near-death experience or other endogenous conscious experience, and (5) memory and verbal report of the near-death experience that would enable the correlation of clinical conditions, neurophysiology, and conscious experience. Although it is possible that these conditions might one day be met for a patient that, as an example, is undergoing an in-hospital cardiac arrest with successful restoration of spontaneous circulation and accompanying whole-scalp neurophysiologic monitoring that is not compromised by the resuscitation efforts, it is unlikely that this would be an efficient or reproducible approach to studying near-death experiences in humans. What is needed is a well-controlled model. Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest has been proposed as a model, but one clinical study showed that near-death experiences are not reported after this clinical intervention.

### Manual therapy cures death: I think I read that somewhere [^117Dh18f]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Predatory journals are compromising the scientific credibility of "published" research. Past concerns with predatory journals have included the lack of a peer-review process, lack of an editorial board, and little to no description of the publication's ethical standards. In this editorial, we describe the ease with which bogus information can be published in predatory journals, and outline 3 risks to credible science associated with published information and downstream referencing, which may occur through source amnesia bias.

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^112RjkRW]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the same year, Parnia et al. published a smaller study of 63 patients (number of successful resuscitations unknown) using a more conservative near-death experience scale and found that 6.3% reported them. Again, there was no obvious difference in the pharmacology of resuscitation efforts. More recently, Parnia et al. conducted the AWAreness during REsuscitation (AWARE) studies (AWARE I in 2014 and AWARE II in 2023). AWARE I was a prospective, multicenter observational investigation of cardiac arrest survivors, with 140 patients studied for a stage 1 interview and 101 of those patients who completed stage 2 interviews. Near-death experiences were reported by 9%, with 2% reporting actual awareness of resuscitation events; a much broader group (46%) reported recollection of some experience (e.g. déjà vu, bright lights). AWARE II was a 25-site prospective study that included more objective measures such as audiovisual testing using a computer and headphones, continuous electroencephalography, and cerebral oximetry. There were 567 in-hospital cardiac arrests, of which 53 survived, of which 28 were available for interviews. Of those available for interviews, 21.4% had what was categorized as a transcendent recalled experience of death (a term proposed to replace near-death experience). In summary, near-death experiences and other experiences are common around the time of cardiac arrest and pose a challenge in reconciling apparent behavioral quiescence and a dysfunctional brain with what can be vivid and transformative phenomenology.

### How accurate is the 'surprise question' at identifying patients at the end of life? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137JwtE]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

Data sources and searches

We initially searched the literature using the terms, "surprise question" and "death". Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched. All databases were searched from inception up to the date of the search (November 2016), including papers still being processed by the databases (for exact search terms, see Table 1). In addition, the references of all included studies were checked and authors of papers were contacted to check for any additional papers and for full papers if only an abstract was identified. After contacting the authors of identified papers, it was discovered that our original search strategy had failed to identify one key paper; therefore, the search terms were amended to include "GSF" as a keyword. The search strategy was then re-run on all databases.

Table 1

GSF Gold Standard Framework, TS topic, TX all text

Study selection

All study designs were included.

Inclusion

Studies conducted in human subjects
Studies reporting the use of the SQ

Exclusion

Studies which did not quantify the accuracy of the SQ (or for which this information was not available from study authors)
Studies that collected data retrospectively
Not reported in English

Originally, it was planned to exclude all studies that were in abstract form. However, due to the low number of studies initially identified, and the relative low risk associated with including such data, we opted to be inclusive of all studies. We contacted all authors of abstracts to obtain a full study report. If a full study was not available, abstracts from which relevant data could be extracted were included.

Quality assessment

The quality of studies was assessed with the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. This scale was selected due to the nature of the studies included (non-randomised controlled trial, observational). The raters met and discussed each domain of the scale, completed one study using the scale, and discussed any discrepancies or difficulties that were identified before completing the assessment on all studies. In order to provide a full account of the accuracy of the SQ, no study was excluded based on the risk of bias score alone; however, if possible, it was planned to undertake a sensitivity analysis to account for the effect of poor quality studies. Each paper was assessed by two individual raters (NW and NK). Any discrepancies were resolved by a meeting of the two reviewers, with a third reviewer (PS) being included if the discrepancy was unresolved.

### Contemporary accuracy of death certificates for coding prostate cancer as a cause of death: is reliance on death certification good enough? A comparison with blinded review by an independent cause of death evaluation committee [^111eXu2D]. British Journal of Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

The study's strength was that it was based on large trials, we identified intervention-related deaths, and we successfully masked the trial arm from the expert committee, even though this was reported to be difficult in another trial. Limitations are that the results may not be generalisable beyond the cohorts included in the trials, and the assumption that CoDE results were near perfect in accuracy.

UK death certificates provide a relatively accurate means for evaluating cause of death that would be acceptable for routine public health monitoring and large-scale epidemiological studies. In the context of randomised controlled trials, the potential for even a small amount of misattribution bias that is differential by trial arm means that an independent cause of death evaluation is likely to be necessary to provide unbiased outcome data.

### A neuroscientific model of near-death experiences [^112yT7h9]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Near-death experiences (NDEs) are episodes of disconnected consciousness that typically occur in situations that involve an actual or potential physical threat or are perceived as such, and the experiences are characterized by a rich content with prototypical mystical features. Several explanatory theories for NDEs have been proposed, ranging from psychological or neurophysiological to evolutionary models. However, these concepts were often formulated independently, and, owing to the fragmented nature of research in this domain, integration of these ideas has been limited. Lines of empirical evidence from different areas of neuroscience, including non-human studies, studies investigating psychedelic-induced mystical experiences in humans, and research on the dying brain, are now converging to provide a comprehensive explanation for NDEs. In this Review, we discuss processes that might underlie the rich conscious experience in NDEs, mostly focusing on prototypical examples and addressing both the potential psychological mechanisms and neurophysiological changes, including cellular and electrophysiological brain network modifications and alterations in neurotransmitter release. On the basis of this discussion, we propose a model for NDEs that encompasses a cascade of concomitant psychological and neurophysiological processes within an evolutionary framework. We also consider how NDE research can inform the debate on the emergence of consciousness in near-death conditions that arise before brain death.

### Near death experiences in cardiac arrest: visions of a dying brain or visions of a new science of consciousness [^1122HTBC]. Resuscitation (2002). Low credibility.

Very little is known about the dying process and in particular the state of the human mind at the end of life. Cardiac arrest is the final step in the dying process irrespective of cause, and is also the closest physiological model of the dying process. Recent studies in cardiac arrest survivors have indicated that although the majority of cardiac arrest survivors have no memory recall from the event, nevertheless approximately 10% develop memories that are consistent with typical near death experiences. These include an ability to 'see' and recall specific detailed descriptions of the resuscitation, as verified by resuscitation staff. Many studies in humans and animals have indicated that brain function ceases during cardiac arrest, thus raising the question of how such lucid, well-structured thought processes with reasoning and memory formation can occur at such a time. This has led to much interest as regards the potential implications for the study of consciousness and its relationship with the brain, which still remains an enigma. In this article, we will review published research examining brain physiology and function during cardiac arrest as well as its potential relationship with near death experiences during this time. Finally, we will explore the contribution that near death experiences during cardiac arrest may make to the wider understanding of human consciousness.

### Stakeholders' perspectives on the post-mortem use of genetic and health-related data for research: a systematic review [^113cWx87]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our study is not without limitations. To start, the number of articles that met inclusion criteria was relatively small, and several included studies only minimally considered the situation after death. Studies were not only few, but also limited to the field of genetics, as discussed above. While our search strategy encompassed all types of health-related data, retrieved studies only considered genetic data and mostly in the context of returning actionable findings. Second, comparability of included studies may be limited. This is due to questions being differentially worded, which slightly changes their meaning (e.g. "should vs. may" results be "disclosed vs. offered vs. returned" to "relatives vs. next-of-kin"?). Comparison between studies was also potentially limited because while some authors investigated actual choices made, others used hypothetical scenarios to gauge people's opinions. Third, our findings may lack generalizability both across and within studies. Limiting the search to articles published in English has produced mostly studies from North America, some parts of Europe and Australia, while cultural attitudes towards death and the use of data or material, as well as already existing legal and ethical frameworks may differ widely internationally. Within included studies, bias may have been introduced by the substantial overrepresentation of white people over 40 years old, the small sample sizes, specific settings (i.e. mostly cancer research), and the fact that individuals choosing to participate in these studies may already have positive attitudes towards research. Future studies should involve larger and more diverse groups of participants in terms of age, ethnicity, nationality and setting.

### Management of patients with internal carotid artery near-total occlusion: an updated meta-analysis [^1168TAg5]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The decision for revascularization in patients with near-total internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion still remains controversial. We undertook an extensive review of the literature and conducted a meta-analysis aiming to investigate the appropriate therapeutic approach for patients with near-total ICA occlusion.

Methods

A multiple electronic health database search was performed on all articles published up to December 2014. All available data were analyzed giving emphasis on the applied therapeutic approach (best medical therapy [BMT], carotid endarterectomy [CEA], and carotid artery stenting [CAS]), whereas the main endpoints of the meta-analysis were transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, stroke-related death, myocardial infarction (MI), major adverse event (MAE), overall mortality, and restenosis.

Results

Five articles on BMT and CEA, 8 articles on CEA, and 11 articles on CAS were deemed eligible. A statistically significant difference was recorded in pooled stroke incidence rates (IRs) per 100 patient-years (p-ys) of BMT (IR = 6.19) compared with CEA (IR = 2.24, P = 0.002) and CAS (IR = 1.64, P < 0.001) studies. No statistically significant differences were recorded in pooled IRs per 100 p-ys between CEA and CAS, concerning TIA (P = 0.96), stroke (P = 0.44), stroke-related death (P = 0.30), and MAE (P = 0.99), whereas a borderline significance was recorded concerning overall mortality (P = 0.08) and restenosis (P = 0.08). No nominally significant effects were demonstrated with respect to almost all the studied potential modifiers in meta-regression analysis among the eligible studies.

Conclusions

An intervention is probably indicated for patients with near-total ICA occlusion. The results of our study underline the need for including patients with near-total ICA occlusion in future randomized controlled trials. Meanwhile, the treatment of these patients should be individualized.

### How quickly do systematic reviews go out of date? A survival analysis [^113NCztG]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Systematic reviews are often advocated as the best source of evidence to guide clinical decisions and health care policy, yet we know little about the extent to which they require updating.

Objective

To estimate the average time to changes in evidence that are sufficiently important to warrant updating systematic reviews.

Design

Survival analysis of 100 quantitative systematic reviews.

Sample

Systematic reviews published from 1995 to 2005 and indexed in ACP Journal Club. Eligible reviews evaluated a specific drug or class of drug, device, or procedure and included only randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled trials.

Measurements

Quantitative signals for updating were changes in statistical significance or relative changes in effect magnitude of at least 50% involving 1 of the primary outcomes of the original systematic review or any mortality outcome. Qualitative signals included substantial differences in characterizations of effectiveness, new information about harm, and caveats about the previously reported findings that would affect clinical decision making.

Results

The cohort of 100 systematic reviews included a median of 13 studies and 2663 participants per review. A qualitative or quantitative signal for updating occurred for 57% of reviews (95% CI, 47% to 67%). Median duration of survival free of a signal for updating was 5.5 years (CI, 4.6 to 7.6 years). However, a signal occurred within 2 years for 23% of reviews and within 1 year for 15%. In 7%, a signal had already occurred at the time of publication. Only 4% of reviews had a signal within 1 year of the end of the reported search period; 11% had a signal within 2 years of the search. Shorter survival was associated with cardiovascular topics (hazard ratio, 2.70 [CI, 1.36 to 5.34]) and heterogeneity in the original review (hazard ratio, 2.15 [CI, 1.12 to 4.11]).

Limitation

Judgments of the need for updating were made without involving content experts.

Conclusion

In a cohort of high-quality systematic reviews directly relevant to clinical practice, signals for updating occurred frequently and within a relatively short time.

### End-of-life experiences in the dying process: scoping and mixed-methods systematic review [^116ggpwS]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Methods

The initial goal was to perform just a ScR of ELE, in accordance with the protocol registered in the Open Science Framework. However, based on the preliminary results, we became aware of the importance of performing a synthesis of the evidence and an evaluation of the methodological quality of the primary studies, with a view to providing a more substantial contribution to the development of this field of study. Therefore, both an ScR and an MMSR were performed.

Both reviews were conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for ScRand for MMSR, respectively, also observing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statementand the PRISMA Extension for ScR (PRISMA-ScR). The construction of the research question for quantitative studies was carried out using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) and, for the qualitative studies, the PICo (Population, Phenomenon of interest and Context). The ScR research question was 'What scientific literature is available regarding ELE?'. The MMSR questions were: (1) What is the prevalence of the various types of ELE found in the literature? (2) Is there any evidence available about the impact of the various forms of ELE on the process of dying? and (3) What are the perceptions of patients, relatives and professionals concerning ELE and the explanations thereof?.

Search strategy

In 2021, in the months of September and November, we performed a search of nine electronic databases: Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scielo, Virtual Health Library Regional Portal (BVS), OpenGrey, DART-Europe and the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations. No language filters were applied. The keywords used in the search were as follows (online supplemental material I): (end of life phenomena) OR (end-of-life experience) OR (end-of-life dreams and visions) OR (hallucinations near death) OR (deathbed*) OR (terminal lucidity) OR (paradoxical lucidity) OR (awareness near death). All the key terms were in English, with the exception of the Brazilian Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations database, where the Portuguese language was used.

### End-of-life experiences in the dying process: scoping and mixed-methods systematic review [^1173c3k4]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

There have been reports in diverse cultures, throughout history and in the literature, of ELEs experienced by people of both sexes, of all ages, socioeconomic status, occupations, with different diseases, places of death and religious/spiritual beliefs. In the 19th and 20th centuries, a number of attempts were made to conduct more systematic studies into these ELEs by researchers like Gurney et al, James Hyslop (1907), Ernesto Bozzano (1923), Barrett, Osis and Haraldsson. However, it is only recently that the scientific study of these experiences has resurfaced.

Despite being a somewhat common phenomenon at the end of life, ELEs have still not been studied to the same degree as near-death experiences (NDEs). Both experiences are part of the universal, human phenomenon we know as death, characterised as structured and complex mental activity in a dying brain. However, unlike NDE, where the patient is close to death but recovers, ELE is experienced by people who do actually die.

### A guide to performing a peer review of randomised controlled trials [^116JUksB]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Is the quality good enough? Check for major flaws

Among the things that editors have to decide, one of the most essential is whether a paper is fatally flawed. This means that, whatever else – even if a fascinating topic, and beautifully crafted in breathless prose – a critical problem may mean it cannot be published, even with complete overhaul. The word 'fatal' implies no hope of resuscitation. Sometimes what appears to be a fatal flaw may actually be inadequate reporting (for example, not reporting ethical approval or trial registration), in which case, stop the review until this is addressed with the authors of the paper (through the editorial office of course – never directly with the authors). The Editor/editorial office may ask the authors to provide more information to resolve the impasse. Some journals screen for certain types of fatal flaws before sending papers for review; others do not. If the issue is not inadequate reporting and there is truly a fatal flaw, stop. There is nothing else necessary to comment on. Focus your report on that fatal flaw; however, do mention that you did not review the remainder of the paper. Your responsibility as a peer reviewer ends when you describe how it is not possible to repair this paper. Bear in mind that what is a 'fatal' flaw can be quite subjective and will vary between journals, editors, and reviewers. What some believe is fatal, others may see as a major flaw that is reparable in some way.

Major flaws are serious flaws that must be addressed before publication can be considered appropriate. Some examples of major flaws, that are applicable to many study designs, are provided in Box 1.

### Relation of study quality, concordance, take home message, funding, and impact in studies of influenza vaccines: systematic review [^112GsKt2]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

In the studies we included, poor methodological quality was associated with a discrepancy between results and conclusions, and this in turn was associated with optimistic conclusions in non-government sponsored studies. We found no direct association between these findings and industry funding, but this might have been affected by the sizeable number of studies with undeclared sponsors (23%).

Studies partly or completely sponsored by industry, however, were published in more prestigious journals and are probably cited more, although their methodological quality and size were similar. Some of these findings might help to explain the continuation of a near global policy, despite growing doubts as to its scientific basis.

We reasoned that the combined impact factor and citation index would give us a good idea of the circulation and dissemination of the study (that is, the interest its publication generated). Most of our studies (70%) were of poor quality with overoptimistic conclusions — that is, not supported by the data presented. Those sponsored by industry had greater visibility as they were more likely to be published by high impact factor journals and were likely to be given higher prominence by the international scientific and lay media, despite their apparent equivalent methodological quality and size compared with studies with other funders. Although differences in citation index by study funding are sensitive to the inclusion of the large number of studies with undeclared sources of funding, the higher impact factor and citation index are probably a reflection of a higher profile of industry sponsored studies and a more thorough dissemination of their content.

### End-of-life experiences in the dying process: scoping and mixed-methods systematic review [^117BAKrZ]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Data extraction

All data were extracted from the included reports by two independent reviewers (TOS and HGR) using the data extraction instrument developed by the reviewers (online supplemental material II). The data extracted for the ScR included specific details about the authors, year, country, terminology and report types in the included reports. In the MMSR, for the quantitative studies and the quantitative component of the mixed-methods studies (MMS), the extracted data included specific details about the populations, geographical location, phenomena of interest, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question. For the qualitative studies and the qualitative component of the MMS, extracted data included specific details about the population, setting, geographical location, study methods and the phenomenon of interest relevant to the review question. Additionally, some bibliometric characteristics of the included studies were accessed through the electronic database Scopus: (A) main authors; (B) author's h-index; (C) total number of author's publications; (D) total number of author's citations; (E) main journals and (F) CiteScores of main journals. Any disagreements arising between the reviewers were resolved through discussion (TOS, HGR and AMA).

Assessment of methodological quality of studies included in the MMSR

A quality assessment was used to check for bias and to confirm the integrity of the data collected from the studies selected for the MMSR. Quantitative papers and the quantitative component of MMS, plus the qualitative papers and the qualitative component of MMS selected for retrieval, were assessed by two independent reviewers (TOS and HGR) for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review, using the JBI standardised critical appraisal tools. Any disagreements arising between the reviewers were resolved through discussion (TOS, HGR and AMA). For each JBI standardised critical appraisal tool, a score was arrived at based on the number of methodological characteristics in the study, for a classification of quality as good, fair or poor. Whenever a characteristic was not applicable to the study, this classification was reworked for the total number of remaining characteristics. Only studies evaluated as possessing good or fair quality were included in the MMSR.

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^114j6FAR]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The near-death experience has been reported since antiquity and is often characterized by the perception of light, interactions with other entities, and life recall. Near-death experiences can occur in a variety of situations, but they have been studied systematically after in-hospital cardiac arrest, with an incidence of 10 to 20%. Long attributed to metaphysical or supernatural causes, there have been recent advances in understanding the neurophysiologic basis of this unique category of conscious experience. This article reviews the epidemiology and neurobiology of near-death experiences, with a focus on clinical and laboratory evidence for a surge of neurophysiologic gamma oscillations and cortical connectivity after cardiac and respiratory arrest.

### Towards replicability and sustainability in cancer research [^114hXZie]. BJC Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Cancer research is certainly not immune to these dark trends. A systematic replication trial as early as 2012 of what were deemed landmark cancer biology experiments exposed an alarming finding – that only 6 of the 53 experiments, approximately 11% those analysed, had replicable results. A 2021 replication effort of preclinical cancer research which looked at 193 experiments in 53 high-impact published works came to a somewhat disquieting conclusion: most papers failed to report vital statistics and methodology, and none of the experiments had been reported in sufficient detail for replicators to validate the experiment directly. When authors were contacted, they were frequently unhelpful or chose not to respond. Of the papers ultimately assessed, 67% required modification to the published protocol to even undertake.

Much of this is presumably due to ineptitude with data, reporting, or methodological rigour rather than anything untoward. But not every questionable result in cancer research can be considered so benign. Searching for 'cancer' on the RetractionWatch database, a repository of retracted scientific papers, lists 2874 retracted cancer papers to June 2024, the majority of which were not pulled for the scientific record for innocent error, but for classic 'fraud' in the form of falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism (FFP). The last two years alone yields some deeply unedifying reports, from a slew of cancer research articles retracted in an authorship-for-sale scheme to the Federal Office of Research Integrity banning researchers from faculty to the director of cancer centres for " recklessly reporting falsified and/or fabricated data ".

Despite its life-or-death importance to patients, spurious results in cancer science are alarmingly ubiquitous, causing harm by misleading research efforts down unfruitful avenues. This does not just create research waste, it can in the extreme render research projects and even entire fields unsustainable endeavours. In this perspective, we will elucidate some of the practices that render results unreliable, factors that might make research non-replicable, and how we might strive towards a more sustainable research climate. Some of the factors leading to non-sustainability in research are shown in Fig. 1 and discussed herein.

### Qualitative methods in end-of-life research: recommendations to enhance the protection of human subjects [^114HEMDQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Qualitative research has the potential to contribute important new knowledge to care near the end of life, but research is often hampered by questions about how best to protect dying patients and their family members who serve as research subjects. Due to lack of familiarity with the techniques of ethnographic or observational research, as well as concerns about the vulnerability of the dying, members of Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are often unable to evaluate the benefits and potential harms of studies. In addition, policies derived from standards based on interventional medical research or clinical trials may be applied inappropriately. We offer comprehensive recommendations aimed at improving the translation of human subjects guidelines into meaningful protections for subjects in qualitative studies, including education for IRBs. Policies must be flexible and should be guided by empirical findings documenting the actual impact of research participation, rather than a priori assumptions about patient vulnerability. Sensitive topics, such as drug use, may require added protections.

### Reminding peer reviewers of reporting guideline items to improve completeness in published articles: primary results of 2 randomized trials [^112j11KD]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Strengths and Limitations

Several studies have been conducted to assess whether specific interventions can improve reporting completeness in published articles, however, most of these studies did not use a randomized design. Our intervention was purposely designed so that it could easily be implemented by journals at low cost if shown to be effective. Conducting 2 trials in parallel allowed us to generate high-quality evidence to answer the question of whether this low-cost intervention of reminding peer reviewers of the most important reporting items could improve reporting completeness in published articles. The following limitations are worth mentioning. First, we do not know what input the intervention had on manuscripts that were not published. In theory, it would have been possible that the intervention had an impact on the acceptance rate, which would have distorted the balance of baseline characteristics between the intervention and control groups. However, given that we did not find a difference in acceptance and rejection rates between the groups and that the baseline characteristics of included manuscripts were well balanced, we are reassured that we can trust the findings of our primary outcome. Furthermore, from the perspective of the readers of journal articles and the publishing journal, one could also argue that only the reporting quality of manuscripts that are actually published is relevant. Nevertheless, to get a better understanding of the impact of the intervention on manuscripts that were not published, we plan an in-depth qualitative study to assess peer reviewer comments from a subsample of randomized manuscripts (both accepted and rejected) to investigate whether manuscripts having more comments about inadequate reporting were more frequently rejected. Second, it is possible that we had a ceiling effect with little room for improvement in reporting quality. This might have occurred in CONSORT-PR, for which we found moderate to good reporting (nearly 70%), but not for SPIRIT-PR, for which the reporting was below 50%. Furthermore, we did not observe higher mean proportions of adequate reporting than we expected in our sample size calculations (eAppendix 4 in Supplement 3). Third, because of technical restrictions, we could not implement our reminder to peer reviewers within the general instructions that they receive from the journal when accepting the review invitation. It is possible that the peer reviewers did not notice the additional email or received the email too late. However, because of our daily screening activities, we were able to send the intervention email in a timely manner, and there was only 1 manuscript in the intervention group for which the peer reviewers did not receive the email in time (eTable 4 in Supplement 3). Fourth, although we collaborated for these 2 trials with 7 journals (convenience sample of journals in general medicine as well as specialist journals), we cannot be certain that the results would be the same in other journals (eg, journals with a higher proportion of industry-sponsored trials). Nonetheless, we believe that the peer review process is comparable in most biomedical journals and that the pool of peer reviewers is not completely different, so we would expect similar findings. In addition, when we consider our subgroup analyses stratified by impact factor, even though we found differences in the overall reporting, the effect of the intervention remained the same (ie, the intervention did not have an effect).

### Stakeholders' perspectives on the post-mortem use of genetic and health-related data for research: a systematic review [^115YGFss]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

Search strategy

We systematically searched for studies eligible for inclusion in this review using the following electronic databases: PubMed (including MEDLINE), CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science. In addition, reference lists of included studies were manually searched to find other potentially relevant citations, and forward reference searching was used to identify potential articles citing the included studies. Our search encompassed studies published in English up to 31 December 2018. No lower limit was used to restrict publication date.

The search strategy contained synonyms and sub-topics — in the form of database-specific subject headings as well as free terms — of the following concepts: post-mortem; health-related and genetic data; research ethics; stakeholders; preferences. These synonyms were discussed among the research team beforehand in order to facilitate finding all relevant papers, such as those discussing different types of stakeholders (e.g. research participants, relatives and the general public). The full search strategy is available in Supplementary Table S1 online.

Eligibility criteria

The list of retrieved studies was first screened on the basis of title and abstract, and subsequently by reviewing the full text of each of the articles selected during the previous round. Screening was done independently by two researchers (HA and MARB) who discussed the results until an agreement was reached. Studies were considered to be eligible for inclusion if they: (a) discussed the sharing or (re-)use, after the research participant's death, of genetic and health-related data obtained while the participant was still alive; (b) explored the perspectives or experiences of stakeholders regarding this process; (c) were empirical in nature. We chose to include both quantitative and qualitative studies, in order to enumerate acceptability levels while also enabling understanding of underlying reasons.

Articles were excluded if they were: (a) a systematic review; (b) an editorial, letter, case description or other type of descriptive article with no empirical data; (c) a discussion of attitudes towards data being used for clinical or forensic purposes instead of research; (e) a description of perspectives on the use of data obtained after the death of the research subject; (d) not written in English. No exclusions were made based on age, sex, ethnicity or any other characteristic of participants.

### What would it take to die well? A systematic review of systematic reviews on the conditions for a good death [^111VmuZG]. The Lancet: Healthy Longevity (2021). High credibility.

The medicalisation of life under the influence of health-care systems, focused on curing diseases, has made dying well challenging. This systematic review identifies common themes from published systematic reviews about the conditions for a good death as a means to guide decisions around this universal event. MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo, and AMED were searched for citations with "good death" or "dying well" in their titles on Sept 23, 2020, and complemented with backward reference and forward citation screening with Google Scholar. Articles published in peer-reviewed journals in any language were included. Articles that focused on the identification of conditions for a good death and described how primary studies were sought and selected were also included. Data on general characteristics, quality, and themes were extracted independently. 13 of 275 potentially eligible reviews were included. Common themes were dying at the preferred place, relief from pain and psychological distress, emotional support from loved ones, autonomous treatment decision making, avoidance of futile life-prolonging interventions and of being a burden to others, right to assisted suicide or euthanasia, effective communication with professionals, and performance of rituals. No reviews specified the meaning or timing of death, connected themes, or prioritised them. Vague jargon was often used to describe complex concepts. Most conditions for a good death could be offered to most dying people, without costly medical infrastructure or specialised knowledge. Efforts to describe these conditions clearly, to identify whether there are exceptions or missing items, and whether they apply in non-dominant settings (ie, outstide institutional, affluent, anglophone, and Christian settings) are needed.

### Reliable assessment of the effects of treatment on mortality and major morbidity, I: clinical trials [^1158C7od]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

This two-part review is intended principally for practising clinicians who want to know why some types of evidence about the effects of treatment on survival, and on other major aspects of chronic disease outcome, are much more reliable than others. Although there are a few striking examples of treatments for serious disease which really do work extremely well, most claims for big improvements turn out to be evanescent. Unrealistic expectations about the chances of discovering large treatment effects could misleadingly suggest that evidence from small randomised trials or from non-randomised studies will suffice. By contrast, the reliable assessment of any more moderate effects of treatment on major outcomes — which are usually all that can realistically be expected from most treatments for most common serious conditions — requires studies that guarantee both strict control of bias (which, in general, requires proper randomisation and appropriate analysis, with no unduly data-dependent emphasis on specific parts of the overall evidence) and strict control of random error (which, in general, requires large numbers of deaths or of some other relevant outcome). Past failures to produce such evidence, and to interpret it appropriately, have already led to many premature deaths and much unnecessary suffering.

### A scoping review of the mechanisms underlying developmental anesthetic neurotoxicity [^11376FHk]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

POTENTIAL CONFOUNDS IN COMPARING FINDINGS FROM ANIMAL AND HUMAN STUDIES

One major potential difference between animal and human studies is the degree of physiological control, which complicates interpretation of species differences. Differences in their outcomes might not be due to differences in the exposures or species effects per se, but rather might reflect differences in the physiological control during the exposure. Participants in human studies were surgical patients who had intensive intraoperative physiological monitoring and care during their anesthetic exposure. In contrast, very few animal studies exercise that level of care. A meta study of animal experiments reported that most research (439 of 732 studies, 60.0%) did not use any physiological monitoring and thus almost certainly did not provide any physiological control during anesthetic exposure. Rodent studies are also often conducted by researchers who have far less training than a pediatric anesthesiologist on anesthetic induction, maintenance, and recovery.

Death of otherwise healthy animals is an obvious indicator of poor physiological control, but many animal experiments under-report mortality. A systematic review of stroke and cancer experiments estimated 42% of studies did not report animal deaths. Even if neurotoxicity experiments have lower death rates than these, studies of survivors might still be reporting on the effects of uncontrolled physiology and near-fatal experiments, rather than on the results of clinical anesthetic exposures.

For example, 2 studies of P7 rats exposed to the same anesthetic mixture (midazolam, N 2 O, isoflurane) reported wildly divergent mortality rates (0%vs 80%). In response to the widely recognized underreporting problem, the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines were developed to ensure researchers include sufficient details when reporting animal studies. Unfortunately, these guidelines have been adopted slowly.

### Causes, nature and toxicology of fentanyl-associated deaths: a systematic review of deaths reported in peer-reviewed literature [^112atCba]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1226 records were screened of which 17 studies were included (Figure 1). Of the 17 included articles, eight were case reports and nine were case series (see Table 1). The quality of reporting of included case studies was generally good. Demographic characteristics, patient history, clinical presentation, adverse events and take away lessons were clearly provided in most articles. Patient history, however, was either unclear or not reported in only three (37.5%) of eight articles. The quality of case series was variable with a lack of clear inclusion criteria and analyses plans (Tables 2 and 3).

Demography

A total of 1969 deaths were reported in included studies. Most deaths occurred in North America with United States reporting the highest number of deaths (n = 1738), followed by Canada (n = 112) and Mexico (n = 96). Outside North America, deaths were reported in Western Europe including Germany (n = 11) and Nordic regions including Sweden (n = 9) and Norway (n = 9) (Table 1). Recent cases were identified from Far East Asia, Japan (n = 1). The study conducted by Nara et al, was the first forensic autopsy report to be undertaken in Japan. Where ethnicity was reported, most of the deaths were reported among whites 1024 (56.1%) followed by blacks 719 (39.38%) and Hispanics 77 (4.22%). The majority of the patients who were reported dead were males 1456 (75.83%).

### Are pre-hospital trauma deaths preventable? A systematic literature review [^112bPdwd]. World Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The first and largest peak of trauma mortality is encountered on the trauma site. The aim of this study was to determine whether these trauma-related deaths are preventable. We performed a systematic literature review with a focus on pre-hospital preventable deaths in severely injured patients and their causes.

Methods

Studies published in a peer-reviewed journal between January 1, 1990 and January 10, 2018 were included. Parameters of interest: country of publication, number of patients included, preventable death rate (PP = potentially preventable and DP = definitely preventable), inclusion criteria within studies (pre-hospital only, pre-hospital and hospital deaths), definition of preventability used in each study, type of trauma (blunt versus penetrating), study design (prospective versus retrospective) and causes for preventability mentioned within the study.

Results

After a systematic literature search, 19 papers (total 7235 death) were included in this literature review. The majority (63.1%) of studies used autopsies combined with an expert panel to assess the preventability of death in the patients. Pre-hospital death rates range from 14.6 to 47.6%, in which 4.9–11.3% were definitely preventable and 25.8–42.7% were potentially preventable. The most common (27–58%) reason was a delayed treatment of the trauma victims, followed by management (40–60%) and treatment errors (50–76.6%).

Conclusion

According to our systematic review, a relevant amount of the observed mortality was described as preventable due to delays in treatment and management/treatment errors. Standards in the pre-hospital trauma system and management should be discussed in order to find strategies to reduce mortality.

### Moving cancer immunotherapy forward through the… [^111EwiPq]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Throughout the 6 years of the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer 's (JITC) existence, the field of cancer immunotherapy has changed dramatically. In 2013, when the journal was founded, no programmed death (PD)-1 inhibitors had yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the first study of CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in ALL patients was just published, and cancer immunotherapy was named the 'Breakthrough of the Year' by Science magazine. Since then, the field has experienced an explosion of developments, with well over 50 FDA-approved cancer immunotherapy indications and nearly 45% of patients with cancer falling within one of those indications.

It is therefore an exciting time for JITC and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). The field itself has been growing at a breathtaking pace, making great strides in the realization of SITC's mission — to make cancer immunotherapy a standard of care and the word 'cure' a reality for patients with cancer everywhere. JITC has been a key player in these developments by disseminating groundbreaking results in foundational tumor immunology and clinical cancer immunotherapy. The high value that JITC brings to the oncology field has been recognized by numerous scholarly publishing entities, including Clarivate Analytics, whose designation of an 8.728 journal impact factor has placed JITC within the ranks of the top oncology and immunology peer-reviewed journals.

### How accurate is the 'surprise question' at identifying patients at the end of life? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115HwdbE]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Selection

The studies identified from the database searches were screened by two reviewers independently (NW and NK). The first selection criterion was that the abstract/title included the use of the SQ. Any study not meeting this criterion was excluded. At full review, studies were selected for inclusion if they reported a quantifiable measure of the accuracy of the SQ (e.g. the proportion of patients correctly identified as being in the last year of life, as opposed to a qualitative assessment such as "the SQ performed well"). Any discrepancies at either selection point were resolved by a meeting between the two reviewers. If unresolved, a third reviewer (PS) was consulted.

Extraction

The following data were extracted from each paper:
A description of the study population (both patient and clinician)
The format of the SQ that was used in the study (e.g. the length of time to which the SQ related, or whether the SQ referred to expected survival or expected death)
The accuracy of the SQ (i.e. how many people who were identified as likely to die, did actually die)

### Consciousness and the dying brain [^1162nXnY]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Psychedelic drugs provide an opportunity to study near-death experience–like phenomenology and neurobiology in a controlled, reproducible setting. Dimethyltryptamine, a potent psychedelic that is endogenously produced in the brain and (as noted) released during the near-death state, is one promising technique. Administration of the drug to healthy volunteers recapitulates phenomenological content of near-death experiences, as assessed by a validated measure as well as comparison to actual near-death experience reports.

Of direct relevance to anesthesiology, one large-scale study comparing semantic similarity of (1) approximately 15,000 reports of psychoactive drug events (from 165 psychoactive substances) and (2) 625 near-death experience narratives found that ketamine experiences were most similar to near-death experience reports. Of relevance to the neurophysiology of near-death states, ketamine induces increases in gamma and theta activity in humans, as was observed in rodent models of experimental cardiac arrest. However, there is evidence of disrupted coherence and/or anterior-to-posterior directed functional connectivity in the cortex after administration of ketamine in rodents, monkeys, and humans. This is distinct from what was observed in rodents and humans during the near-death state and requires further consideration. Furthermore, psilocybin causes decreased activity in medial prefrontal cortex, and both classical (lysergic acid diethylamide) and nonclassical (nitrous oxide, ketamine) psychedelics induce common functional connectivity changes in the posterior cortical hot zone and the temporal parietal junction but not the prefrontal cortex. Once true correlates of near-death or near-death–like experiences are established, leveraging computational modeling to understand the network conditions or events that mediate the neurophysiologic changes could facilitate further mechanistic understanding.

### Brief resolved unexplained events (formerly apparent life-threatening events) and evaluation of lower-risk infants [^11748BDs]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — language cues and definitions: Strong and moderate recommendations are associated with "should" and "should not" statements, whereas a weak recommendation may be recognized by "may" or "need not". A strong recommendation means the benefits of the recommended approach clearly exceed the harms (or, for a strong negative recommendation, the harms clearly exceed the benefits) and the supporting evidence quality is excellent; clinicians are advised to follow such guidance unless a clear and compelling rationale for acting in a contrary manner is present. A moderate recommendation means the committee believes benefits exceed harms (or harms exceed benefits for a negative recommendation) but the evidence on which the recommendation is based is not as strong, and clinicians are encouraged to follow such guidance while remaining alert to new information and sensitive to patient preferences. A weak recommendation means the existing evidence quality is suspect or well-designed, well-conducted studies have shown little clear advantage to one approach versus another, offering clinicians flexibility in decision-making, although boundaries on alternatives may be set.

### Consistency of near-death experience accounts over two decades: are reports embellished over time? [^113tq842]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Aim

"Near-death experiences", commonly reported after clinical death and resuscitation, may require intervention and, if reliable, may elucidate altered brain functioning under extreme stress. It has been speculated that accounts of near-death experiences are exaggerated over the years. The objective of this study was to test the reliability over two decades of accounts of near-death experiences.

Methods

Seventy-two patients with near-death experience who had completed the NDE scale in the 1980s (63% of the original cohort still alive) completed the scale a second time, without reference to the original scale administration. The primary outcome was differences in NDE scale scores on the two administrations. The secondary outcome was the statistical association between differences in scores and years elapsed between the two administrations.

Results

Mean scores did not change significantly on the total NDE scale, its 4 factors, or its 16 items. Correlation coefficients between scores on the two administrations were significant at P < 0.001 for the total NDE scale, for its 4 factors, and for its 16 items. Correlation coefficients between score changes and time elapsed between the two administrations were not significant for the total NDE scale, for its 4 factors, or for its 16 items.

Conclusion

Contrary to expectation, accounts of near-death experiences, and particularly reports of their positive affect, were not embellished over a period of almost two decades. These data support the reliability of near-death experience accounts.

### Causes, nature and toxicology of fentanyl-associated deaths: a systematic review of deaths reported in peer-reviewed literature [^116L5tXQ]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. The quality of case studies and case series included in this article are variable and results should therefore be interpreted with caution. The opioid epidemic is a large-scale problem involving several synthetic opioids and only one of which was investigated here. Also, fentanyl itself has many different analogues of varying potency which were not investigated in this review. The study population of this review was only restricted to the adult population. Children have been reported to have died via fentanyl exposure in some studies. Studies that were published in non-indexed journals and unpublished reports were also not included in this review which could have proved valuable sources of information.

### Speed of updating online evidence based point of care summaries: prospective cohort analysis [^116NrWQu]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

We selected all the systematic reviews signalled by the American College of Physicians (ACP) Journal Club and Evidence-Based Medicine Primary Care and Internal Medicine from April to December 2009. These two literature surveillance journals survey a wide range of international medical journals, applying strict criteria for the quality and validity of research articles. Practising clinicians assess studies that meet the basic validity criteria for relevance of clinical implications for practice and newsworthiness and a summary is then produced for the top rated articles. In the same period (April to December 2009) we selected all the Cochrane systematic reviews labelled as "conclusion changed" in the Cochrane Library. These are new citation versions of updated reviews that warrant additional highlighting in the Cochrane Library (for example, with a flag), indicating that they should be read again. We assumed that this sampling frame was representative of systematic reviews that meet explicit quality standards and are deemed directly relevant to clinical practice.

To evaluate how fast point of care summaries are updated we used a prospective cohort design over a one year period from June 2009 to May 2010. The follow-up started two months after the collection period to allow the potential citation of the most recent systematic reviews. Two reviewers independently checked whether each sampled systematic review was cited in at least one chapter of the five point of care information summaries. This was done monthly at the same time for each product. Disagreements were resolved by discussion between the two reviewers.

For each systematic review we defined "birth" as the publication date in one of the two literature surveillance journals or in the Cochrane Library and "death" (that is, event) as its citation in the monitored summaries. When the two reviewers agreed on the inclusion of that evidence in a summary the follow-up for that systematic review was terminated by the event. We censored systematic reviews when they had not been cited by the end of follow-up or if there was clear evidence that the topic was not covered by a given summary, similar to losses at follow-up in survival analyses. Two independent reviewers defined loss to follow-up. We excluded citations in additional reference lists, such as further or external readings and alert systems. We kept an archive of all the reference web pages citing the sampled systematic reviews.

### Full publication of results initially presented in abstracts [^1139Y1eS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Abstracts of presentations at scientific meetings are usually available only in conference proceedings. If subsequent full publication of results reported in these abstracts is based on the magnitude or direction of the results, publication bias may result. Publication bias creates problems for those conducting systematic reviews or relying on the published literature for evidence about health and social care.

Objectives

To systematically review reports of studies that have examined the proportion of meeting abstracts and other summaries that are subsequently published in full, the time between meeting presentation and full publication, and factors associated with full publication.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, reference lists, and author files. The most recent search was done in February 2016 for this substantial update to our earlier Cochrane Methodology Review (published in 2007).

Selection Criteria

We included reports of methodology research that examined the proportion of biomedical results initially presented as abstracts or in summary form that were subsequently published. Searches for full publications had to be at least two years after meeting presentation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We calculated the proportion of abstracts published in full using a random-effects model. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using risk ratio (RR), with multivariable models taking into account various characteristics of the reports. We assessed time to publication using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.

Main Results

Combining data from 425 reports (307,028 abstracts) resulted in an overall full publication proportion of 37.3% (95% confidence interval (CI), 35.3% to 39.3%) with varying lengths of follow-up. This is significantly lower than that found in our 2007 review (44.5%. 95% CI, 43.9% to 45.1%). Using a survival analyses to estimate the proportion of abstracts that would be published in full by 10 years produced proportions of 46.4% for all studies; 68.7% for randomized and controlled trials and 44.9% for other studies. Three hundred and fifty-three reports were at high risk of bias on one or more items, but only 32 reports were considered at high risk of bias overall. Forty-five reports (15,783 abstracts) with 'positive' results (defined as any 'significant' result) showed an association with full publication (RR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.40), as did 'positive' results defined as a result favoring the experimental treatment (RR = 1.17; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.28) in 34 reports (8794 abstracts). Results emanating from randomized or controlled trials showed the same pattern for both definitions (RR = 1.21; 95% CI 1.10 to 1.32 (15 reports and 2616 abstracts) and RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.32 (13 reports and 2307 abstracts), respectively. Other factors associated with full publication include oral presentation (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.40 to 1.52; studied in 143 reports with 115,910 abstracts); acceptance for meeting presentation (RR = 1.65; 95% CI 1.48 to 1.85; 22 reports with 22,319 abstracts); randomized trial design (RR = 1.51; 95% CI 1.36 to 1.67; 47 reports with 28,928 abstracts); and basic research (RR = 0.78; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.82; 92 reports with 97,372 abstracts). Abstracts originating at an academic setting were associated with full publication (RR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.34 to 1.92; 34 reports with 16,913 abstracts), as were those considered to be of higher quality (RR = 1.46; 95% CI 1.23 to 1.73; 12 reports with 3364 abstracts), or having high impact (RR = 1.60; 95% CI 1.41 to 1.82; 11 reports with 6982 abstracts). Sensitivity analyses excluding reports that were abstracts themselves or classified as having a high risk of bias did not change these findings in any important way. In considering the reports of the methodology research that we included in this review, we found that reports published in English or from a native English-speaking country found significantly higher proportions of studies published in full, but that there was no association with year of report publication. The findings correspond to a proportion of abstracts published in full of 31.9% for all reports, 40.5% for reports in English, 42.9% for reports from native English-speaking countries, and 52.2% for both these covariates combined.

Authors' Conclusions

More than half of results from abstracts, and almost a third of randomized trial results initially presented as abstracts fail to be published in full and this problem does not appear to be decreasing over time. Publication bias is present in that 'positive' results were more frequently published than 'not positive' results. Reports of methodology research written in English showed that a higher proportion of abstracts had been published in full, as did those from native English-speaking countries, suggesting that studies from non-native English-speaking countries may be underrepresented in the scientific literature. After the considerable work involved in adding in the more than 300 additional studies found by the February 2016 searches, we chose not to update the search again because additional searches are unlikely to change these overall conclusions in any important way.

### Diagnosing dying: an integrative literature review [^114yhWTf]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Review process and quality assurance

Once the 23 papers for inclusion were identified, the eight reviewers were paired and each pair reviewed 5–6 studies through extracting key data and findings using a preformatted table (see online supplementary table S1). This was an important part of the quality assurance process as ensuring all reviewers used a consistent approach to data extraction. Reviewers first read their allocated studies independently then agreed findings with a partner, which were presented in a summary table. This produced 23 summaries, one for each included study. We used the SIGN hierarchy of evidence to assign a quality rating to the papers in order to allow us to draw conclusions and make an overall judgement about the quality of evidence available in the field. All reviewers received detailed summaries of all the included papers and then participated in the refinement of themes and a conceptual framework initially developed by three reviewers (CK, CG and PBY). Robust methods were employed throughout the review, with analysis an ongoing and iterative process involving all team members. This included two full-team consensus meetings via teleconference, in addition to ongoing dialogue and feedback via email.

### Continuous sedation (CS) until death: mapping the literature by bibliometric analysis [^114jMStQ]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2013). Low credibility.

Context

Sedation at the end of life, regardless of the nomenclature, is an increasingly debated practice at both clinical and bioethical levels. However, little is known about the characteristics and trends in scientific publications in this field of study.

Objectives

This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the scientific publications on continuous sedation until death.

Methods

Four electronic databases (MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO®) were searched for the indexed material published between 1945 and 2011. This search resulted in bibliographic data of 273 published outputs that were analyzed using bibliometric techniques.

Results

Data revealed a trend of increased scientific publication from the early 1990s. Published outputs, diverse in type (comments/letters, articles, reviews, case reports, editorials), were widely distributed across 94 journals of varying scientific disciplines (medicine, nursing, palliative care, law, ethics). Most journals (72.3%) were classified under Medical and Health Sciences, with the Journal of Pain and Symptom Management identified as the major journal in the field covering 12.1% of the total publications. Empirical research articles, mostly of a quantitative design, originated from 17 countries. Although Japan and The Netherlands were found to be the leaders in research article productivity, it was the U.K. and the U.S. that ranked top in terms of the quantity of published outputs.

Conclusion

This is the first bibliometric analysis on continuous sedation until death that can be used to inform future studies. Further research is needed to refine controversies on terminology and ethical acceptability of the practice, as well as conditions and modalities of its use.

### Optimal strategies to consider when peer reviewing a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ckKK5]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Systematic reviews come in all types of shapes and sizes; there are several reporting guidelines that can facilitate the peer review process. Peer reviewers should ensure that they provide the authors with a brief summary of their report, followed by a review of any fatal/major flaws detected or any other concerns; posing these concerns as questions and clarifications to the authors is far better than being accusatory or rude. Peer reviewers play an important role in helping ensure that published systematic reviews are of the highest possible quality. In practical terms, this means that the systematic review should be completely and transparently reported and that the methods can be reproduced by interested readers.

### Reliable assessment of the effects of treatment on mortality and major morbidity, II: observational studies [^113dQZuW]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Observational studies and randomised trials can contribute complementary evidence about the effects of treatment on mortality and on major non-fatal outcomes. In particular, observational studies have an important role in the identification of large adverse effects of treatment on infrequent outcomes (ie, rare, but serious, side-effects) that are not likely to be related to the indications for (or contraindications to) the treatment of interest. Such studies can also provide useful information about the risks of death and disability in particular circumstances that can help to generalise from clinical trials to clinical practice. But, due to their inherent potential for moderate or large biases, observational studies have little role in the direct assessment of any moderate effects of treatment on major outcomes that might exist. Instead, sufficiently large-scale evidence from randomised trials is needed to assess such treatment effects appropriately reliably. Wider appreciation of the different strengths and weaknesses of these two types of epidemiological study should increase the likelihood that the most reliable evidence available informs decisions about the treatments doctors use — and patients receive — for the management of a wide range of life-threatening conditions.

### Stakeholders' perspectives on the post-mortem use of genetic and health-related data for research: a systematic review [^113HMbAy]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

This lack of information may lead to incorrect assumptions among biobank participants about what happens to their data when they pass away. Moreover, in certain settings (e.g. medical emergencies) it is impossible to obtain prospective consent for the use of data for research, which causes uncertainty among researchers regarding the use of data when people die before consent could be obtained. Furthermore, even if consent has been asked during the participant's lifetime, this consent cannot be renewed for secondary uses of data, i.e. when substantial changes to the research project and its aims are made after the participant's death.

In light of these issues, two main ethical questions arise. Firstly, it can be questioned whether post-mortem use and sharing of identifiable research data is ethically permissible at all. When research participants have not been asked to consent to post-mortem use of their data, does this mean that researchers should not be allowed to use the data, or, at the other end of the spectrum, that no restrictions are needed given the apparent impossibility of harm to the dead participant? This question is of particular significance in genetic research, because through its sensitive nature and unique identifiability, genetic research data may give rise to privacy and discrimination concerns among living relatives even after the initial data subject has passed away. However, the expanding availability of genome and exome sequencing analyses also generate a growing number of potentially clinically actionable findings that could be beneficial for blood relatives to know. Should these individual research findings be communicated to relatives of the deceased? A related question is whether it is desirable, and to what extent, that, through informed consent, research participants or their relatives are granted control over the post-mortem uses and sharing of data, including individual research results.

### Transition from meeting abstract to full-length journal article for randomized controlled trials [^1151TJAb]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Not all research presented at scientific meetings is subsequently published and, even when it is, there may be inconsistencies between these results and what is ultimately printed. Although late-breaking trials sessions are now integrated into several major scientific meetings and the results are often promptly and prominently communicated, no studies have examined the publication fate and degree of consistency between meeting abstracts or presentations and subsequent full-length article publications for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) presented at these sessions.

Objective

To compare RCT abstracts presented in the late-breaking trials session vs other sessions at a major scientific meeting and subsequent full-length publications.

Design

RCTs were identified by hand searching abstract proceedings booklets and related Web sites for the American College of Cardiology scientific meetings (1999–2002). Subsequent full-length articles were identified via electronic databases.

Main Outcome Measures

Publication fate and degree of consistency between meeting abstract results and subsequent full-length publication results.

Results

The 86 late-breaking RCTs were significantly larger (median, 2737 patients vs 896; P < .001), were more likely to be preceded by a published design paper (27 [31%] vs 13 [13%]; P = 0.002), had higher quality scores when eventually published (mean Jadad score 2.69 vs 2.19; P = 0.01), and were less likely to report favorable results for the intervention than the 100 randomly chosen comparison RCTs presented in other sessions (50 [58%] vs 75 [75%]; P = 0.01; odds ratio 0.46; 95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.90). RCTs presented at the late-breaking trials sessions were significantly more likely to be published (79 [92%] vs 69 [69%]; P < .001) and appeared earlier after presentation (median 11.5 months vs 22.0 months; P < .001) than RCTs presented in other sessions, an association that persisted even after adjusting for sample size, conclusion of study, and RCT design: adjusted hazard ratio, 1.80 (95% confidence interval, 1.24–2.61). Sixty (41%) of the 148 RCTs that were subsequently published exhibited discrepancies between the efficacy estimate reported in the meeting abstract vs the one reported in the full-length article for the primary outcome. The mean change in effect was 0.44 SDs and in 20 cases (14%), the point estimate was statistically significant in only 1 member of the pair. The discrepancy rate was the same for late-breaking RCTs as for RCTs presented in other American College of Cardiology sessions (P = 0.92).

Conclusions

Late-breaking trials were larger, more likely to be preceded by a design paper, and less likely to report positive results than RCTs presented at other sessions, but discrepancies between the meeting abstract results and subsequent full-length publication results were common even for late-breaking trials.

### Reviews pooling heterogeneous, low-evidence, high-bias data result in incorrect conclusions: but heterogeneity is an opportunity to explore [^114yMXRz]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Systematic Review submissions to our journal commonly pool heterogeneous studies of low levels of evidence and a high risk of bias. Pooling, or quantitative synthesis, of such study data regularly results in incorrect conclusions. We reject these submissions without peer-review (desk rejection), and typically invite authors to submit a new, subjective synthesis without pooling and to report ranges of the results of included studies rather than pooled values. Generally, quantitative synthesis, or meta-analysis, should restrict included studies to randomized controlled trials. However, systematic review with exploration of heterogeneity can result in valuable information toward determining strengths and deficiencies of current literature, and thus guide future research.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We will follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Cochrane's Methodological Expectations of Cochrane Intervention Reviews (MECIR) for searching. First, we will conduct a pre‐search for MEDLINE to review the primary search results. Keywords will be collected with an Information Specialist's opinions, literature review, and controlled vocabulary (APA Thesaurus, CINAHL Headings, MeSH, Emtree). We will not limit the search by adding specific outcomes so that we can include all outcomes.

Next, we will search the following databases:

Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley);
Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to present);
Embase (ProQuest Dialog) (1974 to present);
Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost) (1937 to present);
PsycINFO (APA PsycNet) (1967 to present);
ClinicalTrials.gov (ProQuest Dialog);
World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP).

There will be no date/time, language, document type, or publication status limitations on the search. We will use the existing search filters for RCTs for each database to include the study design. The search strategies developed for each database are reported in Supplementary material 1.

Searching other resources

We will check the Sociofile database and the following websites: National Palliative Care Research Center, Children's Hospice International, Canadian Virtual Hospice, International Society of Paediatric Oncology, and European Association for Palliative Care to find relevant studies. We will meticulously scrutinize the reference lists of all included studies, guidelines, and pertinent reviews for potentially relevant studies. Furthermore, we will engage with leading authors in the field, directly seeking insights into any unpublished or ongoing trials. We will track amendments, errata, and retractions by:

checking the source journal's website for updates linked to included studies;
reviewing entries in Retraction Watch Database and PubMed's 'retracted publication' filter;
verifying records in platforms such as CrossMark and Scopus, which flag post‐publication updates.

### 2020 APHRS / HRS expert consensus statement on the investigation of decedents with sudden unexplained death and patients with sudden cardiac arrest, and of their families [^112M5PBp]. Heart Rhythm (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA recommendation system — applying Class of Recommendation (COR) and Level of Evidence (LOE) is defined as follows: Class 1 (strong) "Benefit > > > Risk", with suggested phrases including "Is recommended", "Is indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", "Should be performed/administered/other", and comparative phrases "Treatment/strategy A is recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "Treatment A should be chosen over treatment B". Class 2a (moderate) "Benefit > > Risk", with "Is reasonable", "Can be useful/effective/beneficial", and comparative phrases "Treatment/strategy A is probably recommended/indicated in preference to treatment B" and "It is reasonable to choose treatment A over treatment B". Class 2b (weak) "Benefit ≥ Risk", with "May/might be reasonable", "May/might be considered", and "Usefulness/effectiveness is unknown/unclear/uncertain or not well-established". Class 3: No Benefit (moderate) "Benefit = Risk", with "Is not recommended", "Is not indicated/useful/effective/beneficial", and "Should not be performed/administered/other". Class 3: Harm (strong) "Risk > Benefit", with "Potentially harmful", "Causes harm", "Associated with excess morbidity/mortality", and "Should not be performed/administered/other". LOE categories include Level A with "High-quality evidence‡ from more than 1 RCT", "Meta-analyses of high-quality RCTs", and "One or more RCTs corroborated by high-quality registry studies"; Level B-R (Randomized) with "Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more RCTs" and "Meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs"; Level B-NR (Nonrandomized) with "Moderate-quality evidence‡ from 1 or more well-designed, well-executed nonrandomized studies, observational studies, or registry studies" and "Meta-analyses of such studies"; Level C-LD (Limited Data) with "Randomized or nonrandomized observational or registry studies with limitations of design or execution", "Meta-analyses of such studies", and "Physiological or mechanistic studies in human subjects"; and Level C-EO (Expert Opinion) with "Consensus of expert opinion based on clinical experience". The table notes that "COR and LOE are determined independently (any COR may be paired with any LOE)".

### Primary outcomes for resuscitation science studies: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^112mg4Qk]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The guidelines presented in this consensus statement are intended to serve researchers, clinicians, reviewers, and regulators in the selection of the most appropriate primary outcome for a clinical trial of cardiac arrest therapies. The American Heart Association guidelines for the treatment of cardiac arrest depend on high-quality clinical trials, which depend on the selection of a meaningful primary outcome. Because this selection process has been the subject of much controversy, a consensus conference was convened with national and international experts, the National Institutes of Health, and the US Food and Drug Administration.

Methods

The Research Working Group of the American Heart Association Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee nominated subject leaders, conference attendees, and writing group members on the basis of their expertise in clinical trials and a diverse perspective of cardiovascular and neurological outcomes (see the online-only Data Supplement). Approval was obtained from the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee and the American Heart Association Manuscript Oversight Committee. Preconference position papers were circulated for review; the conference was held; and postconference consensus documents were circulated for review and comments were invited from experts, conference attendees, and writing group members. Discussions focused on (1) when after cardiac arrest the measurement time point should occur; (2) what cardiovascular, neurological, and other physiology should be assessed; and (3) the costs associated with various end points. The final document underwent extensive revision and peer review by the Emergency Cardiovascular Care Committee, the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee, and oversight committees.

Results

There was consensus that no single primary outcome is appropriate for all studies of cardiac arrest. The best outcome measure is the pairing of a time point and physiological condition that will best answer the question under study. Conference participants were asked to assign an outcome to each of 4 hypothetical cases; however, there was not complete agreement on an ideal outcome measure even after extensive discussion and debate. There was general consensus that it is appropriate for earlier studies to enroll fewer patients and to use earlier time points such as return of spontaneous circulation, simple "alive versus dead", hospital mortality, or a hemodynamic parameter. For larger studies, a longer time point after arrest should be considered because neurological assessments fluctuate for at least 90 days after arrest. For large trials designed to have a major impact on public health policy, longer-term end points such as 90 days coupled with neurocognitive and quality-of-life assessments should be considered, as should the additional costs of this approach. For studies that will require regulatory oversight, early discussions with regulatory agencies are strongly advised. For neurological assessment of post-cardiac arrest patients, researchers may wish to use the Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale for global outcomes.

Conclusions

Although there is no single recommended outcome measure for trials of cardiac arrest care, the simple Cerebral Performance Categories or modified Rankin Scale after 90 days provides a reasonable outcome parameter for many trials. The lack of an easy-to-administer neurological functional outcome measure that is well validated in post-cardiac arrest patients is a major limitation to the field and should be a high priority for future development.

### Top-cited articles in the journal: a bibliometric analysis [^114kdJ1M]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The Journal has had a profound influence in nearly 150 years of publishing. A bibliometric analysis, which uses citation analyses to evaluate the impact of articles, can be used to identify the most impactful papers in the Journal's history.

Objective

The objective was to identify and characterize the top-cited articles published in the Journal since 1920.

Study Design

We used the Web of Science and Scopus databases to identify the most frequently cited articles of the Journal from 1920 through 2018. The top 100 articles from each database were included in our analysis. Articles were evaluated for several characteristics including year of publication, article type, topic, open access, and country of origin. Using the Scopus data, we performed an unadjusted categorical analysis to characterize the articles and a 2 time point analysis to compare articles before and after 1995, the median year of publication from each database list.

Results

The top 100 articles from each database were included in the analysis. This included 120 total articles: 80 articles listed in both and 20 unique in each database. More than half (52%) were observational studies, 9% were RCTs, and 75% were from US authors. When the post-1995 studies were compared with the articles published before 1995, articles were more frequently cited (median 27 vs 13 citations per year, P < .001), more likely to be randomized (14.0% vs 4.8%, P = 0.009), and more likely to originate from international authors (33.3% vs 17.5%, P = 0.045).

Conclusion

Slightly more than half of the top-cited papers in the Journal since 1920 were observational studies and three quarters of all papers were from US authors. Compared with top-cited papers before 1995, the Journal's top-cited papers after 1995 were more likely to be randomized and to originate from international authors.

### Brain death / death by neurologic criteria guidance on communication, objections, pregnancy, and public trust: an AAN position statement [^114mWzNe]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) enhancing public trust — World Brain Death Project (2020) recommendations include that all hospital BD/DNC determination policies should adhere to the most up-to-date national BD/DNC guidelines, that training and continuing education should be required for clinicians involved in BD/DNC determination, and that there is a need for additional research to address knowledge gaps related to BD/DNC determination. The Canadian BD/DNC Clinical Practice Guideline (2023) specifies that any clinician participating in death determination must have the requisite skills, training, and knowledge of death determination processes and procedures, that physicians supervising and interpreting radiologic ancillary investigation for BD/DNC should be trained in neuroradiology with relevant experience, that in all cases of potential organ donation clinicians determining death must not have an association or active involvement in transplant procedures, organ allocation, or the care of the intended transplant recipients, and that a standardized checklist should be used for death determination and documentation.

### Comparison of preprint postings of randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 and corresponding published journal articles: a systematic review [^112LZxKn]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

In a smaller cross-sectional study of 67 observational and interventional studies that were posted as preprints and published as journal articles, there was a discrepancy in results reporting in 44 cases (65.7%), which was similar to our estimate of 65 studies (54.6%). In 2 prior studies of both non–COVID-19 and COVID-19 studies of various designs, the main conclusion was contradictory in 0.5% to 2.2% of preprint and journal article pairs, which is similar to our estimate of 1.7%. In contrast to prior studies, our study focuses on COVID-19 RCTs. As a study design, RCTs should provide high-quality evidence for knowledge synthesis. Our study included preprints when they were first published online and then followed them until journal article publication or end of follow-up, so our study included preprints that were not published as journal articles. These studies would be omitted in prior studies. As a result, our study can describe time to publication and factors associated with a preprint being published in a journal. In addition, our study included a detailed comparison of each preprint and journal article after 2 independent reviewers performed a thorough reading of the full text and supplementary materials and also conducted a risk of bias assessment, which was not done in prior studies. For example, a prior study compared preprint and journal article pairs in terms of the abstract, tables, and figures only. Therefore, our study adds substantially to the existing evidence.

### Full publication of results initially presented in abstracts [^111eUb3V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Abstracts of presentations at scientific meetings are usually available only in conference proceedings. If subsequent full publication of abstract results is based on the magnitude or direction of study results, publication bias may result. Publication bias, in turn, creates problems for those conducting systematic reviews or relying on the published literature for evidence.

Objectives

To determine the rate at which abstract results are subsequently published in full, and the time between meeting presentation and full publication. To assess the association between study characteristics and full publication.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, reference lists, and author files. Date of most recent search: June 2003.

Selection Criteria

We included all reports that examined the subsequent full publication rate of biomedical results initially presented as abstracts or in summary form. Follow-up of abstracts had to be at least two years.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers extracted data. We calculated the weighted mean full publication rate and time to full publication. Dichotomous variables were analyzed using relative risk and random effects models. We assessed time to publication using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.

Main Results

Combining data from 79 reports (29,729 abstracts) resulted in a weighted mean full publication rate of 44.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 43.9 to 45.1). Survival analyses resulted in an estimated publication rate at 9 years of 52.6% for all studies, 63.1% for randomized or controlled clinical trials, and 49.3% for other types of study designs'. ositive' results defined as any 'significant' result showed an association with full publication (RR = 1.30; CI 1.14 to 1.47), as did 'positive' results defined as a result favoring the experimental treatment (RR = 1.17; CI 1.02 to 1.35), and 'positive' results emanating from randomized or controlled clinical trials (RR = 1.18, CI 1.07 to 1.30). Other factors associated with full publication include oral presentation (RR = 1.28; CI 1.09 to 1.49); acceptance for meeting presentation (RR = 1.78; CI 1.50 to 2.12); randomized trial study design (RR = 1.24; CI 1.14 to 1.36); and basic research (RR = 0.79; CI 0.70 to 0.89). Higher quality of abstracts describing randomized or controlled clinical trials was also associated with full publication (RR = 1.30, CI 1.00 to 1.71).

Authors' Conclusions

Only 63% of results from abstracts describing randomized or controlled clinical trials are published in full. 'Positive' results were more frequently published than not 'positive' results.

### Toward understanding death [^1125xcig]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based approaches to preventing child death require evidence; without data on common causes of child mortality, taking effective action to prevent these deaths is difficult at best. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is a potentially powerful, but nascent, technique to obtain gold standard information on causes of death. The Gates Foundation committed to further establishing the methodology and obtain the highest quality information on the major causes of death for children under 5 years. In 2018, the MITS Surveillance Alliance was launched to implement, refine, and enhance the use of MITS across high mortality settings. The Alliance and its members have contributed to some remarkable opportunities to improve mortality surveillance, and we have only just begun to understand the possibilities on larger scales. This supplement showcases studies conducted by MITS Surveillance Alliance members and represents a significant contribution to the cause-of-death literature from high mortality settings.

### Death audits and reviews for reducing maternal, perinatal and child mortality [^112CH6YR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We included cluster randomised trials. However, as these are expensive and difficult to conduct, and large sample sizes are needed to measure impact on mortality, we anticipated that we would find very few. Therefore, we also included cluster non‐randomised trials, studies with a step‐wedge design, controlled before‐and‐after studies and interrupted time series studies.

For cluster randomised trials, cluster non‐randomised trials and controlled before‐and‐after studies, we used the EPOC criteria (EPOC 2017a), and excluded studies with only one intervention or control site. For interrupted time series studies, we excluded studies that did not have a clearly defined point in time when the intervention occurred and at least three data points before and three after the intervention.

Types of participants

Participants receiving the intervention (audits and reviews of maternal, perinatal or child deaths) could be involved with health facilities of any level or the wider community, such as subdistricts or districts, or both. Participants who should benefit from the intervention were pregnant women giving birth, their neonates and their children under five years old at the study sites during the study period in which the outcomes are measured.

Types of interventions

We included any form of death audit or review that involved studying individual cases of maternal, perinatal or child deaths, identifying avoidable factors and making recommendations. We classified the interventions as verbal and social autopsy, facility‐based death audit and SEA, or confidential enquiry. We excluded verbal autopsy studies that evaluated only causes of death and not avoidable factors. We included studies of maternal, perinatal, newborn and child deaths, alone or in combination. We excluded severe morbidity or near‐miss reviews. We included comparisons of the same population before introduction of the death review, or other comparable communities in which the death review was not implemented.

Types of outcome measures

We planned to include studies in the review irrespective of whether measured outcome data were reported in a 'usable' way.

Main outcomes

To be included in the review, a study needed to report at least one of the following outcomes:

perinatal mortality rate;
stillbirth rate;
neonatal mortality rate;
mortality rate in children under five years of age;
maternal mortality rate.

Secondary outcomes

For included studies, we also considered other outcomes:

outcomes relating to maternal severe morbidity, such as maternal near miss or as defined by study authors;
outcomes relating to quality of care in participating facilities;
perinatal morbidity related to suboptimal care;
cost per death averted.

### Ethics guidelines for research with the recently dead [^111j1N25]. Nature Medicine (2005). Excellent credibility.

The objective of the multidisciplinary expert Consensus Panel on Research with the Recently Dead (CPRRD) was to craft ethics guidelines for research with the recently dead. The CPRRD recommends that research with the recently dead: (i) receive scientific and ethical review and oversight; (ii) involve the community of potential research subjects; (iii) be coordinated with organ procurement organizations; (iv) not conflict with organ donation or required autopsy; (v) use procedures respectful of the dead; (vi) be restricted to one procedure per day; (vii) preferably be authorized by first-person consent, though both general advance research directives and surrogate consent are acceptable; (viii) protect confidentiality; (ix) not impose costs on subjects' estates or next of kin and not involve payment; (x) clearly explain ultimate disposition of the body.

### Stakeholders' perspectives on the post-mortem use of genetic and health-related data for research: a systematic review [^1114xzxv]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This literature review is the first to systematically synthesise the empirical literature on the ethical questions around post-mortem use of data for medical research. All studies were published in the last decade, signifying increased awareness of the topic likely correlated with the advancements in DNA sequencing. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were found to be used in ascertaining the views and experiences of patients, relatives, healthy controls, researchers and IRB members about (1) the use of research data after death, and (2) the post-mortem return of individual genetic research results to relatives. We discuss these themes in turn and conclude with some reflections on consent and the desired extent of control regarding post-mortem use of data for medical research.

Post-mortem use of data for research: an underexplored area

Regarding the question of acceptability of post-mortem use of previously collected data for research, we found limited evidence. The four identified studies showed high levels of support among relatives and researchers (no studies were found eliciting views from participants themselves) for using data from the deceased for research purposes. This is in line with the views of living research participants who generally support research using clinical data or samples, and believe the contribution to research outweighs the risks of re-identification or unwanted uses.

Compared with living participants, for the deceased this balance between benefits and risks may be further skewed towards the benefits, given the diminished possibility of harm from data breaches for deceased participants. On the other hand, there seem to be risks for deceased subjects too, given the potential harm to their ante-mortem integrity or changes to their legacy which they cannot correct. While the philosophical debate on whether dead people can be harmed deserves further attention, a full discussion is outside the scope of this article. Of note is that genetic data brings about additional risks in terms of the potential implications for blood relatives sharing genetic traits with the deceased, namely potential practical concerns (e.g. insurance and employment) and psychological harm associated with clinically actionable findings.

In our analysis of empirical studies we found a complete lack of research regarding health-related data outside of genetics, probably because these implications of post-mortem use are most obvious in relation to genetic relatives. However, the focus on genetic data obscures the question whether research participants should have post-mortem informational self-determination as such, independent of whether their data have health implications for their relatives. This question warrants further attention and studies are needed that focus on other types of health data.

### Quality control in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^113Ycse9]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses are being submitted to, and being published by biomedical journals with increasing frequency. In order to maintain the utility of such publications and avoid misguidance it is important that these studies are conducted to a high standard. This article aims to provide guidance both for those researchers undertaking and reporting such studies and for the readers of such articles. Details of a suggested method for conducting a systematic review are given, including methods for literature searches, data abstraction and data extraction followed by a brief overview of common methods used for meta-analyses and the interpretation of the results of meta-analysis.

### Assessment of concordance and discordance among clinical studies posted as preprints and subsequently published in high-impact journals [^113StZRA]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Among 8941 preprints posted on medRxiv, 944 had been subsequently published in a peer-reviewed journal as of our search date. Of these, 47 were clinical studies published in a high-impact journal (Table 1). Most preprint–journal article pairs were retrospective studies (35 of 47 pairs [74%]) and were related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (28 of 47 pairs [60%]).

Table 1.
Characteristics of Clinical Study Preprints on medRxiv With a Corresponding Peer-Reviewed Journal Article in a High-Impact Journal a

Abbreviation: IQR, interquartile range.

Among the 47 preprint–journal article pairs, 46 (98%) reported the same first and senior authors and 36 (77%) had the same total number of authors (Table 2). Most of the pairs had concordant funding statements (39 pairs [83%]) and institutional review board disclosures (44 pairs [94%]). Of the 17 pairs (36%) with discordant conflict of interest statements, there were 8 where only the journal articles contained a conflict of interest disclosure. Among the 44 pairs reporting sample sizes in both sources, 38 were concordant. Sample sizes were larger in the journal articles for nearly all discordant pairs (5 of 6 pairs [83%]).

Table 2.
Concordance Between Clinical Study Preprints and Articles Published in High-Impact Journals

Abbreviations: COI, conflict of interest; IRB, institutional review board.

Overall, 44 preprint–journal article pairs (94%) reported concordant primary end points (Table 2). Ten of 47 pairs (21%) were descriptive (noninferential) studies without clearly comparable numerical results. Among the remaining 37 pairs reporting primary results from inferential analyses, 12 (32%) reported discordant results; 7 had effect estimates that were in the same direction and were statistically consistent. Nearly all pairs (45 of 46 pairs [98%]) with clearly stated study interpretations were concordant, including all pairs with discordant results.

### Near-death experience in survivors of cardiac arrest: a prospective study in the Netherlands [^115KrvbW]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Background

Some people report a near-death experience (NDE) after a life-threatening crisis. We aimed to establish the cause of this experience and assess factors that affected its frequency, depth, and content.

Methods

In a prospective study, we included 344 consecutive cardiac patients who were successfully resuscitated after cardiac arrest in ten Dutch hospitals. We compared demographic, medical, pharmacological, and psychological data between patients who reported NDE and patients who did not (controls) after resuscitation. In a longitudinal study of life changes after NDE, we compared the groups 2 and 8 years later.

Findings

62 patients (18%) reported NDE, of whom 41 (12%) described a core experience. Occurrence of the experience was not associated with duration of cardiac arrest or unconsciousness, medication, or fear of death before cardiac arrest. Frequency of NDE was affected by how we defined NDE, the prospective nature of the research in older cardiac patients, age, surviving cardiac arrest in first myocardial infarction, more than one cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) during stay in hospital, previous NDE, and memory problems after prolonged CPR. Depth of the experience was affected by sex, surviving CPR outside hospital, and fear before cardiac arrest. Significantly more patients who had an NDE, especially a deep experience, died within 30 days of CPR (p < 0.0001). The process of transformation after NDE took several years, and differed from those of patients who survived cardiac arrest without NDE.

Interpretation

We do not know why so few cardiac patients report NDE after CPR, although age plays a part. With a purely physiological explanation such as cerebral anoxia for the experience, most patients who have been clinically dead should report one.

### Evaluating complex interventions in end of life care: the MORECare statement on good practice generated by a synthesis of transparent expert consultations and systematic reviews [^111nLddK]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There are 57 million deaths each year. Despite being a core business of medicine, end of life care (EoLC) is neglected. Although some people have excellent EoLC, many do not die as they would wish. A major barrier is the lack of quality research; treatments, clinical guidelines and services are limited by a lack of evidence. Surveys, qualitative studies and reviews recommend that EoLC research is feasible and ethical but, funding of EoLC research is poor and lacks common research guidance. Thus, randomised trials of EoLC treatments and services remain rare, often limited by poor recruitment, high attrition, bias, confounding and small sample sizes. There are challenges capturing relevant outcomes in frail patients who may lack capacity, raising ethical reservations. Research evaluating EoLC is characterised as too slow, too expensive and frequently not producing useful results. There is a need to improve research methods to evaluate models of service delivery and complex service level interventions in EoLC and identify good research practices to aid future studies. In response, the Methods Of Researching End of Life Care (MORECare) collaboration was established by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) to identify, appraise and synthesise 'best practice' methods for research evaluating EoLC. This paper reports the total integrated results from MORECare and the resulting guidance statement.

### The mortality cost of carbon [^115CVBrk]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We found that our idealized criteria for inclusion in the mortality damage function are quite demanding. A common limiting factor was that studies only covered a limited geographic area, as making a full global climate-mortality projection requires a large and comprehensive historical dataset of human mortality statistics to understand underlying climate-mortality mechanisms (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 for full details). In addition, of the 100 studies surveyed, few attempted to account for adaptation; all the studies that did were published in 2011 or later. The majority of the studies that account for adaptation project it to have a large role in limiting the damage done from climate change.

Although no study perfectly met all five criteria, a few studies came sufficiently close, and these studies were used to construct the mortality damage function. The studies ultimately chosen were a 2014 WHO Report "Quantitative risk assessment of the effects of climate change on selected causes of death, 2030s and 2050s", a 2019 Climate Impact Lab report "Valuing the Global Mortality Consequences of Climate Change Accounting for Adaptation Costs and Benefits", and a 2017 Lancet Planetary Health article "Projections of temperature-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios". Due to their scope, each of these studies were large multi-institution research collaborations between 16, 17, and 45 authors, respectively.

Many of the 97 studies that were not chosen were used indirectly because their data, methodologies, and results were utilized in these three studies. Each of the three chosen studies featured authors who had worked extensively on the climate-mortality relationship and who had authored some of the other 97 papers that were among those surveyed in the systematic research synthesis. Many studies came sufficiently close to meeting the criteria but were excluded because they were either reused by one of the three studies above (Hales et al. (2014)in particular was largely an agglomeration of past studies) or the methods they developed were later applied to a larger dataset that could more accurately capture the global mortality effects of climate change. A more thorough description of each of these three studies, including their advantages and drawbacks, is provided in the Supplementary Materials.

### Maintaining public trust in medical advice-could less Be more? [^111vvfwW]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Cleland JGF. Maintaining Public Trust in Medical Advice — Could Less Be More. JAMA Netw Open. 2022; 5: e2211113. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.11113 The truth of the assertion that "drugs don't work in patients who don't take them, " attributed to the former US Surgeon General C. Everett Coop, may be self-evident, but of course the drug must be effective in the first place. Implementation science investigates methods to help realize the benefits of advances in clinical care. Luepker et al1 are to be congratulated on conceiving and testing a comprehensive educational and interventional campaign designed to increase the uptake of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Minnesota between 2015 and 2019, using surrounding states, where the program was not implemented, as comparators. The campaign failed to increase aspirin uptake.

Only 1 in every 20 people surveyed recalled promotional aspirin messaging and the use of aspirin decreased, both in Minnesota and in the surrounding states. We should learn as much or more from failure than we do from success. The program had an integrated, well-crafted, multipronged approach with educational messages conveyed by advertising on billboards and radio, newspaper articles, an Ask About Aspirin website that received more than 1 million visits, and engagement of more than 1000 primary care physicians and other health care professionals in educational programs. The authors believe that the population was exposed to the aspirin promotional message approximately 24 million times per year. In 2015, only 49% of the people in Minnesota who had an indication for use of primary prevention aspirin, according to US Preventive Service Task Force 2009 guidelines, were receiving it, which was slightly higher than in surrounding states.

By 2020, use of aspirin had decreased both in Minnesota and, to a lesser extent, in the surrounding states. The decrease was temporally associated with the publication of 3 large randomized clinical trials showing either no benefit or harm from use of primary prevention aspirin and was consistent with national guidance, 2, 3 suggesting that many clinicians and patients had acted responsibly in the face of new evidence. Prescribing inertia will have prevented a more profound decrease because people who have taken aspirin for years without obvious problems may be reluctant to change their routine; neither will physicians press them to do so. However, the outcome of the campaign probably would not have been substantially different even in the absence of changes in evidence and guidance, because few of the target audience became aware of the message. What lessons can we learn from this.

First, there is so much supposedly good advice these days on so many health issues that many people probably just ignore all but the most trusted sources of information. In that sense, the results of this implementation study are encouraging. People appear to follow the evidence rather than the media when it comes to health. Being British, I cringe every time I see a US television advertisement for a medical product. I cannot help feeling that many of my US cousins feel the same way. A hard-sell may have negative results, especially when it turns out that the product for sale does not work. The opioid crisis has undermined trust in both regulators and physicians. 4 Many popular films and television series now highlight recent medical misdemeanors. We cannot afford to make more mistakes based on shaky evidence. Second, the public may be smart enough to do the math.

### Maternal death related to COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis focused on maternal co-morbidities and clinical characteristics [^115q7ZYj]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The research protocol was designed a priori, defining methods for searching the literature. The meta‐analysis was conducted complying with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA)and the Meta‐Analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) statement guidelines. The review was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with the ID number CRD42021228455.

2.1 Search strategy and study selection

Five electronic databases (Cochrane Library at the CENTRAL register, Ovid Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Google Scholar) were searched from inception to February 2021. Eligible studies were identified with a combination of the following keywords and/or Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms: "maternal death"; "maternal mortality"; "coronavirus"; "COVID‐19"; "COVID 19"; and "SARS‐CoV‐2". Case reports, case series, prospective cohort studies, and retrospective cohort studies regarding maternal mortality cases due to COVID‐19 and neonatal outcomes were considered eligible if they reported at least one maternal death with the clinical characteristics of the adverse events and if they were published in a peer‐reviewed journal. No language restrictions were applied. Review articles, letters to the editor, non–peer‐reviewed reports, studies with unspecified dates and places of research, suspicion of duplicate reporting and/or unreported data on maternal deaths were excluded from the study. From the selected studies, the references were also evaluated in order to find additional relevant studies.

Titles and abstracts were reviewed separately by two reviewers (MLV and FL) to identify all eligible articles. Full‐text articles were retrieved for further consideration for inclusion. Discrepancies were solved by discussion with a third author (SS).

2.2 Data extraction, quality assessment, and outcome measures

The analyzed data were selected from each relevant study and systematically collected in a database. The following information was obtained: author's name; institution and country; study design; sample size; maternal age; gestational age at admission; symptoms on admission to hospital and the days before; pregnancy co‐morbidity; mode of delivery; acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developed; maternal and neonatal outcomes; chest computed tomography (CT); time between delivery and maternal death; the results of COVID‐19 tests performed on the neonatal population; and the perinatal outcomes. Not all studies reported on all evaluated variables and studies that did not report on a specific outcome were recorded as not reported.

### End-of-life experiences in the dying process: scoping and mixed-methods systematic review [^1148oirL]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2024). High credibility.

Participants, data collection setting and sample size

Quantitative studies were conducted with a number of participants which comprised: patients (n = 7), relatives (n = 3) and a variety of HCPs (n = 9) — nurses, doctors, volunteers, paid caregivers, etc. The principal data collection settings were hospices (47.4%). Qualitative studies were conducted with a number of participants and included: patients (n = 2), relatives (n = 2) and a variety of HCPs (n = 3) — nurses, doctors, social worker, hypnotherapist, professional caregiver, etc of which 43% were collected in palliative care settings. MMS were conducted with a number of participants and included: patients (n = 2), relatives (n = 3) and a variety of HCPs (n = 4) — nurses, doctors, care assistant and end-of-life caregivers. The main data collection settings were hospices and nursing homes (66.7%) (table 2).

There is a large variation in sample size among the studies. In the studies involving patients, three studies report just one case, one describes a series of six cases. In a further six studies, the sample size varies between 25 and 80 patients. The remaining study analysed the case records of 338 patients. Studies with relatives (n = 9) have the largest sample sizes, ranging from 47 to 2021. The majority of studies with HCPs have sample sizes ranging from 4 to 45 (n = 9), from 64 to 187 (n = 4)and 571 to 1708 (n = 2)(see table 2).

Bibliometric characteristics of included studies

The principal authors were Kerr and Grant who, in collaboration with various colleagues, published six studies (seven articles) involving patients and relatives in the USA. Then come Fenwick (the highest h-index, h = 36), with five publications including a sample of HCPs in the UK, of which four were written in conjunction with Brayne. Kellehear, with two publications involving relatives in India and the Republic of Moldova. Most of the papers were published in the American Journal of Hospice and Palliative Care (n = 9, 25%), followed by the Journal of Palliative Medicine and the Omega-Journal of Death and Dying, both having a 13.9% share of publications on ELE (online supplemental material VII).

### Do abstracts in otolaryngology journals report study findings accurately? [^113vXxr3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Although published abstracts have the advantage of being prominent and concise, their quality in the otolaryngology literature has not been studied. We sought to understand the limitations of relying on abstracts as the sole source of information about published research. In addition, we sought to identify specific opportunities for improving the quality of published articles and their associated abstracts.

Methods

Studies of original research published in four major otolaryngology journals from January 2008 to June 2008 were included. Each study article and abstract was reviewed separately for 12 domains relating to study design, results, and conclusions. Good inter-rater reliability was established as part of the validation process.

Results

Four hundred eighteen articles were identified for study, which included 75 percent clinical research and 25 percent basic science. The most common omissions in the abstract when compared with the complete article were study limitations (91% left out of abstract), geographic location (79%), confidence intervals (75%), dropouts or losses (62%), and harms and adverse events (44%). Conversely, the abstract often included information about research design (99%), sample size (92%), source of the data (81%), and quantitative results (67%). These results did not differ significantly with regard to article type, journal, or level of evidence.

Conclusions

Readers of otolaryngology journals may form biased or inappropriate conclusions if they read only the abstract of a study, particularly with regard to study limitations, adverse events, and subject dropouts or losses. These results highlight the perils of using the abstract as a sole source of information.

### Key challenges and ways forward in researching the "good death": qualitative in-depth interview and focus group study [^113PM1Lr]. BMJ (2007). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To understand key challenges in researching end of life issues and identify ways of overcoming these.

Design

Qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with researchers and focus groups with people affected by cancer.

Participants

An international sample of 32 researchers; seven patients with experience of cancer; and four carers in south east Scotland.

Results

Researchers highlighted the difficulty of defining the end of life, overprotective gatekeeping by ethics committees and clinical staff, the need to factor in high attrition rates associated with deterioration or death, and managing the emotions of participants and research staff. People affected by cancer and researchers suggested that many people nearing the end of life do want to be offered the chance to participate in research, provided it is conducted sensitively. Although such research can be demanding, most researchers believed it to be no more problematic than many other areas of research and that the challenges identified can be overcome.

Conclusions

The continuing taboos around death and dying act as barriers to the commissioning and conduct of end of life research. Some people facing death, however, may want to participate in research and should be allowed to do so. Ethics committees and clinical staff must balance understandable concern about non-maleficence with the right of people with advanced illness to participate in research. Despite the inherent difficulties, end of life research can be conducted with ethical and methodological rigour. Adequate psychological support must be provided for participants, researchers, and transcribers.

### Impact of study outcome on submission and acceptance metrics for peer reviewed medical journals: six year retrospective review of all completed glaxoSmithKline human drug research studies [^113Rm8uj]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Industry and, to a lesser extent, academia have been criticized for failing to submit clinical trial data for publication, especially when the results are perceived to be "negative" — that is, unfavorable to the drug under study — leading to publication bias. Despite a commitment by many industry sponsors to publish all research results, failure to publish regardless of outcome adversely impacts the credibility of all industry sponsored research.

Transparent reporting of medical research irrespective of outcome fulfills an ethical obligation to the patients taking part in a trial, advances scientific understanding, and could inform treatment decisions. Although public posting of summary results is now a legal requirement for many types of studies, publication in peer reviewed journals is still considered the ideal form of disclosure as it provides critical context that aids interpretation. Literature surveys carried out since 2010 suggest that 56–85% of trials with study protocols registered onand other public sites were eventually published. There has been wide variance across and within sponsor categories (such as industry, academia, government) and by study outcomes (presence versus absence of significance) in both publication rates as well as time to publication, with a general temporal trend toward increased disclosure rates. Studies lacking statistically significant outcomes were less likely to be published and, when they were published, took a longer time from study completion to publication.

Most literaturesurveys rely on information on public websites (such as) that lack the information necessary to take into account the effect of unsuccessful attempts to publish (that is, journal rejection) on publication rates and time to publish. We analyzed study and publication outcomes using a cohort of all drug trials completed from January 2009 to June 2014 from a single pharmaceutical sponsor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). Since 2009, GSK policy requires that all human research studies of its drug products (whether investigational or marketed) are submitted for journal publication within 18 months of study completion unless exempted. For this analysis, we classified all studies completing during this period (including those not submitted or published) by outcome and hypothesized that there would be no difference in submission rates by study outcomes (per sponsor policy) but that studies with negative outcomes would have lower acceptance rates and require a greater number of submission attempts to be published in peer reviewed medical journals.

### Impact of a web-based tool (webCONSORT) to improve the reporting of randomised trials: results of a randomised controlled trial [^114miJHy]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Published articles reporting on the methodology and results of clinical trials are most often, for all readers, the only way to know how a study was conducted and what the results were. These articles must present accurate, unbiased, and transparent information concerning the methodology and conduct of the trial for the reader to assess the validity, generalizability, and applicability of the trial results.

Many studies have evaluated the quality of reporting in randomised trials in almost every clinical specialty and subspecialty. In nearly every study, the results indicate that many crucial methodological elements are not reported in published reports of randomised trials. For example, in a sample of 616 randomised trials indexed in PubMed in December 2006, the primary endpoint was not defined in 47% of trials, the method used to generate the sequence of randomisation was not reported in 66%, the method used to conceal allocation was not reported in 75%, and the sample size calculation was not reported in 56%. When the tested interventions or studied populations are insufficiently described, reproducing these interventions is impossible, as is assessing the population to which the results may apply. Lack of transparency is a major limiting factor for clinicians wanting to translate best evidence into best practice. It is also a major problem for scientists who perform systematic reviews and meta-analyses as some published trials may have to be excluded because of missing information.

Lack of transparency is mainly the responsibility of the authors of articles, but peer reviewers and journal editors should ensure that the results are based on an appropriate methodology. The CONSORT (CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement, published in 1996 and updated in 2001 and 2010, was designed to improve the transparency and quality of the reporting in clinical trials. It comprises a checklist of 25 items and a flow chart that allows visualisation of the flow of patients through the study, from recruitment to the analysis of the results. This recommendation, endorsed by a considerable number of medical journals, informs not only authors, but also reviewers and editors, about which information should be included in articles to facilitate critical judgment and interpretation of results. A recent systematic review showed that endorsement of the CONSORT Statement by a journal was associated with an improvement in the quality of reporting of randomised trials.

### Taking the pulse of brain death: a meta-analysis of the natural history of brain death with somatic support [^11765mSt]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conversely, other sensational cases in the mass media have not been submitted to the scrutiny of scientific peer review, for several reasons. First, sensational news can be generated by individuals (family members, nonmedical health care staff, physicians without neurological understanding, mass media personnel) who lack the knowledge to differentiate states of altered consciousness (e.g. vegetative state, minimally conscious state, coma, locked‐in syndrome, BD). Second, these news reports of truly misdiagnosed cases of BD are unlikely to be submitted to the scrutiny of the scientific community, because the diagnosing physicians are aware that official diagnostic criteria were not properly executed (Table S1).

Therefore, a global publication bias is plausible and prevents the medical community from precisely discerning, quantifying, and learning from diagnostic fallacies. Hence, a "super partes" governance platform, to which to address anonymous and confidential enquiries bypassing the reluctance of directly involved providers, is warranted. Such governance platforms are, for instance, already available in the UK to inquiry about maternal and perinatal deaths.

Relationship with previous meta‐analyses

A quarter‐century ago, Shewmon published the only other relevant meta‐analysis, which was limited to the cases of chronic BD available at that time. Compared to Shewmon's meta‐analysis, ours adds considerable information, because we added 1535 subjects, we tabulated the data on somatic survival length for some patients who were BD but still surviving at the time of the previous meta‐analysis, and our analysis benefited from advanced statistical analysis.

Limitations

One intrinsic limitation of our meta‐analysis lies in its material: retrospective data from institutional databases and suprainstitutional registries. Reciprocal strengths were (i) correspondence in meta‐analytic results of granular (patient‐level) and aggregated data; and (ii) rigorous methodology, ensured by a prospectively registered protocol and PRISMA standards, and by a high methodological quality of the selected studies. Another limitation could be the potential reporting bias, which was detected for some secondary endpoints. Nonetheless, the primary endpoint was homogeneous among studies with no reporting bias or heterogeneity. Consequently, this meta‐analysis represents the best evidence possible, as no prospective randomized studies are foreseeable due to the nature of the condition investigated.

### International guideline development for the determination of death [^111UCFUv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Methods

On 30–31 May 2012, an invitational forum sponsored by Health Canada and Canadian Blood Services in collaboration with the WHO was held in Montreal, Canada, as part of the planning, scoping, and needs assessment phase in the process of guideline development (see "Appendix 1" for forum committees and participants). The 32 invited participants included delegates from a broad range of national and international professional societies involved with death determination in adults and children in acute care settings. Prior to the forum, participants were provided with comprehensive background materials, including a selected bibliography of peer-reviewed articles related to death determination, a literature review on definitions of death, and a draft lexicon of medical terminology relevant to death determination policy and practice. Each section of the meeting began with an expert speaker who provided historical information, reviewed baseline knowledge, and supplied his or her perspective on current issues and controversies. After each presentation, participants asked questions of the expert and discussed the presentation with the entire group. Reference sheets that offered condensed summaries of existing evidence were distributed, and the participants were then divided into groups where they held extensive discussions about a "challenge question" relevant to the topic of the session. When the participants reconvened in the plenary, each group's results were discussed, and the collective outputs were reworked until consensus was reached. Consensus was defined as achieving substantial agreement, manifested by all participants indicating that they agreed with or could accept a conclusion, which they would support both within and outside the meeting.

For the purposes of this forum, death was fundamentally considered a biological event. While it was respectfully recognized that legal, ethical, cultural, and religious perspectives on death can impact the utility of recommendations in the field, these perspectives were not topics for debate or discussion at this initial meeting. Table 1 highlights the common terminology that was agreed upon to support clarity and precision in the language used throughout this forum and for subsequent phases of work. The planning committee worked with participants to identify critical events that comprise the dying sequence, with the understanding that dying is a process whereby biological/physiological functions cease. Death is an event in that dying process, a point when the person can be determined to have died. The forum identified the tests required for the minimum acceptable clinical standard for determining death in adults and children and recommended additional testing beyond the minimum standard. A consensus on an operational definition of human death was then derived.

### A cross sectional study of maternal near miss and mortality at a rural tertiary centre in Southern Nigeria [^116sND2i]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

Method/study procedure

The subjects were recruited using an exhaustive sampling approach. Pregnant women admitted in the prenatal ward, labor ward and or in the accident and emergency ward, who survived a near miss or died were recruited for the study. Data was collected for a period of 1 year from September 1st 2014 to August 31st 2015. Two medical officers and five interns who had done or on rotation in Obstetrics and Gynaecology department were involved in data collection. The principal investigator supervised the medical interns and medical officers who were involved in data collection. On a daily basis a medical officer and an intern visited the Labor ward, Obstetrics ward, Gynecology ward, Accident and Emergency, Intensive care unit where the registers were used to recruit subjects for the study. The information obtained was continually updated until the discharge of the patient or death. The study proforma was adapted from the Nigeria Near Miss network which was previously published in a peer review journal with input from WHO Human Reproduction Programme Research Ethics. Relevant information extracted include demographic and reproductive data, markers of organ dysfunction predisposing factors to the Near Miss or Maternal mortality. Primary and secondary causes of the severe maternal outcome event were collected. We also explored any administrative, patient related and medical delays in the course of the event and the definitive management targeted at the cause of the maternal near miss or death.

The study proforma did not contain the names of the subjects. This was done to maintain subjects' privacy, confidentiality and anonymity. Informed consent from the subjects was not obtained because there was no personal contact with the patients and the data collectors. Ethical clearance was obtained from the ethics committee of Madonna University Teaching Hospital, Elele, Rivers state Nigeria before the commencement of the study.

Inclusion criteria. This is as shown in the Table 1.

### Use of mortality as an endpoint in noninferiority trials may lead to ethically problematic conclusions [^1153f8Vt]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Noninferiority trials are becoming more common. Their design often requires investigators to "trade" a secondary benefit for efficacy. Use of mortality as an outcome of interest leads to important ethical conflicts whereby researchers must establish a minimal clinically important difference for mortality, a process which has the potential to result in problematic conclusions.

Objective

We sought to investigate the frequency of the use of mortality as an outcome in noninferiority trials, as well as to determine the average pre-specified noninferiority ("delta") values.

Design

We searched MEDLINE for reports of parallel-group randomized controlled noninferiority trials published in five high-impact general medical journals.

Main Outcome Measures

Data abstracted from articles including trial design parameters, results, and interpretation of results based on CONSORT recommendations.

Results

One hundred seventy-three manuscripts reporting 196 noninferiority comparisons were included in our analysis. Of these, over a third (67 trials) used mortality either as their sole endpoint (11 trials) or as part of a composite endpoint (56 trials). Nine trials were consort A, 21 trials consort B, 19 trials consort C, 12 were consort F, 4 consort G, and 2 were consort H. Four analyses showed statistically significant more deaths in the new treatment arm, while meeting consort criteria as "inconclusive" (consort G), (Behringer et al. in Lancet. 385(9976):1418–1427, 2015; Kaul et al. in N Engl J Med. 373(18):1709–1719, 2015; Bwakura-Dangarembizi et al. in N Engl J Med. 370(1):41–53, 2014) and thirteen trials utilizing mortality as an endpoint and had an absolute increase of > 3%, and six had an absolute increase of > 5%.

Conclusions

The use of mortality as an outcome in noninferiority trials is not rare and scenarios where the new treatment is statistically worse, but a conclusion of noninferiority or inconclusive do occur. We highlight these issues and propose simple steps to reduce the risk of ethically dubious conclusions.

### Reducing publication bias through trial registration [^114XfdcQ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Publication bias is the systematic, preferential publication of studies with statistically significant positive results over indeterminate studies (frequently, researchers inappropriately term these "negative" studies), or studies that show a statistically significant negative outcome. Over time, this practice distorts the medical literature, potentially compromising the validity of systematic reviews. Publication bias primarily stems from investigators, but data suppression can occur by pharmaceutical companies, universities, and regulatory agencies. Registration at inception of all clinical trials in a centralized, searchable database can reduce publication bias by enabling researchers to identify all studies related to a particular intervention. Prior attempts to encourage voluntary trial registration have been largely unsuccessful. Hence, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors recently adopted a policy of mandatory clinical trial registration before consideration of manuscripts for publication. Trial registration and the development of comprehensive, computerized databases will promote transparency in research and help reduce publication bias.

### Alignment of systematic reviews published in the cochrane database of systematic reviews and the database of abstracts and reviews of effectiveness with global burden-of-disease data: a bibliographic analysis [^111EhZAK]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The production of intervention research is key to informing efforts at improving population health. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the most internally valid study design and provide the strongest evidence of causal relationships between intervention (exposure) and outcome(s) examined. Observational study designs including cohort and case–control studies also provide useful information particularly in circumstances where it is not feasible to undertake RCTs, such as when the outcome is rare (eg, adverse events), or where long-term follow-up is needed. Systematic reviews of RCTs represent the highest quality study design in evidence hierarchies. By integrating and providing global estimates of the available evidence in context of the broader literature, systematic reviews overcome some of the shortcomings of individual studies including systematic bias and statistical imprecision. While there are some limitations with systematic reviews that can occur as a result of inadequate methodology (eg, poor search strategy) and potential challenges with generalisability and applicability of results, these reviews are fundamental tools for identifying gaps in the literature, informing evidence-based policy formulation and clinical and public health practice. Importantly, policymakers increasingly use systematic reviews as the preferred source of evidence to guide decision-making.

To maximise the benefits of investments in research activity to improve the health and social well-being of the community globally, international organisations including the Institute of Medicine have recommended that government-funded organisations prioritise research activities on the basis of disease burden. Burden of disease is a measure used to assess and compare the relative impact of different diseases and injuries on population health. Mortality and morbidity (assessed using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) are frequently used indices of burden of disease. Total mortality is defined as the number of deaths due to a specific cause (disease or injury) within the total population. DALYs take into account both years of life lost from premature death and years of life lived with a disability from a condition, providing a measurement of the discrepancy between existing and ideal health status. Given the role of systematic reviews in facilitating evidence-based health policy and practice, the production of systematic reviews that focus on conditions contributing to greatest health burden is critical for community health improvement. Key producers of systematic reviews including Cochrane, Johanna Briggs Instituteand the Campbell collaborationhave similarly recognised this as an important consideration in generating evidence to best meet global health needs.

### Impact of near-death experiences on dialysis patients: a multicenter collaborative study [^117DZJQG]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

People who have come close to death may report an unusual experience known as a near-death experience (NDE). This study aims to investigate NDEs and their aftereffects in dialysis patients.

Study Design

Cross-sectional study.

Setting & Participants

710 dialysis patients at 7 centers in Taipei, Taiwan.

Predictor

Demographic characteristics, life-threatening experience, depression, and religiosity.

Outcomes

NDE and self-perceived changes in attitudes or behaviors.

Measurements

Greyson's NDE scale, Royal Free Questionnaire, 10-Question Survey, Ring's Weighted Core Experience Index, and Beck Depression Inventory.

Results

45 patients had 51 NDEs. Mean NDE score was 11.9 (95% confidence interval, 11.0 to 12.9). Out-of-body experience was found in 51.0% of NDEs. Purported precognitive visions, awareness of being dead, and "tunnel experience" were uncommon (< 10%). Compared with the no-NDE group, subjects in the NDE group were more likely to be women and younger at life-threatening events. Both frequency of participation in religious ceremonies and pious religious activity correlated significantly with NDE score in patients with NDEs (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). The NDE group reported being kinder to others (P = 0.04) and more motivated (P = 0.02) after their life-threatening events than the no-NDE group.

Limitations

Determining the incidence of NDEs is dependent on self-reporting. Many NDEs occurred before the patient began long-term dialysis therapy. Causality between NDE and aftereffects cannot be inferred.

Conclusions

NDE is not uncommon in the dialysis population and is associated with positive aftereffects. Nephrology care providers should be aware of the occurrence and aftereffects of NDEs. The high occurrence of life-threatening events, availability of medical records, and accessibility and cooperativeness of patients make the dialysis population very suitable for NDE research.

STROND checklist — discussion, interpretation, and generalizability direct authors to "Summarize the key findings in relation to the study aims and objectives", "Discuss potential limitations of the study" including "Include details of risk of bias (e.g., selection bias), completeness of case ascertainment, and data quality (assessment of its probability, size, and potential importance)", "Interpret the results in the context of the evidence from other well-performed studies with similar designs and objectives" with "Reliability of the estimates (i.e., based on the strength of the statistical methodology, and study design, measurement of key information)", and to "Discuss the external validity of the study findings" and assess "Are the results consistent with meta-analyses of descriptive epidemiologic studies on the same topic that cover different settings (if applicable)?".

### Advanced life support. CPR techniques and process [^11319yz5]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Advanced life support — insights and implications for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) sedation and analgesia note that cardiac arrest experiences related by survivors are described differently and may include near-death experiences, out-of-body experiences, visual or auditory awareness, spiritual experiences or consciousness during CPR. Sedatives and analgesics have potential hemodynamic effects that may contribute negatively to survival outcomes and may potentially mask clinical signs of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). These potential risks must be weighed against their benefit. The good practice statements by ILCOR provide reasonable suggestions for preventing pain and distress in patients who are conscious during CPR, but with the caveat of using local protocols and regimens in place for critical care patients.

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) evidence quality assessment — Under GRADE, the quality of evidence is influenced by "study design, risk of bias, consistency, precision, directness, and publication bias", with randomized trials "presumed to be high in quality, unless compromised", and observational studies "considered to be low in quality by default but can be 'rated up' by demonstrating a large magnitude of effect, a dose–response, or results that would be even more compelling if plausible confounders are taken into account". Table factors for rating down include "Risk of bias", "Heterogeneity", "Imprecision", "Indirectness", and "Publication bias", and for rating up include "Magnitude of effect", "Dose–response", and "Plausible confounding effect", with example comments such as "Unclear allocation concealment, incomplete blinding, selective reporting of results, incomplete accounting of outcomes", "Inconsistent results across studies", "Confidence intervals range from substantial benefit to little or no benefit", and "Studies showing negative or conflicting results may exist but are missing from the literature".

### Near death experiences, cognitive function and psychological outcomes of surviving cardiac arrest [^1125rvPS]. Resuscitation (2007). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is associated with a number of cognitive processes as well as long term psychological outcomes. Recent studies have indicated that approximately 10–20% of cardiac arrest survivors report cognitive processes, including the ability to recall specific details of their resuscitation from the period of cardiac arrest. In addition it has been demonstrated that these cognitive processes are consistent with the previously described near death experience and that those who have these experiences are left with long term positive life enhancing effects. There have also been numerous studies that have indicated that although the quality of life for cardiac arrest survivors is generally good, some are left with long term cognitive impairments as well as psychological sequelae such as post-traumatic stress disorder.

### The effectiveness of community-based palliative care programme components: a systematic review [^116ueBE6]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Search results

A total of 1,674 articles were initially retrieved from PubMed, CINAHL, ProQuest Federated and Web of Science. Following PRISMA guidelines, the researchers reviewed the references of the retrieved articles, resulting in an additional 25 articles for screening. Figure 1 highlights the selection process as suggested by PRISMA guidelines. Table 1 presents the study characteristics. In addition, Tables 2 and 3 summarise the included 25 quantitative and 21 qualitative research articles, respectively, sorted by the main component examined. The 11 mixed-methods articles appear in both tables. The supplementary file includes more detailed information about all the articles. We present the following results by the types of community-based palliative care components examined and indicate the direction of effect for the quantitative studies. Note that three articles are dated 2022 because they were published in journal issues after being published online first by August 2021.

Early community-based palliative care intervention

Five studies examined early community-based palliative care interventions, all from high-income countries. For all these studies, 'early' was in advance of a patient needing to make final decisions regarding palliative care. Three of the studies framed early in terms of time before death (2 or 3 months, depending on the study). The other two studies stated that early intervention happened before the individual's disease continued to progress. All five studies showed that intervening early with palliative care is generally positive for patients. For groups with early community-based palliative care intervention, emergency department use was lower, acute care stays in the last 2 weeks of death was lower and symptom distress/HIV self-management understanding 9 months into the programme improved compared to the beginning of the programme.

### Designs of trials assessing interventions to improve the peer review process: a vignette-based survey [^111bVpf7]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to determine the best study designs for assessing interventions to improve the peer review process according to experts' opinions. Furthermore, for interventions previously evaluated, we determined whether the study designs actually used were rated as the best study designs.

Methods

Study design: A series of six vignette-based surveys exploring the best study designs for six different interventions (training peer reviewers, adding an expert to the peer review process, use of reporting guidelines checklists, blinding peer reviewers to the results (i.e., results-free peer review), giving incentives to peer reviewers, and post-publication peer review). Vignette construction: Vignettes were case scenarios of trials assessing interventions aimed at improving the quality of peer review. For each intervention, the vignette included the study type (e.g., randomized controlled trial [RCT]), setting (e.g., single biomedical journal), and type of manuscript assessed (e.g., actual manuscripts received by the journal); each of these three features varied between vignettes.

Participants

Researchers with expertise in peer review or methodology of clinical trials.

Outcome

Participants were proposed two vignettes describing two different study designs to assess the same intervention and had to indicate which study design they preferred on a scale, from -5 (preference for study A) to 5 (preference for study B), 0 indicating no preference between the suggested designs (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes were trust in the results and feasibility of the designs.

Results

A total of 204 experts assessed 1044 paired comparisons. The preferred study type was RCTs with randomization of manuscripts for four interventions (adding an expert, use of reporting guidelines checklist, results-free peer review, post-publication peer review) and RCTs with randomization of peer reviewers for two interventions (training peer reviewers and using incentives). The preferred setting was mainly several biomedical journals from different publishers, and the preferred type of manuscript was actual manuscripts submitted to journals. However, the most feasible designs were often cluster RCTs and interrupted time series analysis set in a single biomedical journal, with the assessment of a fabricated manuscript. Three interventions were previously assessed: none used the design rated first in preference by experts.

Conclusion

The vignette-based survey allowed us to identify the best study designs for assessing different interventions to improve peer review according to experts' opinion. There is gap between the preferred study designs and the designs actually used.

### Top 100 cited articles on back pain research: a citation analysis [^111uGgPA]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

A bibliometric review of the literature.

Objective

Back pain is a global burden that leads people to seek medical service and results in work disability. Numerous studies are published annually to give new insights into back pain. However, characteristics of the high-impact articles on back pain have not been explored. The current study aimed to identify the 100 most cited articles on back pain and determine their characteristics.

Summary Of Background Data

Back pain is a globally leading cause of work disability. Numerous studies have been published annually to give new insight to back pain. However, comprehensive analysis to identify the most influential articles is not available until now.

Methods

The Web of Science core database was searched using the subject terms "back NEAR pain", "dorsalgia", "backache", "lumbar NEAR pain", "lumbago", "back NEAR disorder", "discitis". The searching results were listed by citation times and the top 100 cited articles on back pain were identified. Important information such as author, journal, publishing year, country, institution, and study type were elicited.

Results

A total of 44,460 articles on back pain were displayed. Citation times of the enrolled 100 articles ranged from 249 to 1638 with a mean value of 418. The most productive periods were 1991 to 1995 and 1996 to 2000. The journal Spine holds the largest number of 45 articles, followed by Pain with seven articles. A total of 11 countries contribute to the 100 articles and the United States topped the list. None of the high-impact articles were produced in Asian and African.

Conclusion

The current citation analysis demonstrated the essential advances in the history of back pain research and determined the influential authors, institutions, countries, and journals that had outstanding contributions to the studies of back pain.

### Thyroid hormone therapy for older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism [^116N1bdo]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The study TRUST was published by Stott DJ and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Subclinical hypothyroidism and Hypothyroidism. In the TRUST study, the trial question was: what is the effect of levothyroxine in older patients with subclinical hypothyroidism? In the TRUST study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the TRUST study, the population was: 737 patients (396 female, 341 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients ≥ 65 years of age who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism, with thyrotropin level of 4.60–19.99 mlU/L and fT4 level within reference range. The key exclusion criteria were current prescription for levothyroxine, antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, or lithium, thyroid surgery or receipt of radioactive iodine within the previous 12 months, dementia, hospitalization for a major illness or an elective surgery within the previous 4 weeks, acute coronary syndrome within the previous 4 weeks, and terminal illness. In the TRUST study, the interventions were: n = 368 levothyroxine (starting dose of 50 mcg daily or 25 mcg if the body weight was < 50 kg or patient had coronary artery disease, with dose adjustment according to thyrotropin level) n = 369 placebo (mock dose adjustment). In the TRUST study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in change in Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 months (16.6 points vs. 16.7 points;). In the TRUST study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in change in Tiredness score at 12 months (3.8 points vs. 3.2 points; AD 0.4 points, 95% CI -2.1 to 2.9). In the TRUST study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in incidence of serious adverse events of special interest (AF, HF, fracture, or new diagnosis of osteoporosis). In the TRUST study, the conclusion was: in adult patients ≥ 65 years of age who had persisting subclinical hypothyroidism, with thyrotropin level of 4.60–19.99 mlU/L and fT4 level within reference range, levothyroxine was not superior to placebo with respect to change in Hypothyroid Symptoms score at 12 months.

### Cardiovascular event reporting in modern cancer radiation therapy trials [^111P6oMJ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods and Materials

Ten leading, representative, high-impact oncology, internal medicine, and RT journals (Journal of Clinical Oncology; JAMA; JAMA Oncology; JAMA Internal Medicine; The Lancet; The Lancet Oncology; International Journal of Radiation Oncology
- Biology
- Physics; New England Journal of Medicine; Annals of Internal Medicine; and Journal of the National Cancer Institute) were queried to identify all latter-phase (2 and 3) landmark thoracic RT trials. The search terms radiation, phase, study, dose, cancer, and Gy (an abbreviation of Gray, joule/kg) were used to identify potential studies. Results were limited to original research only. An additional search term, chest, was added to search the International Journal of Radiation Oncology
- Biology
- Physics because without it, nearly every published article in the radiation oncology–specific journal met search criteria. The search results were then manually reviewed, and only phase 2 or 3 trials from 2000 to 2019 wherein chest RT was delivered for lung cancer, esophageal cancer, lymphoma, mesothelioma, or breast cancer in at least 1 arm, with enrollment of greater than 100 patients and a minimum 1-year follow-up, were included. For consistency and because some trials were associated with multiple published articles, only trials reporting initial primary study outcomes were included.

After validation, all additional potentially relevant RT, cancer, and cardiovascular variables within the trials were collected, including year of publication; cancer type; trial phase; funding source; enrollment per arm; trial duration; enrollment period; length of follow-up; patient age, sex, and race; and study endpoints. Cardiovascular disease events were defined as any myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure (HF), coronary or peripheral revascularization, acute thromboembolism, myocarditis, cardiac tamponade, atrial fibrillation or note of any other arrhythmia (eg, ventricular tachycardia), valvular heart disease, significant hypertension including hypertensive emergency, CVD death, or any other mention of CVD. Variables specific to RT were collected, including the use of sophisticated radiation planning and delivery techniques (intensity modulated radiation therapy), whether dose escalation or de-escalation was tested, the minimum allowable dose in each study arm, and the reporting of heart dose information. Two reviewers independently reviewed clinical trial data before entry. For those trials with ambiguous or missing data, clinicaltrials.gov was queried, and if uncertainty persisted, corresponding authors were contacted for clarification. Because only published data were collected and no patients were involved, institutional review board approval and informed consent were not required.

### Comparison of clinical study results reported in medRxiv preprints vs peer-reviewed journal articles [^115BsXdV]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

In this cross-sectional study of medRxiv preprints of clinical studies subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals, we found that 74.2% were fully concordant with respect to sample size, primary end points, results, and interpretations. When preprint-journal article pairs had discordant results, the discrepancies were often owing to minor sample size changes that were unlikely to affect the study interpretation. Although approximately 25% of preprints are not subsequently published in journals, these findings suggest that among the majority of preprints that are published in journals, changes to studies' design, results, and conclusions are uncommon. This concordance provides some additional reassurance about the consistency of findings between preprints and subsequently published journal articles.

We found that 81.1% of preprint-journal article pairs were concordant in terms of numerical results of primary end points and that 96.2% were concordant in their interpretations. These findings are in general agreement with a previous studythat focused on the concordance between medRxiv preprints of clinical studies subsequently published in journals with the highest impact factors (> 10), in which 68% of results of primary end points and 98% of interpretations were concordant. The current study extends this previous work by examining pairs in all journals, predominantly those with an impact factor less than 10. Our study also mirrors a previous evaluation of preprints posted to bioRxiv and medRxiv, which found that most abstracts did not change significantly after publication. Similar to our evaluation, these studies also suggest that preprint-journal article pairs with numerical or statistical changes often have consistent conclusions. High levels of concordance have also been observed across other fields, including preprints posted on arXiv and bioRxiv, which are preprint servers for the life and physical sciences, respectively.

### Editorial peer review for improving the quality of reports of biomedical studies [^116FK1kv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Scientific findings must withstand critical review if they are to be accepted as valid, and editorial peer review (critique, effort to disprove) is an essential element of the scientific process. We review the evidence of the editorial peer-review process of original research studies submitted for paper or electronic publication in biomedical journals.

Objectives

To estimate the effect of processes in editorial peer review.

Search Strategy

The following databases were searched to June 2004: CINAHL, Ovid, Cochrane Methodology Register, Dissertation abstracts, EMBASE, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews: ACP Journal Club, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed.

Selection Criteria

We included prospective or retrospective comparative studies with two or more comparison groups, generated by random or other appropriate methods, and reporting original research, regardless of publication status. We hoped to find studies identifying good submissions on the basis of: importance of the topic dealt with, relevance of the topic to the journal, usefulness of the topic, soundness of methods, soundness of ethics, completeness and accuracy of reporting.

Data Collection and Analysis

Because of the diversity of study questions, viewpoints, methods, and outcomes, we carried out a descriptive review of included studies grouping them by broad study question.

Main Results

We included 28 studies. We found no clear-cut evidence of effect of the well-researched practice of reviewer and/or author concealment on the outcome of the quality assessment process (9 studies). Checklists and other standardisation media have some evidence to support their use (2 studies). There is no evidence that referees' training has any effect on the quality of the outcome (1 study). Different methods of communicating with reviewers and means of dissemination do not appear to have an effect on quality (3 studies). On the basis of one study, little can be said about the ability of the peer-review process to detect bias against unconventional drugs. Validity of peer review was tested by only one small study in a specialist area. Editorial peer review appears to make papers more readable and improve the general quality of reporting (2 studies), but the evidence for this has very limited generalisability.

Authors' Conclusions

At present, little empirical evidence is available to support the use of editorial peer review as a mechanism to ensure quality of biomedical research. However, the methodological problems in studying peer review are many and complex. At present, the absence of evidence on efficacy and effectiveness cannot be interpreted as evidence of their absence. A large, well-funded programme of research on the effects of editorial peer review should be urgently launched.

### Empirical evidence for selective reporting of outcomes in randomized trials: comparison of protocols to published articles [^112D9yep]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Selective reporting of outcomes within published studies based on the nature or direction of their results has been widely suspected, but direct evidence of such bias is currently limited to case reports.

Objective

To study empirically the extent and nature of outcome reporting bias in a cohort of randomized trials.

Design

Cohort study using protocols and published reports of randomized trials approved by the Scientific-Ethical Committees for Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, Denmark, in 1994–1995. The number and characteristics of reported and unreported trial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal articles, and a survey of trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely reported if insufficient data were presented in the published articles for meta-analysis. Odds ratios relating the completeness of outcome reporting to statistical significance were calculated for each trial and then pooled to provide an overall estimate of bias. Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies in primary outcomes.

Main Outcome Measures

Completeness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.

Results

One hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736 outcomes were identified. Overall, 50% of efficacy and 65% of harm outcomes per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes for both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–4.0) and harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.8–12.0) data. In comparing published articles with protocols, 62% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders (42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence to the contrary.

Conclusions

The reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate the benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should be registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial completion.

### Positive aging and death or dying: a scoping review [^112tv98y]. The Gerontologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

This scoping review aims to examine the extent and the manner in which research that utilizes successful, active, productive, and healthy aging framework(s) includes death or dying.

Research Design and Methods

An examination of peer-reviewed academic journal articles was conducted following Joanna Briggs Institute's methodological standards for scoping reviews and conforming to Arskey and O'Malley's 5-stage framework. The initial search resulted in 1,759 articles for review, and following the rigorous screening, 35 studies were included for the final review. A qualitative thematic analysis was used to identify how research utilizes the concepts of death and dying in the context of 4 positive aging models.

Results

The core themes identified include (a) the absence of death and dying dimensions in positive aging models; (b) older adults' outlooks on death and dying while aging well; (c) religious and spiritual dimensions of aging well; (d) negative consequences of positive aging models without death and dying dimensions; and (e) the future of death and dying in positive aging models.

Discussion and Implications

The review delivers a critique by researchers on the noticeable absence of death and dying processes within the framework of successful, active, productive, and healthy aging models. These findings represent a rich opportunity for future research on these concepts.

### Sudden cardiac death prediction and prevention: report from a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and Heart Rhythm Society workshop [^116Mbmhw]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac death (SCD) epidemiology and ascertainment — community occurrence and study design requirements are detailed. The page reports that "the vast majority of sudden cardiac arrests occur in the community and at least 90% to 95% of these individuals do not survive despite resuscitation attempts performed in the field by emergency medical response systems". It further states that "In 40% to 50% of cases, SCD is unheralded by symptoms and in 30% to 40% of cases, SCD can be unwitnessed". Consequently, "the ascertainment of the phenotype of individuals at risk of SCD must occur in the community, as opposed to the hospital and healthcare system. Therefore population-based approaches must be used". Retrospective death-certificate ascertainment is described as "inaccurate, with unacceptably low positive predictive values" "when compared to prospective approaches", and "Information on the burden of SCD is available for only selected world regions… with virtually no information available on SCD epidemiology in the vast majority of the world", with "a paucity of data… in nonwhite ethnic and racial groups". The document adds that "Studies assessing risk predictors of SCD have been performed in community-based cohorts and there is increasing recognition that prospective studies of SCD in the general population are also feasible".

### Effect of a condolence letter on grief symptoms among relatives of patients who died in the ICU: a randomized clinical trial [^112Ggqpg]. Intensive Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The study Famirea 22 was published by Nancy Kentish-Barnes and colleagues in 2017 in the journal Intensive Care Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Critical illness. In the Famirea 22 study, the trial question was: what is the effect of a condolence letter among relatives of patients who died in the ICU? In the Famirea 22 study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the Famirea 22 study, the population was: 242 patients (85 female, 157 male). The inclusion criteria were relatives of patients who died in the ICU. The key exclusion criteria were pregnancy. In the Famirea 22 study, the interventions were: n = 123 condolence letter (receiving a condolence letter) n = 119 control (not receiving a condolence letter). In the Famirea 22 study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score at 1 month (16 points vs. 14 points; MD 0.77, 95% CI -1.7 to 3.3). In the Famirea 22 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score at 6 months (13 points vs. 10 points; AD 3 points, 95% CI 0.13 to 5.87) No significant difference in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-depression subscale at 1 month (8 points vs. 6 points; MD 1.1, 95% CI -0.5 to 2.6) No significant difference in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score-depression subscale at 6 months (6 points vs. 3 points; MD 1.4, 95% CI -0.14 to 2.9). In the Famirea 22 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in prevalence of complicated grief symptoms. significant difference in PTSD symptoms at 6 months (52.4% vs. 37.1%) and prevalence of depression symptoms at 6 months (36.6% vs. 24.7%). In the Famirea 22 study, the conclusion was: in relatives of patients who died in the ICU, condolence letter was not superior to control with respect to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score at 1 month.
