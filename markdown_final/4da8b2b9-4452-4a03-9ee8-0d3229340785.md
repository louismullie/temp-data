## Question

what is a hurthle cell adenoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a Hürthle cell adenoma is, seeking a definition and explanation that include cell of origin, how it is distinguished from carcinoma, clinical and pathologic features, diagnostic limitations, management, and differential diagnosis, culminating in a concise synthesis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the cellular origin and terminology. Then, I should verify the benign versus malignant criteria and the role of invasion. Next, I will review epidemiology and clinical behavior, followed by the preoperative diagnostic challenges and the impact of cytology, frozen section, and molecular testing. After that, I need to examine the influence of tumor size on malignancy risk and surgical decision-making. Finally, I will consider the key differentials, note any relevant biological distinctions, and synthesize a precise, clinically useful definition with management implications [^113khwLg] [^1127hgKb].

> Let me first confirm the cellular foundation and nomenclature. Hürthle cells are eosinophilic, follicular-derived thyroid cells often referred to as oncocytes or oxyphilic cells, and this oncocytic cytomorphology can appear in both neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid conditions, so I need to ensure I am not overattributing their presence to neoplasia by default [^113khwLg] [^1127hgKb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about behavior before I pin down the pathologic criteria. A Hürthle cell adenoma is a benign, encapsulated neoplasm composed predominantly of Hürthle cells that, by definition, lacks capsular and vascular invasion; in contrast, a Hürthle cell carcinoma requires demonstrable capsular and/or vascular invasion or metastatic spread, so the distinction hinges on meticulous histopathologic assessment of the tumor-capsule interface and vessels, not on cytology alone [^1127hgKb] [^116yUtAx].

> I should confirm the clinical context and demographics before overgeneralizing. Thyroid nodules are common in the general population with a prevalence exceeding 65%, but wait, let me verify — I must not imply that Hürthle cell adenomas themselves are this prevalent; that statistic applies to nodules overall, within which Hürthle cell tumors represent a subset, often seen in middle-aged women, with series reporting a mean age around the early 50s and female predominance and showing adenomas outnumbering carcinomas in surgical cohorts [^11267SRE] [^115c61nA] [^112pMY2e].

> Next, I should review natural history and recurrence behavior to avoid overreassurance. Most series report that Hürthle cell adenomas, when completely excised, have an excellent prognosis with no intrinsic propensity for recurrence, yet I need to check for caveats — recurrences have been documented due to subcutaneous implantation from intraoperative handling or residual thyroid tissue after limited resections, so surgical technique and completeness of excision matter even for benign disease [^112pMY2e] [^115c61nA].

> Now, I will examine the preoperative diagnostic challenge, because cytology often prompts surgery but cannot make the benign-versus-malignant call for follicular-patterned and oncocytic lesions. Fine-needle aspiration has high utility overall, but for Hürthle-rich nodules it cannot assess capsular or vascular invasion, and its specificity is poor in this context; frozen section similarly shows high specificity but low sensitivity for detecting invasion, so I should caution that neither FNA nor frozen section reliably discriminates adenoma from carcinoma preoperatively, and interpretation is confounded further by autoimmune thyroiditis where Hürthle cell metaplasia mimics neoplasm and by Bethesda indeterminate categories that carry variable malignancy risk [^112pMY2e] [^115t1tcn] [^115EqfrN] [^114g2jnh].

> Wait, let me verify whether adjunctive molecular or gene expression tools change preoperative decisions in Hürthle-predominant nodules. Gene expression classifiers may label many Hürthle cell lesions as suspicious with relatively low malignancy yield, risking overtreatment, whereas broader molecular panels can help in indeterminate cytology but still cannot confirm or exclude capsular or vascular invasion; thus, molecular tests can refine risk but do not replace histologic evaluation for definitive diagnosis in Hürthle cell neoplasia [^115eECVj] [^113p9cCV] [^1112n1VR].

> I should double-check the role of tumor size because I initially noted that clinical factors are not reliably discriminatory; however, there is evidence that larger size correlates with higher malignancy risk in Hürthle cell neoplasms. One series found no malignancies at 2 cm or smaller and universal malignancy above 6 cm, with risk rising beyond 4 cm, while another analysis of indeterminate nodules showed size was generally not predictive except in Hürthle cell neoplasm subsets where larger nodules increased odds of malignancy; this does not prove carcinoma but it can inform surgical extent discussions, though I must reconcile this with reports that clinical factors are overall unreliable, underscoring that size is a risk marker, not a diagnostic criterion [^1136iQna] [^116TcQm9] [^112pMY2e] [^116dM47u].

> Let me consider management principles carefully and avoid overextending recommendations. For a unilateral Hürthle cell adenoma confirmed on final pathology, lobectomy with isthmusectomy is typically adequate and curative; however, given preoperative uncertainty and the size-risk signal, some advocate total thyroidectomy for larger Hürthle cell tumors, especially those over 4 cm, balancing this against patient factors and multidisciplinary judgment, and regardless of extent, careful handling to prevent implantation is essential; if carcinoma is ultimately found, management aligns with differentiated thyroid carcinoma pathways rather than adenoma protocols [^112pMY2e] [^1136iQna] [^116dM47u] [^115c61nA].

> But wait, what if the imaging or functional studies are misleading. FDG-PET avidity can be striking in benign Hürthle cell adenomas, so I should caution that high FDG uptake is not specific for malignancy, and, conversely, metastasis from nonthyroid primaries, such as renal cell carcinoma, can involve the thyroid and even a Hürthle cell neoplasm, reminding me to consider metastasis in atypical cytology or histology patterns [^114z3JYL] [^112rUKTN].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis to ensure completeness. Hürthle cell adenoma must be distinguished from Hürthle cell carcinoma by invasion, from nonneoplastic Hürthle cell change in Hashimoto thyroiditis and multinodular goiter by architectural and capsular features, and from other oncocytic neoplasms such as oncocytic variants of papillary or medullary thyroid carcinoma by nuclear and immunohistochemical profiles and by thorough sampling of the capsule to exclude invasion, as capsular and vascular invasion remain the key outcome predictors in follicular-patterned lesions [^113khwLg] [^1127hgKb] [^116yUtAx].

> Let me reconsider whether there are biological markers that truly separate adenoma from carcinoma in the Hürthle spectrum. Data suggest that both Hürthle cell adenomas and carcinomas often express hTERT protein, with telomere shortening more pronounced in carcinomas, implying a shared oncocytic biology that is distinct from conventional follicular tumors but still not a standalone diagnostic discriminator; hence, I should confirm that such markers are adjunctive rather than definitive [^112WxbhD].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure the definition is precise and clinically actionable. Hürthle cell adenoma is a benign, encapsulated thyroid neoplasm composed predominantly of oncocytic (Hürthle) cells that lacks capsular and vascular invasion on exhaustive histopathologic examination; it typically presents as a solitary nodule in middle-aged adults, has an excellent prognosis with complete excision, and poses significant preoperative diagnostic challenges because cytology and frozen section cannot exclude invasion, making lobectomy both diagnostic and therapeutic in most unilateral cases, with consideration of more extensive surgery for large tumors where malignancy risk is higher and with meticulous operative technique to avoid implantation [^1127hgKb] [^113khwLg] [^112pMY2e] [^1136iQna] [^115c61nA].

A Hürthle cell adenoma is a **benign thyroid tumor** composed of oncocytic (Hürthle) cells [^113khwLg] with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large mitochondria. It is a **well-encapsulated, non-invasive** lesion that does not show capsular or vascular invasion [^116yUtAx], distinguishing it from Hürthle cell carcinoma [^1127hgKb]. Diagnosis relies on **histopathology** [^115t1tcn], as FNA cannot reliably separate benign from malignant Hürthle cell neoplasms [^1127hgKb]. Treatment is typically **lobectomy or isthmusectomy**, with an excellent prognosis and low recurrence risk [^112pMY2e] [^115c61nA].

---

## Histological features

Hürthle cell adenomas show the following **histological features**:

- **Cellular composition**: Predominantly composed of Hürthle cells, which are large polygonal cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm due to numerous mitochondria [^113khwLg].

- **Nuclear features**: Round, centrally located nuclei with prominent nucleoli.

- **Architectural pattern**: Follicular or solid growth pattern [^113khwLg].

- **Encapsulation**: Well-defined fibrous capsule without evidence of capsular or vascular invasion [^116yUtAx].

- **Absence of invasion**: No capsular or vascular invasion, distinguishing them from Hürthle cell carcinomas [^1127hgKb].

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical **clinical features** include:

- **Thyroid nodule**: Solitary, painless, slow-growing thyroid nodule [^11267SRE].

- **Thyroid function**: Usually euthyroid [^11267SRE], although rare cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported [^114qcY6b].

- **Demographics**: More common in females and typically diagnosed in middle-aged to older adults [^115c61nA].

---

## Diagnostic methods

The **diagnosis** of Hürthle cell adenoma involves clinical evaluation, imaging, and histopathological examination:

- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)**: Commonly used initial diagnostic tool [^115t1tcn], but cannot reliably distinguish between benign and malignant Hürthle cell neoplasms due to overlapping cytological features [^1127hgKb].

- **Ultrasound imaging**: Useful for evaluating the size, location, and characteristics of the thyroid nodule [^114g2jnh], but cannot definitively diagnose Hürthle cell adenoma.

- **Histopathological examination**: Definitive diagnosis requires surgical excision [^116yUtAx] and histopathological evaluation to confirm the absence of capsular or vascular invasion.

---

## Treatment

The primary treatment is **surgical excision** [^112pMY2e] — typically **lobectomy or isthmusectomy**, which removes the affected thyroid lobe or isthmus. Total thyroidectomy is **generally not recommended** unless there are multiple nodules or other indications.

---

## Prognosis

Hürthle cell adenomas have an **excellent prognosis** [^112pMY2e]; **recurrence** is low after complete surgical excision [^115c61nA] and **malignant transformation** is rare. Regular follow-up is recommended to monitor for recurrence or malignant transformation.

---

## Differentiation from Hürthle cell carcinoma

Hürthle cell adenomas must be differentiated from Hürthle cell carcinomas, malignant tumors defined by **capsular and/or vascular invasion** [^116yUtAx]; invasion is the key histopathological criterion distinguishing carcinoma from adenoma [^1127hgKb].

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Follow-up should include **regular thyroid examinations**, **periodic ultrasound** [^111Z3JGw], and **monitoring of thyroglobulin levels**, which may help detect recurrence. Ongoing clinical follow-up is **recommended** to monitor for recurrence or malignant transformation [^116GuHTq].

Hürthle cell adenoma is a **benign thyroid tumor** composed of oncocytic cells [^113khwLg] and characterized by a well-encapsulated, non-invasive [^116yUtAx] growth pattern. Diagnosis relies on histopathology [^1127hgKb], and treatment is **surgical excision** [^112pMY2e], with an **excellent prognosis** and low recurrence risk [^115c61nA].

### Surgical treatment of Hurthle cell tumors of the thyroid [^112pMY2e]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Hurthle cell tumors are relatively rare thyroid tumors, and their management and prognosis are controversial. We retrospectively reviewed 135 Hurthle cell adenomas and 28 Hurthle cell carcinomas of the thyroid surgically treated at our institute. No significant difference was found between the adenoma and carcinoma groups in terms of patient age, gender, and tumor size. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in detecting malignancy were 87.5%, 19.3%, 31.2%, 18.6%, and 88.0%, respectively.

- **Frozen section analysis**: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value in detecting malignancy of the thyroid gland were 40.0%, 100.0%, 92.9%, 100.0%, and 92.0%, respectively. Most of the adenomas were treated with procedures no less invasive than lobectomy/isthmusectomy, whereas most carcinoma patients underwent total thyroidectomy. Operative morbidity occurred in six patients (3.8%), including transient recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy in three patients, damage to the external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve in two patients, and transient hypocalcemia in one patient.

No recurrence of Hurthle cell adenomas was noted. Five adenoma patients died of causes unrelated to their Hurthle cell tumors, but no carcinoma patients died during the follow-up period. In conclusion, clinical factors and FNAC are not helpful in differentiating between adenoma and carcinoma. Unilateral Hurthle cell adenoma can be treated by lobectomy/isthmusectomy, and Hurthle cell carcinoma can be treated accordingly.

### The significance of Hurthle cells in thyroid disease [^1127hgKb]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

Hürthle cells (HCs) and HC change, along with the frequently employed synonyms "oncocytes/oncocytic change" or "oxyphils/oxyphilic change", are not infrequently described on fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reports of thyroid lesions. The description of HCs on FNAB reports may cause significant concern to the clinician; however, placing the finding in the appropriate clinical context may alleviate some anxiety. Not all oxyphilic cells are true HCs, and not every aspirate containing HCs is or should be considered equivalent to an HC neoplasm (HCN). There are many benign thyroid lesions associated with HCs or HC change. For clinicians, it may be difficult to discern the significance of these findings and to determine an appropriate course of action.

A skilled and experienced cytopathologist is invaluable in discriminating the subtle features that distinguish these lesions from those warranting a more aggressive approach. The diagnosis of HC carcinoma relies on histopathologic scrutiny and evidence of capsular and/or vascular invasion or metastasis to lymph nodes or distant organs. Many investigators have sought clinical, radiographic, cytological, genetic, and other factors to attempt to discriminate preoperatively between benign and malignant HCNs. At the time of writing, none have been definitively proven to be reliable. For now, because of the inability to determine the benign or malignant nature of such neoplasms based on cytology alone, a surgical approach is warranted.

### The thyroid Hürthle (oncocytic) cell and its associated pathologic conditions: a surgical pathology and cytopathology review [^113khwLg]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hürthle cells are eosinophilic, follicular-derived cells that are associated with a variety of nonneoplastic and neoplastic thyroid lesions. The differential diagnosis of Hürthle cell lesions is quite broad.

- **Objective**: To review the pathologic conditions associated with Hürthle cells in the thyroid and to discuss pathology of thyroid lesions associated with oncocytic cytology.

- **Data Sources**: A variety of thyroid nonneoplastic conditions, such as autoimmune thyroiditis and multinodular goiter, and neoplastic conditions like Hürthle cell adenoma and Hürthle cell carcinoma, are associated with Hürthle cell cytology. In addition, there are several thyroid neoplasms that should be considered when one observes a Hürthle cell neoplasm in the thyroid, including the oncocytic variant of medullary carcinoma and several variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma.

- **Conclusions**: Oncocytic cytology is seen in a variety of thyroid conditions that are associated with a broad differential diagnosis, and care must be used for accurate diagnosis. Newer molecular-based techniques may be useful for further classification of thyroid neoplasms with oncocytic pathology.

### Diagnostic utility of intracytoplasmic lumen and transgressing vessels in evaluation of Hürthle cell lesions by fine-needle aspiration [^117SfU4Q]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Recent abstracts have emphasized the importance of recognizing intracytoplasmic lumen and transgressing vessels as useful criteria for distinguishing between Hürthle cells encountered in neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid aspirates. The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether the application of these criteria improves the specificity and sensitivity of cytologic diagnosis of true Hürthle cell neoplasms.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed 30 fine-needle aspirates of thyroid tissue with a cytologic diagnosis of Hürthle cell neoplasms (13 cases) and nonneoplastic thyroid with prominent Hürthle cells (17 cases). All cases were evaluated for the presence of intracytoplasmic lumen and transgressing vessels and were reclassified as neoplastic or nonneoplastic based on the presence or absence of one or both of these criteria. Surgical follow-up was available in all cases.

- **Results**: Surgical follow-up in 13 cases of Hürthle cell neoplasms revealed Hürthle cell carcinoma (3 cases), Hürthle cell adenoma (6 cases), and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (4 cases). Seventeen cases with a nonneoplastic diagnosis revealed Hürthle cell carcinoma (1 case), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (12 cases), and nodular goiter (4 cases). After applying the previously mentioned cytologic criteria, the cytologic diagnoses were reclassified as Hürthle cell neoplasms (13 cases) and nonneoplastic thyroid (17 cases). The true sensitivity of the test before and after the application of the criteria was 90% and 100%, respectively. The true specificity before and after the application of the criteria…

### Double adenomas of the pituitary reveal distinct lineage markers, copy number alterations, and epigenetic profiles [^1125jP8e]. Pituitary (2021). Low credibility.

Pituitary adenomas typically comprise monoclonal proliferations of anterior pituitary cells. They are usually considered benign, although they may show invasive growth into neighboring structures. Very rarely, they present as aggressive metastasizing tumors referred to as pituitary carcinomas. Pituitary adenomas constitute the third most common intracranial neoplasm after gliomas and meningiomas, representing approximately 15% of tumors in this localization. Adenoma cells either express no hormone (null cell pituitary adenomas) or the pituitary hormone(s) of the cell lineage of origin determined by specific transcription factors. Additionally, about 1% of pituitary adenomas show a plurihormonal expression pattern, which may either be attributed to one cell lineage with aberrant expression of an additional hormone (monomorphous plurihormonal pituitary adenomas, one transcription factor), or, rarely, to two or three different cell lineages (plurimorphous plurihormonal pituitary adenomas, two or three transcription factors). In distinction to plurihormonal pituitary adenomas, the development of two or three separate pituitary adenomas may be observed in 0.5–1.5% of surgical specimens and in up to 10% of autopsy cases. These lesions are termed double or triple/multiple pituitary adenomas.

### Factors predicting malignancy of Hürthle cell tumors of the thyroid: Influence on surgical treatment [^116dM47u]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Controversy still exists about the ability to differentiate between malignant and benign Hürthle cell tumors (HCTs) before and during surgery. Diagnostic difficulties make surgical decisions debatable. The aim of this study was to evaluate factors predicting the malignancy of HCT and to plan its appropriate management. From January 1998 to May 2003, a series of 41 patients underwent thyroidectomy in our surgical department because of HCT. A cross-sectional study of 23 patients with carcinoma and 18 patients with adenoma was carried out, assessing demographic data, tumor characteristics, and diagnostic results of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), frozen section (FS), and MIBI scan scintigraphy. Surgical indications and treatment were also evaluated.

The mean tumor size was significantly greater for carcinomas than adenomas (3.1 vs. 1.9 cm; p = 0.006). Threshold sizes of more than 3.0 cm and 4.0 cm were significant for predicting malignancy (p = 0.025 and p = 0.012). Conversely, 47.8% of carcinomas had a diameter smaller than 3.0 cm. FNAC and FS sensitivities for carcinoma detection were 23.8% and 33.3%, respectively. The positive uptake on MIBI scan imaging was likely to be similarly malignant or benign. Due to the lack of accuracy in all diagnostic studies for predicting malignancy, all oxyphilic cell nodules should be referred to surgery. Different tumor sizes cannot be the only factor on which to base a surgical decision. Therefore, given the diagnostic uncertainties, we believe that an experienced surgeon can safely perform total thyroidectomy in all patients with an HCT.

- **Limitations and future directions**: A very low recurrence risk for NIFTP has been established based on a retrospective analysis of 101 tumor cases with a 13-year median follow-up in the initial reclassification study and 352 cases reported by 2016 in the literature. However, the indolent nature of this disease should be further confirmed in additional studies, preferably in a prospective series of patients. These studies will also allow a reevaluation of the reproducibility and robustness of the diagnostic criteria for NIFTP. This need is highlighted by two recent studies reporting single cases diagnosed as NIFTP with regional lymph node metastasis. The NIFTP diagnostic errors may occur in both follicular and papillary lineage directions. NIFTP is a follicular-pattern neoplasm often driven by RAS-like mutations. Its invasive counterpart, invasive EFVPTC, is known to metastasize primarily via a hematogenous route and not to regional lymph nodes. However, their nuclear features overlap with PTC. Such reports emphasize the need for thorough histopathological examination and following stringent criteria to diagnose NIFTP.

Better understanding is also needed to define whether or not NIFTP lesions of large size have a similarly low risk of recurrence. A recent study has reported no recurrences in a series of 49 large (≥ 4 cm) NIFTP cases followed for at least four years, although larger series of cases with longer follow-up are needed to define the appropriate monitoring strategies for such patients.

- **Matching for patients' characteristics — subgroup analysis**: Presenting with significant differences in cM1-stage, OFTC and FTC patients were matched to exclude influence on survival in a subgroup analysis. Patients were matched by age, sex, TNM classification, R-stage, tumor size, and RAI dose.

There were 310 patients (111 OFTC and 199 FTC) included in the matched patient group analysis. After matching, 27% of the OFTC group and 31% of the FTC group had evidence of disease after the first RIT (p value 0.517). In patients who presented with ED in the first control, persistent disease was found in 43% of OFTC and in 44% of FTC patients (p value 1.0). Recurrence during follow-up was detected significantly more often in OFTC patients than in FTC patients (19% vs. 8%; p value 0.03).

Mean disease-free survival was 17.7 years (95% CI 15.6–19.7) in the OFTC group (N = 81) and 18.0 years (95% CI 17.0–18.9) in the FTC group (N = 137). The 5-year, 10-year, and 20-year disease-free survival were 89%, 75%, and 72% in patients with OFTC, and 93%, 91%, and 89% in patients with FTC, respectively (p value 0.024).

### Clinical impact of follicular oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinoma in comparison with corresponding classical follicular thyroid carcinoma [^113AD2Xd]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

**Patients**: Between 1993 and 2017, 3,605 new patients with thyroid carcinoma were treated in our department. In this study, only patients diagnosed with the oncocytic variant of follicular carcinoma (OFTC) and classical FTC, with total or near-total thyroidectomy followed by complementary initial radioiodine therapy, were selected. The oncocytic variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma was suspended. Patients with a follow-up of less than one year in our center were also excluded. Finally, 378 patients aged over 18 years were enrolled in this study. Of these, 252 patients (67%) had been diagnosed histologically with classical FTC, and 126 patients (33%) with OFTC. Data on demographic characteristics, tumor grade, persistent disease and recurrence during follow-up, and disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival were collected. Pathology reports were reviewed for all patients to confirm the diagnosis of OFTC and FTC. Histopathology was adjusted to the 8th edition of the TNM classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) for all patients.

### Composite regulation of ERK activity dynamics underlying tumour-specific traits in the intestine [^115R8gMB]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

Adenoma-derived organoids exhibit increased dependence on EGFR signalling. Organoids were generated from the normal epithelium or adenomas of the Apc Δ716 mouse small intestine and infected with lentiviruses expressing a FRET biosensor for ERK activity (EKAREV-NLS).

- **Representative images**: ERK activity (FRET/CFP ratio) was observed in organoids derived from both normal epithelium and adenomas.
- **Bee swarm plots**: ERK activity in the normal epithelium-derived and adenoma-derived organoids showed significant differences (Normal: n = 61, Adenoma: n = 99 cells, from more than three organoids).
- **Inhibitor treatments**: Adenoma-derived organoids expressing EKAREV-NLS were treated with 1 μM of an EGFR inhibitor (EGFRi), PD153035, and/or 10 μM of an ErbB2 inhibitor (ErbB2i), CP-724714.
	- **Representative images**: Observations were made before and after treatment with EGFRi or ErbB2i.
	- **Bee swarm plots**: ERK activity was recorded before and after inhibitor treatment (EGFRi: n = 120, ErbB2i: n = 119, EGFRi + ErbB2i: n = 109 cells, pooled from three organoids).

- **Quantification of ERK activity pulses**: Adenoma-derived organoids were treated with EGFR and/or ErbB2 inhibitors and imaged for 90 minutes. ERK activity data from each cell were processed for analysis.
	- **Frequencies of pulse-like ERK activity**: These were evaluated under different conditions (−/−: n = 40, EGFRi/−: n = 45, −/ErbB2i: n = 32, EGFRi/ErbB2i: n = 29 cells).
	- **Proportion of cells with pulse-like ERK activity**: Noted as ERK-pulse + under each condition. Scale bars, 50 µm. Red lines represent mean. Error bars represent s.e.m. Mann–Whitney U-test and Steel–Dwass test were used for statistical analysis.

### Renal cell carcinoma metastatic to Hurthle cell adenoma of thyroid [^112rUKTN]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Metastases to the thyroid gland are a common finding at autopsy in patients who died of malignancy and are often misdiagnosed as primary thyroid neoplasms clinically. We present a patient with a rare, unusual case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastatic to a Hurthle cell adenoma of the thyroid. A 53-year-old woman was admitted to a University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital (Galveston, TX) for a large right thyroid mass that was present for 3 months. A fine needle aspiration of the thyroid mass was performed and interpreted as suggestive of a Hurthle cell neoplasm. A total thyroidectomy revealed Hurthle cell adenoma containing clusters of cytologically atypical cells with clear cytoplasm.

Subsequent patient evaluation and computed tomography revealed a renal mass. Left radical nephrectomy was performed at a later date for the left renal mass, and microscopic examination confirmed the diagnosis of primary clear cell carcinoma of the kidney. Further studies confirmed that the thyroid mass was metastases from RCC. Although carcinoma of the kidney is responsible in most instances of metastatic disease to the thyroid, metastatic RCC to a thyroid neoplasm is extremely rare, with only two reports found in the English literature. The possibility of metastatic RCC should always be considered, especially when nests of clear cells are seen infiltrating into the thyroid parenchyma or neoplasm.

### The predictive value of the fine-needle aspiration diagnosis "suspicious for a follicular neoplasm, Hurthle cell type" in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis [^115EqfrN]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

A fine-needle aspiration sample composed exclusively of Hürthle cells is interpreted as "suspicious for a follicular neoplasm, Hürthle cell type" (SFNHCT). Some nonneoplastic Hürthle cell proliferations in Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) mimic this cytologic pattern. We examined the positive predictive value (PPV) for malignancy of SFNHCT in patients with HT.

Between 1992 and 2007, 401 patients with cytologic findings of SFNHCT were identified at three institutions. Histologic follow-up was available for 287 (71.6%), and malignancy was diagnosed in 69 (24.0%). Malignancy was present in 2 (PPV = 9.5%) of 21 patients with HT compared with 67 (PPV = 25.2%) of 266 patients without HT (P = 0.081). Although the difference in the rate of malignancy between the HT and non-HT cohorts did not reach statistical significance, the lower risk of malignancy in the HT cohort more closely approximates the risk of cases interpreted as "atypia of undetermined significance". For this reason, it might be appropriate for Hürthle cell-only aspirates from patients with HT to be categorized as either atypia of undetermined significance or SFNHCT.

State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations are essential in the contemporary landscape of thyroid surgical care, particularly considering the classification of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP). These recommendations guide practitioners in the complex decision-making processes related to thyroid surgeries. As the guidelines address surgical interventions, they emphasize the importance of individualized patient care. Moreover, they ensure that surgical practices are aligned with the latest research findings and consensus among eminent professionals in the field.

### The presence of Hürthle cells does not increase the risk of malignancy in most Bethesda categories in thyroid fine-needle aspirates [^1168P512]. Thyroid (2020). Low credibility.

Hürthle cell/oncocytic change is commonly reported on thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) and may be considered an "atypical cell" by clinicians. This study aims to delineate the association between Hürthle cells in preoperative cytology and subsequent pathology of the indexed thyroid nodule, and to report rates of malignancy.

- **Methods**: Retrospective review of records of 300 patients with Hürthle cell/oncocytic change on FNA and final surgical pathology at a tertiary referral center between 2000 and 2013 was performed and compared with a multi-institutional FNA cohort. The degree of Hürthle cell presence was correlated with histopathologic diagnoses.

- **Results**: In the Hürthle cell FNA group, Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC) categories were as follows: I (nondiagnostic) 14 (4.7%); II (benign) 113 (37.7%); III (atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance) 33 (11%); IV (follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm) 125 (41.6%); V (suspicious for malignancy) 12 (4%); and VI (malignant) 3 (1%). When categorized based on the degree of Hürthle cell change, 59 (29%) were classified as mild, 13 (6%) moderate, and 131 (65%) as predominant. When comparing the results with a multi-institutional FNA cohort (all with surgical confirmation), the presence of Hürthle cells was found to be associated with a lower risk of malignancy in all BSRTC categories, with a statistically significant difference in the BSRTC IV and V groups. The sole exception was when Hürthle cell presence was classified as predominant.

### Follicular patterned lesions of the thyroid gland: a practical algorithmic approach [^116yUtAx]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2011). Low credibility.

Follicular patterned lesions of the thyroid are problematic, and their interpretation is often subjective. While thyroid experts are comfortable with their own criteria and thresholds, those encountering these lesions sporadically experience a degree of uncertainty with a proportion of cases. The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of proper, diligent sampling of an encapsulated thyroid lesion (in totality in many cases), examination for capsular and vascular invasion, and finally, the assessment of nuclear changes that are pathognomonic of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

Based on these established criteria, an algorithmic approach is suggested using known, accepted terminology. The importance of unequivocal, clear-cut nuclear features of PTC, as opposed to inconclusive features, is stressed. If the nuclear features in an encapsulated, non-invasive follicular patterned lesion fall short of those encountered in classical PTC, but are nonetheless still worrying or concerning, the term 'uncertain malignant potential or behavior, most likely benign' is suggested. Indubitable, classical PTC nuclei (whether diffuse or restricted to a single high-power field) are diagnostic of a PTC, be it classical, non-invasive, or invasive follicular variant PTC. Capsular and vascular invasion remain the only reliable predictors of outcome, as non-invasive, encapsulated follicular variant PTC, even with diffuse PTC nuclear change, behaves in an indolent fashion.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^115Uv4sj]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Retrospective diagnosis of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features involves careful analysis. Traditionally, the pathologic diagnosis of EFVPTC was made based upon its follicular growth pattern, encapsulation, and, most importantly, its hallmark nuclear cytology. Sectioning of the tumor capsule, the tumor itself, and the surrounding parenchyma must be sufficient to assess for tumor capsular and/or vascular invasion, as well as lymphatic permeation within the surrounding uninvolved thyroid parenchyma to rule out satellite lesions and extrathyroidal extension.

Given the requirement to sample the entire tumor and tumor/parenchymal interface, and complete lesional assessment to exclude the presence of true papillary architecture, the diagnosis of NIFTP should not be made retrospectively. Despite documentation of gross submission of the entire lesional interface (capsule), complete scrutiny cannot be retrospectively assured.

### Composite regulation of ERK activity dynamics underlying tumour-specific traits in the intestine [^1118E25c]. Nature Communications (2018). Low credibility.

The above results demonstrated distinct roles for EGFR and ErbB2 in regulating the ERK activity dynamics in normal cells. We next investigated how these receptors regulate ERK activity dynamics during intestinal tumorigenesis. Organoids were generated from adenomas developed in Apc Δ716 mice, which have a truncation mutation in Apc, followed by the introduction of the biosensor for ERK. Under our experimental conditions, approximately half of the cells in the adenoma-derived organoids expressed the biosensor (Fig. 5a). There was no significant difference in basal ERK activity between the normal and adenoma-derived organoids (P = 0.7599) (Fig. 5a, b). However, a striking difference was observed in the presence of EGFRi and ErbB2i: treatment with EGFRi, which did not affect basal ERK activity in the normal organoids (Fig. 4a, b), significantly decreased it in the adenoma-derived organoids (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5c, d). Moreover, adenoma-derived organoids were less sensitive to ErbB2i compared to the normal organoids (Figs. 5d and 4b).

Meanwhile, EGFRi, but not ErbB2i, decreased the frequency of the ERK activity pulses (Fig. 5e) and the proportion of ERK-pulse + cells in adenoma-derived organoids (Fig. 5f). Treatment with both inhibitors almost completely suppressed the firing of ERK activity pulses (Fig. 5e, f). Altogether, these results indicate that EGFR signalling is a predominant driver for basal ERK activity and spontaneous ERK activity pulses in adenoma-derived organoids.

### Clinical impact of follicular oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinoma in comparison with corresponding classical follicular thyroid carcinoma [^114fSznj]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

There are controversial debates regarding whether patients with Hürthle cell carcinoma, also known as oxyphilic or oncocytic cell follicular thyroid carcinoma, have a poorer outcome. In this study, we systematically evaluated the clinical outcomes in a large patient cohort following thyroidectomy and initial I-131 radioactive iodine therapy (RIT).

We retrospectively evaluated a total of 378 patients diagnosed with oncocytic follicular Hürthle cell carcinoma (OFTC) (N = 126) or classical follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) (N = 252). Patients underwent thyroidectomy and complementary I-131 RIT. Clinical data regarding basic demographic characteristics, tumor grade, persistent disease, recurrence during follow-up, and disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival were collected over a follow-up period of 6.9 years (interquartile range, 3.7–11.7 years). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with disease-related and overall survival.

Before and after matching for risk factors, recurrence was significantly more frequently diagnosed in OFTC patients during follow-up (17% vs. 8%; p value 0.037). Likewise, OFTC patients presented with a reduced mean disease-free survival of 17.9 years (95% CI 16.0–19.8) compared to 20.1 years (95% CI 19.0–21.1) in FTC patients (p value 0.027). Multivariate analysis revealed OFTC (HR 0.502; 95% CI 0.309–0.816) as the only independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival. Distant metastases in OFTC patients were significantly less iodine-avid (p value 0.014).

### Thyroid aspiration cytology: Current status [^115t1tcn]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

In the adult population, thyroid nodules are common and are increasingly detected by ultrasound examination or other scanning techniques. Depending on their size and ultrasonographic features, these nodules may require further investigation, including tissue diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has become the predominant method to obtain tissue for microscopic analysis. In October 2007, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a conference to review the state of the science for the use of FNA in the management of thyroid nodules. This conference reviewed indications for thyroid FNA and pre-FNA requirements, training and credentialing, techniques for thyroid FNA, diagnostic terminology and morphologic criteria, utilization of ancillary studies, and post-FNA testing and treatment options. The results of those discussions have been published in both print and electronic versions. The aim of the article was to discuss indications for FNA, diagnostic terminology, and post-FNA options, issues that are important to physicians who are managing patients with thyroid nodules.

### Clinical impact of follicular oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinoma in comparison with corresponding classical follicular thyroid carcinoma [^112FVAUY]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The definition of endpoints was established by comparing patient outcomes at four different time points: the first control after RIT, during follow-up, the last visit of follow-up, and the end of study, in analogy to a previously published study.

- **NED and ED classification at first control**: In the first control, patients were categorized into two groups, namely NED and ED. NED was assumed if the Tg level was under the detection limit (1.6 ng/ml for 1993–1996; < 1.0 ng/ml for 1996–1997; < 0.5 ng/ml after 1998) while Tg recovery was in the normal range. Additionally, the RAI diagnostic whole-body scan had to be negative, and the ultrasound examination had to show no local recurrence and/or lymphadenopathy.

- **Follow-up evaluations**: During follow-up, the rate of persistent disease and recurrence was evaluated. Persistent disease was supposed if the stimulated or non-stimulated Tg level remained above the detection limit and if local recurrence, nodal, and distant metastases were not treated curatively.

- **Criteria for recurrence evaluation**: Recurrence was only evaluated in patients with an initial M0/Mx status and complete response in the first follow-up examination, which included stimulated Tg under the detection limit and an unsuspicious diagnostic RAI whole-body scan (N = 242). In these patients, recurrence was assumed if the Tg-level increased above the detection limit, or if tumor lesions were detected during follow-up. Disease-free survival was defined as the period from the first day of surgery to the first day of recurrence in M0/Mx patients.

- **Assessment of RAI uptake in distant metastases**: Furthermore, RAI uptake of distant metastases was assessed. Positive uptake was defined as increased uptake in all metastatic sites, whereas insufficient uptake was defined as no uptake at all or only partial uptake.

### Biological differential diagnosis of follicular thyroid tumor and Hürthle cell tumor on the basis of telomere length and hTERT expression [^112WxbhD]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

The most difficult thyroid tumors to diagnose by histology are follicular carcinomas (FTCs) and Hürthle cell carcinomas (HCCs). Telomere alteration and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression have been observed in most human cancers and are known to be a feature of malignancy. The purpose of this study was to clarify whether hTERT protein expression and telomere alteration could be applicable biological markers for distinguishing FTC from HCC.

- **Methods**: We investigated a total of 78 thyroid tumor cases, including 14 FTCs, 47 follicular adenomas (FTAs), 5 HCCs, and 12 Hürthle cell adenomas (HCAs). hTERT protein expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, and telomere length was determined by tissue quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization.

- **Results**: Positivity for hTERT protein expression was observed in 86% of FTCs and 49% of FTAs. Telomeres in FTCs were significantly shorter than those in FTAs. All HCCs and HCAs (100%) expressed hTERT protein. Telomeres in HCCs were significantly shorter than those in HCAs.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that hTERT protein expression and telomere shortening would be applicable as biological markers to distinguish FTC from FTA. Previous studies have suggested that follicular tumor and Hürthle cell tumor should be classified biologically as distinct tumors. All Hürthle cell tumors expressed hTERT protein and HCCs had markedly shortened telomeres, suggesting that follicular tumor and Hürthle cell tumor might be biologically distinct entities.

### Spatiotemporal reprogramming of differentiated cells underlies regeneration and neoplasia in the intestinal epithelium [^113q2Tje]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Cancer stem cells manifest marked plasticity, which is often analogous to that of normal tissue stem cells during tissue regeneration. Recent studies have indicated that Lgr5− cells play key roles in the maintenance and metastasis of intestinal cancers. Despite previous studies showing injury-inducible stem cell activity of EE lineage cells in normal intestinal crypts, the dynamics of such cells in the neoplastic context have not been directly characterized. We therefore investigated the stem cell activity of p57+ cells in adenomas of the small intestine. Immunofluorescence staining of intestinal tumors from Apc Δ716 mice revealed that approximately 1% of adenoma cells expressed p57 (Fig. 8a).

RT-qPCR analysis revealed preferential expression of marker genes for EE cells or intestinal LRCs in p57-Venus+ cells versus total adenoma cells from Apc Δ716/p57-DTR-Venus mice (Fig. 8b, c). Tracing experiments with Apc Δ716/p57-CreER T2 /CAG-LSL-tdTomato mice (Fig. 8d) showed that the initially labeled cells after injection of tamoxifen were completely negative for Ki67 staining (Fig. 8e). These results suggested that, similar to their normal counterparts, p57+ cells in intestinal adenoma remain quiescent and retain EE cell identity. In contrast to the complete absence of stem cell activity for p57+ normal crypt cells in the steady-state (Fig. 4), however, we observed lineage tracing events for p57+ adenoma cells (Fig. 8f), with the width of segments ranging from 50 to 500 μm and at least one tracing event being apparent.

### Does a restrictive diagnostic work-up for thyroid nodules lead to a different papillary thyroid cancer patient population? A comparison between Dutch and U.S. T1-T3 patient populations [^1135LSea]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

- **Histology**: The classic type of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) was most prevalent, accounting for 2367 (70.3%) of the patients, followed by the follicular variant (22.5%) and mixed papillary and follicular (5.8%). Less common were the more aggressive types of PTC, including tall cell (0.4%), diffuse sclerosing (0.3%), columnar cell (0.1%), and Hürthle cell (0.5%). Vascular invasion was present in 11.3% of the patients, and the prevalences of R0, R1, and R2 in the total group were 82.5%, 9.0%, and 8.6%, respectively. Multifocal disease was observed in 37.5% of patients, occurring more frequently in the non-low-risk group (44.1% vs. 31.9%, p < 0.001). The median tumor size in the low-risk group was 13.0 mm (IQR: 6.0–22.0), significantly smaller than in the non-low-risk group (25.0 mm, IQR: 15.0–45.0, p < 0.001). Furthermore, tumors were bilaterally located in 22.4% of all patients, with a higher frequency in the non-low-risk group (27.7% vs. 17.8%, p < 0.001).

- **TNM stage**: Pathological TNM staging data is provided in the corresponding table. The prevalences of pT1, pT2, and pT3 tumors were 45.8%, 34.9%, and 19.3%, respectively. Nodal metastases were present in 902 patients (26.8%), with 126 cases (6.9%) of central nodal metastases observed in the low-risk group. Distant metastases at diagnosis were detected in 18 patients (0.5%), primarily affecting the lungs (n = 9), bones (n = 6), and isolated cases in the brain, thoracic wall, and thymus. pT1 tumors were most common (63.7%) in patients with low-risk PTC.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatic adenoma, more specifically concerning cross-sectional imaging, the EASL 2016 guidelines recommend preferring MRI. It is superior to all other imaging modalities and, due to its intrinsic properties to detect fat and vascular spaces, offers an opportunity to subtype hepatocellular adenoma up to 80%.

### Hürthle cell tumor of the thyroid: analysis of 188 cases [^115c61nA]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). High credibility.

We reviewed 188 cases of Hürthle cell tumor of the thyroid (HCT) between 1982 and 1996. There were 160 women and 28 men, with a mean age of 51.8 years. Thirty-one of the patients had cancer, and others had adenoma. Age, size of the primary tumor, and preoperative thyroglobulin level were not significantly different in the cancer and adenoma patients. However, the gender ratio was significantly different (p < 0.05).

- **Recurrence in adenoma patients**: ReHCT was observed in three patients with adenoma. Two patients had subcutaneous recurrence (suspected implantation), and one patient had recurrence in the residual thyroid gland. All patients with recurrence of adenoma underwent partial lobectomy at the initial operation.

- **Recurrence in cancer patients**: Three cancer patients had re-disease. Locoregional recurrence was observed in one patient, and distant metastases were present in two patients (lung in one, lung and bone in one). One of the patients with distant metastasis died from the disease, while the other is alive with the disease.

- **Tumor handling implications**: Tumor implantation was observed in patients with adenoma, indicating that intraoperative handling of the tumor requires care. This means that, even though benign, the tumor is aggressive in terms of proliferative activity.

All patients with Hürthle cell tumor should be treated by total lobectomy at least. The outcome of the cancer patients was not as poor as in previous reports.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^114vPk7d]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features: Some researchers propose that ultrasound findings coupled with the cytomorphologic features can be used to triage intermediate FNA categories regarding NIFTP preoperative detection. Yang et al. have reviewed 179 cases and categorized ultrasonography characteristics and cytomorphologic FNA features for different FVPTC categories. Hahn et al, in a multicenter study, demonstrated that NIFTP cases lacked malignant ultrasound features and were better triaged using an ultrasound core biopsy rather than using standard FNA to facilitate surgical decision making. Yang et al. found that the ultrasound findings of NIFTP and minimally invasive EFVPTCs were similar and could not be distinguished from each other; both typically exhibited a circumscribed oval or round nodule with a hypoechoic rim and a hypervascular Doppler signal. In contrast, ultrasound findings for overtly invasive EFVPTC typically showed a round or oval nodule with irregular margins and hypervascularity on Doppler. Ultrasound for an invasive FVPTC typically reveals at least one of these features: markedly hypoechoic, taller-than-wide, microcalcifications, or blurred margins with an avascular Doppler pattern.

### Follicular adenoma with a papillary architecture originating from an ectopic thyroid gland: A case report [^1116WBvR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

In the present case, the mass had a high density on plain CT tomography, comparable to the density of the thyroid gland, reflecting the iodine content of the tumors. However, because our patient had a normal thyroid gland and cytology showed findings suggestive of cystic fluid with no cells of thyroid origin, we considered the findings to reflect an intracystic hemorrhage. Therefore, we did not consider an ectopic thyroid gland as a differential diagnosis.

Although generalization is difficult due to masses often showing cystic changes rather than uniform density, an ectopic thyroid should be included in the differential diagnosis when the tumor shows a density similar to that of the thyroid gland on plain CT images. If an ectopic thyroid is suspected preoperatively, thyroid scintigraphy can be useful for diagnosis. However, this technique is not routinely performed for masses in the lateral neck. As the patient in the present case had a normal thyroid gland, an ectopic thyroid was not suspected, and scintigraphy was not performed.

Differential diseases for a mass with cystic changes in the lateral neck region, as in the present case, include lateral cervical cysts, neurogenic tumors, and cystic cervical lymph node metastases. The mass was in contact with the submandibular gland, and thus a tumor of submandibular gland origin was considered. Our case was atypical for a lateral cervical cyst due to the substantial component inside the cyst. Thyroid and oropharyngeal cancers are the most common diseases that can cause such presentations.

### Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma presenting as a "hot" nodule [^114qcY6b]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To report an unusual clinical scenario and a rare histopathologic finding of Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma in a patient with an autonomous thyroid nodule, we describe the presentation and clinical course leading to the surprising histopathologic diagnosis of Hürthle cell carcinoma in a pediatric patient who was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism presenting as a solitary toxic nodule.

A 13-year-old white girl presented with a recent history of a palpable thyroid nodule during a routine primary care clinic visit. She was asymptomatic, and thyroid function tests revealed a suppressed thyrotropin concentration, high-normal free thyroxine concentration, and elevated triiodothyronine concentration. The patient underwent dedicated thyroid ultrasonography revealing a 3.5-cm complex mass in the left lobe with increased central vascularity. Iodine 123 imaging of the thyroid demonstrated homogeneous, hyperintense activity in the left lobe; the right lobe was not visualized. A solitary toxic nodule was diagnosed, and, considering her age, she was referred for surgical management. The patient underwent a left lobectomy with isthmusectomy. Pathologic examination revealed a 5-cm, encapsulated, well-differentiated Hürthle cell carcinoma with negative margins and no lymphovascular invasion. The patient underwent subsequent completion thyroidectomy with no evidence of residual carcinoma in the right thyroid lobe.

Malignancy in autonomously functioning thyroid nodules is rare, and most thyroid nodules presenting as "hot" on radioiodine scintigraphy are benign.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^114g2jnh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology is the next step in the triage of a thyroid nodule and should be reserved for lesions found to be sufficiently suspicious based on US and clinical findings. The results play a key role in optimizing subsequent management. In 2007, experts at the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD, discussed the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC). The first edition of the system was published in 2010, followed by an updated version in 2018. The BSRTC is widely used in the United States and has served as a model for similar tiered classification schemes developed in other parts of the world.

The robust diagnostic framework provided by the BSRTC offers valuable guidance in developing management strategies for patients with thyroid nodules. Nonetheless, several potential diagnostic pitfalls exist that can lead to false-positive, false-negative, nondiagnostic, or indeterminate results. Cytology itself has limitations: it cannot distinguish between follicular-patterned hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodules, follicular adenomas, follicular carcinoma, and some cases of follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. Thyroid cytology can be considered only a screening test for these follicular-patterned lesions, the results of which will almost invariably be reported as "indeterminate". These are usually assigned to Bethesda class III ("atypia of undetermined significance" or "follicular lesions of undetermined significance") or IV ("follicular neoplasm").

### The role of proto-oncogene GLI1 in pituitary adenoma formation and cell survival regulation [^111jhB11]. Endocrine-related Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is an important regulator of early tissue patterning and stem cell propagation. It was found to be aberrantly activated in numerous types of human cancer and might be relevant in cancer stem cells. The identification of adult stem cells in the pituitary raised the question of whether tumor-initiating cells and Hh signaling are involved in pituitary adenoma formation.

The present study aimed to evaluate Hh signaling in relation to stem cell and cell cycle markers in 30 human pituitary adenomas and in cultured murine adenoma cells. Therefore, expression levels of components of the Hh pathway, stem cell marker SOX2, cell cycle regulator tumor-protein 53 (TP53), proliferation marker Ki67 (MKI67), and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) were evaluated in 30 human pituitary adenomas in comparison to control tissue. Modulation of cell function and target gene expression by the inhibition and activation of the Hh pathway were studied in murine adenoma cells.

We show that transcription factor glioma-associated oncogene 1 (GLI1) is overexpressed in 87% of all pituitary adenomas. The expression of GLI1 significantly correlated with that of SOX2, TP53, MKI67, and SOD1. Inhibition of GLI1 resulted in the downregulation of the above genes and severe cell death in mouse adenoma cells. On the other hand, activation of the Hh pathway increased cell viability and target gene expression.

In conclusion, our findings point toward an alternative, ligand-independent Hh pathway activation with GLI1 playing a major role in the cell survival of pituitary adenoma cells.

### Clinical impact of follicular oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinoma in comparison with corresponding classical follicular thyroid carcinoma [^117RKzpF]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

All our patients were treated with total or near-total thyroidectomy followed by initial RIT. In previously published studies, the percentage of thyroidectomy ranged from 27% to 100%. Surgery for thyroid carcinoma is an important component of a multimodal treatment approach. Former guidelines have suggested total thyroidectomy as the primary surgical treatment option for nearly all thyroid carcinoma greater than 1 cm, with or without evidence of loco-regional or distant metastases.

The benefit of consecutive RIT in OFTC patients is still not clarified sufficiently. Certainly, ablative RIT of residual thyroid tissue can improve early detection of recurrences based on Tg measurement. However, it is claimed that OFTC patients demonstrate a poorer iodine avidity and are therefore less responsive to RIT. Indeed, in a previously published study, most of the known metastases did not show RAI uptake, and furthermore, not all metastatic sites showed uniform RAI uptake. In contrast, Besic et al. found radioiodine uptake in residual disease or in distant metastases in 11 of 16 OFTC patients. Thus, the efficacy of RIT in metastatic OFTC patients is still controversial.

In our study, distant metastases of OFTC patients were significantly less iodine-avid. Indeed, only 11% of metastatic OFTC patients have shown RAI uptake, which is in line with a previously published study. In this study, only 10% of OFTC patients with bone and pulmonary metastases demonstrated RAI uptake. Nevertheless, Jillard et al. have shown that survival was significantly improved in OFTC patients.

### Thyroid nodules [^11267SRE]. The Medical Clinics of North America (2012). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on thyroid nodules:

- **Definition**: Thyroid nodules are solid growths in the thyroid gland that are radiologically distinct from surrounding thyroid parenchyma.

- **Pathophysiology**: Thyroid nodules may be benign, such as follicular adenoma, Hurthle cell adenoma, colloid cyst, simple or hemorrhagic cyst, lymphocytic thyroiditis, granulomatous thyroiditis, or infectious processes. Conversely, they can be malignant, involving malignancy of follicular or C-cell origin, including papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, Hurthle cell carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, thyroid lymphoma, or malignancy metastatic to the thyroid.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid nodules in the general population is greater than 65%. The estimated incidence of thyroid nodules in the US is approximately 0.1% per year.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for thyroid nodules include advanced age, female sex, tobacco use, higher BMI, metabolic syndrome, iodine deficiency, history of radiation exposure, elevated levels of TSH, increased thyroid volume, and autoimmune thyroid diseases.

- **Disease course**: Large thyroid nodules can result in dysphagia, dyspnea, and dysphonia. Over time, thyroid nodules may also become malignant.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules is around 4–6.5%.

### Molecular variants and their risks for malignancy in cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules [^111zUzAt]. Thyroid (2019). Low credibility.

Our goal was to include all relevant publications. There are known limitations for online searches, so we extended our search to include bibliographies of articles identified by the online search and personal libraries known to include articles relevant to this topic. To ensure the additional offline search methods did not skew the results, data were reanalyzed using only the publications found via the online search and yielded no significant differences.

Additionally, the panel heterogeneity limited the ability to directly compare results of any two publications and estimate accurate incidences. This heterogeneity, along with data only available on operated positive cases in most studies, also made calculations of sensitivity unreliable.

Another potential limitation is that our analysis utilized local, largely unblinded histological diagnoses, as opposed to a blinded panel of expert histopathologists. Caution should be exercised in generalizing any single center's experience to other populations. Imperfect diagnostic concordance among pathologists is known, especially among follicular and oncocytic lesions, and tendencies to categorize such lesions as benign or malignant along with the unblinded nature of such diagnoses could impact locally derived PPVs and would generate heterogeneity among PPV estimates between institutions with differing tendencies.

### Be aware of the patient with benign follicular thyroid lesion histology and rising thyroglobulin level [^116GuHTq]. Endocrine Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The accurate diagnosis of thyroid follicular and Hürthle cell tumors is challenging and controversial. This study presents a series of patients in whom a misclassification of follicular and Hürthle cell thyroid lesions as benign led to devastating clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: The Thyroid Cancer Registry of Rabin Medical Center was screened for patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) initially diagnosed with benign follicular lesion between 1974 and 2015 and treated with hemithyroidectomy. Clinical, pathologic, and outcome data were collected from medical files, and adequate pathology specimens, when available, were re-evaluated.

- **Results**: Seven patients met the inclusion criteria. The original pathologic diagnosis was follicular adenoma in four patients and Hürthle cell adenoma in three patients. Five patients had bone metastases: one also had lung metastases, and another had liver metastases. One patient had both cervical and lung metastases, while another had only metastatic neck lymph nodes. Six patients were ultimately diagnosed with encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (EFVPTC), and one had follicular thyroid cancer metastasis confirmed by bone biopsy. Retrospective analysis revealed capsular invasion in three patients, and only one patient showed evidence of vascular invasion. All seven patients exhibited high levels of thyroglobulin at the diagnosis of metastatic DTC.

- **Conclusion**: The misclassification of follicular thyroid lesions as benign can lead to progressive and disseminated DTC, underscoring the need for careful diagnostic evaluation.

### 2023 European Thyroid Association clinical practice guidelines for thyroid nodule management [^111Z3JGw]. European Thyroid Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding the follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, specifically in the context of follow-up evaluation for nodules classified as benign by fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the ETA 2023 guidelines recommend the following strategies for patients with thyroid nodules with Bethesda I cytology:

- **EU-TIRADS 3 (> 20 mm)**: Repeat FNA; consider performing a core-needle biopsy if the results remain nondiagnostic. Obtain a re-evaluation within 1 year or offer surgery if the results are still nondiagnostic.

- **EU-TIRADS 4 (> 15 mm) and 5 (> 10 mm)**: Repeat FNA; consider performing a core-needle biopsy or molecular testing (if available and sufficient material) if the results remain nondiagnostic. Offer active surveillance or surgery if the results are still nondiagnostic.

### The diagnostic role of FNA based on clinicopathological features in thyroid malignancy [^115gFWok]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a cost-effective, simple, and precise method to evaluate thyroid nodules; however, false positive and false negative results can complicate cases that are misdiagnosed. By utilizing the clinical and sonographical features of the nodule, the rate of diagnostic errors could be significantly reduced. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and sensitivity of FNA results concerning the final pathology of dissected thyroid nodules and assessed the role of other clinicopathological features in the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules.

### Hurthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid [^111cEmh4]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old man consulted for a non-toxic thyroid nodule of 2 years' duration. Fine needle aspiration revealed cell findings consistent with papillary thyroid carcinoma. He eventually underwent total thyroidectomy. Microscopic examination revealed histologic features of Hurthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid. He received radioactive iodine therapy and suppressive levothyroxine treatment. A post-therapy whole body iodine-131 scan revealed thyroid tissue remnants limited to the anterior neck. Four months after radioactive iodine therapy, the thyroglobulin level is low, and the patient remains with no evidence of disease.

### Is repeat fine needle aspiration required in thyroid nodules with initial benign cytology? Results from a large Irish series [^113PTnzQ]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Our real-life experience with a large number of thyroid nodules shows a low rate of false-negative thyroid cytology. When excluding incidental microcarcinomas and inadequate samples, the false-negative result appears to be around 1%. Therefore, we recommend against routine repeat FNAC of low-risk thyroid nodules initially classified as Thy 2 by an experienced cytologist.

### Macrofollicular variant of follicular thyroid carcinoma: a clinical, cytologic, morphologic, and image analysis study of a unique case [^116uKNhm]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Thyroid lesions composed of large follicles that contain abundant colloid are usually regarded as benign hyperplastic or adenomatous nodules by both fine-needle aspiration cytology and histology. In such cases, the pathologist is less likely to request the complete inclusion of the capsule into a paraffin block and to look for vascular and/or capsular invasion, which are the only criteria that permit the differential diagnosis between a benign nodule and a follicular carcinoma. We report the first case of a follicular thyroid carcinoma composed predominantly (> 90%) of macrofollicles with a surface area that was up to 5 times larger than the surface area of normal follicles, as calculated with an image analysis system. Capsular invasion was detected in 2 separate foci. The tumor was classified as a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma, macrofollicular variant. This case is detailed to highlight the potential pitfall that may arise from an incomplete histological analysis of a macrofollicular lesion, with particular attention paid to the differential diagnoses.

### Clinical impact of follicular oncocytic (Hürthle cell) carcinoma in comparison with corresponding classical follicular thyroid carcinoma [^111LqhgN]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The study has several limitations. Firstly, the retrospective design and single-center nature of the study are notable constraints. Histopathological data needed adjustment to align with the 8th edition of the UICC to compare the TNM status; as a result, some patients' TNM classification could not be adapted. Additionally, hybrid imaging techniques such as SPECT were unavailable at the time of inclusion, making it challenging to reliably differentiate between thyroid remnant tissue and radioiodine-avid lymph node metastases.

Furthermore, the Tg assays available during the study were less sensitive than current assays, potentially hindering the early detection of recurrence. Treatment regimens varied over time, transitioning from aggressive approaches to more personalized therapies that account for various risk factors. This shift, however, applies equally to both patient groups in the study. The focus was on long-term outcomes, necessitating the inclusion of these patients to ensure the relevance of the results to contemporary practice.

Finally, the median follow-up time of nearly seven years may be insufficient to detect differences in overall and disease-specific survival. The favorable overall prognosis of differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) and oncocytic follicular thyroid carcinoma (OFTC) may require a larger patient cohort and extended follow-up to reveal survival differences.

### Predictors of malignancy in patients with a thyroid nodule that contains Hürthle cells [^117JSaJ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fine needle aspiration cytology of a thyroid nodule with Hürthle cells can indicate either benign or malignant thyroid diseases. This study aimed to identify factors predicting malignancy in patients who underwent thyroidectomy following a preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology, which predominantly revealed Hürthle cells.

- **Study design**: Retrospective data collection.
- **Setting**: Tertiary referral center.
- **Subjects and methods**: Medical records of 70 consecutive patients were reviewed between March 2005 and August 2010. Various predictive factors — such as age, gender, preoperative serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, the microscopic findings of fine needle aspirations, ultrasonographic appearance, and the size and number of nodules in the pathology report — were correlated with the final histopathologic diagnosis of either benign or malignant disease.

- **Results**: The final pathology revealed that 21 patients (30%) had malignant disease, with 15 patients (71.4%) having papillary carcinoma and 6 patients (28.6%) having Hürthle cell carcinoma. Forty-nine patients (70%) had benign diseases, including hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodules in 24 patients, Hashimoto thyroiditis in 18 patients, Hürthle cell adenoma in 5 patients, and follicular adenoma in 2 patients. The rate of malignancy was higher in male patients (42.9% vs. 28.6%), for nodules measuring ≥ 2 cm (36.7% vs. 25.0%), with the presence of a solitary nodule (34.3% vs. 27.7%), and with the presence of metaplasia in fine needle aspiration (36.4% vs. 27.1%). However, none of these factors were found to be statistically significant (P > .05).

### Special variants of differentiated thyroid cancer: Does it alter the extent of surgery versus well-differentiated thyroid cancer [^113C8817]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Recently, more aggressive variants of so-called well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas have been identified, including the tall cell variant, columnar cell variant, diffuse sclerosing variant, insular carcinoma, and Hürthle cell (oncocytic, oxyphilic) carcinomas.

- **Methods**: An evidence-based review was performed to identify the optimal treatment recommendations for these thyroid cancers of intermediate differentiation.

- **Conclusions**: Although some variation exists within the group, aggressive surgical and medical management are recommended for these neoplasias. Any such recommendations should, however, be viewed in light of the fact that the literature mainly consists of case reports, case series, and limited reviews. The clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and surgical and medical management for these thyroid cancers with intermediate differentiation are discussed.

### Current state and future perspective of molecular diagnosis of fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules [^1112n1VR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most sensitive and specific tool for the differential diagnosis of thyroid malignancy. Some limitations of FNAB can be overcome by the molecular analysis of FNAB. This review analyzes the state and problems of the molecular analysis of FNAB, as well as possible goals for increasing the diagnostic rate, especially in the indeterminate/follicular lesion cytological group.

- **Evidence acquisition**: Twenty publications were evaluated for the diagnostic material and assay systems used, the type, and the number of mutations screened. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative and false-positive rates were calculated for all publications.

- **Evidence synthesis**: Testing for a panel of somatic mutations is most promising to reduce the number of indeterminate FNAB. A mean sensitivity of 63.7% was achieved for indeterminate lesions. However, there is a broad sensitivity range for the investigation of mutations in the indeterminate lesions. Therefore, additional molecular markers should be defined by mRNA and microRNA expression studies and evaluated in FNAB samples of thyroid carcinomas without known somatic mutations, and especially for the many benign nodules in the indeterminate/follicular lesion fine-needle aspiration cytology category. This approach should improve the differential diagnosis of indeterminate/follicular lesion FNAB samples.

Testing for a panel of somatic mutations has led to an improvement of sensitivity/specificity for indeterminate/follicular proliferation FNAB samples. Further methodological improvements are necessary to enhance diagnostic accuracy in these cases.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS Endocrine Section Consensus Statement: State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^112cXmj7]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Although there are no clinical features established or even suspected that definitively prove the existence preoperatively of a NIFTP, many clinical features available to the astute clinician can be pivotal in making management decisions. Presence of significant contralateral lobe nodules, lymph node metastases, tumor fixation, vocal cord paralysis or voice changes, posterior capsule tumor abutment on imaging, or clear radiographic evidence for extrathyroidal extension should lead toward total thyroidectomy.

Additionally, the patient's willingness to have a second surgery if needed, as well as medical fitness for potential completion surgery, should also be considered in the initial surgical discussion of hemithyroidectomy versus total thyroidectomy. Furthermore, multidisciplinary preoperative discussion should occur, and the team as a whole should also be comfortable with plans for less extensive surgery when NIFTP is suspected preoperatively. Once suspected by cytomorphologic, molecular testing, and ultrasonography, the clinical management of a patient with NIFTP should incorporate these clinical features in discussions between the patient, endocrinologist, and surgeon.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^117KZZ2x]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

Pre-NIFTP, the likely histologic outcome of a follicular-patterned lesion of the thyroid in an FNA included a hyperplastic/adenomatoid nodule, follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma, and follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC). Before April 2016, the FVPTC diagnosis included encapsulated forms with and without invasion as well as infiltrating FVPTC tumors.

The reclassification of the noninvasive encapsulated FVPTC as NIFTP has significant implications for the practice of thyroid cytopathology. The most significant change will involve a decrease in the implied risk of malignancy, particularly for cases classified into three so‐called "indeterminate" diagnostic categories of The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology:

- **Bethesda class III**: Atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS).
- **Bethesda class IV**: Follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN).
- **Bethesda class V**: Suspicious for malignancy (SFM).

Recent studies suggest that the decrease in risk of malignancy as a result of NIFTP will be most significant (up to 50%) for thyroid FNA specimens classified as SFM. Interestingly, these same studies have shown no appreciable change in the risk of malignancy for FNA specimens classified as "benign" and only a small decrease for the malignant category. Faquin et al. reported a collection of 6943 thyroid FNA specimens pooled.

### Neoplasms and tumor-like lesions of the sellar region: Imaging findings with correlation to pathology and 2021 who classification [^115iR29N]. Neuroradiology (2023). High credibility.

The sella turcica harbors the pituitary gland, a bean-shaped gland with two distinct lobes: the anterior lobe, also called the adenohypophysis, and the posterior lobe named the neurohypophysis (Fig. 1A). The anterior lobe, by far the largest part of the gland, is divided into a "pars tuberalis" (rich in capillaries), a "pars intermedia", and a "pars distalis" (the most prevalent segment of this portion of the gland in terms of volume).

From an embryological perspective, the pituitary gland has a dual origin reflecting its two distinct parts. Rathke's pouch, a dorsal evagination of the stomodeum, forms the anterior and intermediate lobes, while the infundibulum, a ventral extension of the diencephalon, forms the posterior lobe. The anterior lobe is responsible for the synthesis and release of most pituitary hormones, such as growth hormone (GH), corticotropin (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), prolactin (PRL), and thyrotropic hormone (TSH). The only exceptions are oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which are released by the posterior lobe.

The pituitary gland is anatomically and functionally related to the hypothalamus by a stem called the infundibulum, or pituitary stalk. The stalk extends inferiorly from the tuber cinereum, which is a part of the hypothalamus — a thin convex mass of gray matter that lies between the optic chiasm anteriorly and the mammillary bodies posteriorly — and descends to become continuous with the posterior pituitary lobe (Fig. 1B, C). The third ventricle lies in the midline.

### Tumor size predicts malignant potential in Hürthle cell neoplasms of the thyroid [^1136iQna]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

A fine needle aspiration (FNA) diagnosis of a Hürthle cell neoplasm is associated with a 20% risk of malignancy. We sought to determine if the primary tumor size correlated with the risk of malignancy in patients with a preoperative FNA diagnosis of a Hürthle cell neoplasm.

- **Methods**: Between January 2000 and November 2006, 57 patients underwent a thyroidectomy with a preoperative FNA diagnosis of a Hürthle cell neoplasm. Patient histories, FNA reports, operative notes, and pathology reports were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical analysis was performed.

- **Results**: The overall rate of malignancy in patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms was 21%. The average tumor size was 3.2 cm, with malignant tumors being significantly larger than benign tumors (5.0 vs. 2.7 cm, p < 0.01). The risk of malignancy directly correlated with tumor size. No malignancies were seen in tumors 2 cm or smaller (0/15). The risk of malignancy was only 13% (6/46) in tumors 4 cm or smaller and increased to 55% (6/11) in tumors larger than 4 cm. All tumors larger than 6 cm were malignant (4/4).

- **Conclusions**: Tumor size correlates directly with malignant potential in patients with Hürthle cell neoplasms of the thyroid. Among our patients, malignancy was not present in any tumors 2 cm or smaller and was present in all tumors larger than 6 cm. Because the risk of malignancy is greater than 50% in patients with a tumor larger than 4 cm, consideration should be given for an initial total thyroidectomy in these patients.

### Performance of the afirma gene expression classifier in Hürthle cell thyroid nodules differs from other indeterminate thyroid nodules [^115eECVj]. Thyroid (2015). Low credibility.

The recently introduced Afirma gene expression classifier (AGEC) provides binary results (benign or suspicious) to guide management of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. The AGEC aims to reduce unnecessary surgeries for benign nodules, and management algorithms favor surgery for suspicious results. Limited data are available on the performance of this test for Hürthle cell nodules (HCNs). This study hypothesized that a predominance of Hürthle cells leads to an increased rate of suspicious AGEC results with a potential for overtreatment, despite a relatively low risk of malignancy.

- **Methods**: The pathology databases from three tertiary care facilities were queried from 2010 to 2014 for fine-needle aspirates (FNAs) diagnosed as suspicious for Hürthle cell neoplasm (SHCN) or atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance concerning for Hürthle cell neoplasm (AFHCN). Cytology diagnoses were rendered internally prior to AGEC testing. The patient demographics, FNA diagnosis, AGEC result, surgical procedure, and pathologic outcomes were recorded.

- **Results**: The cohort consisted of 134 patients with HCNs. Prior to AGEC availability, 62 patients underwent surgery; 81% (50/62) of patients had surgery, and 34% (17/50) of the resected index nodules were malignant. After introduction of the AGEC, 72 patients underwent AGEC testing; 65% (47/72) of patients had surgery, and 13% (6/46) of the resected nodules were malignant. Thirty-two percent (23/72) of patients had a benign AGEC result and did not undergo surgery.

### FDG-avid Hürthle cell thyroid adenoma [^114z3JYL]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Incidental thyroid uptake is found in approximately 2.5% of patients who undergo FDG PET for nonthyroid malignancy; approximately a third of the FDG PET thyroid incidentalomas are malignant, including primary thyroid malignancies and metastasis.

We describe a 50-year-old woman, a potential heart transplant candidate with a history of breast cancer, who was found by FDG PET/CT to harbor a large thyroid mass with intense FDG uptake. Biopsy and molecular study demonstrated that the thyroid mass was a Hürthle cell adenoma. This case highlights that Hürthle cell neoplasm should be included in the differential diagnosis of a thyroid nodule with very high FDG avidity.

### Clinical biology of the pituitary adenoma [^117AgF3i]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The cell lineage classification is designed to better align biological and clinical adenoma classifications. For example, the application of this classification has led to a decrease in the reported prevalence of the so-called null cell adenomas due to their previously unclear pathologic classification. Of note, null cell adenomas once accounted for about 20% of all pituitary adenomas in large tumor registries and nearly a third of hormone-negative, nonfunctioning tumors. Currently, they only represent 1% to 2% of all pituitary tumors. This raises the question of whether these adenomas truly exist or if they reflect the limitations of our diagnostic methodologies for further characterization of cell lineage. Null cell adenomas, classified by their lack of cell lineage differentiation through both pituitary hormone and transcription factor immunoexpression, may exhibit more aggressive clinical behavior than other nonsecreting adenomas.

### AHNS series: Do you know your guidelines? AHNS endocrine section consensus statement: State-of-the-art thyroid surgical recommendations in the era of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features [^113q8Dxn]. Head & Neck (2018). Low credibility.

The paradigm shift in terminology presented by noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear features (NIFTP) will affect clinical management with de-escalation of postoperative thyroid hormone suppression, reduction of thyroid‐stimulating hormone levels, and changes in radioactive iodine therapeutic modalities. This will allow for increased intervals between follow-up appointments.

However, the challenge lies in how to provide the surgeon with reliable and actionable information before the histological diagnosis in order to optimally guide initial surgical planning. Inevitably, the emergence of NIFTP, due to its reduction of ultimate rates of malignancy, will result in the initial surgical approach leaning toward more conservative options. These options include lobectomy as opposed to initial total thyroidectomy. The extent to which this shift will occur is yet to be determined and will be influenced by many factors.

The aim is to increase the precision of the surgical preoperative evaluation to identify patients whose final pathology report may ultimately diagnose NIFTP. These patients can, therefore, be offered a conservative surgical plan, such as a lobectomy, instead of a total thyroidectomy.

The ability to detect NIFTP preoperatively is clearly challenging, as it is a histologic diagnosis. Predicting its presence preoperatively relies on informed speculation and is not yet perfected.

### Cost impact of molecular testing for indeterminate thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^113hj9zN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

In the decision tree, patients were separated into two groups. The first group was assigned to the standard of care (StC) arm, and treatment was based solely on FNA results. Patients with one nondiagnostic or FLUS FNA result received a repeat FNA and proceeded to surgery if the second biopsy was again nondiagnostic or FLUS. Patients with a FN, SUSP, or malignant FNA result proceeded to initial thyroid lobectomy or total thyroidectomy (TT). Neither routine frozen section during lobectomy nor central lymphadenectomy during TT were included in the model because these adjuncts represent ongoing areas of controversy.

The second group, referred to as the molecular testing (MR) group, additionally had mutation marker panel testing of all FNA results that were in the FLUS and FN categories. Molecular testing for benign FNA results was not included, as cytology alone is 98–99% accurate and further immediate evaluation is not recommended. Similarly, molecular testing for the nondiagnostic category was not included because such samples are often inadequate for further analysis. Routine molecular testing for FNA in the SUSP or malignant categories was also not included because, according to ATA guidelines, these results should lead to definitive initial TT, and molecular testing would therefore not alter the initial extent of thyroidectomy.

### Value of molecular tests in cytologically indeterminate lesions of thyroid [^113p9cCV]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration has been the initial step in the workup of thyroid nodular lesions and has successfully reduced the number of unnecessary surgeries and improved preoperative malignancy detection. However, up to one-third of cases fall into the diagnostically "indeterminate group", which poses a patient-management challenge.

- **Objective**: To review the characteristics of molecular tests useful for stratifying the malignancy risk of indeterminate thyroid lesions, including their advantages and limitations.

- **Data sources**: PubMed.

- **Conclusions**: Molecular tests are useful for triage of indeterminate thyroid nodules initially diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration. Immunocytochemistry is readily available with the shortest turnaround time among the molecular tests but suffers from poor reproducibility and low interpretation concordance. Gene mutation analysis is superior in detecting malignancies as a rule-in test, despite low specificity. Next-generation sequencing seems promising but needs more validations before widespread use. Gene expression profiling is more suitable for detecting benign lesions as a rule-out test to avoid unnecessary surgeries but is not reliable in excluding malignancies. MicroRNA profiling has great potential for both risk stratification and predicting prognosis but is limited by significant variations in sensitivity and specificity. Although many questions still need to be answered, taken together, molecular tests are a promising option for classifying cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodular lesions.

### Bethesda category III, IV, and V thyroid nodules: Can nodule size help predict malignancy [^116TcQm9]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

The association of tumor size with malignancy in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology (atypia of undetermined significance [AUS]/follicular lesion of undetermined significance [FLUS], suspicious for follicular neoplasm [SFN]/Hürthle cell neoplasm [HCN], and suspicious for malignancy [SM]) has not been clearly studied.

- **Study design**: We retrospectively identified 1,104 patients who underwent thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) and subsequent thyroidectomy. Patients with indeterminate cytology were reviewed. The size of the nodule was determined by ultrasound, and malignancy was confirmed by final histology. Logistic regression modeling was performed to determine if nodule size was associated with malignancy.

- **Results**: There were 461 (42%) patients who had indeterminate cytology by FNA. The median nodule size of all indeterminate lesions was 2.1 cm (range 0.5 to 10 cm). For AUS/FLUS, the median nodule size was 2.1 cm (range 0.7 to 8 cm); for SFN, it was 2.4 cm (range 0.5 to 10 cm); for HCN, it was 2.2 cm (range 0.5 to 9.3 cm); and for SM, it was 1.6 cm (range 0.5 to 6 cm). On final histology, 121 (28%) index lesions were malignant (AUS 23%, FLUS 14%, SFN 22%, HCN 25%, SM 69%). Logistic regression revealed that nodule size was not associated with increased odds of malignancy in all lesions with indeterminate cytology (odds ratio [OR] 0.83; 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00; p = 0.051). However, increased nodule size was associated with malignancy in HCN lesions (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.16 to 4.04; p = 0.01).

- **Conclusions**: The findings of the study suggest that nodule size is not generally associated with malignancy in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology, except in cases of HCN lesions where a larger nodule size may indicate increased risk of malignancy.
