## Question

What is the time gab of taking the antibiotic dose at the right time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the "time gap" should be for taking antibiotic doses at the right time. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which clinical context the user means, because timing differs for surgical prophylaxis, sepsis, and routine outpatient dosing. Then, I should verify the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles that determine "on-time" dosing. Next, I will quantify acceptable windows for early versus late doses in inpatient settings. After that, I should review consequences of missing or delaying doses. Finally, I will synthesize practical, context-specific recommendations and note special populations and exceptions, anchoring to guidelines and high-quality evidence where available.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that commonly drive this question: surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, early management of sepsis or severe infection, and routine outpatient or inpatient maintenance dosing, because the "right time" varies by scenario and the stakes differ substantially [^e6c039bd] [^08982a3a] [^d0837e9d].

> For surgical prophylaxis, I need to ensure the antibiotic is given before incision to achieve adequate tissue concentrations. Most agents should be administered 30–60 minutes prior to incision, with vancomycin given 60–120 minutes before incision due to slower infusion, and redosing guided by half-life and procedure length, typically at 2× the half-life from the initial dose if the case is prolonged or blood loss is substantial [^e6c039bd] [^729ef533] [^8984cc05].

> Wait, let me verify the redosing nuance. I initially thought redosing was strictly at 2 hours for all agents, but that is too simplistic. The correct approach is to redose at 2 times the antibiotic's half-life from the start of the preoperative dose, which for cefazolin is about every 3–4 hours, and for longer half-life agents like fluoroquinolones or metronidazole, redosing may not be needed unless the case is very long or blood loss is excessive [^e6c039bd] [^8984cc05].

> For sepsis and severe infections, I should confirm that "time is life". Early appropriate antibiotics are associated with improved outcomes, with strongest support for rapid IV therapy in septic shock; while some observational data suggest mortality benefit with administration within 4–6 hours of presentation, consensus statements emphasize acting as soon as sepsis is recognized rather than fixating on a single cutoff, and they caution that small timing differences around the first dose may not independently change mortality once comprehensive sepsis care is in place [^08982a3a] [^7d9de0c9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a universal "golden hour". The neonatal sepsis quality-improvement literature uses a 60-minute target for first-dose administration, but that is a process metric to reduce delays, not a proven mortality threshold; I should be clear that this 60-minute target is a reasonable operational goal rather than a validated outcome breakpoint [^d409e6b7].

> For routine inpatient maintenance dosing, I should double-check the accepted window. Most hospital programs operationalize "on-time" as within 60 minutes of the scheduled time, and they track "early" as more than 60 minutes before and "late" as more than 60 minutes after the scheduled time. Missing doses or giving them off-schedule is common and associated with worse outcomes, including longer length of stay, so minimizing these deviations is important [^d0837e9d].

> Next, I should review the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic rationale for on-time dosing. For time-dependent beta-lactams, maintaining free drug concentrations above the MIC for at least 40–70% of the dosing interval is critical for efficacy. Delays or gaps increase the risk of subtherapeutic exposure and treatment failure, whereas concentration-dependent agents like aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones rely on peak/MIC or AUC/MIC targets where timing within the interval is somewhat more forgiving but still matters for cumulative exposure [^c92719e6] [^d9bd5145] [^7121dc8c].

> I will now examine the consequences of missing or delaying doses. Missing or giving doses off-schedule is associated with longer hospital length of stay and may reflect and contribute to suboptimal care processes. In surgical prophylaxis, administering antibiotics after incision is associated with a fourfold increase in infection risk, approximating no prophylaxis, underscoring why timing is non-negotiable in that context [^d0837e9d] [^8cf68cc1].

> But wait, what if the patient is in the ICU with altered pharmacokinetics? In critical illness, volume of distribution and clearance are highly variable, and underdosing is common. Personalized dosing with attention to loading doses, extended or continuous infusion strategies for beta-lactams, and, when available, therapeutic drug monitoring can mitigate timing-related underexposure and improve the likelihood of hitting PK/PD targets, though evidence quality varies by agent and setting [^a39c1577] [^3ab3dad9] [^3d9cab8e].

> For outpatient therapy, I should confirm that adherence and timing are often poor in real life. Electronic monitoring shows that only about 62% of prescribed doses are taken and only about 21% are taken within 20% of the intended interval, which argues for simpler regimens, patient education, and, when appropriate, shorter evidence-based courses to reduce the burden of perfect adherence [^b5ed824e] [^d0689751].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations by context. For surgical prophylaxis, give the dose 30–60 minutes before incision, extend to 60–120 minutes for vancomycin, and redose at 2× half-life if the case is prolonged or blood loss exceeds about 1.5 liters. For sepsis, start IV antibiotics as soon as sepsis is recognized, ideally within 60 minutes in many programs, while ensuring cultures are obtained before antibiotics if this does not cause a harmful delay. For routine inpatient dosing, aim to administer within 60 minutes of the scheduled time and avoid early or late deviations when possible. For outpatients, prioritize regimens with longer intervals and clear instructions, and consider shorter effective durations to improve adherence and reduce resistance pressure [^e6c039bd] [^08982a3a] [^d0837e9d] [^b5ed824e] [^d0dc5ae1].

> I should double-check special populations and exceptions. In obesity, prophylactic antibiotic doses often need to be increased to achieve adequate tissue levels. In renal dysfunction, dose adjustments are necessary to avoid accumulation, and for CRRT, early unadjusted dosing with subsequent adjustment is a pragmatic approach given PK variability. In pediatrics, weight-based dosing and developmental pharmacology require vigilance to avoid under- or overdosing, and stewardship principles still apply to duration and timing [^729ef533] [^7121dc8c] [^cad5446b] [^72d6d48c].

> In summary, the "time gap" should be as small as feasible: within 60 minutes of the scheduled dose for routine inpatient therapy, 30–60 minutes before incision for most surgical prophylaxis with agent-specific adjustments, and as soon as sepsis is recognized for severe infections. Delays beyond these windows increase risks of subtherapeutic exposure, treatment failure, and resistance, so systems that reduce missed or late doses are essential to safe, effective antibiotic therapy [^d0837e9d] [^e6c039bd] [^08982a3a].

The right time gap between antibiotic doses is the **prescribed dosing interval** (e.g. every 8 hours, every 12 hours) based on the drug's pharmacokinetics and infection type [^c92719e6]. For most antibiotics, doses should be given **within ± 1 hour** of the scheduled time to maintain therapeutic levels and avoid treatment failure or resistance [^d0837e9d]. If a dose is missed, take it as soon as you remember unless it's within 2 hours of the next dose; never double up. In critical illness or sepsis, administer antibiotics **as soon as possible** — ideally within 1 hour of recognition — to improve outcomes [^08982a3a] [^d409e6b7].

## General principles of antibiotic dosing intervals

Antibiotic dosing intervals are determined by **pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) properties** [^c92719e6], including:

- **Half-life**: Determines how quickly the drug is cleared from the body.
- **Time-dependent vs concentration-dependent killing**: Beta-lactams require time above MIC; aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones need high peak concentrations [^c92719e6].
- **Infection site and severity**: Critical illness or deep infections may need more frequent dosing or extended infusions [^7121dc8c].

---

## Standard dosing intervals for common antibiotics

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Standard dosing interval** |
|-|-|-|
| Beta-lactams | - Penicillin V <br/> - Amoxicillin <br/> - Cephalexin | Every 6–8 hours |
| Macrolides | - Azithromycin <br/> - Clarithromycin | Every 12–24 hours |
| Fluoroquinolones | - Ciprofloxacin <br/> - Levofloxacin | Every 12–24 hours |
| Aminoglycosides | - Gentamicin <br/> - Tobramycin | Once daily (extended-interval dosing) |
| Tetracyclines | - Doxycycline | Every 12–24 hours |

---

These intervals are **guidelines**; always follow the specific prescription and patient factors [^75abae50].

---

## Acceptable time gap around scheduled doses

For most antibiotics, doses should be administered **within ± 1 hour** of the scheduled time to maintain therapeutic levels and minimize resistance risk [^d0837e9d]. Allowing a ** ± 2-hour window** may be acceptable in some outpatient settings, but this increases the risk of subtherapeutic exposure and should be minimized.

---

## Consequences of deviating from prescribed intervals

Deviations from prescribed intervals can lead to:

- **Subtherapeutic levels**: Increased risk of treatment failure and resistance [^f6029b12].
- **Toxicity**: Higher peak levels from delayed doses can increase adverse effects [^d8ae9b41].
- **Resistance**: Intermittent subtherapeutic exposure selects resistant organisms [^e8235c11].

---

## Special considerations in critical illness

In critical illness or sepsis, **early, appropriate antibiotics** are essential [^08982a3a]. Delays beyond 1 hour are associated with increased mortality, so administer as soon as possible once sepsis is recognized [^d409e6b7]. PK/PD targets often require **higher doses, extended infusions, or continuous infusions** to maintain time above MIC in severe infections [^3ab3dad9] [^7121dc8c].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing intervals

Patient-specific factors may require **interval adjustments**:

- **Renal impairment**: Dose reduction or extended intervals for renally cleared drugs [^75abae50].
- **Hepatic impairment**: Adjustments for hepatically metabolized agents.
- **Age and weight**: Pediatric dosing is weight-based with age-appropriate intervals [^d8ae9b41].
- **Pregnancy**: Altered PK may necessitate dose or interval changes.

---

## Practical recommendations for patients

Patients should:

- **Adhere to prescribed intervals**: Use alarms or reminders to stay on schedule.
- **If a dose is missed**: Take it as soon as remembered unless within 2 hours of the next dose; do not double up.
- **Consult healthcare providers**: Ask about what to do if a dose is missed or delayed.

---

## Summary of key points

- **Follow the prescribed interval**: Based on PK/PD and infection type [^c92719e6].
- ** ± 1 hour window**: Aim for doses within 1 hour of scheduled time [^d0837e9d].
- **Critical illness**: Give antibiotics within 1 hour of recognition when possible [^08982a3a].
- **Missed dose**: Take as soon as remembered unless close to the next dose; never double up.

---

The right time gap is the **prescribed interval**, with doses given as close to schedule as possible; in critical illness, **give antibiotics promptly** to improve outcomes [^08982a3a].

### Is it time to refine? An exploration and simulation of optimal antibiotic timing in general surgery [^760637b7]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative infections increase morbidity, resource use, and costs. Our objective was to examine whether within guideline recommendations an optimal time exists for an initial dose of antibiotic to reduce postoperative infections in general surgery, and to simulate the magnitude of a reduction in infections should an optimal time be implemented.

Study Design

The population consisted of 6,731 patients who underwent 7,095 general surgery procedures between January 5, 2006 and June 25, 2012. Patients with pre-existing infections, such as pneumonia and sepsis, and patients with no recorded use of antibiotics were excluded, as were patients on vancomycin and surgical procedures longer than 4 hours in duration. The final analysis dataset included 4,453 patients. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program was used for perioperative variables and outcomes. The end point was a composite of wound disruption; superficial, deep, organ space, surgical site infections; and sepsis. Semi-parametric logistic regression was used to study the association between antibiotic timing and infection.

Results

There were 444 (10%) patients with a primary end point of infectious complication. A nonlinear "bowl-shaped" relationship between duration of interval from antibiotic administration and surgical incision and infection was observed; lowest risk corresponding to administration time close to incision was 4 minutes before incision (95% one-sided CI, 0-18 minutes). The model suggested optimal timing would result in an 11.3% reduction in the primary infection end point.

Conclusions

Risk of infectious complications decreased as antibiotic administration moved closer to incision time. These data suggest an opportunity to reduce infections by 11.3% by targeting initial antibiotic administration closer to incision.

### Right dose, right now: customized drug dosing in the critically ill [^12716d29]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Drugs are key weapons that clinicians have to battle against the profound pathologies encountered in critically ill patients. Antibiotics in particular are commonly used and can improve patient outcomes dramatically. Despite this, there are strong opportunities for further reducing the persisting poor outcomes for infected critically ill patients. However, taking these next steps for improving patient care requires a new approach to antibiotic therapy. Giving the right dose is highly likely to increase the probability of clinical cure from infection and suppress the emergence of resistant pathogens. Furthermore, in some patients with higher levels of sickness severity, reduced mortality from an optimized approach to antibiotic use could also occur. To enable optimized dosing, the use of customized dosing regimens through either evidence-based dosing nomograms or preferably through the use of dosing software supplemented by therapeutic drug monitoring data should be embedded into daily practice. These customized dosing regimens should also be given as soon as practicable as reduced time to initiation of therapy has been shown to improve patient survival, particularly in the presence of septic shock. However, robust data supporting these logical approaches to therapy, which may deliver the next step change improvement for treatment of infections in critically ill patients, are lacking. Large prospective studies of patient survival and health system costs are now required to determine the value of customized antibiotic dosing, that is, giving the right dose at the right time.

### Why do we need a systematic review of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine dosing schedules? [^de87df09]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2014). Low credibility.

We therefore undertook a comprehensive, systematic assessment of the absolute and relative benefit of PCV schedules to establish if there is evidence of preferred or sub-optimal schedules and to identify where essential gaps in knowledge lie so that targeted, strategic studies can be planned to assure a decisive evidence base for dosing schedule optimization. As with any vaccine, a limited number of randomized controlled trials have been conducted and these cannot answer the diverse range of biologic questions about dosing schedules. We therefore undertook this assessment putting together all of the evidence in the literature, with controlled trials and observational studies alike, aiming to be as inclusive as possible since the largest body of evidence would reveal a consistency in lessons learned even if any given trial was not the optimal study.

There are important factors to consider when weighing the benefits of different schedules. From an epidemiologic standpoint, it is important to account for differences in organism transmission dynamics in various geographic, disease burden and community settings; concluding that an introduction and dosing schedule are optimal should consider both the direct and indirect effects of the vaccine and will be influenced by the existing transmission and carriage rates in the community. From a policy standpoint, the deciding factors for a country should also take into account programmatic considerations for integrating PCV into existing vaccine schedules and the need to maximize limited financial resources. The performance of the vaccine program to deliver high coverage at each time point in the immunization schedule will likely strongly influence decision making regarding PCV schedule choice since ultimately delivering all the doses in a schedule is likely to outweigh any relative benefit of one schedule over another.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^fa0d153a]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Pediatric antibiotic stewardship—gaps in knowledge include effective adaptation of the organizational structure and interventions established for the acute care setting to ambulatory and long-term care settings; understanding the cultural and adaptive influences of antibiotic prescribing; understanding how best to incorporate nursing into stewardship efforts and fostering an environment in which nursing contribution is actively encouraged; defining the optimal treatment of common bacterial infections specific to the pediatric population (for example, comparisons of different drug regimens, durations of therapy, parenteral versus oral therapy, and optimal dosing strategies) to improve the evidence base for stewardship recommendations; developing and validating metrics that consider the potential harm of antibiotics and weigh the risks versus the benefits (that is, an antibiotic-associated harm score); establishment of risk-adjusted antibiotic use benchmarking approaches; approaches to effectively teaching clinicians to become “self-stewards”; and incorporating the patient and family perspective and shared decision-making into stewardship.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^a2d559e5]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The verdict

Given the considerations laid out above, the fixed duration and the drop-the-loser duration designs theoretically have the most potential to identify optimal antibiotic treatment durations. These designs (1) are less vulnerable to allocation concealment bias than the RAR design; (2) are not vulnerable (fixed duration) or are less vulnerable (drop-the-loser) to time-trend bias compared to the RAR or play-the-winner designs; (3) are not associated with the important logistical challenges often accompanying adaptive trials that allow for changes in the allocation ratios (play-the-winner and RAR designs) ; and (4) are more likely than the RAR and play-the-winner designs to have sufficient numbers of patients in each arm and/or subgroup at the end of the trial to estimate the complete duration–response curve with sufficient precision, and hence enable evaluation of the potential for important differences in the optimal duration within specific subgroups.

A potential advantage of the drop-the-loser design over the fixed duration design is that the former can drop duration arms that are clearly inferior versus the standard (maximum) duration based on formal statistical analysis. This may ethically be more acceptable by reducing the number of patients allocated to inferior treatment durations.

Although we have only provided theoretical considerations regarding these four designs, we urge the research community to consider developing, testing and applying alternative trial designs that can identify optimal treatment durations, including sample size calculations.

Extensions

Whilst we have focussed on antibiotic duration, evidence supporting doses of many commonly used antibiotics is similarly scarce, and similar methods could also be used to optimise dose. In practice, particularly in primary care, different durations may well be completely equivalent in terms of acute recovery, yet rare but important complications may vary with different durations. Very large numbers would need to be randomised to estimate ‘duration–response curves’ for these rare outcomes, potentially as co-primary endpoints, or incorporated in a decision analytic framework together with other outcomes. Finally, in the context of changing patterns of resistance or access to care, for example, the optimal duration for any specific indication today may not be optimal tomorrow. A platform duration trial, which allows for the dropping and addition of arms, could be a solution to providing continuously relevant evidence, and would also enable different durations of different drugs to be compared.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^dccff264]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. The estimation of course length must consider the important trade-off between maximising short- and long-term efficacy and minimising antibiotic resistance and toxicity.

Main Body

Evidence on optimal treatment durations should come from randomised controlled trials. However, most antibiotic randomised controlled trials compare two arbitrarily chosen durations. We argue that alternative trial designs, which allow allocation of patients to multiple different treatment durations, are needed to better identify optimal antibiotic durations. There are important considerations when deciding which design is most useful in identifying optimal treatment durations, including the ability to model the duration-response relationship (or duration-response 'curve'), the risk of allocation concealment bias, statistical efficiency, the possibility to rapidly drop arms that are clearly inferior, and the possibility of modelling the trade-off between multiple competing outcomes.

Conclusion

Multi-arm designs modelling duration-response curves with the possibility to drop inferior arms during the trial could provide more information about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapies than traditional head-to-head comparisons of limited numbers of durations, while minimising the probability of assigning trial participants to an ineffective treatment regimen.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^e6c039bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The administration is determined according to the antibiotic half-life. For most frequently used antibiotics, such as cefazolin or cefoxitin, intravenous administration 30–60 min before incision ensures effective tissue concentrations at the time of incision. Redosing during surgery is required when the operative procedure lasts for more than 4 h or there is > 1.5 L blood loss. Vancomycin should be administered within 120 min before the incision, and given over 1 h for a 1 g dose (longer, if the dose is higher). Redosing is generally not required for antibiotics with a long half-life (e.g. fluoroquinolones, metronidazole, vancomycin).

Regarding empiric therapy before causative bacteria and susceptibilities are known, the optimal antibiotic choice should be based on the infection source, expected pathogens, the patient’s clinical condition, local epidemiology, and individual patient risk factors for MDR bacteria. Knowledge of patients’ risk factors for MDR bacteria is essential. Treatment guidelines informed by local epidemiology and resistance patterns should be developed and implemented consistently according to ASP principles. Identifying the correct antibiotic(s) for a particular patient can be complex. Although the susceptibility of bacteria involved in community-acquired infections is usually substantially higher and broader than those involved in HAIs, clinicians often recommend broad-spectrum antibiotics for severe community-acquired infections to avoid “missing anything”. Whereas the spectrum of activity may be appropriate in doing so, the likelihood is over-treatment because narrow-spectrum antibiotics are equally effective in most cases. By contrast, for HAIs, the best course of action is empiric broad-spectrum therapy, including an antifungal agent in some circumstances, with later de-escalation to tailored therapy once microbiology data are available.

Emergency department antibiotics—subsequent dosing highlights that “Patients who remain in the ED for prolonged periods should have subsequent doses of antibiotics administered according to the optimal dosing schedule for each medication.” For prolonged ED stays, “second and subsequent doses of antibiotics are important,” “must be scheduled and administered regardless of where the patient is located,” and “Delays in follow-up antibiotics are associated with worse outcomes, and EDs must ensure safe transitions and ongoing dosing.”

### Use of old antibiotics now and in the future from a pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic perspective [^2da071ca]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Because of the increase in bacterial resistance to commonly used antibacterial drugs, old antibiotics are being 'revived' and, once again, are attracting interest. Many of these old antibiotics were approved long ago, in an era when there was no clear process for development, and requirements for efficacy to be demonstrated in rigorous clinical trials did not exist. At the time of these approvals, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles were largely unknown, and did not inform the dose-finding process or recommendations for optimal usage. Indeed, the task of generating basic vital information for these old antibiotics remains to be performed. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the most essential data needed for dose justification and optimization. An overview of the shortage of data for selected old antibiotics illustrates the scope of the problem. In order to prevent harming patients with clinical decisions based on inadequate evidence, a redevelopment procedure for old antibiotics is urgently needed, including a regulatory framework.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^71f407d3]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic overuse contributes to antibiotic resistance, which is a threat to public health. Antibiotic stewardship is a practice dedicated to prescribing antibiotics only when necessary and, when antibiotics are considered necessary, promoting use of the appropriate agent(s), dose, duration, and route of therapy to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing the unintended consequences of antibiotic use. Because there are differences in common infectious conditions, drug-specific considerations, and the evidence surrounding treatment recommendations (eg, first-line therapy, duration of therapy) between children and adults, this statement provides specific guidance for the pediatric population. This policy statement discusses the rationale for inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs; essential personnel, infrastructure, and activities required; approaches to evaluating their effectiveness; and gaps in knowledge that require further investigation. Key guidance for both inpatient and outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs are provided.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^b7f6882f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on customising antibiotic treatment duration to meet individual patient needs is required in primary care

When evaluating a patient with an RTI, our primary objective is to determine whether antibiotic therapy is necessary. There is substantial evidence indicating that antibiotics have little to no impact on self-limiting infections or when a non-bacterial infection is suspected. If patients are taking antibiotics prescribed by another doctor, or if they started taking antibiotics on their own from leftover medications or pharmacy purchases, and the current doctor determines that the antibiotics are no longer needed, they should be stopped (Panel 2). For patients with RTIs in which antibiotic therapy is warranted, more evidence is needed to determine the optimal treatment durations. Traditional two-arm randomised clinical trials comparing fixed antibiotic durations have limitations, as they provide little insight into the minimal necessary duration for various infectionsand fail to account for the differing needs of individual patients. Based on clinical judgement made from patient history, examination, and precise diagnostic tests, doctors should be encouraged to prescribe first-line treatments at appropriate doses to optimise PK/PD properties, except when contraindicated. Unless the infection is deemed potentially serious, when managing patients with a prescribed fixed antibiotic duration, new studies should ascertain whether treatment cessation upon symptom resolution, prior to completing the antibiotic course, is feasible. In fact, one third of the patients already do that by themselves. Studies using medication event monitoring systems reveal that in real-life scenarios, only one-third of patients adhere to the prescribed antibiotic course.If the results of these studies align with expectations, patients could then be advised to discontinue medication once they feel better and are afebrile.

### Antibiotic resistance – what's dosing got to do with it? [^f6029b12]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

This review seeks to identify original research articles that link antibiotic dosing and the development of antibiotic resistance for different antibiotic classes. Using this data, we seek to apply pharmacodynamic principles to assist clinical practice for suppressing the emergence of resistance. Concepts such as mutant selection window and mutant prevention concentration will be discussed.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register.

Study Selection

All articles that related antibiotic doses and exposure to the formation of antibiotic resistance were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

The escalation of antibiotic resistance continues worldwide, most prominently in patients in intensive care units. Data are emerging from in vitro and in vivo studies that suggest that inappropriately low antibiotic dosing may be contributing to the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance. Fluoroquinolones have widely been researched and publications on other antibiotic classes are emerging. Developing dosing regimens that adhere to pharmacodynamic principles and maximize antibiotic exposure is essential to reduce the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance.

Conclusions

Antibiotic dosing must aim to address not only the bacteria isolated, but also the most resistant subpopulation in the colony, to prevent the advent of further resistant infections because of the inadvertent selection pressure of current dosing regimens. This may be achieved by maximizing antibiotic exposure by administering the highest recommended dose to the patient.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^4226f795]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistant bacteria are developing worldwide, causing a serious and concerning threat to global health. The rise in resistance is associated with overuse and misuse of antibiotics, as well as the lack of new drug development. Primary care accounts for 71.4% of all antibiotic prescriptions in the UK. Uncertainty in the distinction between bacterial or viral infections has led to a large variability in the propensity to prescribe an antibiotic for various infectious conditions.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing is used to determine the appropriateness of particular antibiotics to bacterial infections and whether bacteria are displaying some resistance to treatment. Microbiology data in combination with clinical review are used to develop best practice recommendations for the treatment of bacterial infections by outlining when it is appropriate to treat an infection with an antibiotic, the specific antibiotic that should be prescribed, as well as the recommended dose and duration of the antibiotic course that is effective. However, recent evidence suggests that regular updates to guidelines have little effect on reducing antibiotic prescribing and a substantial amount of antibiotics prescribed still deviate from recommended guidelines. When the recommended antibiotic type is prescribed in the UK, antibiotic courses tend to be slightly longer than what is recommended. This is probably, in part, because it was taught that to prevent reinfection and reduce resistance it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course of antibiotics even when symptoms have surpassed, and that prolonged therapy was needed to avoid treatment failure, suggesting that shorter antibiotic courses were perceived as an inferior treatment to longer courses. These ideas were implemented decades ago when there was little concern about antibiotic overuse and, although over time shorter courses have shown to be comparable in efficacy to longer therapies, variability in the duration of prescribed antibiotics remains. Additional evidence suggests that prescribers feel more comfortable selecting a middle-range duration, or in some cases the longest duration specified, even if the intention of the specified range is that the shortest duration is adequate for most patients. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for optimizing duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients, taking patient characteristics into consideration when identifying the patients who fail to recover on shorter courses of antibiotics.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^08982a3a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis antimicrobials—timing and spectrum: We support early antibiotics once sepsis is diagnosed or deemed likely, with the strongest support for initial intravenous antibiotics in those with suspected diagnosis of septic shock—that is, patients with infection and any hypotension or hypoperfusion; shorter time to antibiotics is preferred, but the precise time frame to optimally support outcomes remains to be defined, and antivirals are less clearly time sensitive in the earliest phases of disease. For sepsis patients without an identified pathogen, we recommend initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics with activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria according to local susceptibility patterns. Most sepsis patients receive initial doses of antimicrobials in the ED prior to the availability of culture results, and clinicians should base the initial selection of antimicrobials on the most likely and most harmful potential pathogens rather than targeting a specific pathogen, unless the clinical presentation directs such a focused approach; narrow-spectrum therapy is uncommon and should not be anticipated in usual practice. Whereas some data suggest that an earlier administration of antibiotics is associated with better survival, other data suggest that small variations in the timing of a first dose of antibiotics are not associated with mortality differences; we agree that once the diagnosis of sepsis is established, rapid and comprehensive therapy—not just antibiotic administration—is optimal, but the current data do not recommend a singular time.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^44203c78]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias

An important challenge that applies to all alternative RCT designs comparing multiple antibiotic treatment durations is the difficulty in blinding clinicians and patients. Where a perfectly matching placebo is available and instructions are provided about the order of taking preparations, blinding is theoretically possible, yet, in practice, such a placebo is difficult/expensive to make. Therefore, duration RCTs are often open-label. When using an open-label design that preferentially allocates patients to specific durations with better outcomes (RAR design), clinicians will be able to determine, during the trial, that these durations are associated with better outcomes, thereby increasing the risk of allocation concealment (selection) bias. This knowledge can change which patients get randomised in the trial and how endpoints will subsequently be assessed. The other designs all reduce the risk of selection bias because clinicians cannot alter the selection of patients based on observed changes in allocation probabilities for these designs.

It is often cautioned that calendar time trends – which are common with infectious diseases – may introduce bias when using RAR. However, one can take advantage of the fact that randomisation probabilities are not constantly changing with most RAR designs. A calendar time-stratified analysis, with equal randomisation probabilities within each stratum, eliminates potential time-trend bias. A larger sample size is needed with such stratified analyses, but it is important to avoid trying to gain small improvements in efficiency at the cost of introducing bias. While the fixed duration design is not vulnerable to time trends due to its design, the RAR and play-the-winner design require a less efficient calendar time-stratified analysis to avoid this type of bias. When considering a drop-the-loser design one should avoid comparison of patients assigned to the dropped duration with patients that were randomised to other arms after dropping the clearly inferior arm to avoid this bias. However, this may not be problematic given that there was already enough information to deem the duration clearly inferior.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^afc751d4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Outstanding questions

It is hard to convince doctors not to prescribe antibiotics at all when they are in doubt or in the face of patient expectations. The limited to moderate impact in reducing unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care observed in antimicrobial stewardship programmes necessitates the exploration of new strategies. We need to change the message to healthcare professionals, policymakers, and educators regarding the idea of always completing a full course of antibiotics. Several systematic reviews show that shorter antibiotic courses are as effective as standard durations for most RTIs. Studies focused on reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and on tailoring antibiotic therapy, dose, and length of therapy to patients' needs, present a promising strategy in primary care. This can be encouraged based on randomised clinical trials indicating that patients most often recover within three days. In the end, we are not treating RTIs, we are treating patients with RTIs.

### Pivotal role of translation in anti-infective development [^5028866e]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

The value of model-based translation in drug discovery and development is now effectively being recognized in many disease areas and among various stakeholders. Such quantitative approaches are expected to facilitate the selection on which compound to prioritize for successful development, predict the human efficacious dose based on preclinical data with adequate precision, guide design, and de-risk later development stages. The importance of time-dependencies, which are typically species-dependent due to different turnover rates of biological processes, is, however, often neglected. For bacterial infections, the choice of dosing regimen is typically relying on preclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, because the bacterial load and disease severity, and consequently the PK/PD relationship, cannot be quantified well on clinical data, given the low-information end points used. It is time to recognize the limitations of using time-collapsed approaches for translation (i.e., methods where targets are based on summary measures of exposure and response). Models describing the full time-course captures important quantitative information of drug distribution, bacterial growth, antibiotic killing, and resistance development, and can account for species-differences in the PK profiles driving the killing. Furthermore, with a model-based approach for translation, we can take a holistic approach in development of a joint model for in vitro, in vivo, and clinical data, as well as incorporating information on the contribution of the immune system. Such advancements are anticipated to facilitate rational decision making during various stages of drug development and in the optimization of treatment regimens for different groups of patients.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^7121dc8c]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical- and antibiotic-related factors can contribute to a differential distribution of antibiotics at the target site. Knowledge of PK/PD of each antibiotic may provide a more appropriate definition of optimal dosing regimens in terms of both dose and administration interval. The concentration gradient between plasma and the site of action may be of high relevance in cases of MDR bacterial infection. For example, data suggest that increased doses of ceftazidime, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin are required to reach target attainment in patients with severe intra-abdominal infections.

Critically ill patients are at high risk of infections, risking life-threatening sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock can have a major effect on PK parameters. Knowledge of pathophysiologic effects on PK/PD is essential for optimizing antibiotic treatment in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock. Hepatic or especially renal dysfunction are conditions where PK changes and dosage reduction may be needed.

The dosing frequency of an antibiotic is determined by the concepts of time-dependent vs. concentration-dependent activity. For example, beta-lactam antibiotics exhibit time-dependent activity, whereby optimal bactericidal activity is achieved when antibiotic concentrations are maintained above the MIC over prolonged periods of time. For this reason, the serum concentration of the antibiotics should exceed the MIC for at least 40% (optimally 70%) of the dosing interval. Higher dosing frequency, prolonged infusions, and continuous infusions achieve this effect and optimize beta-lactam activity. By contrast, antibiotics having concentration-dependent activity are ideally administered to achieve a high peak plasma concentration. For these antibiotics, the peak serum concentration:MIC, not the time above the MIC (fT > MIC), is more closely associated with efficacy. Despite the ideal method of administration and the preferred dosing schemes of aminoglycosides being once-daily dosing for most therapeutic indications, especially in critically ill patients, aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is due to their uptake saturation and a direct vasoconstrictive effect on the renal cortical microcirculation. Thus, limiting aminoglycoside exposure to the renal cortex, by limiting administration to once-daily, reduces the risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Use of pharmacodynamic principles to inform β-lactam dosing: "S" does not always mean success [^97077aa6]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Dose optimization is one of the key strategies for enhancing antimicrobial stewardship. There have been tremendous strides in our understanding of antibiotic exposure-response relationships over the past 25 years. For many antibiotics, the "pharmacodynamic" or the exposure variable associated with outcome has been identified. With advances in mathematical modeling, it is possible to apply our understanding of antimicrobial pharmacodynamics (PD) into clinical practice and design empirical regimens that have a high probability of achieving the PD target linked to effect. By optimizing antibiotic doses to achieve PD targets predictive of efficacy, clinicians can improve care and minimize drug toxicity. For β-lactams, the PD parameter most predictive of maximal bactericidal activity is the duration of time free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) during the dosing interval (fT > MIC). Unfortunately, the conventional intermittent β-lactam dosing schemes often used in practice have suboptimal PD profiles. Prolonging the infusion time of β-lactams is one method to maximize the probability of achieving concentrations in excess of the MIC for the majority of the dosing interval, especially against pathogens with elevated MIC values. Prolonged infusions of intravenous β-lactams are not only associated with improved probability of target attainment (PTA) profiles but offer possible cost savings and greater potential for reducing emergence of resistance relative to intermittent infusions.

### Appropriate antibiotic therapy [^d4b7178c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Prescribing antibiotics is an essential component of initial therapy in sepsis. Early antibiotics are an important component of therapy, but speed of administration should not overshadow the patient-specific characteristics that determine the optimal breadth of antimicrobial therapy. Cultures should be drawn before antibiotic therapy if it does not significantly delay administration. Combination antibiotic therapy against gram-negative infections is not routinely required, and combination therapy involving vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam is associated with an increase in acute kidney injury. Emergency practitioners should be aware of special considerations in the administration and dosing of antibiotics in order to deliver optimal care to septic patients.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^d78124c7]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteria are increasingly able to resist antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity, deaths and costs worldwide. Antibiotic use is an important driver of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Selective pressure can be reduced by minimising antibiotic prescribing for conditions for which antibiotics are often unnecessary. Moreover, the duration of antibiotic courses can often be reduced without significantly compromising cure rates. Shortening antibiotic duration can have a large impact on reducing exposure of bacteria to antibiotics, including bacteria carried asymptomatically. Antibiotics are by far the most prescribed drugs for children, with more than 60 million systemic antibiotics dispensed annually in the US outpatient setting alone, and are amongst the most frequently prescribed drugs for adults.

An important challenge is that, for many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. Courses should be long enough to treat infections effectively, yet short enough to reduce the incidence of side effects and the development and spread of antibiotic resistance. The continued need for antibiotics can be assessed with daily reviews for inpatients ; however, in practice, such reviews are not always performed or acted upon and antibiotics are often continued in order to complete currently recommended course durations. Further, in the outpatient or primary care setting, continued assessment of patients initiated on antibiotics is not feasible. Therefore, it is especially important to have strong evidence about optimal treatment durations in these settings.

Because observational studies comparing different antibiotic durations are potentially confounded by unmeasured patient factors influencing the need for prolonged treatment, evidence about the optimal treatment duration should, where possible, come from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, antibiotic durations for several infections managed in primary care, such as prostatitis, are not guided by RCT evidence on optimal treatment duration. Where treatment durations have been compared in RCTs, in most cases, two treatment durations were selected for comparison, both of which lacked a clear scientific rationale. Whilst RCTs designed in this way can be useful, there are disadvantages to this approach.

Herein, we discuss the main issue with conventional two-arm trial designs, how to assess the ‘optimal’ antibiotic treatment duration, four alternative trial designs that can estimate much needed duration–response relationships (subsequently denoted duration–response curves), and which of these designs has the most desirable properties.

### Timing of antibiotic therapy in the ICU [^2c026b15]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Time variables play an important role in the care of patients with life threatening infections. As Fig. 3 demonstrates, delaying appropriate antibiotic therapy increases the risk of death. At the same time, the risk of antibiotic resistance increases as the duration of antibiotic therapy is prolonged without a ceiling effect. Given these competing clinical outcomes, infection cure versus resistance emergence, clinicians must employ strategies that optimize their use of antimicrobials in the ICU. Table 1 provides some “common sense” recommendations that will assist clinicians in achieving a more harmonious balance in the ICU in regards to antibiotic utilization and timing. Future advances in non-antibiotic therapies for serious infections, rapid molecular diagnostics, and AI/ML should further enhance antibiotic timing practices in the ICU and improve patient outcomes while minimizing the use of unnecessary antimicrobial therapy.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^19bbc7fc]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The importance of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties for correct dosing of antibiotics

Craig et al. refined the concept of the importance of the time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for beta-lactam antibiotics, which refers to the duration of time that serum levels of the antibiotic remain above the MIC at the site of infection. They suggested that for penicillins, this parameter or index should reach at least 50% of the dosing interval to ensure treatment effectiveness. For antibiotics like fluoroquinolones, the optimal pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index is the area under the curve above the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio).

In a recent randomised clinical trial concerning phenoxymethylpenicillin treatment of streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis it was shown that a short course of higher doses of penicillin V, taken four times daily for five days, was non-inferior in clinical outcome to the standard dose taken thrice daily for 10 days.This fits with the above concept that penicillin V due to its relatively short serum elimination half-life should be dosed at least every 6 h to secure a time > MIC of at least 50%. Optimising the bacterial kill also shortens the duration of treatment needed for effect. The optimised dosing regimen concurrently reduces selection of resistance.

AutoKinetics dosing strategy

For each antibiotic, best performing PK models were selected, validated, calibrated and implemented in AutoKinetics, as published previously. Vancomycin and ciprofloxacin are time- and concentration-dependent antibiotics, and their efficacy is related to the area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) relative to the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Meropenem and ceftriaxone are time-dependent antibiotics where time above a concentration relative to the MIC is best associated with their efficacy. As true MIC values were not routinely available from the electronic health record, a surrogate value of 1 mg/L was used, based on EUCAST clinical breakpoints to avoid delays and allow for empirical therapy. Dosing targets for each antibiotic were based on clinical and preclinical studies as previously reviewed and focus on the prevention of underdosing. Detailed dosing strategies and rationale may be found in the Additional file 1 and Additional file 1 : Table S1.

Outcomes

All outcome definitions were prespecified and described in detail in the published study protocol. The primary endpoint was PK target attainment (TA), during the first 24 h following randomisation for the primary antibiotic for which the patient was randomised. The primary endpoint was prespecified at 75% of the dosing target, a conservative endpoint, as detailed in Additional file 1 : Table S1. Secondary PK outcomes were time to PK target attainment (TTA) and the fraction of days of the entire antibiotic course up to ICU discharge during which the primary outcome was reached (%-TA). All PK outcomes were assessed for each antibiotic separately.

Secondary clinical outcomes included mortality at ICU discharge, hospital discharge, day 28 and 6 months as well as ICU- and hospital length of stay, the delta Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score between baseline on the day of randomisation and 96 h after, and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI).

Finally, a predefined safety analysis was performed for subgroups based on the cumulative dose administered in the first 24 h after randomisation compared to the cumulative daily standard dose, unadjusted for kidney function: low dosing (< 50% of standard dose), normal dosing (dose within 50% and 200%) and high dosing (> 200%). For this safety analysis, clinical outcomes were assessed regardless of the choice of primary antibiotic, focusing on mortality and renal failure.

### Optimizing drug exposure to minimize selection of antibiotic resistance [^e8235c11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The worldwide increase in antibiotic resistance is a concern for public health. The fact that the choice of dose and treatment duration can affect the selection of antibiotic-resistant mutants is becoming more evident, and an increased number of studies have used pharmacodynamic models to describe the drug exposure and pharmacodynamic breakpoints needed to minimize and predict the development of resistance. However, there remains a lack of sufficient data, and future work is needed to fully characterize these target drug concentrations. More knowledge is also needed of drug pharmacodynamics versus bacteria with different resistance mutations and susceptibility levels. The dosing regimens should exhibit high efficacy not only against susceptible wild-type bacteria but, preferably, also against mutated bacteria that may exist in low numbers in "susceptible" populations. Thus, to prolong the life span of existing and new antibiotics, it is important that dosing regimens be carefully selected on the basis of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that prevent emergence of preexisting and newly formed mutants.

### Engaging hospitalists in antimicrobial stewardship: the CDC perspective [^3afa7135]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

There has never been a more important time to promote efforts to improve the use of antibiotics in hospitals. The growing challenges of C. difficile infections and antimicrobial resistance can both be addressed, at least in part, through so called "antimicrobial stewardship" efforts. Data suggest that when the right antibiotics are prescribed at the right dose for the right durations patient outcomes are improved and healthcare dollars are saved. That improving antibiotic use is a win-win-win is not in question; what remains to be determined is how best to ensure that these efforts are implemented in all hospitals. I believe that hospitalists must play an important role in advancing antimicrobial stewardship.

### Attainment of therapeutic vancomycin level within the first 24 h: authors' response [^a8aaa8bf]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In sepsis, time is life. However, time is not the only variable of the complex equation of antibiotic therapy; the dose of antibiotic administered needs to be adequate. Subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations potentially lead to decreased microbial killing, treatment failure, and emergence of resistance and/or increased mortality. Early therapeutic drug monitoring and timely dose optimization, ideally during the first 24 h, minimize the likelihood of subtherapeutic antibiotic concentrations and ineffective antibiotic therapy. Vancomycin remains a first-line option for the treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other resistant Gram-positive bacteria. Of note, vancomycin is one of the antibiotics with the highest likelihood of under dosing. Continuous infusion (CI), after adequate loading dose (LD), seems to have pharmacological advantages in the critically ill and enables more consistent achievement of therapeutic exposures.

Antibiotic timing and dosage—Prophylactic antibiotic agents are, by definition, those that are administered before creation of an incision or puncture wound. Recommendations from The Joint Commission specify that intravenous (IV) antibiotic agents be administered within 1 hour of an incision, and a recent large surgical study reiterated support for the 60-minute time frame and found no evidence to narrow the window. A repeat dose of antibiotic agents should be administered if a period of 2 hours has lapsed from initial dose. Administration after a procedure has been associated with 4 times the number of infectious complications, equivalent to rates encountered when no prophylaxis is administered.

### Back to the future: using aminoglycosides again and how to dose them optimally [^4d6f7ac8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Gram-negative organisms have become increasingly resistant to both beta-lactam antibiotics and fluoroquinolones. Consequently, aminoglycoside antibiotics have undergone a resurgence in use. Because of the known toxicities of aminoglycoside antibiotics, clinicians have avoided their use, unless no other alternatives were extant. Over the past 2 decades, we have learned much about the relationship between aminoglycoside exposure and the likelihood of a good clinical outcome or the occurrence of nephrotoxicity. For example, minimum inhibitory concentration values > or = 2.0 mg/L lead to unacceptably low probabilities of a good clinical outcome, and infrequent administration of doses (i.e., intervals of 24 h and longer intervals for patients with compromised renal function) plays a central role in minimizing the likelihood of toxicity. Using these new insights, we suggest ways of evaluating the dose and schedule of administration of aminoglycosides in empirical therapy to obtain the highest likelihood of an efficacious and nontoxic therapy.

The available literature indicates that beta-lactam antibiotics administered to the mother as IAP rapidly reach therapeutic levels in the fetal circulation,but not many studies have compared the antibiotic plasma concentrations in maternal and umbilical cord blood by the time of IAP administration and delivery.Thus, knowledge gaps regarding the optimal timing and dosing of IAP persist.

### Get to the point in intensive care medicine – the sooner the better? [^d8e6b2b6]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Timing of therapy plays a pivotal role in intensive care patients. Although being evident and self-explanatory, it has to be considered that the appropriateness of a specific therapeutic intervention is likewise important. In view of antibiotic therapy of critically ill patients, the available evidence supports the concept of hitting hard, early (as soon as possible and at least before the onset of shock) and appropriately. There is increasing evidence that a positive fluid balance is not only a cosmetic problem but is associated with increased morbidity. However, prospective studies are needed to elucidate whether a positive net fluid balance represents the cause or the effect of a specific disease. Since central venous pressure (CVP) is an unreliable marker of fluid responsiveness, its clinical use to guide fluid therapy is questionable. Dynamic hemodynamic parameters seem to be superior to CVP in predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients. Sedation is often used to facilitate mechanical ventilation. Since there is no best evidence-based sedation protocol, weaning strategies should take the risk of iatrogenic arterial hypotension secondary to high doses of vasodilatory sedative agents into account. In this regard, the concept of daily wake-up calls should be challenged, because higher cumulative doses of sedatives may be required. The right dose and timing for renal replacement therapy is still discussed controversially and remains a subjective decision of the attending physician. New renal biomarkers may perhaps be helpful to validate when (and how) renal replacement therapy should be performed best. Last but not least, all therapeutic interventions should take the individual co-morbidities and underlying pathophysiological conditions into account.

### Role of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics: does the dose matter? [^773f8a3a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Antibiotic dose is important in determining serum area-under-the-curve (AUC) and peak serum concentration (C(max)), as well as the time the serum concentration remains over the pathogen minimum inhibitory concentration (T>MIC). However, dose is not the sole determinant of these factors; they are modified by absorption, clearance, and frequency of dosing. It is difficult to relate dose to clinical outcome in humans, but pharmacodynamic parameters (AUC/MIC, C(max)/MIC, or T>MIC) have been related to clinical and bacteriological efficacy or emergence of resistance to aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides, and beta-lactams.

### Clinical pharmacology of antibiotics [^75abae50]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial pharmacology and its effect on prescribing is quite complex. Selecting an antibiotic that will optimally treat an infection while minimizing adverse effects and the development of resistance is only the first step, as one must also consider the patient's individual pharmacokinetic alterations and the pharmacodynamic properties of the drug when prescribing it as well. Patients with CKD may have alterations in their protein binding, volumes of distribution, kidney clearance, and nonrenal clearance that necessitates antibiotic dose adjustments to prevent the development of toxicity. Knowledge of a drug's pharmacodynamics, defined as the relationship between drug exposure and antibacterial efficacy, provides some guidance regarding the optimal way to make dose adjustments. Different pharmacodynamic goals, such as maximizing the time that free (unbound) drug concentrations spend above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for time dependent drugs ( e.g. , β -lactams) or maximizing the free peak-to-MIC ratio for concentration-dependent antibiotics ( e.g. , aminoglycosides), require different adjustment strategies; for instance, decreasing the dose while maintaining normal dosing frequency or giving normal (or even larger) doses less frequently, respectively. Patients receiving hemodialysis have other important prescribing considerations as well. The nephrologist or patient may prefer to receive antibiotics that can be administered intravenously toward the end of a dialysis session. Additionally, newer dialysis technologies and filters can increase drug removal more than originally reported. This review will discuss the place in therapy, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and other pharmacologic considerations encountered when prescribing commonly used antibiotics in patients with chronic kidney disease or ESKD.

### Pharmacodynamic optimization of β-lactams in the patient care setting [^094520ec]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

In order to eradicate an infecting organism, it is necessary to achieve or maintain concentrations of an antibiotic in vivo that exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for the organism. Duration of exposure, or time above MIC, was recognized as being important for beta-lactam antibiotics more than 60 years ago. Continuous infusion regimens are associated with higher clinical response rates, improvement in surrogate markers of outcome, and lower cost of therapy compared with intermittent infusion regimens, because the MIC can be exceeded for an entire dosing interval. However, for carbapenem antibiotics, it appears that the MIC must only be exceeded for 40% of the dosing interval for bactericidal activity in vivo. Therefore, a promising strategy to optimize carbapenem use is to administer the same dose at the same frequency of administration but to extend the infusion time. Extended infusion regimens take full advantage of a drug's exposure potential within the context of in vivo potency without altering the dose or dosing schedule and with no increase in toxicity or cost. Administering higher doses by extended infusion allows one to manage organisms with high MICs. Optimizing the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of an antibiotic allows one to 'make good drugs better'.

### Time-programmable drug dosing allows the manipulation, suppression and reversal of antibiotic drug resistance in vitro [^ba71f122]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Multi-drug strategies have been attempted to prolong the efficacy of existing antibiotics, but with limited success. Here we show that the evolution of multi-drug-resistant Escherichia coli can be manipulated in vitro by administering pairs of antibiotics and switching between them in ON/OFF manner. Using a multiplexed cell culture system, we find that switching between certain combinations of antibiotics completely suppresses the development of resistance to one of the antibiotics. Using this data, we develop a simple deterministic model, which allows us to predict the fate of multi-drug evolution in this system. Furthermore, we are able to reverse established drug resistance based on the model prediction by modulating antibiotic selection stresses. Our results support the idea that the development of antibiotic resistance may be potentially controlled via continuous switching of drugs.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^3ab3dad9]. Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics—clinical conclusions and research needs emphasize that β-lactam agents have been given as SI and PIs in a large number of clinical cohorts and trials, and both administration schemes demonstrate their role in the treatment of many bacterial infections due to their broad spectrum of activity and relative safety profiles. The body of evidence suggests improved efficacy and similar safety when similar doses are administered as PI compared with SI, yet elucidating exact targets will require more clinical trials. Because of substantial inter- and intrapatient pharmacokinetics (PK) variability, optimizing the administration strategy of these agents to achieve pharmacodynamics (PD) targets may be important for bacterial killing and resistance suppression, but the overall quality of evidence for clinical outcomes is low, particularly among patient populations who would be expected to benefit. The use of PIs has become more prevalent in recent years; however, greater uptake is possible and could be recommended in many situations outlined within these guidelines. The specific need for therapeutic drug monitoring should be better defined in patient populations where PK do not follow classic assumptions and/or underlying MICs to the selected β-lactam, and further studies are needed to evaluate the role of PI β-lactam agents in special populations, define the role of TDM, assess the need for a loading dose, determine optimal PI methods, and identify strategies and global consensus for improving the stability of these agents within inpatient and outpatient settings. To address challenges ahead, future research should also evaluate patient/caregiver-oriented endpoints such as line compatibility, nursing time, quality of life measures, and other practical considerations.

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^a39c1577]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy: principles of use and new agents

While appropriate therapy refers to the use of an antimicrobial agent to which the etiologic pathogen is sensitive, it is also necessary to administer the right dose, at the optimal time, that penetrates into the site of infection. This must be done without overuse that could drive antimicrobial resistance at a global level, as well as within the individual’s own bowel flora, which is often the source of ICU-acquired infections.

Optimal antibiotic usage involves avoidance of underdosing, while preventing adverse effects associated with overdosing. An initial large loading dose is required to “fill” the higher than usual volume of distribution in severe sepsis—roughly 1.5 times the standard dose. Then dosing should occur according to drug clearance. Level 1 and 2 evidence suggests that double coverage for gram-negative infections is unnecessary. Still, some give one large initial dose of an aminoglycoside in ICU-infected patients, along with another agent, to assure broad enough coverage and to optimize rapid killing of the organism.

The kill characteristics of commonly used ICU antibiotics differ. For beta-lactams, the best effect is related to time above minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target pathogen; high daily doses are best administered by using continuous or extended infusions. While this could improve outcomes by keeping trough concentrations high especially in presence of resistance, not all data are supportive. For aminoglycosides (a dose, or concentration-dependent antibiotic) therapy should be with large single daily doses (or extended interval in renal dysfunction). Quinolones, which also have dose-dependent killing, should also have higher, albeit spaced out, dosing.

Augmented renal clearance commonly occurs in younger patients without renal dysfunction and necessitates higher than standard daily dosing to avoid subtherapeutic concentrations. With renal replacement therapy, underdosing and overdosing can occur, but higher doses of beta-lactams are probably a better option to prevent underdosing. Therapeutic drug monitoring could be used as an aid to dosing most antibiotics. When choosing antibiotics, the site of infection is important. Lipophilic antibiotics (e.g. quinolones) provide high concentrations in all tissues. Hydrophilic antibiotics (eg aminoglycosides) do not penetrate well into tissues (lung, etc.) but stay in extravascular spaces, although beta-lactams penetrate better than aminoglycosides.

Areas of uncertainty

What concentrations should be targeted and where?

There is significant heterogeneity in TDM studies regarding the definition of target concentrations, and the PTA of empirical dosing is dependent on if “high” or “low” targets are defined. As an example, while there is consensus that concentrations for ß-lactams should be above the MIC of pathogens for the better part of a dosing interval, it is debated whether target concentrations of up to 4–6 × MIC add further benefit. As individual MICs are often not available, the use of empiric MICs for the respective antimicrobial, usually at the higher end of “sensitive”, is common. While the use of high MICs in combination with high target attainment aims at avoiding underdosing, the necessity of such high targets is questionable as it also increases the risk of attaining potentially toxic levels. It is unclear whether targets should be adjusted according to local resistance epidemiology and if TDM is particularly valuable in settings with high rates of resistance. It must also be recognized that antimicrobial concentrations are usually measured in plasma samples, that not necessarily reflect concentrations at the site of infection and will thus act as a surrogate marker.

### Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles of anti-infective dosing [^9ea0a6e0]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

An understanding of the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles that determine response to antimicrobial therapy can provide the clinician with better-informed dosing regimens. Factors influential on antibiotic disposition and clinical outcome are presented, with a focus on the primary site of infection. Techniques to better understand antibiotic PK and optimize PD are acknowledged.

Methods

PubMed (inception-April 2016) was reviewed for relevant publications assessing antimicrobial exposures within different anatomic locations and clinical outcomes for various infection sites.

Findings

A limited literature base indicates variable penetration of antibiotics to different target sites of infection, with drug solubility and extent of protein binding providing significant PK influences in addition to the major clearing pathway of the agent. PD indices derived from in vitro studies and animal models determine the optimal magnitude and frequency of dosing regimens for patients. PK/PD modeling and simulation has been shown an efficient means of assessing these PD endpoints against a variety of PK determinants, clarifying the unique effects of infection site and patient characteristics to inform the adequacy of a given antibiotic regimen.

Implications

Appreciation of the PK properties of an antibiotic and its PD measure of efficacy can maximize the utility of these life-saving drugs. Unfortunately, clinical data remain limited for a number of infection site-antibiotic exposure relationships. Modeling and simulation can bridge preclinical and patient data for the prescription of optimal antibiotic dosing regimens, consistent with the tenets of personalized medicine.

### Pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial drugs [^0e4fd56c]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Knowledge of the antimicrobial pharmacodynamic characteristics of a drug (inhibition of growth, rate and extent of bactericidal action, and postantibiotic effect) provides a more rational basis for determination of optimal dosing regimens in terms of the dose and the dosing interval. This article reviews concepts of antimicrobial pharmacodynamics, the effect of pharmacodynamics on the emergence of resistant bacterial subpopulations, and the development of pharmacodynamic breakpoints for use in the design of trials of these drugs and in treatment of infected patients.

### Beta-lactam antibiotic dosing during continuous renal replacement therapy: how can we optimize therapy? [^cad5446b]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Correct antibiotic treatment is of utmost importance to treat infections in critically ill patients, not only in terms of spectrum and timing but also in terms of dosing. However, this is a real challenge for the clinician because the pathophysiology (such as shock, augmented renal clearance, and multiple organ dysfunction) has a major impact on the pharmacokinetics of hydrophilic antibiotics. The presence of extra-corporal circuits, such as continuous renal replacement therapy, may further complicate this difficult exercise. Standard dosing may result in inadequate concentrations, but unadjusted dosing regimens may lead to toxicity. Recent studies confirm the variability in concentrations, and the wide variation in dialysis techniques used certainly contributes to these findings. Well-designed clinical studies are needed to provide the data from which robust dosing guidance can be developed. In the meantime, non-adjusted dosing in the first 1 to 2 days of antibiotic therapy during continuous renal replacement therapy followed by dose reduction later on seems to be a prudent approach.

### Accelerating antibiotic access and stewardship: a new model to safeguard public health [^82c9059f]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

This Personal View discusses the challenges faced, especially by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), in responding to the growing burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance. Many patients in LMICs lack access to effective and affordable treatments needed to successfully treat patients. Meanwhile, traditional antimicrobial stewardship models face implementation challenges due to financial, health system, and human resource constraints. These constraints call for a paradigm shift from traditional high-income country-style antimicrobial stewardship, which is often resource intensive and aimed at cost containment, to a broader concept of sustainable access. We suggest a model of context-adapted stewardship that continues to emphasise providing the right antibiotic, at the right time, for the right duration, and at an affordable price. Taking lessons from other disease areas, including tuberculosis, we identify interventions such as task shifting to various health-care workers and the implementation of a hub-and-spoke model to support appropriate use of antibiotics, to enable optimal access and maximisation of scarce resources.

### Introduction: standards of antibacterial performance [^f6fe1df1]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

The development and clinical use of antimicrobial agents continue to evolve in line with new science, understanding and needs. While antimicrobial resistance remains an important determinant for drug development and therapeutic choice, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters are having an ever-increasing importance in defining performance targets for new and established agents. Recently licensed new therapies are largely directed at serious hospital-associated Gram-positive infections, whereas in the community, therapeutic choice remains dependent on well-established agents from limited classes of antimicrobials. In order to maximise the benefits from such agents, it is appropriate that dosage regimens and antibacterial choices be reviewed in the light of new knowledge, particularly in the area of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Antimicrobial resistance continues to evolve, notably within respiratory pathogens, therefore steps must be taken to maintain optimum therapeutic outcomes and also limit the development and spread of resistant strains. Whilst changes in patient and physician attitudes and behaviour towards better quality prescribing are important, new agents must also be developed to provide adequate coverage for resistant pathogens. Development times for novel agents and classes of antimicrobials are long, with uncertain safety profiles and chances of success. Thus, the development of new formulations of existing agents, designed to overcome current resistance patterns, constitutes a potentially important additional strategy towards appropriate prescribing.

### Ensuring administration of first dose of antibiotics within the golden hour of management in neonates with sepsis [^d409e6b7]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Lessons and limitations

We stumbled across an unidentified and unanticipated problem during the course of our efforts to improve antibiotic stewardship. Many times, deficiencies in certain activities remain hidden, because they are not part of routine audits. Once found, we devoted full attention and energy, and tackled it systematically using the principles of quality improvement. Of the basic methods of system analysis, mapping of the process of antibiotic administration was the most revealing. It not only informed us where the delays were but also revealed that the process of antibiotic administration was actually quite complex and dependent on multiple stakeholders. Process mapping is an excellent tool for problems related to time delays.

A key lesson learnt was that prioritisation of the root causes to be targeted is of extreme importance during the phase of problem analysis. As demonstrated in the Pareto chart of our report, timely draw of blood culture before starting the antibiotic was the major bottleneck contributing to delayed antibiotic administration. We overlooked the importance of antibiotic stock, as there was an ample supply and stock of antibiotics during baseline data collection phase. We learnt that parts of the system which may be functioning very well currently can also breakdown at a future time. Therefore, a theoretical analysis of all the steps of a process is also needed apart from the feedback derived from flow chart and fish-bone analysis. While each PDSA test cycle was executed with certain assumptions, we encountered several new problems. However, as we had set up a team with representation from all stakeholders, the members came out with new solutions. The importance and equal status given to all the members for their roles helped the team to stay motivated. It was natural for nurses and hospital attendants to resist taking on the new work responsibilities. However, since they were members of the team trying to modify the system and were convinced of its benefits for the patients, they adapted to the changes and actually started enjoying the changes.

We could not measure and analyse the impact of this process improvement on mortality and morbidity. However, we believe the link between timely administration of antibiotic and patient outcomes is well proven.

Scenarios of overcrowding and mismatch between patient load and manpower are quite common across the developing world. We believe such occurrences are quite common but hidden or ignored, or assumed to be not manageable. Our experience will be useful for several others struggling with similar problems.

b Difference in fraction of days with target attainment with confidence interval, calculated based on a linear mixed model

c Difference in hours to target attainment with confidence interval, calculated based on a linear mixed model. A negative TTA difference indicates a reduction in time to target attainment for the AutoKinetics group compared to control

The secondary PK outcomes are shown in Table 2. Additionally, the survival analysis for the TTA is shown in Fig. 2. For ciprofloxacin, TTA was significantly shorter in the AutoKinetics group with a median time reduction of 26 h (CI 18–42 h, p value < 0.001). There was no significant difference in TTA for ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and meropenem. Patients in the AutoKinetics group showed a 65% (CI 42–88%, p value < 0.001) increase in days on target for the full antibiotic course for ciprofloxacin, but not for the other antibiotics (Table 2).

The Y axis denotes the proportion of patients (up to 1) that have reached their PK target. The X axis denotes the time in hours it takes to reach the primary target. Lines that stop prematurely have reached a proportion of 1. At hour zero, some patients are already on target because they were randomised after their first antibiotic dose. For some antibiotics, target attainment can be reached almost directly after the first dose as can be seen in the case of meropenem, while for others, most notably ciprofloxacin, target attainment requires several hours up to days

### Design principles of collateral sensitivity-based dosing strategies [^749a82c0]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cycling based dosing regimens are frequently discussed as a strategy to improve antibiotic treatment when CS occurs. In our simulations, we show that for one-day cycling treatments antibiotic type (Fig. 5), directionality of CS (Fig. 4), and the identity of any pre-existing resistance subpopulation (Fig. 8) should be considered when choosing which drug to administer first. We, specifically, show that the type of the first administrated antibiotic had a larger impact on the PoR compared to the type of the second administrated antibiotic. The presence of CS to the second administrated antibiotic had a greater effect PoR compared to CS to the first administrated antibiotic. In the case of pre-existing resistance, the PoR was smaller if there was pre-existing resistance to the second administrated drug compared to the first antibiotic. These findings are consistent with previous studies showing that the probability of resistance is influenced by the sequence of antibiotics, and optimized cycling sequences outperformed random drug cycling regimens. In addition, we show that one-day cycling outperforms a three-day cycling interval, both in the presence and absence of CS. This is in agreement with previous in vitro studies showing an advantage of shorter cycling intervals. Furthermore, in the context of cycling, or alternating antibiotic treatments, consideration of the pharmacokinetics, e.g. the time-varying antibiotic concentrations, was found to be important because the remaining concentration of the first antibiotic administered added to the total drug effect (illustrated in Fig. 10). Therefore, the antibiotic switch contributes to a higher total drug effect than after repeated administration of the same drug, even in the absence of collateral effects. In our simulations, the impact of this increased effect is dependent on the type of the antibiotic and was shown to be especially important for time-dependent antibiotics. This highlights the importance of considering both PK and PD when designing effective antibiotic treatments, something that is overlooked when drawing conclusion regarding treatments solely based on static in vitro models.

### Identifying "at-risk" patients for sub-optimal β-lactam exposure in critically ill patients with severe infections [^cb322d57]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Optimal pharmacodynamic index for maximal beta-lactam activity

Beta-lactam antibiotics display time-dependent pharmacodynamics, whereby the time for which the free (unbound) drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (f T > MIC) best characterises bacterial killing. Specifically, the % f T > MIC value needed for bactericidal activity is between 40 and 70% for these antibiotics. However, emerging clinical data from critically ill patients suggest that these patients may benefit from higher and longer antibiotic exposures. It has since been suggested that beta-lactam concentrations should be maintained as at least four or five times the MIC for extended periods during each dosing interval (e.g. 90–100% T > 4×MIC–5×MIC) to maximise patient outcomes, including suppressing the emergence of resistant bacteria. Nevertheless, achieving this aggressive pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target is not easy in critically ill patients, particularly when standard beta-lactam dosing is applied.

### The effect of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes: importance of proper evaluation of appropriate therapy [^843d2d50]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

The impact of antimicrobial resistance on patient outcomes can be effectively measured only if the appropriateness of the antimicrobial therapy received is properly measured. Definition of appropriate therapy should include not only in vitro susceptibility but also the clinical adequacy of the antibiotic used, taking into account the pathogen isolated, the site of infection, known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug, and dosing. In the absence of these data, the effect of delay or absence of appropriate therapy in patients infected with resistant bacterial pathogens is subject to confounding, and the true effect of resistance on outcomes may be obscured.

Regarding specific circumstances for surgical site infection, more specifically with respect to patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis, ACOG 2018 guidelines recommend to administer additional intraoperative doses of an antibiotic, given at intervals of 2 times the half-life of the drug measured from the initiation of the preoperative dose, not from the onset of surgery, to maintain adequate levels throughout the operation in patients undergoing lengthy procedures.

### Handling time-dependent variables: antibiotics and antibiotic resistance [^92e56765]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Elucidating quantitative associations between antibiotic exposure and antibiotic resistance development is important. In the absence of randomized trials, observational studies are the next best alternative to derive such estimates. Yet, as antibiotics are prescribed for varying time periods, antibiotics constitute time-dependent exposures. Cox regression models are suited for determining such associations. After explaining the concepts of hazard, hazard ratio, and proportional hazards, the effects of treating antibiotic exposure as fixed or time-dependent variables are illustrated and discussed. Wider acceptance of these techniques will improve quantification of the effects of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance development and provide better evidence for guideline recommendations.

### Right dose, right now: bedside, real-time, data-driven, and personalised antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock-a two-centre randomised clinical trial [^64574ddb]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

It is currently insufficiently understood what exact PK targets should be targeted to improve clinical outcomes and total plasma concentration targets may not necessarily be associated with antimicrobial efficacy at the site of infection. Furthermore, it is currently unclear if individual MIC measurements are suited for precision dosing as these are error prone  and frequently unavailable at initiation of treatment. Therefore, the PK targets in this trial were based on EUCAST epidemiological cut-offs based on combinations of prevalent pathogens and the antibiotics studied. In addition, safety margins were applied to account for MIC variation to prevent underdosing. Different MIC targets can be incorporated depending on the clinical situation and regional microbial resistance. AutoKinetics is designed to account for any desired PK target and is compatible with any compartment PK model. This provides the flexibility to function in a range of clinical settings.

This trial also has limitations. In a post hoc analysis, we found high prediction errors for the PK models for ceftriaxone and meropenem, which may have led to overdosing and underdosing for these antibiotics, respectively. Thus, better PK models need to be developed for use in clinical practice.

We did not use free fraction antibiotic concentration for the dosing target which may be a better PK target than total (bound and unbound) plasma concentration. This is especially important for ceftriaxone which is known to have a high variability in protein binding and for which unbound plasma concentration may be better associated with antimicrobial efficacy at the site of infection.

Furthermore, patients could be included in the trial at the beginning of their antibiotic course but also at a later stage. The maximum potential benefit of AutoKinetics may be limited to those patients who were included from the start of their antibiotic course. Similarly, patients could have received multiple and concurrent antibiotic courses and it is unclear which antibiotic course was most clinically beneficial or effective. As prespecified, an analysis has been planned—that also includes all secondary antibiotic courses—to evaluate the relationship between different PK targets and clinical and microbiological cure.

Lastly, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was stopped prematurely at about 75% of intended inclusions. A larger sample size may have yielded more conclusive results for the vancomycin and meropenem group and could have strengthened the signal for clinical benefit for AutoKinetics. Future studies to investigate the benefit of personalised dosing on clinical outcomes should therefore be encouraged.

### Right dose, right now: bedside, real-time, data-driven, and personalised antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients with sepsis or septic shock-a two-centre randomised clinical trial [^f976e653]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

The Right Dose Right Now study was an investigator-initiated, two-centre, randomised controlled, two-arm, paralleled, and non-blinded superiority trial conducted at Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc and OLVG, location East in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Both are tertiary referral centres for intensive care medicine with medical and surgical patients. The full trial protocol was published while the trial was ongoing and before analyses of the results. Additional details about the study protocol, including amendments, are detailed in the Additional file 1. Ethical approval was obtained in both centres (VUmc 2017.474, OLVG 18.011) and the trial was monitored by an independent clinical research bureau. This report follows the CONSORT guidelines.

Patients and antibiotics

All adult intensive care patients were eligible for inclusion if they received antibiotics for a suspected or confirmed infection and had a suspected or measured serum lactate greater than two mmol/L or a requirement for vasopressor support in any dose.

Patients were eligible both at the start of and during an antibiotic course depending on when they fulfilled the inclusion criteria, specifically the lactate and vasopressor criteria. Patients could be prescribed multiple antibiotics using AutoKinetics but the clinical team could only include a patient for one antibiotic out of four antibiotics primarily used for the treatment of sepsis in the two centres: the β-lactam antibiotics ceftriaxone and meropenem, the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin, and the glycopeptide vancomycin. For all of these antibiotics, inadequate antibiotic exposure occurs with a frequency of up to 60% and their appropriate dosing has been suggested to improve outcome. The initial trial design also included the β-lactam cefotaxime, which could not be implemented due to a shortage at the national level and subsequent change in antibiotic treatment protocols for sepsis. There were no exclusion criteria. To avoid any delays in treatment, patients were included under deferred consent which was obtained from patients or their representatives within 48 h of randomisation.

### Using a simple handover to improve the timing of gentamicin levels [^8eddd21e]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

Within the surgical department of our small, yet very busy district hospital, gentamicin is used frequently among both acute admissions and down stream patients suffering from intra-abdominal sepsis and sepsis of unknown origin. Gentamicin dosing within the hospital is completed with an online calculator which takes into account the patient's ideal weight, height, creatinine clearance, and age. This gives staff a recommended single dose to be delivered at 24 or 48 hourly intervals. In addition to this, adequate dosing and potential side effects of gentamicin are avoided by taking serum levels that help determine the patient's ability to clear the antibiotic. It is recommended that these levels are taken at a six to 14 hour window in order to gain an adequate reflection of the patient's clearance.

Within our hospital, gentamicin serum levels are usually the responsibility of junior medical staff. Unfortunately the time frame of these levels often makes it difficult to administer gentamicin, take an appropriate blood sample, and prescribe the antibiotic within a single shift. This means that this process is often spread across day, evening, and night staff, and regardless of verbal handover this can often result in levels taken out-with the six to 14 hour window, often causing instances of late, and in rare occasions, missed doses of gentamicin.

### Infusional β-lactam antibiotics in febrile neutropenia: has the time come? [^45426c78]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Febrile neutropenia presents a clinical challenge in which timely and appropriate antibiotic exposure is crucial. In the context of altered pharmacokinetics and rising bacterial resistance, standard antibiotic doses are unlikely to be sufficient. This review explores the potential utility of altered dosing approaches of β-lactam antibiotics to optimize treatment in febrile neutropenia.

Recent Findings

There is a dynamic relationship between the antibiotic, the infecting pathogen, and the host. Great advancements have been made in the understanding of the pharmacokinetic changes in critical illness and the pharmacodynamic relationships of antibiotics in these settings.

Summary

Antibiotic treatment in febrile neutropenia is becoming increasingly difficult. Patients are of higher acuity, receive more intensive chemotherapy regimens leading to prolonged neutropenia, and are often exposed to multiple antibiotic courses. These patients display significant variability in antibiotic clearances and increases in volume of distribution compared with standard ward-based patients. Rising antibiotic resistance and a lack of new antibiotics in production have prompted alternative dosing strategies based on pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, such as extended or continuous infusions of β-lactam antibiotics, to maximize the likelihood of treatment success. A definitive study that describes a mortality benefit of such dosing regimens remains elusive and the theoretical advantages require testing in well designed clinical trials.

### Inhaled antibiotic therapy: what drug? What dose? What regimen? What formulation? [^78ce198b]. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis (2002). Low credibility.

Early studies of the use of antibiotics in patients with cystic fibrosis suggested that they would be of benefit in preventing or reducing infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In seeking to optimize treatment, factors such as the drug used, the dose, the regimen and the formulation must be considered. Aminoglycosides are ideal for aerosolization because they have a long post-antibiotic effect and have an acceptable taste. Tobramycin is one of the aminoglycosides with the lowest systemic toxicity, which enables the aerosol delivery of doses high enough to overcome the antagonistic effects of the sputum. The most dramatic benefits from inhaled tobramycin have been shown to occur in the first 2-4 weeks of administration. Continual administration for longer periods can result in the development of resistance and loss of the improvement in lung function. However, this resistance is transient, and susceptibility to tobramycin returns after a short drug holiday. Optimal drug administration therefore consists of a 4-week on, 4-week off cycle. Such a cycle also helps to maintain patient compliance. Successful drug delivery also depends upon a formulation that does not provoke bronchoconstriction, which demands a formulation that is both preservative free, and osmotically and pH balanced. This research has enabled the development of a novel formulation of tobramycin optimized for use as an inhalation therapy in cystic fibrosis.

### Appropriate antibiotic use and why it is important: the challenges of bacterial resistance [^db5b6c37]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

After the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-20th century, clinicians soon witnessed clinical failures secondary to bacterial resistance. Despite scientists' efforts to synthesize more potent antibiotics during the last five decades, bacterial resistance continues to evolve, in large part because of the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The treatment of several pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, is problematic. New solutions are needed to preserve the activity of our current antibiotic armamentarium, to lower the overall risk of bacterial resistance and to successfully treat patients with resistant bacterial infections. Options include: development of new antibiotics to treat resistant organisms; vaccination to prevent infections; and improved use of antibiotics. Because bacteria will eventually develop means to avoid being killed by antibiotics, judicious use of antibiotics by all clinicians is imperative. Appropriate antibiotic use involves selection of a "targeted spectrum" antibiotic, as well as an appropriate dose and duration.

Lessons

We learnt a number of lessons from carrying out this project:

Small steps of change are useful when testing an intervention.
When designing an intervention, consider the wider range of healthcare professionals that the intervention could impact upon.
Healthcare professionals are not lazy or unintelligent people, the system that they work within limits their time, keeps them busy and makes them tired. One could not expect an individual not to make mistakes in this high-pressured environment, so interventions should seek to eliminate the human factors, which may have a bearing on the process.

### What proportion of vancomycin trough levels are drawn too early?: frequency and impact on clinical actions [^2f7f4069]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Vancomycin trough levels are recommended to predict vancomycin efficacy, and inaccurate levels may lead to inappropriate clinical actions. However, the frequency of timing errors and associated clinical impact is unknown. We retrospectively analyzed vancomycin levels (n = 2,597) measured during 13 months at a large academic medical center. Of the specimens, 41.3% were drawn too early. These samples yielded significantly higher average ± SD vancomycin concentrations than correctly timed samples (22.1 ± 11.7 mg/L vs 15.5 mg/L ± 8.6 mg/L; P < .001), and, consequently, clinicians were more likely to decrease, discontinue, or hold a patient's vancomycin dose (25.6% vs 21.4%; P < .02) or repeat the vancomycin level (29.2% vs 20.0%; P < .001). A substantial proportion of specimens collected to assess vancomycin efficacy were drawn too early, leading to overestimation of patients' true trough level and possible underdosing of vancomycin or a high rate of repeat tests for vancomycin.

### Time-programmable drug dosing allows the manipulation, suppression and reversal of antibiotic drug resistance in vitro [^dac418d3]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

While the development of multi-drug resistance was expected, the results of cycling with polymyxin B (POL) shown in Fig. 1c,e were surprising. This is because, depending on the antibiotic combinations, either the development of POL resistance or the counteracting antibiotic was suppressed. As a result, the bacterial population was resistant to only one antibiotic. In contrast, the resistance was developed in all cases when cultured under single antibiotic stress (Fig. 1b,d,f,h). To gain a better understanding of this behaviour, the bacterial population was challenged with various antibiotic combinations (Supplementary Fig. 3). Here, the antibiotics were cycled over an interval of 1 day because shorter intervals tended to delay the development of the antibiotic resistance (Supplementary Fig. 4b–i). The results showed that cycling with POL often drove the bacterial population to a single drug-resistant state, or kept the population in that state for a long period (Supplementary Fig. 3a). In contrast, cycling with the other antibiotics ended up in a multi-drug-resistant state in all the cases (Supplementary Fig. 3b).

Bacterial evolution under single antibiotic stress

We hypothesized that the single drug-resistant state with POL might be related to the evolutionary patterns of resistance under single antibiotic condition. Indeed, the development of POL resistance under single antibiotic stress exhibited a unique evolutionary pattern with a relatively long ‘silent phase' where the population does not develop drug resistance (up to 6 days) followed by sharp increase as shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 5. As such, the evolutionary patterns of the other antibiotic resistance profiles can be categorized into two types: (1) The rapid development of NAL, KAN and rifampicin resistance increasing to the maximum level with little or no silent phase, and (2) a gradual increase in resistance for CHL, NIT, ampicillin and tetracycline over time. Cycling POL with the antibiotics in the former category tends to suppress the resistance to POL, while populations developed POL resistance at a relatively early stage when cycled with the antibiotics in the latter category.

### Antimicrobial resistance: consideration as an adverse drug event [^788ee258]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance has increased dramatically in the past 15 to 20 yrs and presents a patient safety concern unlike any other in the intensive care unit. Antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients increases morbidity, mortality, length of hospital stay, and healthcare costs. Some organisms may have intrinsically high levels of resistance or may be spread between patients by poor infection control practices. However, a major driver of antimicrobial resistance is antibiotic use. As such, the development of antimicrobial resistance can often be thought of as an adverse drug event. This article explores the link between drug use, drug dosing, other selective pressures and resistance, and describes concepts to minimize the negative impact of antimicrobial therapy. Two broad themes of these concepts are minimizing the use of antibiotics whenever possible and optimizing antibiotic usage when they are needed. Strategies for minimizing the use of antimicrobials include using optimal diagnostic procedures to ensure the need for antimicrobials, streamlining or discontinuing therapy when possible based on culture results, and using the shortest duration of therapy needed for documented infections. Strategies for optimizing antimicrobial use include using optimal dosing based on the manufacturer's instructions and current pharmacodynamic data, guiding better prescribing based on local susceptibility patterns and formulary restriction, and avoiding drugs with more propensity to foster resistance.

Pharmacokinetic outcomes

For ciprofloxacin, the primary outcome of target attainment in the first 24 h was reached in 69% of patients in the AutoKinetics group compared to 3% in the control group (OR 62.5 CI 11.4–1173.8, p < 0.001). For ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and meropenem, there were no statistically significant differences in PK target attainment (Table 2). The cumulative dose for the primary antibiotic given in the first 24 h after randomisation is shown in Additional file 1 : Fig. S2. Additional details about the dosing regimens and measured plasma concentrations are available in Additional file 1 : Figs. S3 and S4. A significant difference was observed for ciprofloxacin with a daily median dose of 2600 mg (IQR 2000–3000 mg) in the AutoKinetics group versus 1000 mg (IQR 800–1200 mg) in the control group.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^fac9fede]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

### Adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease [^d0689751]. Journal of Women's Health (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess adherence to oral therapies in pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Methods

Medication adherence to oral doxycycline therapy (100 mg) was measured using electronic event monitoring (EEM) among adult women with PID. Subjects (n = 91), who were predominantly black and with a high school or lower educational attainment, were randomly selected from the Pelvic Inflammatory Disease Evaluation and Clinical Health (PEACH) Study, a trial in which subjects were randomized to either (1). initial inpatient then outpatient or (2). fully outpatient treatment with doxycycline and cefoxitin. Summary statistics calculated within treatment groups and in the cohort as a whole included the percentage of administrations taken, percentage of days with correct dosage, percentage of days with no drug taken, time elapsed until the first drug holiday, and percentage of optimal dosing intervals.

Results

Study subjects took an average of 70% of prescribed doses, took the prescribed two daily doses for less than half of their outpatient days, took an unscheduled drug holiday for almost 25% of their outpatient days, and took only 16.9% of their doses within the optimal timing interval. In general, working, not bleeding with sex, and not drinking hard liquor were positively associated with measures of adherence. Adherence estimates were similar among women in the inpatient and outpatient groups after hospital discharge.

Conclusions

The disturbing rates of time interval adherence, even after hospitalization, suggest the need to determine the effectiveness of antibiotic regimens involving shorter courses and longer dosing intervals.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^d8ae9b41]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

For treatment to be successful, it is commonly recognized that attaining concentrations above a certain critical target is required.The usual pharmacodynamic marker that guides antibiotic efficacy is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Based on in vitro studies, the optimal pharmacokinetic target in relation to an organism’s MIC has been defined for each antibiotic: fC max /MIC, ratio of maximal free drug concentration to MIC; fAUC/MIC, ratio of the area under the free drug concentration‐time curve to MIC; fT > MIC, fraction of time of the free drug concentration being above the MIC, with the latter usually used for beta‐lactam antibiotics.However, to define a drug’s therapeutic window, an assessment of likely efficacy needs to be accompanied by an assessment of the proposed dose’s potential to cause adverse drug reactions. For some antibiotics with narrow therapeutic windows such as nephrotoxicity associated with aminoglycosides or glycopeptides, these toxicity cutoffs are well defined. For the beta‐lactams, toxicity thresholds are less well defined, but increasing evidence points towards neurotoxicity possibly becoming dose‐limiting, especially when new dosing regimens such as continuous infusion dosing are gaining in popularity.

Focusing on three clinically important severe syndromes—pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis—this review aimed to assess variability and appropriateness in pediatric beta‐lactam dosing recommendations for selected WHO AWaRe antibiotics based on the assumption that these were severe infections in hospitalized neonates and children. We collated dosing guidance from national and international pediatric formularies, searched for the most appropriate model for suggested drugs, and simulated target attainment in a real‐world setting by sampling underlying syndrome‐specific populations from point prevalence surveys.

### Antimicrobial stewardship for inpatient facilities [^f1b2a28d]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship aims to improve patient care and reduce unwanted consequences of antimicrobial overuse or misuse, including lowered efficacy, emergence of antimicrobial resistance, development of secondary infections, adverse drug reactions, increased length of hospital stay, and additional healthcare costs. Recent guidelines make specific recommendations for the development of institutional programs to enhance antimicrobial stewardship. Optimally, such programs should be comprehensive, multidisciplinary, supported by hospital and medical staff leadership, and should employ evidence-based strategies that best fit local needs and resources. An infectious diseases physician and clinical pharmacist with infectious diseases training are recommended as core members of the multidisciplinary team, although a hospitalist with interest (and perhaps additional training) in antimicrobial therapy may be able to fill the void. Program directors and core members should be compensated for their time. Principal proactive strategies--with evidence supporting their consideration--include prospective audits, with intervention and feedback, formulary restriction, and preauthorization. Other strategies include persistent one-on-one education, guidelines adapted to local needs, and informatics to support clinical decision making. Intervention goals are to prevent unnecessary antimicrobial starts, to streamline or de-escalate therapy early in its course, and to convert from parenteral to oral therapy, optimize dosing, and ensure the appropriate length of therapy. Most community hospitals, if sufficiently resourced, should be able to implement a successful antimicrobial stewardship program. Evidence suggests that good antimicrobial stewardship can lead to less overall and inappropriate antimicrobial use, lower drug-related costs, reductions in Clostridium difficile-associated disease, and, in some studies, less emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Does the dose matter? [^d9bd5145]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters, such as the ratio of peak to minimum inhibitory concentration (peak/MIC ratio), ratio of 24-hour area under the curve to MIC (24-h AUC/MIC ratio), and the time above MIC, are good indicators of the drug dose-organism interaction. Time above the MIC is the important determinant of the activity of beta-lactams, macrolides, clindamycin, and linezolid. Free drug serum levels of these drugs should be above the MIC for at least 40%-50% of the dosing interval to produce adequate clinical and microbiological efficacy. Peak/MIC and 24-h AUC/MIC ratios are major determinants of the activity of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. In general, peak/MIC ratios should exceed 8 and 24-h AUC/MIC values should be >100 to successfully treat gram-negative bacillary infections and to prevent the emergence of resistant organisms during therapy. The successful treatment of pneumococcal infections with fluoroquinolones and azithromycin appear to require 24-h AUC/MIC ratios of only 25-35. Mutation prevention concentrations are being reported for various fluoroquinolones with different pathogens, but their clinical significance has not yet been established. More information is needed on the role of PK/PD parameters and their magnitude for preventing mutations and the emergence of resistant organisms for most classes of antibiotics.

### Beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and continuous renal replacement therapy [^69231c84]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Optimal antibiotic dosing in the ICU is still a controversial issue that clinicians face daily. Despite compelling evidence supporting early and appropriate antibiotic therapy as one of the most effective interventions for improving patient outcome, antibiotic selection and dosing is often challenging in critically ill patients because of disease complexity, resulting physiological alterations, and reduced antibiotic susceptibilities of nosocomial pathogens. Besides, selecting an antimicrobial to which the causal agent is susceptible is not sufficient to achieve the best clinical outcomes, and factors such as adequate tissue penetration and achievement of a pharmacodynamic target associated with therapeutic success according to the antibiotic class are crucial for improving infection cure and patient morbi-mortality [-].

Beta-lactam antibiotics are time-dependent antibiotics, meaning that they exhibit optimal killing activity when plasma concentrations are maintained above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria during a percentage of the dosing interval (%T >MIC). Beta-lactams are also the most prescribed antibiotics in the ICU. Significant and unpredictable pharmacokinetic variability of this pharmacological group has been well documented in critically ill patients: the volume of distribution (Vd) and the clearance (CL) of beta-lactams have been found to vary significantly depending on patient severity, proteinemia and organ failure, among other factors. Acute kidney injury and the requirement of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) add further variability to beta-lactam CL. However, available clinical evidence supporting beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT is not yet optimal, since recommendations are mainly elucidated from healthy volunteers’ data and from clinical studies with important patient variability and limited sample sizes.

The aims of this article are to describe the current clinical scenario of beta-lactam dosing in critically ill patients with septic shock and CRRT, to highlight the sources of variability among the different studies that reduce extrapolation to clinical practice, and to identify the opportunities for future research and improvement in this field. For this purpose, two of the most frequently prescribed beta-lactams for nosocomial infections (meropenem and piperacillin) and a highly protein-bound antibiotic usually prescribed for community-acquired infections (ceftriaxone) were chosen for a thorough review. A systematic review of all available data on beta-lactam antibiotic pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients with CRRT was beyond the scope of this article, as this has been done elsewhere [-].

Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

β-Lactam PK/PD targets—future research needs emphasize uncertainty in universal thresholds and specify study design elements. The authors state, “It remains possible that no single fT>MIC or fCmax/MIC threshold will apply uniformly across all β-lactam agents, organisms, and infection types,” and “Future studies in patients are needed to confirm the optimal exposure required for β-lactam TDM, including exposures associated with dose-related toxicities.” They add, “We recommend that such studies include monotherapy, when possible, a similar infection type, and importantly collect actual plasma concentration and MIC data to determine observed individual exposure. Finally, the sample size should be sufficient to include patients with exposures over a broad range of fT>MIC.”

### Computerized advice on drug dosage to improve prescribing practice [^23d8ef75]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Maintaining therapeutic concentrations of drugs with a narrow therapeutic window is a complex task. Several computer systems have been designed to help doctors determine optimum drug dosage. Signiﬁcant improvements in health care could be achieved if computer advice improved health outcomes and could be implemented in routine practice in a cost-effective fashion. This is an updated version of an earlier Cochrane systematic review, first published in 2001 and updated in 2008.

Objectives

To assess whether computerized advice on drug dosage has beneficial effects on patient outcomes compared with routine care (empiric dosing without computer assistance).

Search Methods

The following databases were searched from 1996 to January 2012: EPOC Group Specialized Register, Reference Manager; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Ovid; EMBASE, Ovid; and CINAHL, EbscoHost. A "top up" search was conducted for the period January 2012 to January 2013; these results were screened by the authors and potentially relevant studies are listed in Studies Awaiting Classification. The review authors also searched reference lists of relevant studies and related reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series analyses of computerized advice on drug dosage. The participants were healthcare professionals responsible for patient care. The outcomes were any objectively measured change in the health of patients resulting from computerized advice (such as therapeutic drug control, clinical improvement, adverse reactions).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. We grouped the results from the included studies by drug used and the effect aimed at for aminoglycoside antibiotics, amitriptyline, anaesthetics, insulin, anticoagulants, ovarian stimulation, anti-rejection drugs and theophylline. We combined the effect sizes to give an overall effect for each subgroup of studies, using a random-effects model. We further grouped studies by type of outcome when appropriate (i.e. no evidence of heterogeneity).

Main Results

Forty-six comparisons (from 42 trials) were included (as compared with 26 comparisons in the last update) including a wide range of drugs in inpatient and outpatient settings. All were randomized controlled trials except two studies. Interventions usually targeted doctors, although some studies attempted to influence prescriptions by pharmacists and nurses. Drugs evaluated were anticoagulants, insulin, aminoglycoside antibiotics, theophylline, anti-rejection drugs, anaesthetic agents, antidepressants and gonadotropins. Although all studies used reliable outcome measures, their quality was generally low.This update found similar results to the previous update and managed to identify specific therapeutic areas where the computerized advice on drug dosage was beneficial compared with routine care:1. it increased target peak serum concentrations (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.79, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.13) and the proportion of people with plasma drug concentrations within the therapeutic range after two days (pooled risk ratio (RR) 4.44, 95% CI 1.94 to 10.13) for aminoglycoside antibiotics;2. it led to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants (SMD for percentage of time spent in target international normalized ratio +0.19, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.33) and insulin (SMD for percentage of time in target glucose range: +1.27, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.98);3. it decreased the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants (SMD -0.56, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.04);4. it decreased the thromboembolism events (rate ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.94) and tended to decrease bleeding events for anticoagulants although the difference was not significant (rate ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.08). It tended to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics (nephrotoxicity: RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.06) and anti-rejection drugs (cytomegalovirus infections: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40);5. it tended to reduce the length of time spent in the hospital although the difference was not significant (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.02) and to achieve comparable or better cost-effectiveness ratios than usual care;6. there was no evidence of differences in mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypoglycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants.For all outcomes, statistical heterogeneity quantified by I(2) statistics was moderate to high.

Authors' Conclusions

This review update suggests that computerized advice for drug dosage has some benefits: it increases the serum concentrations for aminoglycoside antibiotics and improves the proportion of people for which the plasma drug is within the therapeutic range for aminoglycoside antibiotics.It leads to a physiological parameter more often within the desired range for oral anticoagulants and insulin. It decreases the time to achieve stabilization for oral anticoagulants. It tends to decrease unwanted effects for aminoglycoside antibiotics and anti-rejection drugs, and it significantly decreases thromboembolism events for anticoagulants. It tends to reduce the length of hospital stay compared with routine care while comparable or better cost-effectiveness ratios were achieved.However, there was no evidence that decision support had an effect on mortality or other clinical adverse events for insulin (hypoglycaemia), anaesthetic agents, anti-rejection drugs and antidepressants. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that some decision support technical features (such as its integration into a computer physician order entry system) or aspects of organization of care (such as the setting) could optimize the effect of computerized advice.Taking into account the high risk of bias of, and high heterogeneity between, studies, these results must be interpreted with caution.

### Process mapping strategies to prevent subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator infections [^72b8e631]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4 Implant techniques (Supporting Information: Figure 2)

Once the patient is ready for the first incision, it is highly advised to take a surgical time‐out and review the antibiotic delivery time to assure the optimal interval has passed but not been exceeded between the start of the IV delivery and the first incision. If necessary, administer a follow‐up dose. This is also a good time to recheck the last dose of anticoagulation, if applicable.

When making the incisions, utmost care should be taken to create clean incisions with minimal tissue damage or lacerations to improve wound healing. Avoid aggressive retractions, and avoid dissecting into the muscle layers, which could lead to excessive bleeding. Take the time to achieve thorough hemostasis. The use of cautery tools such as the lighted PhotonBlade™ can help illuminate the deep pocket to detect and stop any bleeding. In addition, the use of the two‐ versus three‐incision technique has been shown to reduce implant time,which may reduce the infection risk.

### Adherence to guidelines for the administration of intraoperative antibiotics in a nationwide US sample [^5e3efc7b]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

In terms of specific antibiotics that may benefit from focused quality improvement initiatives, we identified certain medications that may warrant closer attention when administered. Our findings indicate that 50.5% of the patients administered vancomycin received a dose at least 10% lower than guidelines would dictate. Generally, vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic for patients with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonization,frequently seen in high-risk patients in health care settings. Using lower than recommended vancomycin doses may be especially deleterious owing to the potentially increased risk of SSIs in these patients. Moreover, nonadherence to guideline-based vancomycin administration has been linked to an increased rate of SSIs. Targeting efforts at optimizing vancomycin administration, especially related to its dose, may thus have an impact on reducing SSIs.

It is worth emphasizing that we found very high adherence to guidelines with respect to timing of initial antibiotic administration (99.4%) as compared with other metrics. Intense attention has been given to appropriate timing of antibiotics in the context of the SCIP initiative, which likely explains the excellent performance in this metric across institutions. The success in adherence to SCIP suggests that implementation of similar initiatives targeting a more comprehensive set of metrics relevant to appropriate antibiotic administration may similarly improve adherence.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^49eed135]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

### Preparing doxycycline hyclate for non-pill swallowers-CDC (...) [^9947e0e4]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know If you're exposed to anthrax, it's important to begin antibiotics quickly and take as directed to prevent serious illness and death from anthrax. Many children and others can't swallow pills, so caretakers can learn how to mix antibiotics into food or drink so they can still take antibiotics. The antibiotic mixture should be taken every 12 hours for as long as directed. Step 2: Measure
- Find your child's weight on the chart below. If unknown, find the age on the chart.
- Follow it across to the "Amount of Doxycycline & Water Mixture" column.
- The weight-range dosing is based on 2. 2 mg/kg calculation.
4. Measure doxycycline mixture from first bowl for child's weight or age. For a 1/2. teaspoon dose, fill halfway or use an oral syringe. It's better to give slightly more than not enough.
5. Place this amount into the second bowl. This is one dose, and it should be mixed with food or drink.

F or adults who cannot swallow pills or children over 76 pounds: Use the entire doxycycline mixture from the first bowl. The contents of the first bowl make one dose to be mixed with food or drink. You have now measured the right dose. Step 3: Mix
- Put the dose in the second bowl. Add 3 teaspoonsof one of the following:
- Milk, including breast milk and formula for infants
- Chocolate milk
- Chocolate pudding OR
- Apple juice mixed with 2 to 4 teaspoons of sugar 2. Mix well before giving it to your child. You now have one dose mixed with food or drink. Step 4: Give the dose Give your child all of the doxycycline, water, and food mixture from the second bowl. Make sure your child swallows all of it. This is one dose. Do this once every 12 hours each day for as long as directed.

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^9b39dda8]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Pharmacokinetic considerations

Alterations of antimicrobial PK in critically ill patients, most notably, those with septic shock has been an area of research focus for over two decades. A bedside view of patients receiving lifesaving supportive therapies such as circulatory support via pharmacologic or mechanical means, mechanical ventilatory support, renal replacement therapies, and/or ECMO provide an outward reflection of in vivo variability of antimicrobial PK. When patient physiology returns to baseline functioning it is assumed that antimicrobial PK also normalizes. However, the fluctuations in antimicrobial absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination make dose optimization (Table 2) a challenge for the most experienced and resourced clinician despite recommendations to do so in clinical practice guidelines.

### Uncertainty in antibiotic dosing in critically ill neonate and pediatric patients: can microsampling provide the answers? [^179f9fb9]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

With a decreasing supply of antibiotics that are effective against the pathogens that cause sepsis, it is critical that we learn to use currently available antibiotics optimally. Pharmacokinetic studies provide an evidence base from which we can optimize antibiotic dosing. However, these studies are challenging in critically ill neonate and pediatric patients due to the small blood volumes and associated risks and burden to the patient from taking blood. We investigate whether microsampling, that is, obtaining a biologic sample of low volume (<50 μL), can improve opportunities to conduct pharmacokinetic studies.

Methods

We performed a literature search to find relevant articles using the following search terms: sepsis, critically ill, severe infection, intensive care AND antibiotic, pharmacokinetic, p(a)ediatric, neonate. For microsampling, we performed a search using antibiotics AND dried blood spots OR dried plasma spots OR volumetric absorptive microsampling OR solid-phase microextraction OR capillary microsampling OR microsampling. Databases searched include Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and EMbase.

Findings

Of the 32 antibiotic pharmacokinetic studies performed on critically ill neonate or pediatric patients in this review, most of the authors identified changes to the pharmacokinetic properties in their patient group and recommended either further investigations into this patient population or therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure antibiotic doses are suitable. There remain considerable gaps in knowledge regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of antibiotics in critically ill pediatric patients. Implementing microsampling in an antibiotic pharmacokinetic study is contingent on the properties of the antibiotic, the pathophysiology of the patient (and how this can affect the microsample), and the location of the patient. A validation of the sampling technique is required before implementation.

Implications

Current antibiotic regimens for critically ill neonate and pediatric patients are frequently suboptimal due to a poor understanding of altered pharmacokinetic properties. An assessment of the suitability of microsampling for pharmacokinetic studies in neonate and pediatric patients is recommended before wider use. The method of sampling, as well as the method of bioanalysis, also requires validation to ensure the data obtained reflect the true result.

### The effects of missed doses of antibiotics on hospitalized patient outcomes [^d0837e9d]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Missing doses of antibiotics in hospitalized patients is a well-described but inadequately recognized issue. We hypothesized that missing doses of antibiotics decreases quality of care.

Methods

Retrospective study on patients admitted to the Shock Trauma ICU from February to June 2015. Patients prescribed a multidose course of antibiotics were evaluated. A missed antibiotic dose was one ordered but never given (a completely missed dose) or a dose that was not given within an hour before or after the planned time (an off-schedule missed dose). Patient outcomes included a positive culture, ventilator, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality. Multiple statistical methods were used as appropriate; significance was set as P < 0.05.

Results

For the 5-mo study period, 280 patients were admitted and 200 met inclusion criteria. Eight percent of patients (16/200) did not miss any antibiotic doses, 39% (77/200) had only off-schedule doses, 2% (4/200) had only completely missed doses, and 51% (103/200) had both off-schedule and completely missed doses. For the 200 patients, 8167 doses were ordered and 2096 (26%) were missed. Adjusting for age, gender, BMI, injury severity score, and doses of antibiotics showed that those who miss doses off-schedule had longer LOS than those who do not miss doses of antibiotics. There was a significant nonlinear relationship between LOS and frequency of early (P-value = 0.02) and late (P-value = 0.01) doses.

Conclusions

To reduce length of hospital stay and optimize quality, methods to improve compliance with antibiotic dosing schedules should be investigated.

### Electronically monitored adherence to short-term antibiotic therapy in children [^b5ed824e]. Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Nonadherence to short-term antibiotic treatment in children can lead to treatment failure and the development of drug-resistant microorganisms. We aimed to provide reliable adherence estimates in this population.

Methods

A prospective, blinded, electronically monitored, observational study between January 2018 and October 2021. Patients aged 2 months to 5 years diagnosed with an acute bacterial infection requiring short-term (5-10 days) oral antibiotic monotherapy, were provided with an electronically monitored medication bottle, recording every manipulation of the cap. Primary outcomes were overall adherence, predefined as administration of >75% of doses relative to the number of doses prescribed, and timing adherence, defined as the administration of >75% of prescribed doses taken within ±20% of the prescribed interval.

Results

One hundred infants (49 boys, mean [range] age 1.87 years [0.2-5.1]) were included in the final analysis. Only 11 participants received all the recommended doses. Overall adherence was 62%, whereas timing adherence was 21%. After applying a logistic regression model, the only factor significantly associated with nonadherence was being a single parent (odds ratio = 5.7; 95% confidence interval [1.07-30.3]). Prescribers overestimated adherence, defining 49 of 62 (77.7%) participants as likely adherent. Patients predicted to be adherent were not more likely to be adherent than those predicted to be nonadherent (31/47 actual adherence among those predicted to be adherent vs 6/16, P = .77).

Conclusions

Adherence of children to the short-term antimicrobial treatment of an acute infection is suboptimal. Providers were unable to predict the adherence of their patients. These data are important when considering recommended treatment durations and developing interventional programs to increase adherence.

Shortest effective duration of therapy—We recommend that ASPs implement guidelines and strategies to reduce antibiotic therapy to the shortest effective duration (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Recommending a duration of therapy based on patient-specific factors is an important activity for ASPs, with suitable approaches including developing written guidelines with specific suggestions for duration, including duration of therapy recommendations as part of the preauthorization or prospective audit and feedback process, or specifying duration at the time of antibiotic ordering (eg, through an electronic order entry system).

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^a9f44057]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment for respiratory tract infections to combat antimicrobial resistance

Most bacterial RTIs show equal efficacy with fewer adverse events in shorter compared to standard antibiotic courses in clinical trials. This is based on the principle of ‘shorter is better,’ initially conceived one decade ago.However, there are two notable exceptions: otitis media among children under the age of two and streptococcal pharyngitis, in which shorter first-line antibiotic courses are less effective than standard antibiotic courses.

Over the last few decades, most guidelines have recommended standard antimicrobial therapy durations of seven to ten days for lower RTIs. However, few randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the minimal effective treatment durations. Despite the low number of patients included in some of these studies, shorter treatment durations, such as two to three days, have been demonstrated not to be inferior to longer durations in terms of clinical efficacy.,Initially advocated for uncomplicated urinary tract infections in the early 2000s, an increasing body of evidence suggests that shorter durations of antibiotics are also effective in treating most RTIs (Table 2). Some recent clinical guidelines, like the WHO AWaRe antibiotic book, advocate for five-day courses of antibiotics for acute rhinosinusitis, COPD exacerbations, and community-acquired pneumonia.Despite this evidence, most clinicians still use standard or longer courses.

### Strategies for reduction in duration of antibiotic use in hospitalized patients [^f87eb23b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

There is a global crisis of antibiotic resistance in part because of the collateral damage of antibiotic use. Reduction in antibiotic consumption is clearly important to minimize this problem. Limiting treatment duration may be the most clinically palatable means of reducing antibiotic consumption. Antimicrobial stewardship programs play an important role in this process. Their effectiveness may be increased by drawing on evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding optimal antibiotic duration. However, in most clinical scenarios, the recommended duration of therapy in published guidelines is based on expert opinion. Biological markers, such as procalcitonin, have been shown to reduce antimicrobial consumption with no adverse outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials. Although procalcitonin may not be the perfect biomarker, the concept of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic discontinuation after clinical stabilization, in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship programs, appears to be ready for introduction into clinical practice.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^16541ab4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

‘Complete the antibiotic course’, a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR.However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental.By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms.This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection.AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma.The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies.In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Electronic prescribing: introducing a stat optional dose to improve time to antibiotic on the acute medical unit [^751235e2]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Darlington Memorial Hospital is a district general hospital in the North East of England. The acute medical unit (AMU) takes referrals from the emergency department and also direct from general practitioners (GPs) in the region. Research shows that early recognition and management of sepsis is key to improving outcomes and significantly decreases mortality. Having observed several cases of delayed sepsis management in patients referred from their GP, we aimed to improve time to antibiotic therapy in patients identified as having sepsis as per the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2016 NG51 sepsis guidelines. We analysed the time from admission to antibiotic administrations for patients referred to AMU via their GP with suspected sepsis. We found there was a significant delay between antibiotic prescribing and administration. Baseline data showed that only 36% of patients received a stat dose of antibiotic on admission. Results showed that those patients with a stat dose prescribed had a median time of 36min from prescription to antibiotic compared with 98min for those without. We introduced a stat antibiotic option with all antibiotic prescriptions on the electronic prescribing system, encouraging prescribers to administer a stat dose. Through focusing on antibiotic prescribing systems and practices over two PDSA cycles, we were able to improve the time from prescription to administration of antibiotics for patients with sepsis. We reduced the delay in antibiotic administration in patients with sepsis from 49 to 34min, an improvement of 31% (15/49). The percentage of patients receiving a stat dose of antibiotics increased from 36% to 63%. While we acknowledge that there remains room for improvement with regards to antibiotic prescribing and sepsis management, we have made sustainable interventions with important improvements. E-prescribing systems must be evaluated and modified accordingly on a regular basis to ensure that they positively contribute to quality patient care and clinical practice.

### Resistance decay in individuals after antibiotic exposure in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb130d6a]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Our search strategy was systematic and transparent, and found studies that had not been found in the earlier review of resistance decay. Our review also provides a higher level of rigour by excluding studies at high risk of bias due to confounding variables (such as hospitalisation, device-associated infections and persistent infections) and by being careful to align the time periods after antibiotic exposure (as subgroup analyses) among the included studies to enable better comparisons.

There are several limitations of this review. First, the unadjusted status of the ORs we extracted, rather than simply importing study authors’ adjustments of some confounders, threatens to introduce bias from those confounders. There are potentially many other confounders. For example, resistance can be acquired through contact with other individuals rather than direct antibiotic exposure, groups within the included studies may have different baseline risks for resistance, resistance sampling was not standardised and indications for antibiotic exposure and bacterial load (likely to differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, who might be the only carriers of resistance in their microbiome, or between children and adults) might affect the development of resistance. However, the crude ORs reported differ little from the adjusted values.

We were not able to investigate any effect of dose or duration of the antibiotic exposure on resistance. The quality of how resistance data were analysed and reported was poor in some studies, and some authors did not respond to our requests to clarify aspects of their methods and data, which contributes to the uncertainty of the review’s estimates. This could be because reporting of resistance was not the primary objective in most of the included studies. Finally, resistance was reported in most studies as the proportion of resistant isolates, which does not take account of the changes in overall bacterial population, which is likely to decrease from the antibiotic effect. Consequently, a rise in the resistance proportion might disguise a decrease in the absolute numbers of resistant bacteria.

Urgently needed is further research with high-quality placebo-controlled trials that measure the numbers of resistant and susceptible isolates and enable comparisons of antibiotic dose, duration and class against different bacteria.

### Optimisation of antimicrobial therapy using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters [^c92719e6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

To understand the relationship between drug dose and efficacy, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics need to be integrated. Patterns of antimicrobial activity fall into one of two major patterns: time-dependent killing and concentration-dependent killing. Time-dependent killing is characteristic of many antibiotic classes, such as beta-lactams and macrolides, and seeks to optimise the duration of exposure of a pathogen to an antimicrobial. The major PK/PD parameter correlating with efficacy of time-dependent antimicrobials is the serum concentration present for 40-50% of the dosing interval, and this concentration is the susceptibility limit or breakpoint for the dosing regimen used. The second pattern, concentration-dependent killing, seeks to maximise antimicrobial concentration and is seen with aminoglycosides, quinolones and azalides. The major PK/PD parameter correlating with efficacy of these agents is the 24-h area under the curve to MIC ratio, which should be > or =25 for less severe infections or in immunocompetent hosts, and > or =100 in more severe infections or in immunocompromised hosts. PK/PD breakpoints for concentration-dependent agents can therefore be calculated from the formula AUC divided by 25. This enables development of PK/PD breakpoints based on the above parameters for time- and concentration-dependent agents for defined dosing regimens. For an antimicrobial to be useful empirically, the MIC90s of the agent against the common pathogens responsible for the disease being treated should be below the PK/PD breakpoint. This is particularly important for oral dosing regimens for treating emerging resistant respiratory tract pathogens, where efficacy against the predominant pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, is required.

### Why do hospital prescribers continue antibiotics when it is safe to stop? Results of a choice experiment survey [^e499daaa]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global public health problem that threatens to undermine many advances of modern medicine. Reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and thus selective pressure on bacteria to develop resistance is a key strategy to combat AMR.

In the English National Health Service (NHS), reductions in antibiotic use have been achieved in primary care by raising the threshold for starting patients on antibiotics. Given the need to initiate antibiotic therapy urgently in life-threatening infection, limiting antibiotic overuse in hospitals depends on prescribers undertaking an early antibiotic prescription ‘review and revise’ at around 48–72 h after a patient starts antibiotic treatment. In England, this approach is supported by ‘Start Smart then Focus’ guidance, and in the USA, by ‘Antibiotic Time Outs’. However, antibiotic prescribing has continued to increase in NHS hospitals, both overall and in terms of certain broad-spectrum, intravenous agents (e.g. quinolones and 3rd, 4th and 5th generation cephalosporins). Although hospitals only account for around 1/5 of total antibiotic prescribing, this increase is a major concern because this is where most broad-spectrum agents are used. Such agents have the greatest potential to drive resistance and cause adverse drug reactions.

The ability to ‘review and revise’ antibiotic prescriptions is a key competency for healthcare professionals who prescribe antibiotics in hospitals. Prescribers may choose to change route or duration of therapy, but only a decision to stop treatment quantitatively reduces antibiotic exposure. In current practice, prescribers frequently do not select this option when it would be safe to do so. For example, while up to 20–30% of initial prescriptions amongst acute medical admissions could be stopped safely, in routine practice, fewer than 10% are typically stopped. In a systematic review of in-hospital antibiotic prescribing decisions (including both initial prescribing and de-escalation decisions), sociocultural and behavioural factors, such as fear of adverse health outcomes for patients, intolerance of uncertainty, professional hierarchy and beliefs on the applicability of antibiotic prescribing guidelines, were found to be likely to play a role in these decisions. However, it is likely that the determinants of decisions to start antibiotic treatment and decisions taken at review differ, so that decisions specifically to de-escalate antibiotic treatment are a subset of these factors. Furthermore, there is a lack of quantitative evidence on the relative weights of such determinants, knowledge of which could enable efficient design and implementation of stewardship interventions.

### Continuous versus intermittent infusions of antibiotics for the treatment of severe acute infections [^ffbc8977]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated for the treatment of severe infections. However, the emergence of infections caused by multi-drug resistant organisms in conjunction with a lack of novel antibiotics has prompted the investigation of alternative dosing strategies to improve clinical efficacy and tolerability. To optimise pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic antibiotic parameters, continuous antibiotic infusions have been compared to traditional intermittent antibiotic infusions.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy and safety of continuous intravenous administration of concentration-dependent and time-dependent antibiotics to traditional intermittent intravenous administration in adults with severe acute bacterial infections.

Search Methods

The following electronic databases were searched in September 2012: The Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL, ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S). The reference lists of all relevant material, the Internet and the trials registry www.clinicaltrials.gov for completed and ongoing trials were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials in adults with a bacterial infection requiring intravenous antibiotic therapy comparing continuous versus intermittent infusions of antibiotics were included. Both time-dependent and concentration-dependent antibiotics were considered.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three independent authors performed data extraction for the included studies. All data was cross-checked and disagreements resolved by consensus. An intention to treat analysis was conducted using a random-effects model.

Main Results

Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria with a combined total of over 1,600 patients. The majority of included studies were judged to be at unclear or high risk of bias with regard to randomisation sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, management of incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential threats to validity. No studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for all methodological quality items assessed. There were no differences in all-cause mortality (n=1241, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.67 - 1.20, p=0.45), infection recurrence (n=398, RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.35 - 4.19, p=0.76), clinical cure (n=975, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.93 - 1.08, p=0.98), and superinfection post-therapy (n=813, RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.60 - 1.94, p=0.79). There were no differences in safety outcomes including adverse events (n=575, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 - 1.12, p=0.63), serious adverse events (n=871, RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.80 - 2.30, p=0.26), and withdrawal due to adverse events (n=871, RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.52 - 7.95, p=0.31). A difference was observed in the subgroup analyses of clinical cure in septic versus non-septic patients, where intermittent antibiotic infusions were favoured for clinical cure in septic patients. However, this effect was not consistent between random-effects and fixed-effects analyses. No differences were found in sensitivity analyses conducted.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no differences in mortality, infection recurrence, clinical cure, superinfection post-therapy, and safety outcomes when comparing continuous infusions of intravenous antibiotics to traditional intermittent infusions of antibiotics. However, the wide confidence intervals suggest that beneficial or harmful effects cannot be ruled out for all outcomes. Therefore, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend the widespread adoption of continuous infusion antibiotics in the place of intermittent infusions of antibiotics. Further large prospective randomised trials, with consistent and complete reporting of clinical outcome measures, conducted with concurrent pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies in special populations are required to determine whether adoption of continuous antibiotic infusions is warranted in specific circumstances.
