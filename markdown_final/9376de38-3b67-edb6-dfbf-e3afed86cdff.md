## Question

What is the treatment of hypcalcemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of hypocalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypocalcemia and distinguishing total from ionized calcium. Then, I should assess severity and symptoms to decide on IV versus oral therapy. Next, I will consider the underlying etiology because management differs in postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, CKD-MBD, tumor lysis syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, and drug-induced hypocalcemia. After that, I will outline acute IV calcium protocols, oral calcium and active vitamin D strategies, and special populations like pediatrics and trauma. Finally, I will integrate monitoring, safety thresholds, and when to consider PTH replacement, making sure I verify dosing and guideline nuances as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity before jumping to treatment, because hypoalbuminemia can artifactually lower total calcium while ionized calcium remains normal, and in critical illness albumin-adjusted calcium is unreliable for predicting true ionized hypocalcemia, so I should order ionized calcium when available and interpret total calcium in light of albumin, especially in ICU or transfusion contexts [^97f2d2f7] [^fc3276ac].

> Next, I should review severity and symptoms to guide urgency. Severe symptomatic hypocalcemia with tetany, seizures, or cardiac effects warrants immediate IV calcium, whereas mild, asymptomatic cases can be managed orally with close follow-up, and I need to ensure I do not overtreat low total calcium when ionized calcium is normal or when the patient is asymptomatic [^3c770ed8] [^1a04fe87].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology, because treatment hinges on cause. I will categorize likely causes as postsurgical hypoparathyroidism, CKD-MBD with calcimimetic-induced hypocalcemia, tumor lysis syndrome, vitamin D deficiency, and drug-induced hypocalcemia such as denosumab or bisphosphonates, since each scenario has different priorities and thresholds for intervention [^1a04fe87] [^3067df1e] [^6896f72e].

> For acute symptomatic hypocalcemia, I should act quickly. IV calcium gluconate is preferred over calcium chloride for peripheral administration because chloride is more caustic; typical dosing uses 10% calcium gluconate, 1–2 g IV over 10 minutes, repeated as needed, followed by a continuous infusion of 1–2 g in 1 L saline over 6–8 hours with serial ionized calcium checks, and I should remember that boluses are short-lived so infusions are more effective for sustained correction [^3c770ed8] [^27dcf7be] [^c0c101fa].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric dosing so I don't overgeneralize adult protocols. In children with manifest tetany or seizures, 10–20 mg/kg elemental calcium as IV calcium gluconate over 5–10 minutes is recommended, followed by 30–75 mg/kg/day elemental calcium in divided doses, with calcitriol 20–100 ng/kg/day in 2–3 divided doses until normalization, and I should double-check that I'm using elemental calcium calculations correctly when advising families on oral formulations [^671227f5] [^c3d90df0].

> I need to ensure I address concurrent hypomagnesemia because low magnesium impairs PTH secretion and action. If magnesium is below about 1.6 mg/dL, I should replete magnesium first or alongside calcium, as magnesium repletion can expedite calcium recovery and reduce refractory hypocalcemia, particularly in postsurgical or critical care settings [^4b835cb8] [^3c770ed8].

> For chronic or non-emergent hypocalcemia, I should start oral calcium and active vitamin D, tailoring to the cause. Oral calcium carbonate 1–2 g three times daily is a typical starting point, with calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg twice daily added if needed, and I should titrate to keep serum calcium at the low end of normal to mitigate hypercalciuria and ectopic calcification risk, especially in hypoparathyroidism [^3c770ed8] [^1efd065d].

> But wait, what if the patient has CKD-MBD and is on a calcimimetic. I should confirm that KDIGO advises tolerating mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia to avoid calcium loading, and if symptomatic or severe, I should reduce or hold the calcimimetic and add calcium and active vitamin D as indicated, balancing phosphate control and PTH targets in the broader CKD-MBD framework [^1a04fe87] [^b1b0fa57].

> In tumor lysis syndrome, I should avoid treating asymptomatic hypocalcemia because calcium can promote calcium-phosphate precipitation when phosphate is high. If hypocalcemia is symptomatic, a short infusion of calcium gluconate with close monitoring is reasonable, but my priority remains aggressive hydration, rasburicase when indicated, and phosphate control to prevent calcium-phosphate deposition [^3067df1e] [^4a08a658].

> For vitamin D deficiency, I need to check that I'm using the right repletion strategy. Cholecalciferol 50,000 IU weekly for about 4–8 weeks is a common approach, with maintenance at 400–800 IU daily thereafter, and I should pair this with calcium and consider calcitriol if hypocalcemia is severe or malabsorption is present, recognizing that calcitriol helps acutely but does not rebuild vitamin D stores [^787109da] [^671227f5].

> I should double-check denosumab-related hypocalcemia precautions. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected before denosumab, all patients should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and in advanced CKD or high-risk patients I should monitor calcium 10–14 days after injection and then periodically, as severe, prolonged hypocalcemia is well documented and may require IV therapy [^6896f72e] [^e366fe82].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety thresholds. During active correction, I will check ionized calcium every 4–6 hours initially, then daily once stable, and in chronic management I will monitor calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and 25(OH)D periodically, aiming to keep the calcium-phosphate product below about 55 mg²/dL² to reduce ectopic calcification risk, and I will adjust therapy if calcium drifts above the normal range or if hypercalciuria emerges [^1efd065d] [^3c770ed8].

> Hold on, I should verify when to consider PTH replacement. In chronic hypoparathyroidism refractory to or complicated by high-dose calcium and active vitamin D, recombinant PTH options such as rhPTH 1–84 or the long-acting palopegteriparatide can normalize calcium while lowering phosphate and urinary calcium, and I need to ensure I exclude autosomal dominant hypocalcemia before initiating PTH therapy [^5b27264e] [^d6b16f8c].

> Let me reconsider trauma and massive transfusion contexts. Hypocalcemia is common and associated with coagulopathy and mortality, so I should maintain a low threshold to give calcium during resuscitation, particularly after multiple transfusions, while acknowledging that definitive outcome data from RCTs are still evolving and that ionized calcium is the most reliable marker in this setting [^c00c7792] [^1237891f].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality. Many recommendations rely on low to moderate quality evidence, so I will individualize decisions, document shared decision-making when choices are conditional, and remain open to adjusting therapy as new data emerge, especially in areas like PTH replacement and trauma resuscitation where practice is evolving [^3c770ed8] [^5b27264e].

Treat hypocalcemia by **correcting ionized calcium** with IV calcium gluconate for symptomatic or severe cases (10% solution, 1–2 g over 10 min, repeat as needed) [^27dcf7be], then transition to oral calcium (1–2 g elemental calcium/day) [^3c770ed8] and active vitamin D (calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg/day) for maintenance [^4b835cb8]. Always **correct hypomagnesemia first** (≥ 1.6 mg/dL) because it impairs calcium correction [^4b835cb8]. In chronic hypoparathyroidism, use calcium plus active vitamin D, and consider PTH replacement if refractory [^5b27264e] [^d6b16f8c]. Monitor calcium, magnesium, and renal function; avoid overcorrection to prevent hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis [^1efd065d].

## Acute management of symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia

### Indications for acute intervention

Acute intervention is indicated for **symptomatic hypocalcemia** — manifesting with tetany, seizures, paresthesia, or cardiac arrhythmias — or for **severe hypocalcemia**, typically defined as ionized calcium < 0.8 mmol/L (3.2 mg/dL) or total calcium < 7.5 mg/dL (1.875 mmol/L).

---

### Intravenous calcium therapy

- **First-line therapy**: IV calcium gluconate (preferred over calcium chloride due to lower risk of tissue necrosis) [^notfound].

- **Initial dose**: 10% calcium gluconate solution, 1–2 g (10–20 mL) IV over 10 minutes [^notfound].

- **Repeat dosing**: Repeat every 10–20 minutes until symptoms resolve or total calcium reaches ~8 mg/dL.

- **Continuous infusion**: Follow with a continuous infusion of 1–2 g in 1 L saline over 6–8 hours, titrated to maintain ionized calcium in the low-normal range (1.0–1.2 mmol/L).

- **Monitoring**: Continuous cardiac monitoring during IV calcium administration.

---

### Precautions and contraindications

Avoid **rapid IV push** because it can cause bradycardia or arrhythmias, and avoid **calcium chloride** through peripheral IVs due to high risk of tissue necrosis; reserve it for central access or cardiac arrest scenarios.

---

## Chronic management of hypocalcemia

### Oral calcium supplementation

- **First-line maintenance**: Oral calcium (usually calcium carbonate or citrate), 1–2 g elemental calcium/day in divided doses [^3c770ed8].

- **Dosing**: Titrate to maintain serum calcium in the low-normal range (8.0–8.5 mg/dL).

- **Adjuncts**: Add active vitamin D (calcitriol 0.25–0.5 mcg/day) to enhance intestinal calcium absorption, especially in hypoparathyroidism or chronic renal failure [^3c770ed8].

---

### Management of hypoparathyroidism

- **Conventional therapy**: Calcium plus active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) [^1efd065d].

- **Limitations**: High doses can cause hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and renal impairment [^1efd065d].

- **PTH replacement**: Recombinant PTH (rhPTH 1–84 or palopegteriparatide) is indicated for refractory cases or when conventional therapy is intolerable [^5b27264e] [^d6b16f8c].

---

### Management of hypocalcemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD)

In CKD, **KDIGO guidance** suggests tolerating mild, asymptomatic hypocalcemia to avoid calcium loading; correct symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia to prevent bone disease, hyperparathyroidism, and QT prolongation [^1a04fe87]. Management includes calcium supplementation, active vitamin D, and phosphate binders to control hyperphosphatemia and maintain calcium-phosphate balance [^a1be9275].

---

## Special considerations

### Hypomagnesemia

Always **correct hypomagnesemia first** (target ≥ 1.6 mg/dL), as it impairs PTH secretion and action and can cause refractory hypocalcemia [^4b835cb8].

---

### Drug-induced hypocalcemia

Denosumab can cause severe hypocalcemia, especially in CKD; **correct calcium before initiation** and monitor closely [^6896f72e]. Bisphosphonates can also cause hypocalcemia, particularly with vitamin D deficiency; **monitor and supplement as needed** [^0373de48].

---

### Pediatric considerations

Use **IV calcium gluconate** for symptomatic hypocalcemia at 10–20 mg/kg elemental calcium over 10 minutes, repeating as needed [^671227f5]. For maintenance, give oral calcium 30–75 mg/kg/day divided TID plus calcitriol 20–100 ng/kg/day divided BID–TID [^671227f5].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track **serum calcium, magnesium, phosphate, and renal function** regularly, and adjust therapy to maintain calcium in the low-normal range while avoiding hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis [^1efd065d].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | IV calcium gluconate | Symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia |
| 2 | Correct hypomagnesemia | Magnesium < 1.6 mg/dL |
| 3 | Oral calcium + active vitamin D | Chronic hypocalcemia |
| 4 | PTH replacement | Refractory hypoparathyroidism |
| 5 | Monitor calcium, magnesium, phosphate, renal function | Ongoing management |

---

Effective hypocalcemia management requires **rapid correction of acute symptoms** with IV calcium, followed by chronic therapy with oral calcium and active vitamin D, with etiology-specific adjustments and vigilant monitoring to prevent complications.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines [^0ce46239]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and absent or deficient PTH. This report presents a summary of current information about epidemiology, presentation, diagnosis, clinical features, and management and proposes guidelines to help clinicians diagnose, evaluate, and manage this disorder.

Participants

Participants in the First International Conference on the Management of Hypoparathyroidism represented a worldwide constituency with acknowledged interest and expertise in key basic, translational, and clinical aspects of hypoparathyroidism. Three Workshop Panels were constituted to address questions for presentation and discussion at the Conference held in Florence, Italy, May 7–9, 2015. At that time, a series of presentations were made, followed by in-depth discussions in an open forum. Each Workshop Panel also met in closed sessions to formulate the three evidence-based reports that accompany this summary statement. An Expert Panel then considered this information, developed summaries, guidelines, and a research agenda that constitutes this summary statement.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each Workshop Panel conducted an extensive literature search as noted in the individual manuscripts accompanying this report. All presentations were based upon the best peer-reviewed information taking into account the historical and current literature.

Consensus Process

This report represents the Expert Panel's synthesis of the conference material placed in a context designed to be relevant to clinicians and those engaged in cutting-edge studies of hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

This document not only provides a summary of our current knowledge but also places recent advances in its management into a context that should enhance future advances in our understanding of hypoparathyroidism.

Regarding medical management for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, more specifically with respect to management of hypocalcemia, KDIGO 2017 guidelines recommend to consider tolerating mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia (in the context of calcimimetic treatment) in adult patients with CKD, in order to avoid inappropriate calcium loading. Consider correcting symptomatic or severe hypocalcemia to prevent adverse consequences, such as bone disease, hyperparathyroidism, and QTc interval prolongation.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^bf3c8309]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can lead to serious complications in patients with advanced cancer. Bisphosphonates are effective treatments for both osteolytic and humoral hypercalcaemia of malignancy. In patients with persistent or relapsed hypercalcaemia of malignancy that fails to respond or no longer responds to bisphosphonate treatment, denosumab offers a therapeutic option and, as such, has been approved for this indication in the USA, Australia, Canada, and Russia. Denosumab is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than zoledronic acid and is more effective at preventing hypercalcaemia. It is possible that the incidence of hypercalcaemia of malignancy may further decrease as potent inhibitors of bone resorption are used more commonly and earlier in the course of management of patients with metastatic cancer. On the other hand, inhibitors of bone resorption have been shown to increase the risk of developing hypocalcaemia. This risk is higher with denosumab than with zoledronic acid; however, it can be managed by proper identification of at-risk patients and careful monitoring of those receiving these agents. Given the potential improvements to quality of life that inhibitors of bone resorption offer patients with advanced cancer, the benefits and risks associated with their use must be assessed. Further to this, physicians need to be aware of the measures they can take to counteract these risks and to find the balance between hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^b10be6bd]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) postoperative hypocalcemia — Recommendation 60 states: "To prevent and/or manage postoperative symptoms of hypocalcemia following total or completion thyroidectomy, a strategy for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation should be considered. (Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence)." Permanent hypoparathyroidism is defined by ongoing supplementation needs: "Permanent hypoparathyroidism is defined by a requirement for calcium and/or calcitriol 6 months following thyroidectomy; when measured off calcitriol, the PTH level is usually low or undetectable." Reported incidence from a systematic review is: "A 2014 systematic review of 115 studies of thyroidectomy reported a median transient hypocalcemia rate of 27% (range 19%–38%), and median permanent hypoparathyroidism rate of 1% (range 0%–3%)."

### A systematic review supporting the endocrine society clinical practice guideline on the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults [^a27d9cea]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy that is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To support development of the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults.

Methods

We searched multiple databases for studies that addressed 8 clinical questions prioritized by a guideline panel from the Endocrine Society. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess certainty of evidence.

Results

We reviewed 1949 citations, from which we included 21 studies. The risk of bias for most of the included studies was moderate. A higher proportion of patients who received bisphosphonate achieved resolution of hypercalcemia when compared to placebo. The incidence rate of adverse events was significantly higher in the bisphosphonate group. Comparing denosumab to bisphosphonate, there was no significant difference in the rate of patients who achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Two-thirds of patients with refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy who received denosumab following bisphosphonate therapy achieved resolution of hypercalcemia. Addition of calcitonin to bisphosphonate therapy did not affect the resolution of hypercalcemia, time to normocalcemia, or hypocalcemia. Only indirect evidence was available to address questions on the management of hypercalcemia in tumors associated with high calcitriol levels, refractory/recurrent hypercalcemia of malignancy following the use of bisphosphonates, and the use of calcimimetics in the treatment of hypercalcemia associated with parathyroid carcinoma. The certainty of the evidence to address all 8 clinical questions was low to very low.

Conclusion

The evidence summarized in this systematic review addresses the benefits and harms of treatments of hypercalcemia of malignancy. Additional information about patients' values and preferences, and other important decisional and contextual factors is needed to facilitate the development of clinical recommendations.

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^97f2d2f7]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Hypocalcaemia is common in critical illness but tends to normalize during the early days of admission to intensive care.

- In most cases normalization of calcium status is not associated with improved outcome, however mortality may be higher in severely hypocalcaemic patients who remain hypocalcemic on the fourth day of their admission.

- Calcium supplementation does not improve either calcium normalization or survival and a large randomized controlled trial is required to assess the effectiveness and side effects of this intervention.

- Albumin-adjusted calcium is a poor predictor of low ionized calcium in critical illness and should not be used in this setting.

- Low magnesium, sodium and albumin are independently associated with low ionized calcium and this should be considered in the overall management of each patient.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^671227f5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Management of postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism and its effect on hypocalcemia-related complications: a meta-analysis [^13ddd43a]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of this Meta-analysis is to evaluate the impact of different treatment strategies for early postoperative hypoparathyroidism on hypocalcemia-related complications and long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Data Sources

Embase.com, MEDLINE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched to September 20, 2022.

Review Methods

Articles reporting on adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy which specified a treatment strategy for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism were included. Random effect models were applied to obtain pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals. Primary outcome was the occurrence of major hypocalcemia-related complications. Secondary outcome was long-term hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Sixty-six studies comprising 67 treatment protocols and 51,096 patients were included in this Meta-analysis. In 8 protocols (3806 patients), routine calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was given to all patients directly after thyroidectomy. In 49 protocols (44,012 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D medication was only given to patients with biochemically proven postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In 10 protocols (3278 patients), calcium and/or active vitamin D supplementation was only initiated in case of clinical symptoms of hypocalcemia. No patient had a major complication due to postoperative hypocalcemia. The pooled proportion of long-term hypoparathyroidism was 2.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.0). There was no significant difference in the incidence of long-term hypoparathyroidism between the 3 supplementation groups.

Conclusions

All treatment strategies for postoperative hypocalcemia prevent major complications of hypocalcemia. The early postoperative treatment protocol for postthyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism does not seem to influence recovery of parathyroid function in the long term.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^ac90b227]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Vitamin D 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) testing — In the general adult population younger than age 50 years, we suggest against routine 25(OH)D testing (2 | ⊕◯◯◯). Technical remarks state that, in this population, 25(OH)D levels that provide outcome-specific benefits have not been established in clinical trials and that the panel suggests against routine screening for a 25(OH)D level to guide decision-making and against routine follow-up testing for 25(OH)D level to guide vitamin D dosing; this recommendation relates to generally healthy adults who do not otherwise have established indications for 25(OH)D testing (eg, hypocalcemia). Based on the panel's best estimates of treatment effects, the panel judged that the anticipated desirable effects of vitamin D are likely to be small at best and the anticipated undesirable effects are likely to be trivial, and panel members judged that empiric vitamin D would likely be acceptable to individuals in this age group, especially females with risk factors for developing osteoporosis.

### Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^8099acb8]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Post-thyroidectomy calcium management (Recommendation 32) specifies that patients need to be monitored for hypocalcemia, which is almost always transient; treatment with oral calcium and calcitriol is indicated if patients become symptomatic or have persistently prolonged hypocalcemia, and serum calcium levels should be monitored postoperatively with oral calcium and vitamin D administered to those with symptomatic hypocalcemia; chronic replacement therapy is indicated in patients who cannot be weaned from medication (Grade B Recommendation).

### Assessment and clinical course of hypocalcemia in critical illness [^3b63222a]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Hypocalcemia is a common finding in patients admitted to a general ICU. In this large cohort of patients, levels tended to normalize over the early days of admission and this was not associated with outcome. However, patients severely hypocalcemic on admission whose calcium failed to rebound to normal trended towards having a higher mortality and may be a target for intervention. Findings also indicate that calcium supplementation is not associated with calcium normalization or improved outcome, although this study was observational in nature. A large randomized controlled trial of calcium supplementation in critically ill patients with different degrees of hypocalcemia is required to determine the effectiveness and side effects of this treatment and its role in clinical practice.

### KDIGO 2017 clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone Disorder (CKD-MBD) [^61ee5457]. Kidney International Supplements (2017). Medium credibility.

KDIGO 2017 CKD‑MBD update — serum calcium management — In adult patients with CKD G3a–G5D, we suggest avoiding hypercalcemia (2C). In children with CKD G3a–G5D, we suggest maintaining serum calcium in the age‑appropriate normal range (2C). The 2009 recommendation suggested maintaining serum calcium in the normal range for CKD G3a–G5D (2D), and the rationale indicates that mild and asymptomatic hypocalcemia, for example with calcimimetic treatment, can be tolerated to avoid inappropriate calcium loading in adults.

### Endocrine and metabolic emergencies: hypocalcaemia [^5669b9bb]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common electrolyte disturbance, especially in the inpatient setting. There are a wide variety of causes of hypocalcaemia and correct management depends on the underlying diagnosis. However, acute hypocalcaemia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should be managed as a medical emergency. Chronic care of the hypocalcaemic patient is also briefly described, as this is an important opportunity to reduce further admissions related to both hypocalcaemic and hypercalcaemic presentations.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^acf27ecd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypoparathyroidism is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone.

Methods

This review is an evidence-based summary of hypoparathyroidism in terms of relevant pathophysiological, clinical, and therapeutic concepts.

Results

Many clinical manifestations of hypoparathyroidism are due to the lack of the physiological actions of parathyroid hormone on its 2 major target organs: the skeleton and the kidney. The skeleton is inactive, accruing bone without remodeling it. The kidneys lose the calcium-conserving actions of parathyroid hormone and, thus, excrete a greater fraction of calcium. Biochemical manifestations, besides hypocalcemia and low or undetectable levels of parathyroid hormone, include hyperphosphatemia and low levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Calcifications in the kidney, brain, and other soft tissues are common. Removal of, or damage to, the parathyroid glands at the time of anterior neck surgery is, by far, the most likely etiology. Autoimmune destruction of the parathyroid glands and other genetic causes represent most of the other etiologies. Conventional treatment with calcium and active vitamin D can maintain the serum calcium level but high doses may be required, adding to the risk of long-term soft tissue calcifications. The advent of replacement therapy with recombinant human PTH(1–84) represents a major step in the therapeutics of this disease.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of hypoparathyroidism have led to greater understanding of the disease itself and our approach to it.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^49e894cb]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Treatment and prevention of hypocalcaemia

Hypocalcaemia in patients with cancer can have severe consequences, whether occurring with or without the use of inhibitors of bone resorption, but responds well to calcium and vitamin D supplementation. Furthermore, when treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption is required for the management of metastatic bone disease, hypocalcaemia can usually be prevented by identification and appropriate management of at-risk patients. Case reports and retrospective analyses have identified a number of risk factors associated with the development of hypocalcaemia in those receiving inhibitors of bone resorption; these include vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency, osteoblastic metastases, prostate cancer, and low baseline blood calcium levels (Table 2). It is therefore important that vitamin D and calcium levels are assessed and supplementation initiated before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption. This evaluation is particularly important given the high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency among patients with metastatic cancer. Furthermore, all patients receiving inhibitors of bone resorption for the prevention of SREs should receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation; use of these supplements has been shown to lower the risk of developing hypocalcaemia by 27% and 40% in patients receiving zoledronic acid or denosumab, respectively. An interim analysis of an open-label observational study of treatment persistence in patients with cancer who were receiving denosumab to prevent SREs found that most patients (80%) received calcium and vitamin D supplementation at the start of denosumab treatment. Long-term follow-up persistence data, however, are not yet available. Previous reports suggest that adherence to calcium and vitamin D supplementation is low; patients should, therefore, be counselled on the importance of adequate calcium and vitamin D intake in order to improve adherence. Use of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active metabolite of vitamin D, might offer further advantages in the prevention and treatment of hypocalcaemia; however, trials are required to confirm this.

Although hypocalcaemia can occur at any time during treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, studies show that it often develops soon after treatment initiation; within 7 days, in some cases. Therefore, careful monitoring of at-risk patients after starting treatment is important to enable quick detection and resolution of hypocalcaemia. At-risk patients should also be educated about the symptoms of hypocalcaemia and encouraged to report any indicative symptoms. If hypocalcaemia occurs while a patient is receiving inhibitors of bone resorption, additional calcium and vitamin D supplementation and further monitoring are advised. Delaying the administration of inhibitors of bone resorption because of hypocalcaemia is rarely necessary.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^787109da]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

### Role of postoperative vitamin D and / or calcium routine supplementation in preventing hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b8941005]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Transient hypocalcemia is a frequent complication after total thyroidectomy. Routine postoperative administration of vitamin D and calcium can reduce the incidence of symptomatic postoperative hypocalcemia. We performed a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of this intervention. The primary aim was to evaluate the efficacy of routine postoperative oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation in preventing symptomatic post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. The second aim was to draw clear guidelines regarding prophylactic calcium and/or vitamin D therapy for patients after thyroidectomy.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials comparing the administration of vitamin D or its metabolites to calcium or no treatment in adult patients after thyroidectomy. The search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Google Scholar, and Web of Knowledge databases. Patients with a history of previous neck surgery, calcium supplementation, or renal impairment were excluded.

Results

Nine studies with 2,285 patients were included: 22 in the vitamin D group, 580 in the calcium group, 792 in the vitamin D and calcium group, and 891 in the no intervention group, with symptomatic hypocalcemia incidences of 4.6%, 14%, 14%, and 20.5%, respectively. Subcomparisons demonstrated that the incidences of postoperative hypocalcemia were 10.1% versus 18.8% for calcium versus no intervention and 6.8% versus 25.9% for vitamin D and calcium versus no intervention. The studies showed a significant range of variability in patients' characteristics.

Conclusions

A significant decrease in postoperative hypocalcemia was identified in patients who received routine supplementation of oral calcium or vitamin D. The incidence decreased even more with the combined administration of both supplements. Based on this analysis, we recommend oral calcium for all patients following thyroidectomy, with the addition of vitamin D for high-risk individuals.

### Meta-analysis of routine calcium / vitamin D3 supplementation versus serum calcium level-based strategy to prevent postoperative hypocalcaemia after thyroidectomy [^5ef9d0a6]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The aim was to assess the effectiveness of routine administration of calcium ± vitamin D3 compared with a serum calcium level-based strategy to prevent symptomatic hypocalcaemia after thyroidectomy.

Methods

RCTs comparing routine supplementation of calcium ± vitamin D3 with treatment based on serum calcium levels measured after total thyroidectomy, published between 1980 and 2017, were identified in MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS and Google Scholar databases. Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Risk differences were calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. Meta-regression and cumulative meta-analysis were used to explore the best therapeutic approach.

Results

Fifteen studies with 3037 patients were included, and seven treatment comparisons were made. Routine supplementation with calcium + vitamin D3 offered a lower risk of symptomatic (risk difference (RD) -0·25, 95 per cent c.i. -0·32 to -0·18) and biochemical (RD -0·24, -0·31 to -0·17) hypocalcaemia than treatment based on measurement of calcium levels. The number needed to treat was 4 (95 per cent c.i. 3 to 6) for symptomatic hypocalcaemia. No publication bias was found; although heterogeneity was high for some comparisons, sensitivity analysis did not change the main results.

Conclusion

Routine postoperative administration of calcium + vitamin D3 is effective in decreasing the rate of symptomatic and biochemical hypocalcaemia.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^20b03c97]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

Calcium Metabolism In Cancer and Hypercalcaemia Of Malignancy

The balance between bone formation and resorption may be disrupted in patients with cancer, leading either to increased bone resorption, calcium release, and possibly hypercalcaemia, or to increased bone formation, sequestration of calcium, and possibly hypocalcaemia. In adults, hypercalcaemia of malignancy is most common in patients with tumours that produce factors that induce osteoclast activation and enhance bone resorption. Impaired renal function and increased renal tubular calcium resorption may further affect calcium levels.

Treatment Of Hypercalcaemia Of Malignancy

Inhibitors of bone resorption, first the bisphosphonates and, later, denosumab, have been shown to be effective in hypercalcaemia treatment. Bisphosphonates (which are administered intravenously) are approved for hypercalcaemia of malignancy and are the current mainstay of treatment, whereas denosumab (which is administered subcutaneously) may offer an option for patients who do not respond to bisphosphonates or suffer from renal insufficiency.

Hypocalcaemia

TREATMENT AND PREVENTION: Hypocalcaemia is most common in patients with prostate cancer and osteoblastic bone metastases, but can occur in patients with a variety of tumour types who are receiving inhibitors of bone resorption. While patients often respond to calcium and vitamin D supplementation, prevention should be the aim; at-risk patients should be identified before starting treatment with inhibitors of bone resorption, be closely monitored during at least the first few months of treatment, and receive concomitant calcium and vitamin D supplementation unless hypercalcaemia is present.

Conclusion

Both hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia can be serious if left untreated. It is therefore important that patients with cancer are closely monitored and receive adequate prevention and treatment measures to maintain normal blood calcium levels.

### Hypoparathyroidism [^97ef2e0a]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is a disease characterized by inadequately low circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulting in low calcium levels and increased phosphate levels in the blood. Symptoms of the disease result from increased neuromuscular irritability caused by hypocalcaemia and include tingling, muscle cramps and seizures. The most common cause of the disease is inadvertent removal of, or injury to, the parathyroid glands during neck surgery, followed by genetic, idiopathic and autoimmune aetiologies. Conventional treatment includes activated vitamin D and/or calcium supplements, but this treatment does not fully replace the functions of PTH and can lead to short-term problems (such as hypocalcaemia, hypercalcaemia and increased urinary calcium excretion) and long-term complications (which include nephrocalcinosis, kidney stones and brain calcifications). PTH replacement has emerged as a new treatment option. Clinical trials using human PTH(1–34) and PTH(1–84) showed that this treatment was safe and effective in studies lasting up to 6 years. Recombinant human PTH(1–84) has been approved in the United States and Europe for the management of hypoparathyroidism; however, its effect on long-term complications is still being evaluated. Clinical practice guidelines, which describe the consensus of experts in the field, have been published and recognize the need for more research to optimize care. In this Primer, we summarize current knowledge of the prevalence, pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of hypoparathyroidism.

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^0edf4531]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1efd065d]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventing signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, maintaining serum calcium levels in the low normal range or slightly below normal, preventing hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, keeping the calcium-phosphate product below 55 mg 2 /dL 2, and preventing renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis) and other extraskeletal calcifications are the main objectives of treatment. Conventional therapy of HypoPTH includes not only the emergency management of acute and severe hypocalcemia with IV administration of calcium gluconate, but also the management of chronic hypocalcemia with calcium, calcitriol, as well as magnesium supplements, whenever required. The normalization of serum calcium levels through traditional treatment involving calcium and active vitamin D fails to fully restore normal calcium homeostasis physiology. Instead, it leads to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia because it lacks renal calcium reabsorption and phosphaturia typically stimulated by PTH. Consequently, this standard approach heightens the risk of extraskeletal calcifications and long-term kidney complications. Moreover, the absence of PTH results in abnormal bone remodeling and contributes to reduced quality of life for many hypoparathyroidism patients despite adhering to conventional therapy. These challenges have prompted scientific exploration into alternative therapeutic avenues. Since the mid-1990s, synthetic PTH (1–34) has been proposed for the management of refractory HypoPTH, with promising results. rhPTH (1–84) has been approved for the treatment of adults with HypoPTH refractory to conventional therapy, with the exception of patients who have autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.

### Hypercalcaemia and hypocalcaemia: finding the balance [^3ace3603]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2017). Low credibility.

In patients with severe hypercalcaemia, the hormone calcitonin is an important adjunctive treatment that acts within 4 h of administration and can be used to immediately reduce calcium plasma concentrations. Calcitonin reduces calcium concentration by inhibiting osteoclast activity and increasing renal calcium clearance. It should be given at a dose of 4–8 units/kg subcutaneously or intramuscularly every 6–12 h; duration of dosing is, however, limited to 48 h owing to the development of tachyphylaxis and decreased responsiveness.

Currently, the standard treatment for hypercalcaemia of malignancy is rehydration combined with intravenous bisphosphonate therapy, with zoledronic acid preferred over pamidronate. In some countries, denosumab is approved for use in patients with bisphosphonate-refractory hypercalcaemia. In addition, calcitonin may be useful for patients with severe or life-threatening hypercalcaemia because it causes a rapid, albeit transient, decrease of high serum calcium levels.

(Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence)." Practical dosing and adjuncts include: "Oral calcium carbonate is widely available without prescription, usually well tolerated, and a typical postoperative dose is 1–2 g, 2–3 times daily with prompt dose escalation as required for symptom relief (excess ingestion is readily excreted)." If symptoms persist with oral calcium, "oral calcitriol should also be initiated, at a typical dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mcg twice daily," and laboratory evaluation can guide management: "Phosphorus level can help to distinguish between bone hunger (normal PO4) and hypoparathyroidism (elevated PO4). Magnesium and 25-OH vitamin D levels should also be checked." For severe cases, infusion is preferred: "Intravenous boluses of calcium are not recommended due to their short-lived effect; infusions of calcium over several hours are more effective and preferred."

### Is calcium supplementation always needed in patients with hypoparathyroidism? [^8df6c69a]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral calcium salts are recommended for the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), although dosimetry is variable between individual patients and clinicians. However, patient feedback on calcium salts can be negative, particularly due to gastrointestinal side effects and hypercalciuria-related complications. We begin with a clinical case of a HypoPT patient taking oral calcium salts following thyroid surgery, who requested support in reducing her dose of these with a view to stopping entirely. To evaluate her request, we first describe the usual treatment of HypoPT according to current guidance and then present data from (a) a case note review of a cohort of 24 HypoPT patients managed with a "no calcium" treatment regimen by single physician (b) a comprehensive online survey of HypoPT patients' treatment and experiences (n = 330). The case note review found that target range serum calcium levels were successfully achieved in all 24 patients since transitioning to a "no calcium" regimen, without any breakthrough hypocalcaemia-related symptoms, the development of new renal stones, the occurrence of calcium-related hospital admissions or the finding of significant hypercalciuria. The online survey identified 36% of HypoPT patients who continued to take activated vitamin D, but had discontinued calcium supplements. HypoPT patients not currently taking calcium reported a significantly lower prevalence of adverse effects and outcomes, both compared with their previous experiences whilst taking calcium and also compared with the 64% of patients who continued to take oral calcium. We conclude that, subject to methodological limitations, there are significant issues of tolerability arising from conventional calcium-based treatment regimens for patients with chronic HypoPT. For selected patients, it may be reasonable to facilitate a managed therapeutic transition to "no calcium" regimen, and we also propose that calcium-based regimes be prospectively evaluated against calcium-free (or calcium-low) alternatives.

### Assessment and management of patients with abnormal calcium [^fc3276ac]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Calcium is essential for homeostasis, and normocalcemia should be maintained strictly during the perioperative period. The biochemistry of calcium equilibrium results from the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid glands, which detect changes in calcium concentrations and initiate the proper response. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia is a common metabolic derangement that is often discovered on routine serum screening. The most common etiologies are primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer. Increasingly, parathyroidectomy is the preferred therapy for primary hyperparathyroidism. Severe hypercalcemia ("hypercalcemic crisis") should be managed aggressively with a combination of intravenous fluids, steroids, bisphosphonates, and calcitonin. Some of these patients may require an urgent parathyroidectomy for calcium control. Hypocalcemia needs to be verified, as many cases of hypocalcemia are the artifact of hypoalbuminemia. Severe hypocalcemia occurs after subtotal or total parathyroidectomy with auto transplantation as well as after massive resuscitation or blood transfusion. Strategies aimed at correcting calcium concentrations depend on the severity of symptomatology. If symptoms are mild, oral calcium supplementation can be given; otherwise, intravenous calcium should be administered.

### Association between hypocalcemia and mortality in trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e4439761]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Hypocalcemia in trauma patients is associated with increased mortality. Recent data highlight the integration of hypocalcemia into the trauma lethal triad — comprising hypothermia, acidosis, and coagulopathy — as a predictor of prognosis and mortality in critically injured patients. Based on our findings, we suggest that hypocalcemia should be closely monitored regardless of the history of transfusion. Further prospective evaluation is warranted to validate the benefits of early calcium administration in trauma patients.

### Medical management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism [^3a63397d]. Endocrine Practice (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a clinical update on the management of hypoparathyroidism with focus on postsurgical hypoparathyroidism.

Methods

Using PubMed, English-language literature was searched related to management of hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. We discuss the incidence, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, early diagnosis, and treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Results

Hypoparathyroidism is a well-recognized complication after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Transient hypoparathyroidism occurs in 10% of patients who undergo total thyroidectomy. Less than half of patients who develop transient hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery develop permanent hypoparathyroidism. Postsurgical hypocalcemia resulting from inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion could cause neurologic complications and respiratory compromise. Calcium supplements and vitamin D analogues effectively treat hypocalcemia associated with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Measurement of PTH after thyroid and parathyroid surgery allows early identification of patients likely to require calcium supplements and vitamin D analogue therapy. Early identification and appropriate management of postsurgical hypoparathyroidism prevent hypocalcemia-related complications and allow patients to be discharged from the hospital earlier. Patients who develop permanent hypoparathyroidism should receive appropriate follow-up care to monitor for long-term complications related to supplemental therapy. PTH replacement therapy is currently being evaluated for the treatment of transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism.

Conclusions

A multidisciplinary approach involving an endocrinologist and surgeon is imperative to reduce the morbidity associated with hypoparathyroidism after thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Supplemental therapy with calcium and vitamin D analogues is standard. New drugs currently in clinical trials offer promising treatment options.

### Denosumab (Conexxence) [^c8d8ceec]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Changes

Denosumab products can cause severe hypocalcemia and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Conexxence. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to14 days after Conexxence injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e., eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2] including dialysis-dependent patients are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following denosumab products administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk.

To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D prior to decisions regarding Conexxence treatment. Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present. Monitor serum calcium weekly for the first month after Conexxence administration and monthly thereafter. Instruct all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those who are dialysis-dependent, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining serum calcium levels with adequate calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation. Treatment with Conexxence in these patients should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is experienced in diagnosis and management of CKD-MBD.

### Management of hypoparathyroidism: present and future [^44ee550f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Conventional management of hypoparathyroidism has focused upon maintaining the serum calcium with oral calcium and active vitamin D, often requiring high doses and giving rise to concerns about long-term consequences including renal and brain calcifications. Replacement therapy with PTH has recently become available. This paper summarizes the results of the findings and recommendations of the Working Group on Management of Hypoparathyroidism.

Evidence Acquisition

Contributing authors reviewed the literature regarding physiology, pathophysiology, and nutritional aspects of hypoparathyroidism, management of acute hypocalcemia, clinical aspects of chronic management, and replacement therapy of hypoparathyroidism with PTH peptides. PubMed and other literature search engines were utilized.

Evidence Synthesis

Under normal circumstances, interactions between PTH and active vitamin D along with the dynamics of calcium and phosphorus absorption, renal tubular handing of those ions, and skeletal responsiveness help to maintain calcium homeostasis and skeletal health. In the absence of PTH, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and skeleton are all affected, leading to hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, reduced bone remodeling, and an inability to conserve filtered calcium. Acute hypocalcemia can be a medical emergency presenting with neuromuscular irritability. The recent availability of recombinant human PTH (1–84) has given hope that management of hypoparathyroidism with the missing hormone in this disorder will provide better control and reduced needs for calcium and vitamin D.

Conclusions

Hypoparathyroidism is associated with abnormal calcium and skeletal homeostasis. Control with calcium and active vitamin D can be a challenge. The availability of PTH (1–84) replacement therapy may usher new opportunities for better control with reduced supplementation requirements.

### Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0373de48]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Treatment regimens for hypercalcemia of malignancy — intravenous bisphosphonates include pamidronate and zoledronic acid. Pamidronate is given 60 to 90 mg IV over 2 to 24 hours and can be repeated every 2 to 3 weeks; effects last 7 to 14 days and may last 2 to 4 weeks, and it normalizes calcium in 60% to 70% of patients, with adverse events including acute-phase response, hypocalcemia, possible renal insufficiency if decreased glomerular filtration rate, and rare atypical femoral fractures/ONJ. Zoledronic acid is dosed 3 to 4 mg IV over 15 to 30 minutes, can be repeated in 7 days if desirable calcium level not achieved and every 3 to 4 weeks thereafter, yields 4 to 6 weeks of effect and normalizes calcium in 80% to 90% of patients, but may cause kidney damage especially if glomerular filtration rate < 30 to 35 mL/ minute and requires dose adjustment if glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min with administration over 30 to 60 minutes.

Post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism — incidence variability and definitional criteria are outlined as follows: Hypoparathyroidism is the most common complication of bilateral and re-operative thyroid operations. Reported rates are influenced by different time points after surgery, diverse electrolyte supplementation protocols, variable operation aggressiveness and surgeon expertise, and by variable use of clinical criteria including symptomatic versus asymptomatic hypocalcemia, biochemical criteria (serum parathyroid hormone [PTH] and/or calcium and/or ionized calcium), and treatment criteria (requirement for calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation). According to a recent meta-analysis, the median incidence of temporary and permanent hypoparathyroidism following thyroidectomy ranges from 19% to 38% and 0% to 3%, respectively.

### Denosumab (Jubbonti) [^e366fe82]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Severe Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Changes

Denosumab products can cause severe hypocalcemia and fatal cases have been reported. Pre‑existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Jubbonti. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g., history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to 14 days after Jubbonti injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e., eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2] including dialysis-dependent patients are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following denosumab products administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk.

To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25 (OH)2vitamin D prior to decisions regarding Jubbonti treatment. Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present. Monitor serum calcium weekly for the first month after Jubbonti administration and monthly thereafter. Instruct all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those who are dialysis-dependent, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining serum calcium levels with adequate calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation. Treatment with Jubbonti in these patients should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is experienced in diagnosis and management of CKD-MBD

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^f7747f23]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association postoperative hypoparathyroidism — risk factors, thresholds, and management are summarized as follows: Hypoparathyroidism occurs when a low intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level is accompanied by hypocalcemia. Risk factors for post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism include bilateral thyroid operations, autoimmune thyroid disease, central neck dissection, substernal goiter, surgeon inexperience, and malabsorptive conditions. Measurement of intraoperative or early postoperative PTH levels following thyroidectomy can help guide patient management, and in general, a postoperative PTH level ≤ 15 pg/mL indicates increased risk for acute hypoparathyroidism. Effective management of mild to moderate potential or actual postoperative hypoparathyroidism can be achieved by administering either empiric/prophylactic oral calcium and vitamin D, selective oral calcium and vitamin D based on rapid postoperative PTH level(s), or serial serum calcium levels as a guide for supplementation; for more severe hypocalcemia, inpatient management may be necessary. Permanent hypoparathyroidism has long-term consequences for both objective and subjective well-being, and should be prevented whenever possible.

### Preoperative calcium or vitamin D supplement in thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^942dfeb7]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review and meta‐analysis was to assess the role of preoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy.

Data Sources

The search for randomized controlled trials was performed in the OVID Medline and Embase databases.

Review Methods

The last search was made on September 16, 2024. Three independent reviewers evaluated full‐text articles from relevant reports based on eligibility criteria. The quality of the included studies was assessed by two reviewers according to the ROB 2 tool.

Results

This systematic review and meta‐analysis considered 13 studies with 1504 participants. There were positive results in treatment outcomes including the mean postoperative calcium level (MD, 0.30 mg/dL: 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.44); the 48 h of postoperative hypocalcemia (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.62); the postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24 to 0.62); the IV calcium supplementation (OR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.58); and length of hospital stays (MD, −0.29; 95% CI, −0.51 to −0.07) as compared to the control group. Readmission rates showed no significant differences between the groups (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.01 to 3.08).

Conclusions

Preoperative calcium and vitamin D supplementation in patients who underwent total thyroidectomy results in reduction of postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia. The finding is critical because it offers a feasible and effective solution that could improve patient care while potentially reducing the burden of numerous blood tests during the postoperative period.

### Is therapy with calcium and vitamin D and parathyroid autotransplantation useful in total thyroidectomy for preventing hypocalcemia? [^f1b52e42]. Head & Neck (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Routine calcium and vitamin D administration and routine autotransplantation of parathyroid glands can prevent hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy.

Methods

Routine autotransplantation of 1 or more parathyroid glands and oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation was used in 252 patients.

Results

One, 2, or 3 parathyroid glands were autotransplanted in 223, 27, and 2 patients, respectively. Routine oral calcium and vitamin D was administered in postoperative period in all patients. Postoperative hypocalcemia occurred in 17%, of whom 1.6% had minor symptoms related to hypocalcemia. No patient developed permanent hypocalcemia during the follow-up period. The postoperative stay was 1 day in 93.6% of the cases. The incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia and hospital stay was higher in patients who underwent autotransplantation of more than 1 parathyroid gland.

Conclusions

Routine oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation and autotransplantation of at least 1 parathyroid gland effectively reduced symptomatic hypocalcemia and permanent hypoparathyroidism in total thyroidectomy.

### Do we overtreat post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia? [^3f08562a]. World Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Calcium and calcitriol supplements are standard for patients with post-thyroidectomy serum calcium < 2.0 mmol/L; however, we wondered whether we overtreat post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia with intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH). We examined quick-intraoperative intact PTH (QiPTH) assay results to find a suitable treatment for post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Methods

We studied 197 bilateral thyroidectomy patients. Post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia was defined as serum calcium < 2.0 mmol/L. A QiPTH assay was done 15 min after the thyroidectomy (QiPTH(15)), and hypoparathyroidism was defined as PTH < 15 ng/L. The QiPTH(15) assay was used to determine the effects of the thyroidectomy on postoperative PTH levels and serum calcium levels. The natural course and medical response of hypocalcemia was observed in patients with a QiPTH(15) ≥ 15 ng/L.

Results

None of the 187 patients with a QiPTH(15) ≥ 15 ng/L developed postoperative hypoparathyroidism. However, 79 patients developed transient hypocalcemia, and those with Graves' disease (47/94) had significantly (p < 0.05) higher hypocalcemia than those with non-Graves' thyroid disease (32/93). The serum calcium of these 79 patients declined to its lowest level within the first postoperative 18 h. Seven patients with serum calcium < 1.75 mmol/L were successfully treated using a calcium supplement only, and the others recovered spontaneously without treatment.

Conclusions

When post-thyroidectomy QiPTH(15) was ≥ 15 ng/L, postoperative hypoparathyroidism was excluded, but more than one-third of the patients developed post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. However, most of them recovered without treatment, and a few recovered after taking only a calcium supplement. We believe that using QiPTH(15) results as a guide will prevent overtreatment of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

### The American Association of Endocrine Surgeons guidelines for the definitive surgical management of thyroid disease in adults [^19a37e9c]. AAES (2020). High credibility.

Calcium supplementation after thyroidectomy — risk and protocols indicate that because 2 contralateral parathyroid glands remain in situ, there is no risk of hypocalcemia with initial lobectomy and no need to measure postoperative calcium. After total or completion thyroidectomy, common approaches include postoperative serum calcium measurement with selective calcium ± calcitriol supplementation, routine prophylactic calcium ± calcitriol for all patients, or PTH-guided early supplementation. In a prospective cohort study of > 400 patients, PTH-based selective dosing of calcium and vitamin D reduced symptoms of hypocalcemia and critically low calcium levels.

### Denosumab (Prolia) [^6896f72e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Severe Hypocalcemia and Mineral Metabolism Changes

Prolia can cause severe hypocalcemia and fatal cases have been reported. Pre-existing hypocalcemia must be corrected prior to initiating therapy with Prolia. Adequately supplement all patients with calcium and vitamin D [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

In patients without advanced chronic kidney disease who are predisposed to hypocalcemia and disturbances of mineral metabolism (e.g. history of hypoparathyroidism, thyroid surgery, parathyroid surgery, malabsorption syndromes, excision of small intestine, treatment with other calcium-lowering drugs), assess serum calcium and mineral levels (phosphorus and magnesium) 10 to14 days after Prolia injection. In some postmarketing cases, hypocalcemia persisted for weeks or months and required frequent monitoring and intravenous and/or oral calcium replacement, with or without vitamin D.

Patients with Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease [i.e., eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2] including dialysis-dependent patients are at greater risk for severe hypocalcemia following Prolia administration. Severe hypocalcemia resulting in hospitalization, life-threatening events and fatal cases have been reported. The presence of underlying chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD, renal osteodystrophy) markedly increases the risk of hypocalcemia. Concomitant use of calcimimetic drugs may also worsen hypocalcemia risk.

To minimize the risk of hypocalcemia in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, evaluate for the presence of chronic kidney disease mineral and bone disorder with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), serum calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D, and 1,25(OH)2vitamin D prior to decisions regarding Prolia treatment. Consider also assessing bone turnover status (serum markers of bone turnover or bone biopsy) to evaluate the underlying bone disease that may be present. Monitor serum calcium weekly for the first month after Prolia administration and monthly thereafter. Instruct all patients with advanced chronic kidney disease, including those who are dialysis-dependent, about the symptoms of hypocalcemia and the importance of maintaining serum calcium levels with adequate calcium and activated vitamin D supplementation. Treatment with Prolia in these patients should be supervised by a healthcare provider who is experienced in diagnosis and management of CKD-MBD.

### Hypocalcemia in trauma patients: a systematic review [^1237891f]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, hypocalcemia is a common finding in shocked trauma patients, in whom death can occur rapidly. Review of current published literature indicates a focus on transfusion related hypocalcemia or its association with mortality without accounting for prior blood product administration. This systematic review has identified moderate quality evidence on the association between transfusion-independent hypocalcemia and mortality, blood transfusion needs, and coagulopathy. However, further prospective trials are needed to corroborate this relationship and identify possible therapeutic measures that might mitigate the aforementioned outcomes.

### Calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone for managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism [^a5cb0b82]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-surgical hypoparathyroidism is a common complication after thyroid surgery. The incidence is likely to increase given the rising trend in the annual number of thyroid operations being performed. Measures to prevent post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism including different surgical techniques and prophylactic calcium and vitamin D supplements have been extensively studied. The management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism however has not been extensively evaluated. Routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements in the postoperative period may reduce the risk of symptoms, temporary hypocalcaemia and hospital stay. However, this may lead to overtreatment and has no effect on long-term hypoparathyroidism. Current recommendations on the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism is based on low-quality evidence. Existing guidelines do not often distinguish between surgical and non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, and transient and long-term disease. The aim of this systematic review was to summarise evidence on the use of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in the management of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. In addition, we aimed to highlight deficiencies in the current literature and stimulate further work in this field.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effects of calcium, vitamin D and recombinant parathyroid hormone in managing post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase as well as ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov. The date of the last search for all databases was 17 December 2018 (except Embase, which was last searched on 21 December 2017). No language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised control trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) examining the effects of calcium, vitamin D or recombinant parathyroid hormone in people with temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full texts for relevance.

Main Results

Database searches yielded a total of 1751 records. We retrieved potentially relevant full texts and excluded articles on the following basis: not a RCT or CCT; intervention, comparator or both did not match prespecified criteria; non-surgical causes of hypoparathyroidism, and studies on prevention. None of the articles was eligible for inclusion in the systematic review.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review highlights a gap in the current literature and the lack of high-quality evidence in the management of post-thyroidectomy temporary and long-term hypoparathyroidism. Further research focusing on clinically relevant outcomes is needed to examine the effects of current treatments in the management of temporary and long-term post-thyroidectomy hypocalcaemia.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^abcfc4ee]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

KDIGO 2017 CKD-MBD — risk–benefit rationale for calcitriol or vitamin D analogs emphasizes hypercalcemia risk without cardiac benefit and limits use to severe, progressive SHPT. Two trials "demonstrated a significantly increased risk of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol, compared with placebo, in the absence of beneficial effects on surrogate cardiac endpoints," leading the Work Group to state that "the use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs should be reserved for only severe and progressive SHPT." The key evidence for changes in Recommendation 4.2.2 predominantly came from these trials.

### Evidence for the role of perioperative PTH measurement after total thyroidectomy as a predictor of hypocalcemia [^cfc049aa]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Total thyroidectomy is now accepted worldwide as the standard surgical procedure for the management of benign bilateral nodular thyroid disease. Hypocalcemia is the most common complication of that procedure and a variety of strategies for diagnosing and managing post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia have been advocated. Increasingly, the use of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) has been utilized to try to predict those patients at risk of developing post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Methods

A Medline search of English language literature was performed and we reviewed the evidence in relation to the following three issues: the accuracy of PTH in predicting hypocalcemia, the optimal timing for measuring PTH, and the routine use of oral calcium supplements.

Results

Post-thyroidectomy PTH levels accurately predict hypocalcemia but lack 100% accuracy. Progressive and severe hypocalcemia is unlikely in the setting of a normal PTH level and hence PTH can be cautiously used to facilitate discharge within 24 h for many patients. In addition, PTH levels can be used to implement early treatment with calcium and/or vitamin D supplements to reduce the incidence and severity of hypocalcemia. A single PTH measurement taken any time from 10 min to several hours postoperative will provide equally accurate results for predicting post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. Routine use of oral calcium supplements may reduce the incidence and severity of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia.

Conclusion

Postoperative PTH can be used to stratify the risk of patients developing hypocalcemia after thyroidectomy. In addition, the routine use of oral calcium supplements can lead to decreased incidence and severity of post-thyroidectomy hypocalcemia. Protocols based on PTH and the routine use of oral calcium supplements can lead to improved patient outcomes after thyroidectomy.

### Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [^0a5c36eb]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management options for benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

Methods

We present a systematic summary of benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia after review of the current available literature.

Results

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by lifelong hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is important clinically because it can be difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. It is a benign condition, and affected patients should be advised against parathyroidectomy. The incidence of complications associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, like osteopenia and nephrolithiasis, is not increased in persons with benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and the rates are similar to those in the general population. Rarely, a severe form of this disease, namely neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in infants with homozygous CASR mutations.

Conclusions

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a small but important cause of hypercalcemia, especially in the younger population. Hypercalcemia persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. It is important to diagnose this condition, not only in the index case but also in family members, because these patients should be advised against surgical intervention.

### Preoperative calcium or vitamin D supplement in thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^a249b946]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Trial Registration and Reporting

This systematic review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42021278859) and was exempted by the Siriraj Institutional Review Board (registration number 189/2565(IRB4)). The meta‐analysis was reported according to the 2020 Statement of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA).

Eligibility Criteria

Eligibility criteria were RCTs published in the English language that investigated the relationship between preoperative calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation and postoperative hypocalcemia. The included participants could be adult or pediatric patients with thyroid malignancy or benign thyroid disease. All participants underwent total thyroidectomy or complete thyroidectomy with or without neck dissection.

We exclude studies focused on patients who underwent partial thyroidectomy, concurrent planned parathyroidectomy of all glands, prior neck dissection, or laryngectomy. Those who were treated with corticosteroids, furosemide, bisphosphate, or routine intravenous calcium supplements due to their underlying diseases that could influence their serum calcium level were also excluded. Studies that were not original and those whose full texts were not accessible were also disregarded.

Search Strategy

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of preoperative calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation in patients who underwent total/completion thyroidectomy in preventing postoperative hypocalcemia. The PICOS framework of this study consisted of the following:
Population: Patients underwent a total/complete thyroidectomy.
Intervention: Preoperative vitamin D and/or calcium supplements.
Comparison: No treatment or placebo.
Outcomes: Postoperative serum calcium level.
Study designs: Randomized control trials.

We performed searches in two databases, including OVID Medline and Embase. A manual search was also carried out. Keywords included "total thyroidectomy," "bilateral thyroid surgery," "calcium supplement," and "vitamin D supplement" (Tables S1 and S2). Duplicate records were removed using Endnote version 20 prior to the screening phase. The last search was made on September 16, 2024.

### The diamond of death: hypocalcemia in trauma and resuscitation [^c00c7792]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early recognition and management of hemorrhage, damage control resuscitation, and blood product administration have optimized management of severe trauma. Recent data suggest hypocalcemia exacerbates the ensuing effects of coagulopathy in trauma.

Objective

This narrative review of available literature describes the physiology and role of calcium in trauma resuscitation. Authors did not perform a systematic review or meta-analysis.

Discussion

Calcium is a divalent cation found in various physiologic forms, specifically the bound, inactive state and the unbound, physiologically active state. While calcium plays several important physiologic roles in multiple organ systems, the negative hemodynamic effects of hypocalcemia are crucial to address in trauma patients. The negative ramifications of hypocalcemia are intrinsically linked to components of the lethal triad of acidosis, coagulopathy, and hypothermia. Hypocalcemia has direct and indirect effects on each portion of the lethal triad, supporting calcium's potential position as a fourth component in this proposed lethal diamond. Trauma patients often present hypocalcemic in the setting of severe hemorrhage secondary to trauma, which can be worsened by necessary transfusion and resuscitation. The critical consequences of hypocalcemia in the trauma patient have been repeatedly demonstrated with the associated morbidity and mortality. It remains poorly defined when to administer calcium, though current data suggest that earlier administration may be advantageous.

Conclusions

Calcium is a key component of trauma resuscitation and the coagulation cascade. Recent data portray the intricate physiologic reverberations of hypocalcemia in the traumatically injured patient; however, future research is needed to further guide the management of these patients.

### Preoperative calcium or vitamin D supplement in thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^0774c0d7]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta‐analysis considered 13 studies with 1504 participants. There were positive results in treatment outcomes including the mean postoperative calcium level, the 48 h of postoperative hypocalcemia; the postoperative symptomatic hypocalcemia; the IV calcium supplementation rates; and the length of hospital stays compared with the control group. However, the readmission rates did not demonstrate statistical significance. Subgroup analysis revealed that the intervention group had a higher mean postoperative calcium level than the control group for the combined preoperative and postoperative supplementation subgroups and the combined calcium and vitamin D supplementation subgroup. The summary of the effects of interventions is provided in Table II.

Table II
Summary of effects of interventions.

To our knowledge, this is the first and largest meta‐analysis of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and received preoperative calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation. Khatiwada et al. and Casey et al. published a qualitative systematic review on this subject recently. In our review, every trial included in both articles has already been assessed. We decided to do a meta‐analysis despite the presence of heterogeneity because we believe it can still provide useful insights by statistically summarizing the findings of different studies. This quantitative synthesis may be useful in the identification of patterns, trends, and potential sources of heterogeneity. Additionally, we hope that it might advance our understanding of the subject along with improving our clinical practice.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^752c52f4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

Chapter 4.3: treatment of bone with bisphosphonates, other osteoporosis medications, and growth hormone — in patients with CKD G3a–G5D with biochemical abnormalities of CKD-MBD and low BMD and/or fragility fractures, we suggest that treatment choices take into account the magnitude and reversibility of the biochemical abnormalities and the progression of CKD, with consideration of a bone biopsy (2D). Recommendation 3.2.2 now addresses the indications for a bone biopsy prior to antiresorptive and other osteoporosis therapies, the original Recommendation 4.3.4 has been removed, and Recommendation 4.3.3 has broadened from CKD G3a to G3b to CKD G3a to G5D. When such treatment choices are considered, their specific side effects must also be taken into account (e.g., antiresorptives will exacerbate low bone turnover, denosumab may induce significant hypocalcemia), and the risk of their administration must be weighed against the accuracy of the diagnosis of the underlying bone phenotype.

### Preoperative calcium or vitamin D supplement in thyroidectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7a08064]. The Laryngoscope (2025). Medium credibility.

As stated previously, the subgroup analysis of various related factors demonstrated significant effects on the mean postoperative calcium level. This information could benefit clinical implementation to achieve optimal outcomes. However, it is important to note that there appears to be weak evidence suggesting that preoperative calcium alone plays a significant role in improving postoperative findings. Our analysis revealed that calcium supplementation alone did not provide significant benefits, and there was not much difference between vitamin D alone and vitamin D combined with calcium supplementation. This finding underscores the importance of considering vitamin D supplementation, either alone or in combination with calcium, rather than calcium alone in preoperative protocols.

According to Tartagia et al. if supplementing began right away after surgery, the incidence of postoperative hypocalcemia would not decrease within 24 h; instead, it would decrease 2 to 3 days later. According to Sturniolo et al. the incidence of hypocalcemia following surgery is highest during the first 24 h. Additionally, based on the pharmacokinetics of the active form of vitamin D, which has a half‐life of 6 to 8 h, it takes six to eight half‐lives to reach the therapeutic level or 48 h. For this reason, the cut‐off point for our analysis was set at 3 days. We found that the benefits of supplementing 3 days before surgery are equivalent to those of longer periods.

The selection of calcium supplementation, vitamin D supplementation, or a combination thereof should be guided by individual patient characteristics, including baseline vitamin D and calcium levels, comorbidities, and potential adverse effects. A recognized synergistic effect between calcium and vitamin D has been established. Based on our systematic review and meta‐analysis, we propose the following evidence‐based recommendations, acknowledging that optimal regimens may vary, and further research is warranted.

For less complex thyroid surgeries, a single high‐dose vitamin D regimen, often combined with calcium, has demonstrated efficacy. Rowe et al. (2019) reported that administering 300,000 IU cholecalciferol 7 days preoperatively reduced symptomatic hypocalcemia. This evidence supports using a single high‐dose approach in uncomplicated cases.

Patients undergoing more extensive thyroid surgery or those with pre‐existing vitamin D deficiency may benefit from more intensive supplementation strategies. A short‐term high‐dose regimen consisting of weekly doses of 50,000 IU vitamin D for approximately 4 weeks has shown significant efficacy. Ramouz et al. (2020) demonstrated that this regimen significantly reduced postoperative hypocalcemia in vitamin D‐deficient patients undergoing total thyroidectomy.

### Hypoparathyroidism and the kidney [^75f14948]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia are the pathognomonic biochemical features of hypoparathyroidism, and result directly from lack of parathyroid hormone (PTH) action on the kidney. In the absence of PTH action, the renal mechanisms transporting calcium and phosphate reabsorption deregulate, resulting in hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Circulating calcium negatively regulates PTH secretion. Hypocalcemia causes neuromuscular disturbances ranging from epilepsy and tetany to mild paresthesia. Circulating phosphate concentration does not directly regulate PTH secretion. Hyperphosphatemia is subclinical, but chronically promotes ectopic mineralization disease. Vitamin D-thiazide treatment leads to ectopic mineralization and renal damage. PTH treatment has the potential for fewer side effects.

### An algorithm informed by the parathyroid hormone level reduces hypocalcemic complications of thyroidectomy [^cb2e87ba]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The management of hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy (TTx) remains a challenge. Transient hypocalcemia is one of the most common postoperative complications of TTx, occurring in 17–26% of patients, and it results from direct injury to, devascularization of, or accidental removal of the parathyroid glands. Though early postoperative hypocalcemia is reversible in the great majority of cases, permanent hypoparathyroidism is likely much more common than previously suspected.

To manage postoperative hypocalcemia, most practitioners obtain serial serum calcium measurements and respond appropriately to low levels. Recently, several groups have advocated measurement of the parathyroid hormone (PTH) level several hours after operation in order to predict the development of hypocalcemia. This practice has not been widely adopted, nor has it been incorporated into a standardized system of care for patients undergoing TTx.

In the present study, we examined the impact of a management algorithm incorporating the postoperative PTH level as a means of preempting the development of hypocalcemia after TTx.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^0f85c65c]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

### Hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, management and emerging therapies [^5b27264e]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by inadequate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion or action and results in hypocalcaemia, and can lead to hyperphosphataemia and hypercalciuria. Most cases of hypoparathyroidism occur as a complication of surgery, with the remainder due to causes including autoimmune disease, genetic causes, infiltrative diseases, mineral deposition or due to abnormalities in serum levels of magnesium. Hypoparathyroidism can cause multisystem disease, with long-term complications resulting from ectopic calcification as well as renal complications with nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and renal impairment in addition to respiratory, cardiac or neurological manifestations. Conventional therapy consists of oral calcium salts and active vitamin D but it has limitations, including fluctuations in serum levels of calcium and a high pill burden, and can increase the risk of long-term complications. By contrast, PTH replacement therapy can effectively achieve normal serum levels of calcium, and lower serum levels of phosphate. The long-acting PTH analogue, palopegteriparatide, has been shown to normalize urine levels of calcium. In addition, PTH replacement therapy reduces the pill burden. Palopegteriparatide is also associated with improved quality of life in comparison to conventional therapy. This Review summarizes current recommendations regarding the pathophysiology, evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and also references the 2022 international hypoparathyroidism guidelines. Palopegteriparatide has now been approved as PTH replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. Emerging therapies will also be presented in this Review.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^d6b16f8c]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta‐analysis of the largest available number of treated patients demonstrates that PTH replacement therapy is well‐tolerated, safe, and effective in the management of hypoparathyroidism. Unlike conventional supplementation, it has beneficial effects on serum phosphate, calcium‐phosphate product, and urinary calcium excretion, which are currently the unmet needs in chronic hypoparathyroidism. Basing on available data, no significant differences between PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 have been demonstrated in most outcomes, except for a beneficial effect of PTH 1−84 only in reducing calcium‐phosphate product. It also improves several extrarenal outcomes, such as QoL and bone turnover. In addition to its current indication as second‐line treatment in patients with refractory hypocalcaemia, our results support the use of PTH replacement therapy in patients in whom hyperphosphatemia and increased urinary calcium excretion are a clinical concern.
