## Question

What are the sexual symptoms screening tools

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about sexual symptoms screening tools. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the scope and taxonomy of tools by population and condition. Then, I should verify which instruments are truly validated for screening versus diagnosis or monitoring. Next, I will appraise the quality and psychometrics of key tools. After that, I should align recommendations with guideline-backed use cases. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, prioritized list and note limitations and implementation considerations, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the scope and taxonomy so I don't conflate screening with diagnostic or monitoring tools. Screening tools are brief, validated instruments intended to identify individuals who may have a sexual problem and warrant further evaluation, whereas diagnostic tools are more comprehensive and often used to confirm and quantify dysfunction, and monitoring tools track change over time; I need to keep these distinctions explicit in the synthesis [^1f8ca676] [^1498ef2a].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence for female sexual dysfunction screening. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is the most widely studied instrument; the FSFI-19 has six domains and strong criterion validity, and the FSFI-6 is a validated 6-item screener with sensitivity 0.93 and specificity 0.94 at a cutoff of 19, making it practical for routine use, though I should note that structural validity evidence for the FSFI-6 is limited and warrants cautious interpretation [^b5d8ccf0] [^307bf6ae]. Wait, let me verify the distress component: sexual distress is a key diagnostic criterion, so pairing a function screener with a distress measure is sensible; the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised (FSDS-R) is commonly used for this purpose, including a single-item version, though I should confirm that the single-item variant has adequate psychometrics in the specific context where I plan to use it [^1b14d091] [^fea4af76].

> I will now examine tools for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women. The Decreased Sexual Desire Screener (DSDS) is a 5-item tool validated for generalized acquired HSDD; a positive screen requires four "yes" responses, and the fifth item helps differentiate contributing factors, which I should remember to use as a gateway to a fuller assessment rather than as a standalone diagnostic [^fea4af76] [^432533fa]. Hold on, I should verify that the DSDS is the tool most consistently endorsed for HSDD screening in practice-oriented reviews; yes, multiple sources converge on its utility for rapid case-finding in women with low desire and distress [^fea4af76].

> For male sexual dysfunction, I need to check the core screening instruments. The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM/IIEF-5) is a 5-item validated screener for erectile dysfunction with extensive clinical and research use; it is recommended by urology guidelines for initial assessment and follow-up, and I should confirm that it is appropriate across common etiologies, which it is [^8b216580] [^47d16e46]. Let me consider broader male function: the full International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) covers multiple domains and is the gold standard for trials and detailed assessment, though it is longer and better suited to diagnostic or monitoring contexts rather than rapid screening [^1b494df8] [^eb333418].

> But wait, what if I need a truly brief, unisex screener for primary care? A validated single-item screener asks whether the patient has had any sexual problems or concerns in a defined period and, while nonspecific, has shown construct validity against PROMIS SexFS and can open the door to a more focused evaluation; I should double-check that its performance is acceptable in diverse populations before recommending it broadly, and the original validation supports its feasibility and basic validity [^34b1f4e7].

> Next, I should review condition-specific and population-specific tools. For men after prostate cancer treatment, expert consensus developed a tool to screen for neglected sexual side effects (NSSE) that are not captured by generic instruments; this is a good reminder that disease-specific screeners can surface clinically important problems that standard tools miss, though I need to ensure I cite the validation status correctly, which here is Delphi-derived and awaiting further psychometrics [^844f9c3a] [^ddba99d6]. For neurological populations, guidelines emphasize routine inquiry and multidimensional assessment rather than a single tool, so I should not overpromise a single instrument in that space and instead frame screening within a structured history and targeted exam approach [^926b37bc] [^b59f9589].

> I should confirm guideline positions to anchor tool selection in practice. ACOG recommends initiating discussion of sexual function at routine visits and supports brief, standardized checklists to facilitate conversation, while AAFP advises open-ended screening questions and a thorough sexual history with attention to distress; diabetes guidelines explicitly recommend asking about desire, arousal, and orgasm difficulties in women with diabetes and screening men for low libido and ED, reinforcing the need to integrate sexual health into chronic disease care [^57faa32b] [^8833f2e0] [^bcd9a00d] [^7275ef29]. Hold on, I should verify that these are current: yes, the 2025 ADA Standards and 2025 AAFP guidance continue to endorse routine sexual health inquiry in diabetes and primary care, respectively [^bcd9a00d] [^8833f2e0].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized toolkit while keeping feasibility in mind. For women, the FSFI-6 provides a rapid, validated screen for overall sexual function; if low desire with distress is the concern, the DSDS is appropriate; and adding a distress measure such as the FSDS-R helps align with diagnostic criteria that require personal distress. For men, the SHIM remains the first-line screen for ED, with the IIEF reserved for comprehensive assessment or treatment monitoring. Across populations, a single-item screener can normalize discussion and identify patients needing further evaluation, especially when time is constrained [^307bf6ae] [^fea4af76] [^1b14d091] [^8b216580] [^1b494df8] [^34b1f4e7].

> I need to ensure I address limitations and implementation. Many tools were developed in specific populations and may require cultural adaptation; structural validity for some short forms remains under study; and screening is only the first step — positive screens should trigger a full sexual, medical, and psychosocial history, with targeted examination and labs as indicated. I should also remember that distress and relational context are essential to diagnosis and that patients may not volunteer symptoms unless asked directly, so routine, nonjudgmental inquiry is critical [^b5d8ccf0] [^1f8ca676] [^0c41a2c5].

> Finally, let me reconsider whether any of my initial claims overstep the evidence. I initially thought the FSFI-6 had been validated in multiple languages with invariant factor structure, but wait, I should correct that: while the FSFI-19 has extensive linguistic validation, evidence for the FSFI-6's structural validity and cross-cultural invariance is limited and inconsistent, so I should qualify its use accordingly and recommend confirmatory analyses when adopting it in new settings [^b5d8ccf0] [^307bf6ae].

Sexual symptoms screening tools are **validated questionnaires** that quickly identify sexual dysfunction across domains such as desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain. The most commonly used tools are the **Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI)** [^b5d8ccf0] and the **Decreased Sexual Desire Screener (DSDS)** for women [^fea4af76], and the **Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM/IIEF-5)** [^8b216580] and the **International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)** [^1b494df8] for men. These tools are recommended by guidelines for routine screening [^notfound], especially in patients with chronic conditions like diabetes [^bcd9a00d] or neurological disease [^b59f9589], and for monitoring treatment response [^eb333418]. They are brief, reliable, and facilitate early detection and management of sexual dysfunction [^307bf6ae].

### Questionnaires for assessment of female sexual dysfunction: a review and proposal for a standardized screener [^7c048aee]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are many methods to evaluate female sexual function and dysfunction (FSD) in clinical and research settings, including questionnaires, structured interviews, and detailed case histories. Of these, questionnaires have become an easy first choice to screen individuals into different categories of FSD.

Aim

The aim of this study was to review the strengths and weaknesses of different questionnaires currently available to assess different dimensions of women's sexual function and dysfunction, and to suggest a simple screener for FSD.

Methods

A literature search of relevant databases, books, and articles in journals was used to identify questionnaires that have been used in basic or epidemiological research, clinical trials, or in clinical settings.

Main Outcome Measure

Measures were grouped in four levels based on their purposes and degree of development, and were reviewed for their psychometric properties and utility in clinical or research settings. A Sexual Complaints Screener for Women (SCS-W) was then proposed based on epidemiological methods.

Results

Although many questionnaires are adequate for their own purposes, our review revealed a serious lack of standardized, internationally (culturally) acceptable questionnaires that are truly epidemiologically validated in general populations and that can be used to assess FSD in women with or without a partner and independent of the partner's gender. The SCS-W is proposed as a 10-item screener to aid clinicians in making a preliminary assessment of FSD.

Conclusions

The definition of FSD continues to change and basic screening tools are essential to help advance clinical diagnosis and treatment, or to slate patients adequately into the right diagnostic categories for basic and epidemiological research or clinical trials.

### Instruments for screening, diagnosis, and management of patients with generalized acquired hypoactive sexual desire disorder [^fea4af76]. Journal of Women's Health (2020). Medium credibility.

Screening, diagnosis, and management of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) and research into the condition have been challenging due to its biopsychosocial complexity and lack of consensus on relevant measures. Although physician interviews yield much clinically valid information, self-reported questionnaires appear more acceptable to patients and physicians. Consequently, validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools are essential for evaluation and management of HSDD, including any therapeutic intervention. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidance on the use of appropriate endpoints and associated measures for female sexual dysfunction, including HSDD. Although many of the available measures were not designed specifically for HSDD assessment, as per FDA guidelines, most clinical studies have used individual domains or items from established tools, such as the Female Sexual Function Index-desire domain and Item 13 of the revised Female Sexual Distress Scale. For clinical practice, several professional societies recommend the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener and/or a sexual history as tools to diagnose HSDD. This review discusses frequently used PRO tools as well as the newly developed and validated Elements of Desire Questionnaire, which may be appropriate for clinical trials or clinical practice.

### Assessment of sexual function / dysfunction via patient reported outcomes [^1498ef2a]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2007). Low credibility.

The recent recognition of the high prevalence of sexual dysfunctions and disorders in our society, along with the substantial investment of the pharmaceutical industry in the field of sexual functioning, has resulted in a significant expansion in the development of valid and reliable measures of sexual function/dysfunction. The instruments tend to be brief self-report inventories, typically requiring 10–20 min of patient time for completion. Most measures were initially developed as screening and outcomes measures for use in clinical drug trials of new treatments for sexual dysfunction, but are beginning to see more widespread use in the clinic. All these instruments must adhere to recently prescribed rigorous guidelines set forth by the Food and Drug Administration, and have been demonstrated to be valid and reliable indicators of the status and quality of sexual functioning in both men and women. The constructs that form the framework of our diagnostic system for sexual dysfunctions are not amenable to direct physical measurement, so that currently they must be assessed via these self-report scales. Although not as precise as physical measures, these inventories do an admirable job of quantifying and registering sexual functioning status in a concise and reliable manner, and have become indispensable tools in our clinical and research programs.

### Recommendations for the clinical evaluation of men and women with sexual dysfunction [^4a06da32]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

The challenge in the field of sexual medicine is to develop evidence-based principles for clinical evaluation and create a uniform, widely accepted diagnostic and treatment approach for all sexual problems and dysfunctions, for both genders.

Aim

To provide recommendations for the broad approach for assessing sexual problems in a medical practice setting; to develop an evidence-based diagnostic and treatment algorithm for men and women with sexual dysfunctions.

Methods

The PubMed literature was reviewed. Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature and the Delphi consensus process.

Results

The Committee determined three principles for clinical evaluation and management: (i) adoption of a patient-centered framework, with emphasis on cultural competence in clinical practice; (ii) application of evidence-based medicine in diagnostic and treatment planning; (iii) use of a unified management approach in evaluating and treating sexual problems in both men and women. The International Consultation in Sexual Medicine-5 stepwise diagnostic and treatment algorithm was developed for that purpose. According to this algorithm, sexual, medical, and psychosocial history is mandatory, whereas physical examination and laboratory tests are highly recommended in most cases. Furthermore, the Brief Sexual Symptom Checklist (BSSC) for Men and BSSC for Women, and more recently the Sexual Complaints Screener (SCS) for Men and SCS for Women, were all endorsed for screening purposes. A classification system was also defined; clinically, sexual dysfunctions are categorized in three types according to their etiology (Type I: psychogenic; Type II: organic; Type III: mixed). Final recommendations on specialized diagnostic tests were based on level of evidence.

Conclusions

A unified diagnostic and management strategy in sexual medicine, irrespective of condition and gender, would improve patients' sexual well-being. It would also lead to the development of academic curricula to provide practicing physicians across specialties with the needed skills to meet contemporary patients' needs in sexual medicine health-care delivery.

### Arriving at the diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction [^77794918]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Low credibility.

Female sexual dysfunctions include a group of sexual complaints and disorders affecting women of all ages, and stemming from a heterogeneous array of etiologies and contributing factors. The classification system for sexual dysfunctions in the woman has evolved from a linear categorization of sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain disorders to one that is more complex and overlapping. Personal distress is a key factor in defining a sexual problem as a dysfunction. The recently released Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, edition 5, collapses former definitions of female sexual disorders and moves away from the older linear model of diagnostic categories. Physicians should be open to discussing sexual problems with women, and may make use of validated questionnaires in the office setting. Evaluation tools available for assessing sexual function in the woman are in use in the research setting, as are physiological measures of assessment.

### Diagnosing sexual dysfunction in men and women: sexual history taking and the role of symptom scales and questionnaires [^1f8ca676]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

A detailed sexual history is the cornerstone for all sexual problem assessments and sexual dysfunction diagnoses. Diagnostic evaluation is based on an in-depth sexual history, including sexual and gender identity and orientation, sexual activity and function, current level of sexual function, overall health and comorbidities, partner relationship and interpersonal factors, and the role of cultural and personal expectations and attitudes.

Aim

To propose key steps in the diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunctions, with special focus on the use of symptom scales and questionnaires.

Methods

Critical assessment of the current literature by the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine committee.

Main Outcome Measures

A revised algorithm for the management of sexual dysfunctions, level of evidence, and recommendation for scales and questionnaires.

Results

The International Consultation on Sexual Medicine proposes an updated algorithm for diagnostic evaluation of sexual dysfunction in men and women, with specific recommendations for sexual history taking and diagnostic evaluation. Standardized scales, checklists, and validated questionnaires are additional adjuncts that should be used routinely in sexual problem evaluation. Scales developed for specific patient groups are included. Results of this evaluation are presented with recommendations for clinical and research uses.

Conclusion

Defined principles, an algorithm and a range of scales may provide coherent and evidence based management for sexual dysfunctions.

### The use of the sexual function questionnaire as a screening tool for women with sexual dysfunction [^dcbd8428]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine if the validated Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ), developed to assess efficacy in female sexual dysfunction (FSD) clinical trials, may also have utility in identifying target populations for such studies.

Methods

Data from five clinical trials and two general population surveys were used to analyze the utility of the SFQ as a tool to discriminate between the presence of specific components of FSD (i.e., hypoactive sexual desire disorder, female sexual arousal disorder, female orgasmic disorder, and dyspareunia).

Results

Sensitivity/specificity analysis and logistic regression analysis, using data from all five clinical studies and the general population surveys, confirmed that the SFQ domains have utility in detecting the presence of specific components of FSD and provide scores indicative of the presence of a specific sexual disorder.

Conclusions

The SFQ is a valuable new tool for detecting the presence of FSD and identifying the specific components of sexual functions affected (desire, arousal, orgasm, or dyspareunia).

### Female sexual health: screening and evaluation [^c59554fe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Female sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent, affecting 30% to 50% of cisgender women globally. Low sexual desire, sexual arousal disorder, and orgasm disorder affect 10% to 20%, 6% to 20%, and 4% to 14% of women, respectively. Dyspareunia or pain with intercourse affects 8% to 22% of women. Universal screening is recommended; and a thorough medical history and physical examination are the foundations of evaluation and assessment. Laboratory tests and imaging are sometimes warranted, but referral to a sexual medicine expert is suggested if the practitioner is unfamiliar or uncomfortable with treatment.

### The female sexual function index (FSFI) – A systematic review of measurement properties [^b5d8ccf0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) is a patient-reported outcome measure measuring female sexual dysfunction. The FSFI-19 was developed with 6 theoretical subscales in 2000. In 2010, a shortened version became available (FSFI-6).

Aim

To investigate the measurement properties of the FSFI-19 and FSFI-6.

Methods

A systematic search was performed of Embase, Medline, and Web of Science for studies that investigated measurement properties of the FSFI-19 or FSFI-6 up to April 2018. Data were extracted and analyzed according to COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) guidelines. Evidence was categorized into sufficient, insufficient, inconsistent, or indeterminate, and quality of evidence as very high, high, moderate, or low.

Main Outcome Measures

The Main Outcome Measure is the evidence of a measurement property, and the quality of evidence based on the COSMIN guidelines.

Results

83 studies were included. Concerning the FSFI-19, the evidence for internal consistency was sufficient and of moderate quality. The evidence for reliability was sufficient but of low quality. The evidence for criterion validity was sufficient and of high quality. The evidence for structural validity was inconsistent of low quality. The evidence for construct validity was inconsistent of moderate quality. Concerning the FSFI-6, the evidence for criterion validity was sufficient of moderate quality. The evidence for internal consistency was rated as indeterminate. The evidence for reliability was inconsistent of low quality. The evidence for construct validity was inconsistent of very low quality. No information was available on structural validity of the FSFI-6, and measurement error, responsiveness, and cross-cultural validity of both FSFI-6 and FSFI-19.

Clinical Implications

Conflicting and lack of evidence for some of the measurement properties of the FSFI-19 and FSFI-6 indicates the importance of further research on the validity of these patient-reported outcome measures. We advise researchers who use the FSFI-19 to perform confirmatory factor analyses and report the factor structure found in their sample. Regardless of these concerns, the FSFI-19 and FSFI-6 have strong criterion validity. Pragmatically, they are good screening tools for the current definition of female sexual dysfunction.

Strength & Limitation

A strong point of the review is the use of predefined guidelines. A limitation is the use of a precise rather than a sensitive search filter.

Conclusions

The FSFI requires more research on structural validity (FSFI-19 and FSFI-6), reliability (FSFI-6), construct validity (FSFI-19), measurement error (FSFI-19 and FSFI-6), and responsiveness (FSFI-19 and FSFI-6). Further corroboration of measurement invariance (both across cultures and across subpopulations) in the factor structure of the FSFI-19 is necessary, as well as tests for the unidimensionality of the FSFI-6.

### Screening for Chlamydia and gonorrhea: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^016936cb]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Supporting evidence — scope and accuracy findings state that the USPSTF commissioned a systematic review that evaluated the benefits and harms of screening in all sexually active adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons; key differences from the prior review were combining all populations into a single analytic framework, evaluating the accuracy of risk stratification and screening strategies for identifying persons at increased risk, and focusing diagnostic accuracy on anatomical site-specific testing; because treatments were previously determined effective and well established, the review did not include a review of treatments. The USPSTF found convincing evidence that available screening tests can accurately diagnose chlamydial and gonococcal infections; convincing evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active women at increased risk; and inadequate evidence that clinicians could identify sexually active men at increased risk. In asymptomatic individuals, 3 studies with 76 136 participants using a risk score reported an area under the curve of 0.64 to 0.73, and one study showed that age (younger than 22 years) alone had accuracy similar to that for the use of more extensive risk criteria.

### A modified Delphi study to identify screening items to assess neglected sexual side-effects following prostate cancer treatment [^844f9c3a]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study adds value in that it will assist health care practitioners to identify a variety of sexual dysfunction complications, collectively referred to as NSSE in men after PCa treatment. Currently these symptoms are often undiagnosed and remain untreated, especially in a low to middle income country such as South Africa. Consensus was reached on the statements making up the NSSE screening tool by a panel of experts. This screening tool may be applied on patients who have had treatment for early stage PCa that includes prostate surgery and prostate radiation therapies. This screening tool will need to undergo further psychometric testing to establish its validity and reliability.

3.3 Section 3: Assessment of Sexual Symptoms

Table 3 and Appendix S7 present the evidence supporting recommendations made for the assessment of sexual symptoms, and Figure 3 illustrates the assessment and treatment algorithm of sexual symptoms based on the recommendations.

Clinical question 26. Should neurologists obtain a history of a patient's sexual symptoms versus not asking about sexual symptoms? Should there be a multidimensional assessment about primary, secondary, and tertiary factors versus no multidimensional assessment?

History taking forms the cornerstone of the assessment, and this is summarised as a checklist in Table 5. High‐quality guidelines for individuals with neurological disease highlight the importance of a comprehensive medical and sexual history in evaluating sexual dysfunction, emphasising primary, secondary, and tertiary sexual dysfunctions. A detailed history should explore sexual dysfunction's nature, onset, and impact, including specific challenges faced by those with SCI or post‐stroke, considering both physical and psychosocial factors. Sexual orientation, relationship history, emotional well‐being, substance use, and previous treatments should also be assessed.

### Development and validation of a 6-item version of the female sexual function index (FSFI) as a diagnostic tool for female sexual dysfunction [^307bf6ae]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

A limiting step in the evaluation of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) is the availability of a rapid screening procedure. Often, practitioners avoid investigating sexual symptoms due to concerns of insufficient time or lack of proper tools to address FSD.

Aim

The purpose of this study was to prepare and validate an abridged form of the most popular psychometric diagnostic test (Female Sexual Function Index, FSFI-19) to provide a fast screener of FSD for easy use in outpatient visits, epidemiological studies, and assessment of treatment response.

Methods

We interviewed and administered the FSFI-19 to 200 women attending outpatient clinics for sexual and reproductive medicine. Forty women were excluded because they had no sexual activity or failed to attend the retest visit. Patients were evaluated on two subsequent visits to validate the abridged form of the questionnaire. Overall, 105 were found to suffer from a FSD.

Main Outcome Measure

We assessed, individually, the sensibility and sensitivity of all questions of the full-length FSFI. We then estimated the performance of each item with respect to the specific sexual domain they address. By selecting the best combination of performing items in each domain, we built an abridged, 6-item form of the FSFI.

Results

The Receiver Operating Characteristic curves of the FSFI-6 showed that women who scored ≤ 19 were classified as having FSD. Using the cut-off of 19, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were, 0.93 and 0.94, respectively. Reliability, internal consistency, and stability on retest were also good.

Conclusions

The abridged FSFI-6 is a valuable tool for screening women that are likely to suffer from FSD. In six simple questions, taking no more than 3 minutes, a score of less than 19 indicates the need for further investigations, including the full-length FSFI-19 and a dedicated interview. In conclusion, this is a novel tool that can help any doctor to disclose FSD rapidly and efficiently.

### A systematic review of sexual distress measures [^1b14d091]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sexual distress is an important component of sexual dysfunction and quality of life and many different measures have been developed for its assessment.

Aim

To conduct a literature review of measures for assessing sexual distress and to list, compare, and highlight their characteristics and psychometric properties.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted using Scopus and PubMed databases to identify studies that developed and validated measures of sexual distress. The main characteristics and psychometric properties of each measure were extracted and examined.

Outcomes

Psychometrically validated measures of sexual distress and a summary of relative strengths and limitations.

Results

We found 17 different measures for the assessment of sexual distress. 4 were standalone questionnaires and 13 were subscales included in questionnaires that assessed broader constructs. Although 5 measures were developed to assess sexual distress in the general population, most were developed and validated in very specific clinical groups. Most followed adequate steps in the development and validation process and have strong psychometric properties; however, several limitations were identified.

Clinical Translation

This literature review offers researchers and clinicians a list of sexual distress measures and relevant characteristics that can be used to select the best assessment tool for their objectives.

Strengths and Limitations

A thorough search procedure was used; however, there is still a chance that relevant articles might have been missed owing to our search methodology and inclusion criteria.

Conclusion

This is a novel and state-of-the-art review of assessment tools for sexual distress that includes valuable information measure selection in the study of sexual distress and sexual dysfunction.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^c864af0f]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Early detection of abused children could help decrease mortality and morbidity related to this major public health problem. Several authors have proposed tools to screen for child maltreatment. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the evidence on accuracy of tools proposed to identify abused children before their death and assess if any were adapted to screening.

Methods

We searched in PUBMED, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, FRANCIS and PASCAL for studies estimating diagnostic accuracy of tools identifying neglect, or physical, psychological or sexual abuse of children, published in English or French from 1961 to April 2012. We extracted selected information about study design, patient populations, assessment methods, and the accuracy parameters. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS criteria.

Results

A total of 2 280 articles were identified. Thirteen studies were selected, of which seven dealt with physical abuse, four with sexual abuse, one with emotional abuse, and one with any abuse and physical neglect. Study quality was low, even when not considering the lack of gold standard for detection of abused children. In 11 studies, instruments identified abused children only when they had clinical symptoms. Sensitivity of tests varied between 0.26 (95% confidence interval [0.17–0.36]) and 0.97 [0.84–1], and specificity between 0.51 [0.39–0.63] and 1 [0.95–1]. The sensitivity was greater than 90% only for three tests: the absence of scalp swelling to identify children victims of inflicted head injury; a decision tool to identify physically-abused children among those hospitalized in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit; and a parental interview integrating twelve child symptoms to identify sexually-abused children. When the sensitivity was high, the specificity was always smaller than 90%.

Conclusions

In 2012, there is low-quality evidence on the accuracy of instruments for identifying abused children. Identified tools were not adapted to screening because of low sensitivity and late identification of abused children when they have already serious consequences of maltreatment. Development of valid screening instruments is a pre-requisite before considering screening programs.

### Measurement of male and female sexual dysfunction [^ded8c7e8]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

Measurement approaches for male and female sexual dysfunction have proliferated in recent years, spurred in large part by the development of new treatments for male and female dysfunction. In the past, physiologic measures of penile tumescence and rigidity in males, and vaginal blood flow in females, played an important role in clinical and research studies. More recently, a variety of brief, self-report measures have been developed for assessing male and female function across a variety of sexual domains (eg, desire, arousal, orgasm, satisfaction). These self-report measures have been shown to have a high degree of reliability and validity, and are sensitive to treatment interventions. Accordingly, they are widely employed in clinical trials. Daily diary or sexual event logs have similarly been developed for this purpose. Self-report measures have been used for clinical screening purposes and for diagnostic assessment of sexual function in a number of studies. Finally, several disease-specific quality of life and treatment satisfaction measures have been developed, which are currently in widespread use in clinical trials of sexual dysfunction.

### Sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors: a narrative review [^317e2871]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Due to improvements in earlier detection and expansions in available treatments, the number of individuals surviving with cancer is steadily increasing. Sexual dysfunction is a common and often persistent complication for cancer survivors, affecting > 60% of women diagnosed with cancer. Although highly prevalent, issues related to sexual health are often not addressed among survivors, with women reporting less discussion with providers compared to men.

Methods

In this narrative review, we present a case series of three women seen in a psycho-oncology clinic who experienced sexual dysfunction following a cancer diagnosis. We then review existing literature on the presentation and management of sexual issues associated with cancer and its treatment.

Results

The three cases highlight different mechanisms of sexual dysfunction after cancer, including anatomic changes, hormonal alterations, psychiatric conditions and medication side effects. The literature review includes discussion of the prevalence and course of sexual dysfunction in female cancer survivors. Tools for screening and assessment are then reviewed, as well as contributing factors and common presenting symptoms. We conclude with a discussion of both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches to management.

Conclusions

Despite its high prevalence and considerable impact on quality of life, the complication of sexual dysfunction after cancer diagnosis and treatment is still under recognized and undertreated. Improving awareness, communication, and screening, as well as appropriate referral to treatment, could have a profound impact on the ever growing number of women surviving with cancer with sexual health concerns.

### Lifestyle management in polycystic ovary syndrome-beyond diet and physical activity [^f0882bac]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Psychological

The current guideline highlights the need for awareness, and appropriate assessment (such as stepwise screening) and management, of QoL, depression and anxiety, psychosexual dysfunction, negative body image and disordered eating. The guideline emphasises the importance of clinicians and women working in partnership to address women's individual priorities; understanding that the impact of PCOS on an individual's QoL is key to delivering meaningful outcomes. To assist women to communicate with clinicians about what is important to them, the PCOS Question Prompt List was developed and is consistent with the 2018 guideline. The 2018 guideline recommends screening for risk factors and symptoms of depression and anxiety at time of diagnosis. Women with positive screening results should be supported with further assessment and treatment by appropriately qualified clinicians. To screen for psychosexual dysfunction tools such as the Female Sexual Function Index should be utilised. If negative body image, disordered eating or eating disorders are suspected, the PCOS guideline outlines a stepped approach for screening, and where appropriate promotes the use of psychological therapy offered by trained health professionals, which should be guided by regional clinical practice guidelines.

STI and HIV infection risk assessment — primary prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) includes assessment of behavioral risk and biologic risk, and health care providers should routinely obtain sexual histories and address risk reduction. The "Five P's" approach is one strategy for eliciting key areas of interest, and a comprehensive STI and HIV risk assessment should include STI screening because STIs are biologic markers of risk, particularly for HIV acquisition and transmission among certain men who have sex with men (MSM). In most clinical settings, STI screening is described as an essential and underused component, persons seeking treatment or evaluation for a particular STI should be screened for HIV and other STIs as indicated by community prevalence and individual risk factors, and persons should be informed about all the tests for STIs they are receiving.

### Current perspectives on the clinical assessment and diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction and clinical studies of potential therapies: a statement of concern [^ba6ed2c0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

The assessment and diagnosis of female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are in a state of transition because of evolving concepts of female sexuality and suggested changes to the FSD diagnostic framework.

Aim

To review the problems with current FSD diagnosis.

Methods

Multidisciplinary experts from five countries were assembled to convene a "Postmenopausal FSD Roundtable on specific topics related to FSD".

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on a review of evidence-based medical literature, presentation, and internal discussion.

Results

Current FSD diagnosis is challenging because of poorly defined distinctions between normal and abnormal, a limited ability to integrate subjective and objective findings and an inability to incorporate contextual factors that play a significant role in sexual behavior. The availability of self-administered questionnaires (SAQs) that assess various domains of female sexual function, as well as those developed specifically for postmenopausal women, suggests that a more structured approach to assessment and diagnosis may be possible. Several SAQs reflecting proposed changes to the FSD diagnostic framework by the American Foundation for Urologic Disease (AFUD), including the Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ) and the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), have been introduced and recently incorporated into a Structured Diagnostic Method (SDM). Recent regulatory decisions and events affecting the development of FSD interventions have highlighted the lack of consensus with regard to clinically meaningful FSD outcomes, as well as shortcomings in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration draft document that provides the primary guidance for conducting FSD clinical studies in the United States.

Conclusions

Given the high cost and inherent risk of clinical studies, continued development efforts toward FSD therapies are unlikely to proceed in the absence of significant changes in regulatory guidance that reflect the current understanding of FSD and incorporate validated assessment tools.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^c0cda78a]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Determining an individual's need and desire for services — providers can begin by asking about the person's needs and expectations and by taking an initial open-ended sexual history and screening for specific services to help ensure people get services, inform people about available services, and educate people about self-care. Providers should be aware of the risks of screening and that people may feel they are being "targeted" for STI screening or contraception if the process is not explained or normalized. To minimize these risks, explain why screening is being conducted, use a standardized, evidence-based, person-centered tool when possible, note that tools can be brief and user-friendly and that written or online questionnaires can also be used either in person or remotely, and recognize that disclosure is not always the goal and that patients may choose to omit aspects of their history. Taking a sexual history — an open-ended sexual history can help a provider assess what resources and services can be offered to the patient.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: a systematic review update [^58709f04]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

This review builds upon the work of Bailhache et al. and performs a systematic review with the objective of assessing evidence about the accuracy of instruments for identifying children suspected of having been exposed to maltreatment (neglect, as well as physical, sexual abuse, emotional abuse). Similar to the review by Bailhache et al. we investigate both screening tools and other identification tools or strategies that could be adapted into screening tools. In addition to reviewing the sensitivity and specificity of instruments, as was done by Bailhache et al. for five studies, we have also calculated estimates of false positives and negatives per 100 children, a calculation which can assist providers in making decisions about the use of an instrument. This review contributes to an important policy debate about the benefits and limitations of using standardized tools (versus case-finding) to identify children exposed to maltreatment. This debate has become increasingly salient with the publication of screening tools for adverse childhood experiences, or tools that address child maltreatment alongside other adverse experiences.

It should be noted here that while "screening" typically implies identifying health problems, screening for child maltreatment is different in that it usually involves identifying risk factors or high-risk groups. As such, while studies evaluating tools that assist with identification of child maltreatment are typically referred to as diagnostic accuracy studies, the word "diagnosis" is potentially misleading. Instead, screening tools for child maltreatment typically codify several risk and clinical indicators of child maltreatment (e.g. caregiver delay in seeking medical attention without adequate explanation). As such, they may more correctly be referred to as tools that identify potential maltreatment, or signs, symptoms and risk factors that have a strong association with maltreatment and may lead providers to consider maltreatment as one possible explanation for the sign, symptom, or risk factor. Assessment by a health care provider should then include consideration of whether there is reason to suspect child maltreatment. If maltreatment is suspected, this would lead to a report to child protection services (CPS) in jurisdictions with mandatory reporting obligations (e.g. Canada, United States) or to child social services for those jurisdictions bound by occupational policy documents (e.g. United Kingdom). Confirmation or verification of maltreatment would then occur through an investigation by CPS or a local authority; they, in turn, may seek consultation from one or more health care providers with specific expertise in child maltreatment. Therefore, throughout this review we will refer to identification tools as those that aid in the identification of potential child maltreatment.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^e601fd14]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

After presentation with urinary symptoms, an underlying neurological mechanism sometimes emerges subsequently. Increased awareness may bring earlier diagnosis, improving prognosis and outcomes.

Methods

A 2024 International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society think-tank considered the clinical pathway for identification of an undiagnosed neurological or autonomic contribution precipitating urinary symptoms, and the implications for prognosis.

Results

Alongside adult-onset neurogenic conditions, potential for missed diagnosis includes congenital and pediatric-acquired neurogenic conditions, which may become symptomatic during a growth spurt due to spinal cord tethering. Detailed assessment is needed, also considering bowel and sexual dysfunction, with timely referral to neurology to reduce preventable progression of disease. In neurological assessment, control of micturition is often poorly characterized compared with other aspects of spinal cord function and the cranial nerves. Screening tools may be used to identify people who have increased likelihood of particular conditions, but currently available tools are either single-system or population specific. In addition to the general pelvic examination, the assessment of sacral reflexes and pelvic sensations can suggest a neurological mechanism, though the sensitivity and specificity of the neuro-urological examination is unknown. Including the results of the neuro-perineal examination in the urodynamic report may improve the interpretation of the results and potentially support a neurological aetiology.

Conclusion

Future research should consider the value of neuro-urological examination in diagnosis of occult neurological disease, the development of an occult neurology screening tool/risk scoring based on pelvic organ symptoms, and appropriateness of non-neurologist practitioners requesting neurological investigations such as MRI scanning.

Clinical Trial Registration

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: a systematic review update [^a27e50e7]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Child maltreatment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect impacts a significant number of children worldwide. For example, a survey involving a nationally representative sample of American children selected using telephone numbers from 2013 to 2014 found that lifetime rates of maltreatment for children aged 14 to 17 was 18.1% for physical abuse, 23.9% for emotional abuse, 18.4% for neglect, and 14.3% and 6.0% for sexual abuse of girls and boys respectively. Child maltreatment is associated with many physical, emotional, and relationship consequences across the lifespan, such as developmental delay first seen in infancy; anxiety and mood disorder symptoms and poor peer relationships first seen in childhood; substance use and other risky behaviours often first seen in adolescence; and increased risk for personality and psychiatric disorders, relationship problems, and maltreatment of one's own children in adulthood. Given the high prevalence and serious potential negative consequences of child maltreatment, clinicians need to be informed about strategies to accurately identify children potentially exposed to maltreatment, a task that "can be one of the most challenging and difficult responsibilities for the pediatrician". Two main strategies for identification of maltreatment — screening and case-finding — are often compared to one another in the literature. Screening involves administering a standard set of questions, or applying a standard set of criteria, to assess for the suspicion of child maltreatment in all presenting children ("mass screening") or high-risk groups of children ("selective screening"). Case-finding, alternatively, involves providers being alert to the signs and symptoms of child maltreatment and assessing for potential maltreatment exposure in a way that is tailored to the unique circumstances of the child.

A previous systematic review by Bailhache et al. summarized "evidence on the accuracy of instruments for identifying abused children during any stage of child maltreatment evolution before their death, and to assess if any might be adapted to screening, that is if accurate screening instruments were available". The authors reviewed 13 studies addressing the identification of physical abuse (7 studies), sexual abuse (4 studies), emotional abuse (1 study), and multiple forms of child maltreatment (1 study). The authors noted in their discussion that the tools were not suitable for screening, as they either identified children too late (i.e. children were already suffering from serious consequences of maltreatment) or the performance of the tests was not adaptable to screening, due to low sensitivity and specificity of the tools.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for intimate partner violence, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, WHO 2013 guidelines recommend to ask about exposure to intimate partner violence when assessing conditions that may be caused or complicated by intimate partner violence,
such as:

- symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, sleep disorders

- suicidality or self-harm

- alcohol and other substance use

- unexplained chronic gastrointestinal symptoms

- unexplained reproductive symptoms, including pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction

- adverse reproductive outcomes, including multiple unintended pregnancies and/or terminations, delayed pregnancy care, adverse birth outcomes

- unexplained genitourinary symptoms, including frequent bladder or kidney infections

- repeated vaginal bleeding and STIs

- chronic unexplained pain

- traumatic injury, particularly if repeated and with vague or implausible explanations

- problems with the CNS, such as headaches, cognitive problems, hearing loss

- repeated health consultations with no clear diagnosis

- intrusive partner or husband in consultations.

### Developing a symptoms-based risk score for infectious syphilis among men who have sex with men [^f56fa990]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We aimed to assess whether an evidence-based symptoms-based risk score could be developed to identify individuals with infectious syphilis. The optimised risk score C2, including six symptoms and a partner notification for syphilis, had a sensitivity of 40.5% (95% CI 36.3% to 44.8%), a specificity of 95.3% (95% CI 95.0% to 95.6%) and an AUC of 0.68. Based on this score, 5.6% of the study population would be eligible for syphilis testing and 41% of the cases would be identified.

We had aimed that a symptoms-based risk score would enable MSM to self-identify possible infectious syphilis to increase early testing and diagnosis, and avoid further transmission and complications. To our knowledge, there are no studies on the development of a symptoms-based risk score for infectious syphilis. One study developed a simple-to-use nomogram to predict the risk of syphilis, and several other studies described the risk factors for syphilis based on sociodemographic, clinical or behavioural data. The main objective of the current study was to develop a symptoms-based risk score so that individuals would seek help when symptomatic, analogous to similar algorithms for acute HIV infection. Several symptom and behavioural risk scores for acute HIV have been developed and validated successfully. The symptoms-based risk scores may have the advantage above behavioural scores as they may be generalisable among different populations and be unaffected by frequency of high-risk behaviour. Unfortunately, our risk scores did not have promising characteristics and infections would be missed by using the tool. Various iterations to increase sensitivity or specificity did not lead to improved performance; this is probably due to the fact that many infectious syphilis cases are asymptomatic.

### A practical approach to managing hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women with diabetes [^432533fa]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and Screening Tools for HSDD

As a result of the complexity of HSDD, it is difficult to diagnose. Symptoms include a decrease or absence of sexual desire for at least 6 months, which also causes personal distress. A detailed medical history including onset, duration, severity, and level of distress can help determine if the decrease in sexual desire is hormonal, neurological, metabolic, vascular, psychological, or some combination. Complete loss of sexual desire is not required for diagnosis but only a change in desire for at least 3 months. It is important to realize that overlapping sexual disorders are common; therefore, the clinician should ask about other sexual dysfunction in the female patient with HSDD. The clinician should discuss which problem presented first and, in collaboration with the patient, address the primary disorder first.

A thorough sexual history should assess medical, reproductive (obstetric/gynecologic), surgical, psychiatric, social, and sexual information. Providers should assess glycemic control as well as thyroid hormone and prolactin levels to rule out any endocrine problem. Testosterone and estradiol levels can neither predict nor confirm HSDD. In addition, clinicians should complete a thorough medication review for all patients to rule out medication-related risks of FSD. For example, clinicians should avoid prescribing SSRIs for women with HSDD.

The clinician can utilize a variety of validated screening instruments to assess HSDD. The decreased sexual desire screener (DSDS) is a validated, five-question tool completed by the patient to assess for generalized acquired HSDD. The DSDS contains four "yes/no" questions, which assess the loss of sexual desire or distress. The clinician should diagnose HSDD if the woman answers the first four questions as "yes". The fifth question can help make the differential diagnosis by identifying specific factors that may be contributing to the decrease in desire (medical conditions, medications, drugs or alcohol, menopausal symptoms, recent childbirth, pain with intercourse, decreased arousal or orgasm, partner's sexual problems, relationship problems, stress, or fatigue). Table 2 lists evaluation strategies incorporating the screening tools and other factors in the patient's assessment of HSDD.

### Risk of bias from inclusion of patients who already have diagnosis of or are undergoing treatment for depression in diagnostic accuracy studies of screening tools for depression: systematic review [^cae90e77]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and policy implications

The importance of our findings relates to the use of depression questionnaires for screening, a procedure conducted to identify previously unrecognised cases. In clinical practice, depression questionnaires are sometimes used for purposes other than screening, including monitoring the severity of symptoms in patients who already have a diagnosis of depression and assessing patients for recurrence of symptoms while they are being treated. The introduction and discussion sections of the 17 systematic reviews and meta-analyses we reviewed indicate that all were intended to assess the diagnostic accuracy and utility of depression questionnaires for the purpose of screening — that is, for identification of new cases. None discussed how findings might apply to other possible uses for the questionnaires (such as monitoring progress of treatment or detection of relapse). In addition, the recommendations that have been issued by expert panels regarding depression screening in various settings discuss the use of screening instruments as a means of identifying new cases.

Screening for depression is somewhat different from many other types of screening in that a history or interview might not necessarily be part of the evaluation before a screening tool is administered. To illustrate, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for cervical cancer in women who have been sexually active and have a cervix. On the other hand, such screening is not recommended for women older than 65 or for women who have recently had a normal result on a smear test. This approach to screening is predicated on some "filtering" to determine the appropriate individuals or groups to be screened. On the other hand, the task force's recommendations regarding depression screeningfocus on issues in healthcare systems, such as the availability of staff assisted depression care, rather than on any upstream evaluation of patients before screening. In clinical settings, screening tools for depression might be routinely administered to all patients in the waiting room of a hospital, physician's office, or clinic, as has been recommended by expert panels. Regardless of whether these screening tools are used with or without upstream "filtering" in clinical practice, accurate determinations of test characteristics that reflect the ability to detect previously unrecognised cases can be obtained only if this upstream "filtering" is done in studies to exclude patients who already have a diagnosis of depression. Our findings show that this is rarely done, and, as a result, existing evidence on the accuracy and case yield of depression screening tools could substantially overestimate their utility in clinical practice. Well designed studies that exclude patients who already have a diagnosis of or are receiving treatment for depression are needed to generate realistic determinations of the accuracy of depression screening tools in clinical settings to inform decisions about risks and benefits with screening.

### European Academy of Neurology (EAN) / European federation of autonomic societies (EFAS) / international neuro-urology society (INUS) guidelines for practising neurologists on the assessment and treatment of neurogenic urinary and sexual symptoms (NEUROGED guidelines) [^b59f9589]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation: Neurologists should actively ask individuals with neurological diseases about sexual problems regularly and explore multidimensional contributing factors. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 97%).

Clinical Question 27. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems Undergo a Focused Physical Assessment Versus no Physical Assessment?

Identifying the physical contributors to sexual dysfunction in individuals with neurological disorders is crucial for effective management and treatment planning. These individuals should undergo a targeted physical examination when necessary.

Recommendation: Neurologists should perform a targeted physical examination when appropriate in individuals with neurological diseases who experience sexual problems. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 85%).

Clinical Question 28. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Dysfunction Undergo Further Laboratory Diagnostic Evaluations (Vascular Risk Factors) Versus no Diagnostic Evaluation?

Evidence suggests that men with erectile dysfunction (ED) should undergo vascular risk screening, including fasting glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profiles, based on guidelines not aimed at individuals with neurological disease. ED is now seen as a standalone risk for cardiovascular disease and a potential early sign of diabetes, necessitating baseline measurements of serum lipids and glucose. If no recent tests are available, a comprehensive lipid and glucose profile is recommended. Although not all tests will diagnose ED directly, they offer a chance to uncover important co‐morbidities. Serum testosterone should be measured in those showing signs of hypogonadism, with morning blood samples being preferred for accuracy. Screening for urogenital cancers and sexually transmitted infections (STI) may be required on an individualized basis.

Recommendation: Individuals with neurological diseases who have sexual problems should undergo screening laboratory testing for additional contributing factors in the appropriate clinical context. (Good practice statement; Consensus: 97% in Delphi round 2).

Clinical Question 29. Should Individuals With Neurological Disease Reporting Sexual Problems Undergo Further Instrumental Diagnostic Evaluations (Ex: Neurophysiology) Versus no Diagnostic Evaluation?

Routine instrumental diagnostic tests, such as pelvic neurophysiology and MRI, are not typically necessary for individuals with neurological diseases experiencing sexual dysfunction, as these tests often do not provide additional information beyond a thorough history and examination. These tests include the assessment of pelvic somatic sensory and motor functions, reflexes, and autonomic innervation, and may be useful in specific situations such as the assessment of unexplained urogenital dysfunction, evaluating incidental spinal MRI findings, cases of pelvic trauma, or for medico‐legal reasons. The tests should be reserved for specialist settings where they can be accurately performed and interpreted.

### Clinical evaluation and management strategy for sexual dysfunction in men and women [^f6a0fa9b]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The optimal approach for identification and evaluation of the sexual problems in men and women in primary care or general medicine practice has not been consensed.

An International Consultation in collaboration with the major urology and sexual medicine associations assembled over 200 multidisciplinary experts from 60 countries into 17 committees. Committee members established specific objectives and scopes for various male and female sexual medicine topics. The recommendations concerning state-of-the-art knowledge in the respective sexual medicine topic represent the opinion of experts from five continents developed in a process over a 2-year period. Concerning the Clinical Evaluation and Management Strategies Committee, there were 12 experts from five countries.

Main Outcome Measure

Expert opinion was based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation and debate.

Results

Three concepts underlie sexual medicine management: (i) adoption of a patient-centered framework for evaluation and treatment; (ii) application of the principles of evidence-based medicine in diagnostic and treatment planning; and (iii) use of a unified management approach in men and women. When taken together, these three principles provide a balanced and integrated approach to sexual dysfunction management. Common algorithms for diagnosis and management of men and women with sexual dysfunction, brief sexual symptom checklists, basics in history and physical examination, indications for specialized referral and development of a follow-up strategy are presented.

Conclusions

More research is needed in understanding the role of evidence-based and patient-centered medicine in the clinical evaluation and management strategies of men and women with sexual dysfunction.

### Substance use screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment [^661689ed]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Substance use screening in adolescents — scope and tools are outlined as follows: screening is a procedure applied to populations to identify individuals or groups at risk of or with a disease, condition, or symptoms, and is conducted so that the results can form the basis for a corresponding care plan. The best screening tools are those containing the lowest number of succinct validated questions that can elicit accurate and reliable responses. Comprehensive biopsychosocial screening, including substance use screening, is a recommended component of routine adolescent health care. The HEADSSS mnemonic, which stands for home environment, education and employment, eating, peer-related activities, drugs, sexuality, suicide/depression, and safety from injury and violence, is a frequently used framework to conduct a complete psychosocial interview with adolescents, as is the SSHADESS mnemonic, a strength- and resiliency-based tool. Whether the patient responds to a written or electronic survey or provider or medical assistant questioning, the "D" in these tools triggers screening about the patient's substance use but possibly also about use by their friends or household members. The SBIRT screening goal is to define experience with substance use along a spectrum ranging from abstinence to addiction so that this information can be used to guide the next steps of the related clinical approach or intervention, and screening results broadly inform clinical care (for example, alcohol and drug use may be the source of a presenting symptom or may interfere with prescribed medications and test results). The management of inattentiveness would be different if the physician learned that the patient used marijuana (a possible cause) or a stimulant drug (a prescribing risk).

### Developing a symptoms-based risk score for infectious syphilis among men who have sex with men [^e77ce115]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2023). Medium credibility.

This study has several strengths. The data of the Centre for Sexual Health of Amsterdam provided us with a large sample size. Secondly, self-reported symptoms were systematically noted in all the consultations. Furthermore, all clients were tested systematically based on their symptoms and risk behaviour. All assessed symptoms in this study were highly predictive for infectious syphilis. The study also has several limitations. We chose not to include risk behaviour in the risk score. Including risk behaviour might improve the algorithm, yet this would not benefit our objective of self-reported symptoms-based algorithms leading to seeking care. Furthermore, the cut-offs of our risk scores were based on the Youden Index, but this is a rather arbitrary cut-off; the optimal cut-off may depend on the prevalence of infectious syphilis in the population, financial resources and acceptability of low sensitivity. Lastly, we used data of MSM visiting the Centre for Sexual Health; possible results may not be generalisable to all MSM including those who do not yet seek sexual healthcare.

For the prevention of syphilis, multiple approaches are necessary. An awareness campaign with a symptoms-based risk score will likely not prevent the ongoing transmission of infectious syphilis. Early identification of the infection and timely treatment are helpful to reduce the duration of infection and onwards sequela. An online symptoms tool might in some cases be harmful as it may warrant incorrect assessment of no risk. Thus, all MSM who engage in sexual behaviour that places them at higher risk of acquiring STIs should be regularly tested for syphilis. Yet, an online tool might help to motivate MSM to seek help timely in case of suspected symptoms.

In conclusion, our proposed symptoms-based risk scores performed poorly to diagnose infectious syphilis. Thus, we cannot recommend a symptoms-based risk score to select MSM for syphilis screening. All MSM with relevant sexual exposure should be regularly tested for syphilis.

### Associations of depression and anxiety symptoms with sexual behaviour in women and heterosexual men attending sexual health clinics: a cross-sectional study [^c2f38a4f]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2019). Medium credibility.

Symptoms of depression and anxiety

Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9)and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD7)screening tools. Participants are asked if they have experienced each PHQ9/GAD7 symptom in the previous 2 weeks (with four possible responses from: 'not at all' to 'more than half the days') coded 0–3. A PHQ9 score of ≥ 10 (maximum score 27) was used to define depression symptoms, this has been widely validatedand corresponds to moderate-severe symptoms. PHQ2 scores were also calculated based on the first two PHQ9 symptoms to facilitate comparison with similar studies; a score of ≥ 3 indicates depression symptoms. A GAD7 score of ≥ 10 (maximum score 21) was used to define anxiety symptoms. To account for the potential impact of treatment on active symptoms, participants were also asked if they were currently receiving any (medical or other) treatment for depression. Additional mesures of depression were defined in which participants reporting treatment for depression were included as well as those positive for PHQ9/PHQ2.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^2028bca7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Aims

After presentation with urinary symptoms, an underlying neurological mechanism sometimes emerges subsequently. Increased awareness may bring earlier diagnosis, improving prognosis and outcomes.

Methods

A 2024 International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society think‐tank considered the clinical pathway for identification of an undiagnosed neurological or autonomic contribution precipitating urinary symptoms, and the implications for prognosis.

Results

Alongside adult‐onset neurogenic conditions, potential for missed diagnosis includes congenital and pediatric‐acquired neurogenic conditions, which may become symptomatic during a growth spurt due to spinal cord tethering. Detailed assessment is needed, also considering bowel and sexual dysfunction, with timely referral to neurology to reduce preventable progression of disease. In neurological assessment, control of micturition is often poorly characterized compared with other aspects of spinal cord function and the cranial nerves. Screening tools may be used to identify people who have increased likelihood of particular conditions, but currently available tools are either single‐system or population specific. In addition to the general pelvic examination, the assessment of sacral reflexes and pelvic sensations can suggest a neurological mechanism, though the sensitivity and specificity of the neuro‐urological examination is unknown. Including the results of the neuro‐perineal examination in the urodynamic report may improve the interpretation of the results and potentially support a neurological aetiology.

Conclusion

Future research should consider the value of neuro‐urological examination in diagnosis of occult neurological disease, the development of an occult neurology screening tool/risk scoring based on pelvic organ symptoms, and appropriateness of non‐neurologist practitioners requesting neurological investigations such as MRI scanning.

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^6d9a5bd5]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) screening tools — A number of short screening tools are designed and validated for IPV screening, and the Hurt, Insult, Threaten, Scream (HITS) tool in its verbal form is recommended for its ease of scoring and validation across multiple genders. This screen does not include a direct assessment of sexual abuse, as it focuses narrowly on physical violence and safety, and other tools assess all three areas traditionally grouped as IPV, including sexual abuse; but these tools were predominantly developed for and validated in women.

### Screening adults for HIV testing in the outpatient department: an assessment of tool performance in Malawi [^dc70cd15]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Little is known about screening tools for adults in high HIV burden contexts. We use exit survey data collected at outpatient departments in Malawi (n = 1038) to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of screening tools that include questions about sexual behavior and use of health services. We compare a full tool (seven relevant questions) to a reduced tool (five questions, excluding sexual behavior measures) and to standard of care (two questions, never tested for HIV or tested > 12 months ago, or seeking care for suspected STI). Suspect STI and ≥ 3 sexual partners were associated with HIV positivity, but had weak sensitivity and specificity. The full tool (using the optimal cutoff score of ≥ 3) would achieve 55.6% sensitivity and 84.9% specificity for HIV positivity; the reduced tool (optimal cutoff score ≥ 2) would achieve 59.3% sensitivity and 68.5% specificity; and standard of care 77.8% sensitivity and 47.8% specificity. Screening tools for HIV testing in outpatient departments do not offer clear advantages over standard of care.

### Female sexual dysfunction: ACOG practice bulletin clinical management guidelines for obstetrician-gynecologists, number 213 [^7ab3b30a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — Screening for female sexual dysfunction — obstetrician–gynecologists should initiate a clinical discussion of sexual function during routine care visits to identify issues and help destigmatize discussion; the use of a brief sexual function self-report checklist developed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System research framework during patient intake may help facilitate clinical discussion; another method is to use a generalized statement followed by a close-ended question and then an open-ended question; if sexual concerns are identified, a follow-up evaluation is recommended.

### Recognition and assessment of sexual dysfunction associated with depression [^8c4109ec]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Recognition of sexual dysfunction associated with depression or its treatment is critical for patient satisfaction and medication compliance. This report reviews relevant literature related to types of sexual problems, the etiology of sexual dysfunction, prevalence rates, barriers to assessment, and available instruments for evaluating sexual functioning in individuals with depression. Evaluation of sexual functioning should include examination of each phase of the sexual response cycle, with classification of sexual disorders as described in the DSM-IV. Sexual functioning requires both an adequate hormonal milieu and appropriate neurotransmitter functioning. Evaluation of sexual functioning should include a sexual history, current level of sexual functioning, history and current diagnoses of medical and psychiatric illnesses, evaluation of medications and/or other substances taken, indicated endocrine measures, and targeted physical examination. Appropriate evaluation of sexual functioning associated with depression could help reduce the enormous societal costs of this disorder.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^f747b325]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Identification of sexual abuse

The sensitivity of tests using the results of children anal and genital examination were estimated at best at 56% (95% CI: 33–77), and the specificity at 98% (95% CI: 91–100) (Table 4). The frequency of a variety of sexual behaviors of the child over the previous six months prior to assessment was not associated with sexual abuse. A list of 12 symptoms expressed by the child, such as difficulty getting to sleep, change to poor school performance, or unusually interest about sex matters, identified sexual abused children when caretakers reported at least three symptoms, with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 88%. The setting in which the studies took place were consultations with specialized team in child abuse, or when a control group was chosen, consultations at pediatric clinics for well-child examination or others complaints.

 CTQ Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.

Identification of psychological abuse

In a self-administered questionnaire, children were expected to indicate how often they experienced a given parental/caregiver behavior (Table 4). The scale was administered to children aged 13–15 years without specific complaints attending a school within the city of Colombo. At a cutoff of 95 and greater, 20 of 26 abused children were identified.

Identification of several forms of child maltreatment

The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire is a 70-item screening inventory that assesses self-reported experiences of abuse and neglect in childhood and adolescence (Table 4). Accuracy was estimated for each form of child maltreatment in an adolescent psychiatric population. Physical neglect was defined as the failure of caretakers to provide for a child's basic physical needs like food or clothing. The estimated sensitivity and specificity were the best for sexual abuse. The sensitivity were estimated at 86% (95% CI: 71–94), and the specificity at 76% (95% CI: 67–83).

Adaptation to screening

Identified tools were not adapted to screening because of low sensitivity and late identification of abused children when they have already serious consequences of maltreatment.

### The international index of erectile function (IIEF): a state-of-the-science review [^1b494df8]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2002). Low credibility.

The International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) is a widely used, multi-dimensional self-report instrument for the evaluation of male sexual function. It is has been recommended as a primary endpoint for clinical trials of erectile dysfunction (ED) and for diagnostic evaluation of ED severity. The IIEF was developed in conjunction with the clinical trial program for sildenafil, and has since been adopted as the 'gold standard' measure for efficacy assessment in clinical trials of ED. It has been linguistically validated in 32 languages and used as a primary endpoint in more than 50 clinical trials. This review summarizes early stages in the psychometric validation of the instrument, its subsequent adoption in randomized clinical trials with sildenafil and other ED therapies, and its use in classifying ED severity and prevalence. The IIEF meets psychometric criteria for test reliability and validity, has a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, and correlates well with other measures of treatment outcome. It has demonstrated consistent and robust treatment responsiveness in studies in USA, Europe and Asia, as well as in a wide range of etiological subgroups. Although only one direct comparator trial has been performed to date, the IIEF is also sensitive to therapeutic effects with treatment agents other than sildenafil. A severity classification for ED has recently been developed, in addition to a brief screening version of the instrument. This review includes the strengths as well as limitations of the IIEF, along with some potential areas for future research.

### Screening for sexual health concerns in survivors of gynecological cancer [^b998ab48]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the impact of a screening tool, the Brief Sexual Symptom Checklist for Women, on referral rates to physiotherapists, sexual counselors, and psychologists for sexual issues among patients attending the practices of two gynecological oncologists.

Methods

A prospective observational cohort study. A retrospective cohort of consecutive patients matched for age, diagnosis, and stage was used as a control group.

Results

Seventy-eight women were recruited to the intervention group. Diagnoses were endometrial carcinoma (38%), ovarian carcinoma (33%), and cervical carcinoma (24%). Sixty percent had completed adjuvant treatment, and 89% were married or in a de facto relationship. More than half of participants reported at least one sexual difficulty and were not satisfied with their sexual function. The most commonly reported sexual issue was decreased sexual desire. Twelve of 77 (15%) women screened in the intervention group were referred to a sexual counselor and/or a physiotherapist for a sexual issue. Twelve percent of women in the intervention group were referred to a sexual counselor, compared with 5% in the control group (p = 0.072). There was no difference in the proportion of women referred to a pelvic floor physiotherapist between the two groups (8% of women in the intervention group vs. 8% in the control group; p = 1.000).

Conclusions

In the current study, the Brief Sexual Symptom Checklist for Women identified sexual health concerns in over half of gynecological cancer survivors and resulted in a non-significant trend to more referrals for sexual counseling.

### Development and validation of a single-item screener for self-reporting sexual problems in U.S. adults [^34b1f4e7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brief self-assessment of sexual problems in a clinical context has the potential to improve care for patients through the ability to track trends in sexual problems over time and facilitate patient-provider communication about this important topic. However, instruments designed for research are typically too long to be practical in clinical practice.

Objective

To develop and validate a single-item self-report clinical screener that would capture common sexual problems and concerns for men and women.

Design

We created three candidate screener items, refined them through cognitive interviews, and administered them to a large sample. We compared the prevalence of responses to each item and explored the discrepancies between items. We evaluated the construct validity of the items by comparing them to scores on the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System® Sexual Function and Satisfaction (PROMIS® SexFS) measure.

Participants

Local patients participated in two rounds of cognitive interviews (n = 7 and n = 11). A probability-based random sample of U.S. adults comprised the item-testing sample (n = 3517).

Main Measures

The items were as follows: 1) a yes/no item on any sexual problems or concerns ("general screener"), 2) a yes/no item on problems experienced for 3 months or more during the past 12 months, with a list of examples ("long list screener"), and 3) an item identical to the long list screener except that examples appeared individually as response options and respondents could check all that applied ("checklist screener").

Key Results

All of the screeners tested showed evidence for basic validity and had minimal missing data. Percentages of women and men endorsing the screeners were 10% and 15% (general); 20% and 17% (long list); and 38% and 30% (checklist), respectively. Participants who endorsed the screeners had lower function compared to those who did not endorse them.

Conclusions

We recommend the checklist screener for its specificity and ability to identify specific problems associated with decreased sexual function.

### The sexual health inventory for men (SHIM): a 5-year review of research and clinical experience [^8b216580]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2005). Low credibility.

The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) is a widely used scale for screening and diagnosis of erectile dysfunction (ED) and severity of ED in clinical practice and research. In reviewing the SHIM-related literature, we sought to provide a compendium of studies in which the SHIM was used, to provide a systematic framework for organizing and evaluating the studies, and to provide a status report on the SHIM and its impact on the management of male sexual dysfunction. Using a Medline search, we found that the SHIM was an integral measure in at least 21 studies on the prevalence of ED, 23 studies on the efficacy of ED interventions, and eight other (mainly correlational) studies. The quantity of research and quality of scholarship on the SHIM provide testimony to its positive impact on understanding and improving male sexual function. These scientific contributions are likely to remain influential in coming years.

### The quantitative ADAM questionnaire: a new tool in quantifying the severity of hypogonadism [^a6aa0a25]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Although it is estimated that 40% of men over the age of 45 have low testosterone, our current screening tools lack the specificity to identify most of these patients. Often many of the symptoms of hypogonadism are subtle, with an insidious onset. Consequently, improved surveillance and implementation of routine screening of "at-risk" males could conceivably benefit otherwise unrecognized patients.

Currently, one of the most widely used screening tools is the Saint Louis University ADAM questionnaire. This questionnaire does not allow for the quantification of responses. As a result, it is difficult for clinicians to assess the degree of improvement in symptoms after initiating therapy. Heinemann, et al. 21 have proposed another test, the Aging Male Symptom (AMS) rating, a battery of 17 questions graded on a Likert Scale of 1–5. Unlike the ADAM questionnaire, the AMS questionnaire allows one to quantify the degree of improvement in hypogonadal symptoms after initiating therapy. However, like the ADAM questionnaire, the AMS lacks specificity. Moore et al. 22 conducted a study of 1174 androgen deficient males being treated with testosterone and used the AMS to assess response to treatment. The authors found a sensitivity of 96% but a specificity of only 30%. Additionally, some authors have criticized the AMS as excessively long and cumbersome, making its practical application difficult. 23

### A modified Delphi study to identify screening items to assess neglected sexual side-effects following prostate cancer treatment [^ddba99d6]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

A literature review indicated a few original publications on the NSSEs after PCa treatment, but only two publications address issues on how to assess the NSSEs. Both studies used an informal non-validated outcome measure to determine the extent of the NSSE. Other common PCa related sexual dysfunction outcome measures includes the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) and the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). The EPIC and IIEF are both validated instruments and both were recommended at the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine in 2015. However, both instruments only address general sexual dysfunction and there are no questionnaires to assist in diagnosing the NSSEs after PCa. There was thus a need to develop and validate an instrument that will effectively confirm the evidence of the NSSE after PCa treatment.

The aim of this study was to bring together a group of experts to develop an instrument that could be used as a self-administered clinical screening tool to identify NSSE 1–10 years after PCa treatment. A Delphi technique study provides such an opportunity where experts can give controlled feedback to develop a group opinion on a specific subject. The Delphi technique has proven to be a reliable measurement instrument to develop and to refine a new concept, and to direct future research. The Delphi technique is also a cost effective and efficient method to collect information from an expert panel of participants, and is ideally suited for electronic administration.

The study explored the questions that should be included in a screening tool to investigate the NSSE after PCa and it sought gather consensus on the appropriate wording of statements from a group of experts to include in the NSSE screening tool.

### Providing quality family planning services in the United States: recommendations of the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (revised 2024) [^602f88aa]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Sexual history and screening for reproductive desires — Ensure that the patient understands that they can decline answering questions or sharing information; respect their right to decline. Avoid any judgment of the patient's behavior or preferences. Avoid using terms that make assumptions about sexual behavior or orientation. Ensure shared understanding around terminology and pronunciation to avoid confusion. Use a sensitive tone that normalizes the topics being discussed. The 6 Ps, described in Exhibit 6, can be a useful way to remember the main elements of the sexual history. Providers should be prepared to answer patients' questions and concerns about sex and make referrals to appropriate care. Patients experiencing sexual concerns or dysfunction can be referred to a qualified sex therapist or a physical therapist. Online resources such as Bedsider.org offer sources of additional information and sex-positive perspectives on sexuality and sexual health for both patients and providers. People should be made aware of services available on-site and by referral. There are two main frameworks for approaching screening for reproductive desires and related care: (1) reproductive desires and (2) service based. Providers and health care settings may select a tool or suite of tools to use based on where these tools have been tested, the population(s) being served, and health record considerations. It is generally recommended to screen patients at first encounter and then on a regular basis as determined by a schedule that providers or their organizations create based on patient needs, performance indicators, and other factors. It is not recommended to screen at every clinical encounter. Multiple studies show that screening for reproductive desires can increase counseling rates and patient satisfaction. Screening for reproductive desires is not synonymous with reproductive life planning (RLP), the approach endorsed in the previous QFP recommendations. The RLP framework encourages providers to work with all patients to identify their reproductive goals and construct a life plan based on these goals, including shaping their clinical care. This approach is no longer endorsed.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on sexual and reproductive health-2021 update: male sexual dysfunction [^fb9ff43f]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

The present summary of the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines is based on the latest guidelines on male sexual health published in March 2021, with a last comprehensive update in January 2021.

Objective

To present a summary of the 2021 version of the EAU guidelines on sexual and reproductive health.

Evidence Acquisition

A literature review was performed up to January 2021. The guidelines were updated, and a strength rating for each recommendation was included based on either a systematic review of the evidence or a consensus opinion from the expert panel.

Evidence Synthesis

Late-onset hypogonadism is a clinical condition in the ageing male combining low levels of circulating testosterone and specific symptoms associated with impaired hormone production and/or action. A comprehensive diagnostic and therapeutic work-up, along with screening recommendations and contraindications, is provided. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the persistent inability to attain and maintain an erection sufficient to permit satisfactory sexual performance. Along with a detailed basic and advanced diagnostic approach, a novel decision-making algorithm for treating ED in order to better tailor therapy to individual patients is provided. The EAU guidelines have adopted the definition of premature ejaculation (PE), which has been developed by the International Society for Sexual Medicine. After the subtype of PE has been defined, patient's expectations should be discussed thoroughly and pharmacotherapy must be considered as the first-line treatment for patients with lifelong PE, whereas treating the underlying cause must be the initial goal for patients with acquired PE. Haemospermia is defined as the appearance of blood in the ejaculate. Several reasons of haemospermia have been acknowledged; the primary goal over the management work-up is to exclude malignant conditions and treat any other underlying cause.

Conclusions

The 2021 guidelines on sexual and reproductive health summarise the most recent findings, and advise in terms of diagnosis and treatment of male hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction for their use in clinical practice. These guidelines reflect the multidisciplinary nature of their management.

Patient Summary

Updated European Association of Urology guidelines on sexual and reproductive health are presented, addressing the diagnosis and treatment of the most prevalent conditions in men. Patients must be fully informed of all relevant diagnostic and therapeutic options and, together with their treating physicians, decide on optimal personalised management strategies.

### Emerging issues in male adolescent sexual and reproductive health care [^cbc9b342]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Screening and evaluation for sexual dysfunction in male adolescents — young patients may not disclose concerns, so "the onus is on the pediatrician to screen for sexual problems", and clinicians "may want to explore whether male patients have unrealistic expectations or misinformation concerning sex and sexual activity". When discussing medications, "pediatricians should discuss sexual dysfunction as an adverse effect and screen for sexual dysfunction in patients taking medications routinely or on a long-term basis", and "identification of sexual dysfunction is an indicator to screen for other health problems". Patients "may still be receptive to screening", and pediatricians "may use standardized tools such as the International Index of Erectile Function 5 and the Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool, which were validated to screen men 18 years and older". When dysfunction is identified, "a complete medical and psychosocial history and physical examination, including genital examination with sexual maturity rating, are essential to evaluation". Pediatricians "may also screen patients concerning illicit use of any medications or supplements (prescription as well as over the counter), including pharmacologic agents for ED and performance-enhancing substances (ie, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine or supplements)".

### Guidelines for assessment of and intervention with persons with disabilities [^f1d4fea1]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Disability-related abuse — screening and practice recommendations emphasize proactive inquiry and tailored tools: Given that most people do not disclose abuse and the majority of individuals with disabilities report that a healthcare provider never asked about the abuse, inquiring about abuse is important to consider as a standard component of psychological assessment, and some researchers indicate that use of a screening tool that includes disability-specific questions, such as the AAS-D (Abuse Assessment Screen-Disability), increases disclosure compared with tools without disability-specific questions or professional judgment alone; however, Mikton, Maguire, and Shakespeare and Lund caution that research validating the effects of interventions is limited. Recommended clinician actions are: Know the signs, symptoms, and dynamics of disability-related violence, including the unique areas of vulnerability noted above; Screen for abuse and neglect, and when appropriate (see Oschwald et al., 2009 and Robinson-Whelen et al., 2010, for use of a computer-assisted tool for disclosure); Document the history of abuse and neglect; Discuss safety planning with clients, such as having a safe retreat, back-up communication devices, and extra medications or supplies; also include assessment of disaster/emergency preparedness; Maintain current contact information for accessible local domestic violence/sexual assault programs and disability service providers (e.g. Centers for Independent Living); Learn state mandatory reporting requirements for violence against people with disabilities including children, older adults, and dependent adults, and when appropriate involve the person experiencing the abuse throughout the reporting process; Be aware of potential long-term consequences of reporting, including possible deterioration in quality of care and need for accessible domestic violence shelters.

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) — screening and assessment indicate that several organizations recommend identifying GSM through a case-finding approach by screening patients for symptoms with routine questions, but few tools have been validated for GSM assessment and existing tools are limited to vulvovaginal symptoms. The urinary symptoms associated with GSM are linked with other common urologic conditions in older patients, such as overactive bladder (OAB), making identification, evaluation, and treatment complex. A causal relationship between reduced hormone levels and urinary symptoms remains controversial, and some have even questioned whether GSM meets the definition of a disease syndrome, creating uncertainty around optimal screening, identification, evaluation, and management.

Diagnostic Considerations Specific microbiologic diagnosis of N. gonorrhoeae infection should be performed for all persons at risk for or suspected of having gonorrhea; a specific diagnosis can potentially reduce complications, reinfections, and transmission. Culture, NAAT, and POC NAAT, such as GeneXpert, are available for detecting genitourinary infection with N. gonorrhoeae; culture requires endocervical or urethral swab specimens. Culture is also available for detecting rectal, oropharyngeal, and conjunctival gonococcal infection. NAATs and POC NAATs allow for the widest variety of FDA-cleared specimen types, including endocervical and vaginal swabs and urine for women, urethral swabs and urine for men, and rectal swabs and pharyngeal swabs for men and women. NAAT sensitivity for detecting N.

gonorrhoeae from urogenital and nongenital anatomic sites is superior to culture but varies by NAAT type. For urogenital infections, optimal specimen types for gonorrhea screening using NAATs include first-void urine for men and vaginal swab specimens for women. Because of its high specificity and sensitivity, a Gram stain of urethral discharge or secretions that demonstrate polymorphonuclear leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci can be considered diagnostic for infection with. N. gonorrhoeae among symptomatic men. However, because of lower sensitivity, a negative Gram stain should not be considered sufficient for ruling out infection among asymptomatic men. Infection detection by using Gram stain of endocervical, pharyngeal, and rectal specimens also is insensitive and is not recommended. MB or GV stain of urethral secretions is an alternative POC diagnostic test with performance characteristics similar to Gram stain.

Gonococcal infection is diagnosed among symptomatic men by documenting the presence of a WBC-containing intracellular purple diplococci in MB or GV smears. All persons who receive a diagnosis of gonorrhea should be tested for other STIs, including chlamydia, syphilis, and HIV. Those persons whose HIV test results are negative should be offered HIV PrEP.

### Assessment of female sexual dysfunction: review of validated methods [^f3787809]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review validated methods for the assessment of female sexual function in clinical trials.

Design

Evaluation of recent peer-review literature on sexual function assessment in women.

Setting

International conference on androgen insufficiency in women.

Patient(S)

Women with sexual dysfunction due to androgen insufficiency or other causes.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Measures of sexual function in women.

Result(S)

Design and measurement problems in the assessment of sexual functioning in women have limited clinical trials in female sexual dysfunction. Objective measures, such as vaginal photoplethysmography or Duplex ultrasound, have been used in some studies but lack standardization and are unsuitable for use in large-scale clinical trials. A variety of interview methods, validated questionnaires, and event log measures have been used for assessing sexual function in recent trials of androgen replacement therapy. Each of these methods has distinct advantages and disadvantages, although validated questionnaires have provided the most reliable findings to date. Recent Food and Drug Administration guidelines on assessment of female sexual function in clinical trials are critically reviewed.

Conclusion(S)

Despite their prevalence and clinical significance, sexual problems in women have often been neglected in clinical trials. A major obstacle in the design of clinical trials in this area has been the need for sensitive and reliable measures of outcome. Of the currently available measures, self-reported event logs or questionnaires are best suited for research or clinical assessment of female sexual function.

### Neglected medium-term and long-term consequences of labour and childbirth: a systematic analysis of the burden, recommended practices, and a way forward [^f4bb651e]. The Lancet: Global Health (2024). High credibility.

A key theme across the guidelines was the need for providers to consider a broad range of functional, emotional, behavioural, sexual, and other quality-of-life issues affecting women in the postpartum period. Several guidelines recommended systematic clinical assessments or formal screening using validated tools to identify those who have or are at risk of adverse conditions. We synthesised recommendations relating to clinical assessment and screening into a simplified list to help providers detect or exclude these conditions (figure 2). These practices are relevant to providers working in postpartum care, as well as those working in other health-care services in which they encounter women beyond the standard 6-week postpartum period. Opportunities to identify these conditions as early as possible should not be missed, so treatment can be commenced promptly. An overarching message is that timely, women-centred, and evidence-based care is the most effective preventive (or reparative) strategy for many complications.

### Suitability of measurements used to assess mental health outcomes in men and women trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation: a systematic review [^f4c3d23e]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2016). Medium credibility.

Trafficking is a global human rights violation with multiple and complex mental health consequences. Valid and reliable mental health assessment tools are needed to inform health-care provision. We reviewed mental health assessment tools used in research with men and women trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. We searched nine electronic databases (PsycINFO, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Embase, Assia, the Web of Science, Global Health, Google Scholar, and Open Grey) and hand-searched the reference lists of relevant identified studies. Seven studies were included in this Review. Six of the studies screened for post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety; one study screened for harmful use or abuse of alcohol and used a diagnostic tool to assess post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Two studies included men in their sample population. Although the reported prevalence of mental health problems was high, little information was provided about the validity, reliability, and cultural appropriateness of assessment tools. Further research is needed to determine which assessment tools are culturally appropriate, valid, and reliable for trafficked people.

### Sexual problems in the gynecology clinic: are we making a mountain out of a molehill? [^0c41a2c5]. International Urogynecology Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

This study aims to assess the prevalence of sexual problems in general gynecology and urogynecology clinics using a simple screening tool and to compare the prevalence between patients presenting with gynecology or urogynecology complaints.

Methods

Patients attending (uro)gynecology clinics completed three screening questions for sexual problems to be assessed. A fourth question was later introduced to address sexual problems which bother them. Student's t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression were used.

Results

Of 1,194 women, 37% had a sexual complaint. Seventeen percent volunteered this information as part of their main complaint, while the remaining only admitted it on questioning. The last 290 questionnaires included the question on "bother". Of these, 37% had a sexual complaint and only 45% found them bothersome. Multivariate analysis showed that urogynecology complaints were significantly associated with sexual complaints.

Conclusions

As most women only volunteer symptoms when asked directly, clinicians should be vigilant in identifying sexual problems but always establish the question of bother to avoid over-diagnosis.

### Summary of findings from the FDA regulatory science forum on measuring sexual dysfunction in depression trials [^59f5cf13]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Sexual dysfunction is a significant treatment-emergent adverse reaction to the serotonergic antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]). However, the rate of sexual dysfunction is often underestimated in registration trials, which have relied on unsolicited reports. We conducted a literature search to examine the rates of sexual dysfunction with SSRIs/SNRIs when these rates were ascertained by structured questionnaires or standardized instruments. Additionally, we conducted exploratory analyses of major depressive disorder (MDD) registration trial data.

Data Sources

For the literature search, we used the PubMed and EMBASE databases, with a cutoff date of April 1, 2011. We included all the SSRIs and SNRIs that at the time had been approved for the treatment of MDD. For each of these drugs, a search was conducted with the following terms: sexual dysfunction, SD, sexual adverse effects, desire, arousal, excitement, and orgasm. For the exploratory analyses of US Food and Drug Administration in-house trial data, we searched our database for short-term (6–8 weeks), randomized, placebo-controlled MDD monotherapy trials of approved drugs included in New Drug Application submissions that used a standardized instrument to assess sexual function.

Study Selection

For the literature search, we initially found a total of 123 nonduplicate articles, some of which included multiple studies. After screening based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria (and to remove duplicate trial-level data), we were left with 7 articles representing 11 unique studies in which sexual dysfunction was assessed with direct questioning or standardized instruments. The Changes in Sexual Functioning Questionnaire-Short-Form (CSFQ-14) and Arizona Sexual Experiences Scale (ASEX) were the only instruments represented. For the exploratory analyses of in-house MDD trial data, we found controlled studies using either the CSFQ-14 (6 trials) or ASEX (5 trials).

Data Extraction

For the literature search, we were able to pool the results for the studies that included direct questioning. For the studies that used standardized instruments to assess sexual function, we simply describe our findings. For the exploratory analyses of in-house MDD trial data, we constructed a dataset containing all subject-level CSFQ-14 or ASEX item scores for each of the trials as well as demographic and other relevant variables. For each treatment or placebo group, analyses were performed on pooled data, including multiple studies, and on individual studies.

Results

For our literature search, regardless of which method was used to assess sexual function, the data from these articles were informative and showed the expected effects on sexual function with SSRIs/SNRIs. However, for our exploratory analyses, no trend was observed in CSFQ-14 or ASEX results for individual drugs or drug classes.

Conclusions

These results raise the question as to why the CSFQ-14 and ASEX appeared to perform well in the published studies but not in our exploratory analyses of in-house MDD trial data. We discuss possible reasons and solutions.

### Screening for sexual dissatisfaction among people with type 2 diabetes in primary care [^c3ae4700]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

The identification and discussion of sexual care needs in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in primary care is currently insufficient. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of sexual dissatisfaction, sexual problems and need for help by using a screening instrument among people with T2DM in primary care.

Methods

Data were collected in 45 general practices in the Netherlands from January 2015 to February 2016. The Brief Sexual Symptom Checklist (BSSC) was used to screen among 40–75 year old men and women.

Results

In total, 786 people with T2DM (66.5% men) were screened. The prevalence of sexual dissatisfaction was 36.6%, significantly higher among men than among women (41.1% vs. 27.8%). Sexually dissatisfied men most often reported erectile dysfunction (71.6%); for sexually dissatisfied women, low sexual desire (52.8%) and lubrication problems (45.8%) were most common. More than half of all dissatisfied people had a need for care (61.8%), significantly more men than women (66.8% vs. 47.2%).

Conclusions

One third of people with T2DM is sexually dissatisfied and more than half of these people report a need for help. The BSSC could be used a tool to proactively identify sexually dissatisfied people in primary care.

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^89d22ffb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

How Should This Man Be Evaluated?

Does This Man Have Clinically Evident Androgen Deficiency?

The first step is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. There is significant overlap of the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Because of his report of depressed mood and fatigue, the patient was assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 screening tool that screened negative for major depression.

Careful assessment for symptoms and signs that are more specific for hypogonadism is a key first step in the evaluation (Table 1). In the initial cross-sectional report from the European Male Ageing Study, 3 sexual symptoms (low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections) were the only symptoms (out of a total of 19 candidate symptoms) that were consistently associated with a low serum testosterone in a syndromic fashion; diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for a low serum testosterone concentration. Of note, this epidemiology study cannot determine causality. Because reduced sexual activity has been proposed to lower serum testosterone, the observed association of sexual symptoms with low serum testosterone concentrations in the European Male Ageing Study might reflect reverse causation. In the European Male Aging Study, the prevalence of these sexual symptoms was 25% to 35% even in men with a normal serum testosterone. His symptoms of fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value. They may be caused by systemic disease (see below). However, the constellation of symptoms of sexual dysfunction and low serum testosterone justify further evaluation for androgen deficiency.

Table 1.
Clinical features of testosterone deficiency a in men

The patient lacks more specific clinical signs of hypogonadism (Table 1), but these findings, such as new-onset or increased gynecomastia that is almost always characterized by breast pain and tenderness, deficient male pattern body hair (that is generally only seen in longstanding hypogonadism), hot flashes that might occur with acute onset of hypogonadism (eg, bilateral orchidectomy), and/or small (< 15 cc) testes are not common in hypogonadal middle-aged or older men. Although small testes are an uncommon finding in older men with newly diagnosed hypogonadism, Klinefelter syndrome, the most common cause of classic organic hypogonadism, is typically characterized by very small testes (≤ 4 cc each), is underdiagnosed (by 50% or more), and might not be diagnosed until middle or older age.

### Female sexual health: barriers to optimal outcomes and a roadmap for improved patient-clinician communications [^41f02ca3]. Journal of Women's Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background: Although sexual health can be considered a vital sign for overall health, several barriers prevent women from receiving proper medical counseling, support, and/or care for their sexual health needs and concerns.

Methods: Experts in sexual health compiled research and experience on the impediments to women receiving adequate assessment and treatment for their sexual health. Specific solutions and a roadmap for overcoming such barriers and improving patient–clinician communication are presented.

Results: Social stigma around female sexuality remains in Western culture and as a result, women often avoid and/or are embarrassed to discuss their sexual health with their health care professionals (HCPs). Moreover, midlife women are typically unaware or have misconceptions about conditions that may adversely impact their sexual life, such as genitourinary syndrome of menopause and hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Without understanding there may be underlying medical conditions, there is also a lack of awareness that safe and effective treatments are available. Lack of training, tools, time, and limited treatment options impede HCPs from providing women with necessary sexual health support. Educating women, training HCPs, and providing communication tools to HCPs can facilitate effective dialog between patients and HCPs. More specifically, HCPs can be trained to initiate and maintain a sexual health conversation in a manner that is comfortable for women to convey sexual health needs and concerns, and for HCPs to correctly identify, diagnose, and treat the sexual problems of their female patients.

Conclusions: Solutions exist to address the barriers currently impeding patient–clinician interactions around sexual health.

### Care of the adolescent after an acute sexual assault [^155d8d68]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent sexual assault — follow-up care and mental health support emphasizes coordinated referrals, consented communication, timely visits, and screening. Because patients treated in emergency departments often do not return for follow-up care, the emergency treatment team may refer an adolescent victim to his or her medical home as well as a specialty treatment center, and such communication generally is permitted under federal regulations; however, the treating physician should secure the consent of the adolescent before communicating with the primary care provider or specialty center. Follow-up usually includes a visit within 1 to 2 weeks of the initial presentation to assess injuries and adherence to medications, determine the victim's mental health functioning and need for any additional psychological counseling, and arrange for appropriate referrals, with reassessment for STIs as needed depending on medications given and whether the adolescent has had consensual sexual activity since the assault. At follow-up, victims of sexual assault should be assessed for mental health sequelae, and a 4-item posttraumatic stress disorder screening tool assessing symptoms of startle, physiologic arousal, anger, and emotional numbness has been used with some success in adults ages 22 to 46 years; psychotropic medications may be required in some instances. Resources and treatments include RAINN as an excellent resource for victims and health care providers and studies showing that trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy is useful to aid adolescents who have been sexually assaulted; under some circumstances, funding may be available to pay for necessary tests and treatments through the Victims of Crime Act.

### Results of a World Health Organization scoping of sexual dysfunction-related guidelines: what exists and what is needed [^72eca88a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Sexual dysfunction has long been overlooked in the broader context of sexual and reproductive health services. As a result, and in the absence of international sexual dysfunction treatment guidelines, recommendations have instead been developed by a variety of professional associations, worldwide.

Aim

We conducted a mapping of existing recommendations addressing a wide array of conditions related to sexual function/dysfunction.

Methods

We contacted 25 professional associations from around the world and held an online open call for guidelines.

Outcomes

Eligible submissions had to provide recommendations on treatment related to male or female sexual dysfunction.

Results

Twelve guidelines from 11 associations were included. Of the 195 recommendations extracted, 61% were related to men, 53% were related specifically to treatment, and 48% did some form of evidence assessment.

Conclusion

Recommendations from this exercise are provided for WHO, international and national research institutions, ministries of health, and professional associations.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men and women — sex-specific instruments — The consortium recommends tailoring measurement by sex, recommending the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (ICIQ-FLUTS) for women (Number of questions: 25) and the International Prostate Symptoms Screening (IPSS) for men (Number of questions: 8); since no other questionnaires have been validated in both sexes, the IPSS was chosen for men and the ICIQ-FLUTS for screening women, both tools are validated, highly reliable, and screen for severity of symptoms and quality of life (QOL), and because IPSS validation in women found the single QOL question not reliable and it has not been validated in women in English, the ICIQ-FLUTS was determined to be better suited for studies evaluating voiding dysfunction in women.

### An item response theory analysis of the sexual compulsivity scale and its correspondence with the hypersexual disorder screening inventory among a sample of highly sexually active gay and bisexual men [^f836e182]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Numerous scales and assessments are available to assess sexual compulsivity (SC).

Aim

This study sought to conduct an item response theory (IRT) analysis of the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS) to provide evidence about its measurement precision at the various levels of the SC construct in a sample of highly sexually active gay and bisexual men (GBM).

Methods

SCS data from a sample of 202 GBM who are highly sexually active but who vary in their experiences of SC symptoms were modeled using Samejima's polytomous graded response IRT model. To describe the performance of the SCS relative to the Hypersexual Disorder Screening Inventory (HDSI), SCS scores were compared with participants' corresponding HDSI results to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy.

Main Outcome Measures

This study examined the correspondence between the SCS and the HDSI, a diagnostic instrument for the screening of hypersexuality.

Results

IRT analyses indicated that, although two of the SCS items had low reliability, the SCS as a whole was reliable across much of the SC continuum. Scores on the SCS and the HDSI were highly correlated; however, no potential cutoffs on the SCS corresponded strongly with the polythetic scoring criteria of the HDSI.

Conclusion

Comparisons of SCS scores with HDSI results indicated that the SCS itself could not serve as a substitute for the HDSI and would incorrectly classify a substantial number of individuals' levels of hypersexuality. However, the SCS could be a useful screening tool to provide a preliminary screening of people at risk for meeting criteria on the HDSI. Combining the SCS and the HDSI may be an appropriate evaluation strategy in classifying GBM as negative on both (i.e., "non-hypersexual/non-SC"), positive on the SCS only (i.e., "at risk"), and positive on both the SCS and the HDSI (i.e., "problematic hypersexuality/SC").

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD research recommendations — psychosocial, mental health, and socioeconomic priorities emphasize that studies are needed to validate and compare existing tools for assessing patient-reported outcomes in people with ADPKD, to use an incidence-based approach for examining anxiety and depression linked to ADPKD including analysis of geographic, cultural, and other demographic differences, and to assess the effects of body dysmorphia on mental health and sexual dysfunction. Studies are needed to assess various interventions to improve mental health and psychological aspects of chronic pain and sexual dysfunction, to assess the optimal psychological support for people with ADPKD and their families considering age at diagnosis, and research is needed to develop and evaluate online tools that allow people with ADPKD to quantitatively assess the impact of body image and sexual dysfunction on psychosocial well-being while accounting for cultural and regional variations. Studies are needed to assess the financial and societal burden of ADPKD to inform policy and coverage decisions and to assess the variation in coverage and healthcare systems throughout the world.

### Screening adults for HIV testing in the outpatient department: an assessment of tool performance in Malawi [^6af857f0]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Data Analysis

We used questions from the exit survey to approximate a screening tool; questions that captured factors hypothetically associated with HIV risk were included in the analysis.

Operationalizing the Screening Tool

We included seven variables in the full screening tool. We included suspected sexually transmitted infections (STI) (defined as attending the facility for an STI) because STIs are a known risk factor for seroconversion, and attending the facility for malaria-like symptoms since malaise and fever have previously been associated with recent HIV seroconversion in similar settings. We also included "overlooked" groups who do not have a standard entry point for HIV testing: women below the age of 25 (since women often test during pregnancy at antenatal visits), and men over the age of 24 because men almost exclusively seek care via OPD for acute needs, therefore if they are not engaged at OPD they may not be reached. These groups are also important for the evolving HIV epidemic in the region: both men and young women have higher HIV positivity, test less often and may not be well-served by current HIV testing modalities. Finally, never tested for HIV or tested > 12-months ago was included as SOC. The response to each tool question was scored as a 0/1 (no/yes), and these responses were summed to create the total screening tool score.

We also dichotomized two questions with continuous response options (number of recent health visits, and number of recent sexual partners). Cut points were selected based on association with HIV status: we assessed the "inflection point" at which these items became strongly associated with HIV positivity (e.g. having two or more sexual partners was not significantly associated but having three or more sexual partners was).

AUA guideline — guideline statements for erectile dysfunction (ED) state: Men presenting with symptoms of ED should undergo a thorough medical, sexual and psychosocial history, a physical examination, and selective laboratory testing (Clinical Principle). For the man with ED, validated questionnaires are recommended to assess the severity of ED, to measure treatment effectiveness, and to guide future management (Expert Opinion). Men should be counseled that ED is a risk marker for underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other health conditions that may warrant evaluation and treatment (Clinical Principle). In men with ED, morning serum total testosterone levels should be measured (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). For some men with ED, specialized testing and evaluation may be necessary to guide treatment (Expert Opinion). For men being treated for ED, referral to a mental health professional should be considered to promote treatment adherence, reduce performance anxiety, and integrate treatments into a sexual relationship (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Obesity and sexuality in women [^401d8bc6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Sexual health is an important part of an individual's overall health. This article presents the definitions and classifications of female sexual dysfunction (FSD), emphasizes the importance of obtaining a sexual health assessment, and describes the tools that can be used for this assessment. The impact of obesity on reproductive health over a women's entire life span (in the family-planning years, reproductive years, and menopause years) is described. The treatment of obesity will have a positive effect on a woman's sexual health, with a likely improvement in FSD and a decrease in risk factors related to contraception, pregnancy, infertility, and menopause.

### Sexual identity inequalities in the co-occurrence of poor mental health and health risk behaviours-a national cross-sectional study [^600161c4]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Measures

Sexual identities

Based on self-reported answers on sexuality (from eight options listed in Additional File 1: Table S1), participants were categorised into the following: (1) Completely heterosexual, (2) Bisexual and (3) Gay or lesbian. Those who answered 'other', 'do not know' and 'preferred not to say' were excluded (N = 154). Individuals who identified as mainly heterosexual were also excluded from this study. While mainly heterosexual individuals have increased risk for mental health problems compared to heterosexual peers, there is ongoing debate on whether they should be considered a separate sexual identity category or combined with bisexual individuals, especially among adolescents. For this study, we included those who identified as completely heterosexual, bisexual and gay/lesbian.

Mental health (MH)

In this study, MH refers to symptoms of depression and anxiety. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) is a commonly and widely used brief screening tool comprising 5 subscales (with each subscale including 5 items for a total of 25 items) that assess a range of behavioural and emotional problems in children. The SDQ is used to assess positive and negative attributes in children over the previous 6 months. In this study, we used the SDQ emotional symptoms subscale (SDQ-E) comprising 5 items or questions (for e.g. are you often unhappy?) relating to depression, worry, fear, nervousness and somatic symptoms, which assesses symptoms of psychological distress in the preceding 6 months. The SDQ-E is widely validated and routinely used to capture symptoms of depression and anxiety in the general population and clinical settings. Further, the SDQ-E measure has been validated against diagnostic measures of depression or anxiety disorders and is an established screening tool to distinguish those individuals who meet the diagnostic criteria for depression and anxiety from those who do not. For each of the 5 items, participants could respond with not true, somewhat true or certainly true (scored 0, 1 and 2, respectively). Total scores were calculated, ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more emotional problems (depression and anxiety). Total scores were categorised into a binary variable based on recommended cut-off points indicating participants with 'close to average' (< 6) vs. 'high/very high levels' (≥ 6) of difficulties. The internal consistency of the SDQ emotional symptoms subscale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and was found to be acceptable (α > 0.8).

### Results of a World Health Organization scoping of sexual dysfunction-related guidelines: what exists and what is needed [^6e93986a]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of this mapping exercise was to identify existing guidelines related to sexual dysfunctions. We found that guidelines addressing male sexual dysfunctions were more numerous and addressed specific conditions, as compared with guidelines addressing women's sexual functioning. This likely reflects the greater attention, research, and funding traditionally afforded to understanding and addressing men's sexual functioning. The sexual dysfunction conditions relevant to women, which are now located in a new sexual health chapter of the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11), as well as a growing comfort globally with acknowledging women's sexuality at all stages in life, will hopefully provide impetus for additional research and guideline development for women.

The content was also different between recommendations for men vs women, and is likely a result of different professional associations developing these guidelines in the tone appropriate for their memberships. Finally, a large percentage of recommendations were developed based on "expert opinion", that is no objective and systematic evaluation of the evidence. This could be the result of several factors. First, some professional organizations may not have the resources to undertake the rigorous systematic reviews of the literature required to collect, review, and grade the available evidence. However, second, the benefit of conducting a systematic review is limited when there is not sufficient evidence in the literature. As such, for certain under-researched sexual dysfunctions or treatments (particularly for women, as described previously), recommendations developed through expert opinion and consensus processes may be the most pragmatic way to provide evidence-informed services. Stronger recommendation development processes follow improved evidence, but robust research again requires acknowledgment of the importance of sexual functioning to overall health and well-being and corresponding funding and prioritization.

### Sexual symptoms in aging men indicate poor life satisfaction and increased health service consumption [^ade3f36b]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The deterioration of sexual, physical, and mental performance in aging men has been used to measure the clinical manifestations of androgen decrement. However, their prevalence and relation to coexisting morbidities are unknown.

Methods

All men in Turku, Finland, aged 40 to 69 years (n = 28,622) in 2000 were mailed a questionnaire that included questions on general health, sociobehavioral factors, and the Aging Male Symptoms scale (17 questions, each yielded 1 to 5 points, from 1, no symptoms to 5, very severe).

Results

The participation rate was 54% (15,496 returned questionnaires). Moderate or severe sexual symptoms (decreased frequency of erections, libido, and potency) were observed in 20% of men of the youngest age group of 40 to 44 years. The proportion of men with significant symptoms increased linearly with age up to 67% in the oldest age group (65 to 69 years). Other symptoms did not show a similar age trend. On multifactor analysis, sexual symptoms were independently associated with decreased life satisfaction and increased visits to the physician after adjustment for coexisting morbidities. Visits to the physician were up to three times more frequent among men with moderate to severe sexual symptoms than among those with mild or no symptoms.

Conclusions

Sexual symptoms in aging men are common and associated with decreased life satisfaction and an increased number of visits to the physician. These symptoms deserve more attention in the workup of aging male patients, because they offer a simple screening tool to detect impaired well-being associated with increased consumption of health services.
