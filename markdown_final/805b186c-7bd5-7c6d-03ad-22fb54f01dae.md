## Question

What can cause pressure in ears

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what can cause pressure in the ears. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the anatomic compartments where "pressure" can arise: external ear, middle ear, and inner ear. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism, such as barotrauma, Eustachian tube dysfunction, effusions, inner ear hydrops, structural lesions, and systemic or environmental contributors. Next, I will prioritize the most common and clinically urgent causes, and finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and highlight red flags that warrant urgent evaluation, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the anatomic framework so I don't miss anything. Ear pressure can reflect problems in the external ear (pinna or canal), the middle ear (tympanic cavity and mastoid), or the inner ear (endolymphatic system and vestibule/cochlea), and symptoms often overlap, so I need to keep all three in mind while I proceed [^notfound].

> I will now examine barotrauma as a leading cause, especially in travelers and divers. Middle ear barotrauma occurs when ambient pressure changes outpace the ability to equalize middle ear pressure, producing fullness, pain, and sometimes hearing changes; this is common in aviation and scuba diving, and prevention hinges on timely equalization maneuvers and avoidance when congested [^f4bb9e85] [^d9b3d4a2] [^6285dc99]. Wait, let me verify the diving specifics: forceful equalization during descent can worsen pressure differentials and even cause inner ear injury, so I should emphasize gentle, frequent equalization and cessation of diving if symptoms occur [^6285dc99].

> Next, I should review Eustachian tube dysfunction, which is a very common cause of aural fullness and pressure. Obstructive ETD from mucosal edema, allergies, or adenoid hypertrophy impairs ventilation and pressure equalization, while patulous ETD causes autophony and a sense of openness; both can feel like "pressure" to patients, and prevalence in adults is substantial, around 1% by tympanometric criteria, though symptom-based estimates are higher [^fae7372e] [^8648f164]. Hold on, I should verify the subtypes: contemporary consensus recognizes dilatory, baro-challenge–induced, and patulous forms, which helps explain why symptoms may be intermittent and context-dependent [^8648f164].

> Let me consider middle ear effusion and negative pressure states. Otitis media with effusion produces fluid in the middle ear without acute infection, causing fullness, conductive hearing loss, and retraction of the tympanic membrane; chronic negative pressure can lead to structural damage such as atelectasis or retraction pockets, prompting consideration of tympanostomy tubes when persistent or complicated [^81e83767] [^c66a018d] [^a020e8ce]. I should double-check the diagnostic markers: flat or shifted tympanograms and reduced mobility on pneumatic otoscopy support effusion or negative pressure, guiding management decisions [^c66a018d].

> Now, I need to check inner ear causes, particularly Ménière's disease. Ménière's disease presents with episodic vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness or pressure; the pathophysiology is endolymphatic hydrops, and diagnosis is clinical by exclusion with supportive audiovestibular testing, not by a single definitive test [^f863ee63] [^427ef5d3]. Wait, I initially thought positive pressure therapy (Meniett) was a standard option; hold on, I should verify current guidance — recent high-quality evidence and guidelines conclude there is no proven benefit and recommend against routine use, so I should correct that earlier assumption and emphasize medical and selective surgical strategies instead [^6e3a4d58] [^b50d9d9c].

> I will now examine structural and mechanical lesions that can mimic or cause pressure phenomena. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence creates a "third window", making patients exquisitely sensitive to sound and pressure stimuli with vertigo and oscillopsia; pressure or Valsalva can trigger eye movements in the plane of the affected canal, which is a key diagnostic clue [^7751c305]. But wait, what if the pressure symptom is actually from a mass effect? Paragangliomas and other middle ear masses can present with pulsatile tinnitus and aural pressure, so otoscopy for a retrotympanic mass and appropriate imaging are essential when red flags are present [^73d44ebf].

> Let me think about systemic and environmental contributors that modulate ear pressure indirectly. Allergic rhinitis and chronic sinonasal inflammation impair Eustachian tube function and increase the risk of effusion and negative pressure; addressing allergies can improve middle ear outcomes in selected patients, though evidence quality varies [^1f552237] [^b2cfd3c2]. I should also consider obstructive sleep apnea: CPAP can acutely raise middle ear pressure, and in some patients may unmask or exacerbate ETD symptoms, while in others it may be beneficial; this is a nuanced, patient-specific balance [^61f1ee03] [^9c7eff71]. Finally, atmospheric pressure changes and seasonal variation have been linked to increased rates of BPPV and possibly Ménière's flares, suggesting inner ear pressure dynamics may be influenced by ambient pressure, though mechanisms remain under study [^0172375f].

> Hold on, I should verify less common but important mimics. Temporomandibular joint disorders frequently produce ear fullness and pressure via shared neuroanatomy and masticatory muscle tension; distinguishing TMJD from ETD requires careful history and exam, and TMJD symptoms often improve with jaw-focused therapy rather than ear-directed interventions [^bee91976] [^98e2587d]. I also need to remember that mild intracranial hypertension can present with head fullness and vestibulocochlear symptoms that overlap with inner ear disease, so red flags like positional headache, pulsatile tinnitus, or papilledema should prompt neuro-otologic evaluation [^e11e8305].

> Next, I should review a practical diagnostic approach so I don't jump to conclusions. Start with targeted history: laterality, tempo, triggers (flights, diving, altitude, CPAP, allergies, jaw symptoms), associated features (vertigo, hearing fluctuation, otalgia, otorrhea, tinnitus), and comorbidities (OSA, TMJD, rhinitis). Then perform otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, and tympanometry to assess membrane mobility and middle ear pressure, adding audiometry when indicated. Reserve imaging for persistent unexplained symptoms, asymmetric findings, or red flags such as pulsatile tinnitus or neurologic signs [^c66a018d] [^fae7372e]. Let me reconsider the role of advanced ETD testing: tubomanometry can help in complex cases, but availability and interpretation vary, so I should use it selectively and correlate with the clinical picture [^386f1625].

> I should confirm red flags that warrant urgent evaluation. Sudden sensorineural hearing loss with aural fullness needs emergent ENT assessment for possible idiopathic SSNHL, where timely steroids may improve outcomes. Severe vertigo with aural fullness could signal Ménière's flare or another inner ear process. Pulsatile tinnitus with pressure suggests vascular or mass lesions. And focal neurologic deficits or severe headache with ear symptoms require urgent neuroimaging to exclude intracranial pathology [^notfound]. But wait, what if the patient just flew and now has severe pain and bleeding? That pattern raises concern for tympanic membrane rupture or inner ear barotrauma, and diving-related symptoms with vertigo could reflect inner ear barotrauma or decompression sickness, both requiring prompt otolaryngology input [^6285dc99].

> Finally, I need to ensure management advice aligns with evidence and patient context. For barotrauma, prevention and conservative measures are key: avoid flying or diving when congested, use gentle Valsalva or yawning during descent, consider oral decongestants in adults when appropriate, and avoid forceful equalization. For ETD, treat underlying rhinitis, consider autoinflation techniques, and escalate to tympanostomy if persistent effusion or structural risk emerges. For Ménière's, prioritize salt restriction, diuretics, and vestibular rehabilitation, reserving intratympanic steroids or ablation for refractory cases. And for TMJD-related ear pressure, direct therapy to the masticatory system rather than the ear itself [^d9b3d4a2] [^81e83767] [^6e3a4d58] [^bee91976]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overpromising on autoinflation: while data in children with OME suggest potential benefit, certainty is low and adherence matters, so shared decision-making is essential [^4292657e].

Ear pressure is most often due to **Eustachian tube dysfunction** (ETD) [^fae7372e] from allergies, colds, or sinus infections, causing fullness, popping, and muffled hearing [^8648f164]. Other common causes include **middle ear effusion** (fluid buildup) [^81e83767], barotrauma from altitude or diving [^f4bb9e85], and Ménière's disease with endolymphatic hydrops [^427ef5d3]. Less common causes are TMJ disorders [^bee91976], superior semicircular canal dehiscence [^7751c305], and intracranial pressure disorders [^e11e8305]. Evaluation includes history, exam, tympanometry, and audiometry [^fae7372e]; management targets the cause, with decongestants, autoinflation, or tympanostomy for ETD/effusion [^4292657e] [^2ad8bc86], and lifestyle or medical therapy for Ménière's [^notfound].

## Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD)

ETD is the **most common cause** of ear pressure, reflecting impaired ventilation and pressure equalization of the middle ear [^fae7372e]. It presents with fullness, popping, muffled hearing, and occasional pain [^8648f164].

- **Allergies and rhinitis**: Allergic inflammation causes mucosal edema and obstruction, leading to ETD and pressure [^1f552237].
- **Upper respiratory infections**: Viral URIs cause mucosal swelling and dysfunction, producing pressure and fullness [^ad65d95e].
- **Baro-challenge-induced ETD**: Rapid altitude or pressure changes (flying, diving) overwhelm normal equalization, causing barotrauma and pressure [^f4bb9e85] [^6285dc99].

---

## Middle ear effusion (otitis media with effusion)

OME is fluid in the middle ear without acute infection, often after URIs or with ETD, and causes **persistent pressure**, fullness, and conductive hearing loss [^81e83767].

- **Persistent effusion**: Fluid reduces middle ear compliance and increases pressure, causing fullness and muffled hearing [^5ef6a58c].
- **Structural effects**: Chronic effusion can cause tympanic membrane retraction or atelectasis, worsening pressure and hearing [^a020e8ce].

---

## Barotrauma

Barotrauma results from **pressure differentials** across the tympanic membrane during altitude or diving, causing pain, fullness, and hearing changes [^f4bb9e85].

- **Aviation and diving**: Rapid pressure changes cause middle ear squeeze, with pain, fullness, and possible tympanic membrane rupture [^f4bb9e85] [^6285dc99].
- **Equalization failure**: Inability to open the Eustachian tube (e.g. congestion, anatomic factors) increases risk and severity [^6285dc99].

---

## Ménière's disease

Ménière's disease causes **endolymphatic hydrops** and episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness/pressure [^427ef5d3].

- **Endolymphatic hydrops**: Excess endolymph increases inner ear pressure, causing fullness and pressure sensations [^427ef5d3].
- **Fluctuating symptoms**: Pressure often accompanies vertigo attacks and hearing fluctuations [^427ef5d3].

---

## Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders

TMJ disorders can cause **referred ear pressure** via shared neuroanatomy and muscle tension [^bee91976].

- **Referred symptoms**: TMJ dysfunction causes ear fullness, pressure, and otalgia without middle ear pathology [^bee91976].
- **Muscle tension**: Masticatory muscle spasm contributes to pressure and discomfort [^notfound].

---

## Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD)

SSCD creates a **third window**, making the inner ear sensitive to pressure and sound, causing pressure, vertigo, and autophony [^7751c305].

- **Third window effect**: Pressure changes in the ear canal or intracranial space trigger vertigo and pressure [^7751c305].
- **Pressure/sound sensitivity**: Vertigo and pressure are provoked by Valsalva, loud sounds, or head movements [^7751c305].

---

## Intracranial pressure disorders

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension and related disorders can transmit pressure to the ear via **CSF pathways**, causing fullness and pressure [^e11e8305].

- **CSF pressure transmission**: Elevated intracranial pressure can affect inner ear pressure via the cochlear aqueduct, causing fullness and pressure [^e11e8305].
- **Associated symptoms**: Headache, visual changes, and pulsatile tinnitus often accompany ear pressure [^e11e8305].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach includes:

- **History**: Onset, duration, triggers (altitude, diving, URI, allergies), associated symptoms (vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, TMJ pain) [^f2432a04].
- **Physical examination**: Otoscopy, pneumatic otoscopy, TMJ palpation, nasal/endoscopic exam [^c66a018d].
- **Tympanometry**: Assesses middle ear pressure and Eustachian tube function [^fc4bb3b9].
- **Audiometry**: Evaluates hearing loss and helps distinguish conductive vs sensorineural causes [^c66a018d].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

| **Cause** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Eustachian tube dysfunction | - Decongestants <br/> - Antihistamines <br/> - Autoinflation <br/> - Tympanostomy tubes if refractory [^4292657e] [^2ad8bc86] |
| Middle ear effusion | - Watchful waiting <br/> - Autoinflation <br/> - Tympanostomy tubes if persistent [^4292657e] [^2ad8bc86] |
| Barotrauma | - Prevention (equalization, avoiding flying/diving when congested) <br/> - Decongestants <br/> - Autoinflation [^d9b3d4a2] [^88536985] |
| Ménière's disease | - Salt restriction <br/> - Diuretics <br/> - Vestibular rehabilitation <br/> - Intratympanic steroids or gentamicin for refractory cases [^notfound] |
| TMJ disorders | - TMJ therapy <br/> - Occlusal splints <br/> - Physical therapy [^notfound] |
| SSCD | - Surgical repair (middle fossa craniotomy) for severe symptoms [^notfound] |
| Intracranial pressure disorders | - Medical management (acetazolamide, weight loss) <br/> - Neurosurgical consultation [^e11e8305] |

---

Ear pressure arises from multiple causes, most commonly **ETD**, OME, barotrauma, and Ménière's disease, with less frequent contributions from TMJ, SSCD, and intracranial pressure disorders. A focused history, exam, and targeted testing guide diagnosis and therapy, which should address the specific etiology to relieve pressure effectively.

### Meniere's disease: overview, epidemiology, and natural history [^1d8e64f2]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Meniere's disease is a disease of the inner ear characterized by a triad of symptoms: vestibular symptoms, auditory symptoms, and pressure. The pathologic correlate of Meniere's disease is endolymphatic hydrops and the etiopathogenesis involves a deficiency in the absorption of endolymph. The pathophysiology of the symptoms is still disputed: membranous ruptures, pressure and mechanical displacement of the end organs, or obstruction followed by an abrupt clearance of the endolymphatic duct. The course of the disease may be progressive or nonprogressive and, in addition to the typical presentation of Meniere's disease, two variations of the disorder have been identified: cochlear Meniere's disease, and vestibular Meniere's disease. It can be further broken into two subsets: Meniere's syndrome, with a known and well-established cause, and Meniere's disease, in which the cause seems to be idiopathic. It is likely that there are racial (genetic) as well as environmental factors that influence differences in incidence among countries and among various sections of countries. The disease is much more common in adults, with an average age of onset in the fourth decade, the symptoms beginning usually between ages 20 and 60 years. Meniere's disease is (grossly) equally common in each sex, and right and left ears are affected with fairly equal frequency. The diagnosis of Meniere's disease is by exclusion, and a careful history is the most important guide to a correct diagnosis. Its medical treatment is largely empiric. Surgery can be considered when, even after medical therapy, the disease progresses and the symptoms become intractable. Surgery may be either conservative or destructive. Bilaterality must be considered when deciding the best surgical option for a patient with Meniere's disease. It is the authors' opinion that endolymphatic sac surgery is an extension of conservative treatment.

### An innovative, cost-effective, pressure-relieving device for burned ears [^f208a7ac]. Burns (2004). Low credibility.

Cosmetic disfigurement is a common result of facial burn injuries. Next to judicious wound care and timely wound closure, the application of pressure to maturing facial scars is a key factor in minimizing disfigurement. This is not true for ear burns, where pressure is contraindicated at all phases of recovery, thus making it mandatory to provide pressure-relief over the ears throughout rehabilitation. Though such a need has been understood since long ago, the availability of such a device is very rare in any developing nation. Moreover the cost of such splints is too expensive. This report presents an innovative idea to protect the ear with a low-cost splinting technique.

### The eustachian tube. update on anatomy, development, and function [^4d49b2a1]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Central to many pathologic conditions affecting the middle ear is the failure of the ET to perform its functions of regulation of middle ear pressure, clearance of middle ear secretions, and protection of the middle ear space. Recent advances in radiologic imaging and fiberoptic endoscopes have allowed a more detailed description of the structure and function of this area. Hopefully, with the knowledge gained from advances in this area, more effective medical treatment options for common otologic problems, such as otitis media, will become available.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^81e83767]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) frequently asked questions — ear fluid is described as "a buildup of mucus or liquid behind the eardrum, without symptoms of an ear infection", and ear infections (acute otitis media [AOM]) "cause fever, ear pain, and active (acute) inflammation"; in OME the fluid "is not actively infected, and pain may be absent or minimal". The page notes that "Nearly all children get ear fluid at least once by school age". Children may have "no symptoms at all or more subtle findings", and clinicians can detect fluid "by looking in the ear canal (otoscopy) or by measuring the movement of the eardrum (tympanometry or pneumatic otoscopy)". Causes listed include "a cold, an ear infection (AOM), or the normal congestion (negative pressure)", and most fluid "goes away on its own in weeks or months". OME "is of more concern if it lasts > 3 mo", and "Your doctor should check the ears periodically until the fluid is gone"; management advice notes that the "best advice can be found in clinical practice guidelines" based on evidence and consideration of benefits and harms.

Abstract

Background

Ménière's disease is a condition that causes recurrent episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus. It is often treated with medication, but different interventions are sometimes used. Positive pressure therapy is a treatment that creates small pressure pulses, generated by a pump that is attached to tubing placed in the ear canal. It is typically used for a few minutes, several times per day. The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is unknown, as is the way in which this treatment may work. The efficacy of this intervention at preventing vertigo attacks, and their associated symptoms, is currently unclear.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of positive pressure therapy versus placebo or no treatment in people with Ménière's disease.

Search methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; CENTRAL; Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 14 September 2022.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi‐RCTs in adults with a diagnosis of Ménière's disease comparing positive pressure therapy with either placebo or no treatment. We excluded studies with follow‐up of less than three months.

Data collection and analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were: 1) improvement in vertigo (assessed as a dichotomous outcome ‐ improved or not improved), 2) change in vertigo (assessed as a continuous outcome, with a score on a numerical scale) and 3) serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were: 4) disease‐specific health‐related quality of life, 5) change in hearing, 6) change in tinnitus and 7) other adverse effects. We considered outcomes reported at three time points: 3 to < 6 months, 6 to ≤ 12 months and > 12 months. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main results

We included three studies with a total of 238 participants, all of which compared positive pressure using the Meniett device to sham treatment. The duration of follow‐up was a maximum of four months.

Improvement in vertigo

A single study assessed whether participants had an improvement in the frequency of their vertigo whilst using positive pressure therapy, therefore we are unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the results.

Change in vertigo

Only one study reported on the change in vertigo symptoms using a global score (at 3 to < 6 months), so we are again unable to draw meaningful conclusions from the numerical results. All three studies reported on the change in the frequency of vertigo. The summary effect showed that people receiving positive pressure therapy had, on average, 0.84 fewer days per month affected by vertigo (95% confidence interval from 2.12 days fewer to 0.45 days more; 3 studies; 202 participants). However, the evidence on the change in vertigo frequency was of very low certainty, therefore there is great uncertainty in this estimate.

Serious adverse events

None of the included studies provided information on the number of people who experienced serious adverse events. It is unclear whether this is because no adverse events occurred, or whether they were not assessed and reported.

Authors' conclusions

The evidence for positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease is very uncertain. There are few RCTs that compare this intervention to placebo or no treatment, and the evidence that is currently available from these studies is of low or very low certainty. This means that we have very low confidence that the effects reported are accurate estimates of the true effect of these interventions. Consensus on the appropriate outcomes to measure in studies of Ménière's disease is needed (i.e. a core outcome set) in order to guide future studies in this area and enable meta‐analyses of the results. This must include appropriate consideration of the potential harms of treatment, as well as the benefits.

### Meniere's disease [^427ef5d3]. Lancet (2008). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ménière's disease:

- **Definition**: Ménière's disease is a chronic disorder of the inner ear characterized by intermittent episodes of vertigo and fluctuating hearing loss.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of Ménière's disease is multifactorial, with a characteristic sign being endolymphatic hydrops, a disorder in which excessive endolymph accumulates in the inner ear and causes damage to the ganglion cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of Ménière's disease in the US is estimated at 190 per 100,000 population.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for Ménière's disease include adult age, family history, certain lifestyle and environmental factors, such as allergies.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients experience intermittent episodes of vertigo lasting from minutes to hours, along with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss that can progress over time. Tinnitus and aural pressure are also common symptoms. The severity and frequency of these symptoms can vary greatly among patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of Ménière's disease is generally favorable in terms of symptom management.

### Does repeated hyperbaric exposure to 4 atmosphere absolute cause hearing impairment? Study in Guinea pigs and clinical incidences [^a5922a66]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Direct pressure applied on the inner ear cannot induce hearing loss.

Background

Three possible causes have been described in the literature for inner ear permanent lesions during scuba diving: pressure imbalance between the middle ear and the external ear, appearance of microbubbles in the internal ear, and direct effect of pressure on the inner ear. We seek to determine whether this last factor can be involved.

Methods

We submitted two groups of guinea pigs previously implanted with an electrode in the round window to a protocol of air diving in a hyperbaric chamber. Eardrums of animals in one of the two groups had been perforated beforehand. Twenty dives were practiced over 4 weeks. We chose dive parameters consistent with common sport diving: maximal pressure of 4 atmosphere absolute and duration of 30 minutes. Auditory threshold and cochlear spontaneous activity were recorded at regular intervals. Furthermore, we recorded spontaneous cochlear activity in Heliox 400-m and 600-m dives to determine whether our conclusions hold for "extreme" diving.

Results

In the group with perforated eardrums, no variation of those parameters were recorded, even in extreme diving. Important variations were noticed in the other group.

Conclusions

Pressure applied directly on the inner ear during diving does not disturb cochlear activity.

### Sound-and / or pressure-induced vertigo due to bone dehiscence of the superior semicircular canal… [^7751c305]. JAMA Network (1998). Excellent credibility.

Schematic drawing of pressure changes in the middle and inner ear resulting from testing maneuvers used in this study. 24 A, Sound, positive pressure in the external canal, and Valsalva maneuver against pinched nostrils evoke pressure changes that result in expansion of the membranous canal with corresponding outward movement in the area of dehiscence. Eight patients with vertigo, oscillopsia, and/or disequilibrium related to sound, changes in middle ear pressure, and/or changes in intracranial pressure were identified in a 2-year period. Seven of these patients also had vertical-torsional eye movements induced by these sound and/or pressure stimuli. The direction of the evoked eye movements could be explained by excitation or inhibition of the superior semicircular canal in the affected ear. Conclusions We have identified patients with a syndrome of vestibular symptoms induced by sound in an ear or by changes in middle ear or intracranial pressure.

These patients can also experience chronic disequilibrium. Eye movements in the plane parallel to that of the superior semicircular canal were evoked by stimuli that have the potential to cause ampullofugal or ampullopetal deflection of this canal's cupula in the presence of a dehiscence of bone overlying the canal. Presentation of 430- to 500-Hz tones at 100-dB sound pressure level to the right ear evoked a similar eye movement. Tones outside of this frequency range, tones in the left ear, as well as positive or negative pressure insufflation in either external auditory canal resulted in neither an eye movement nor in a sensation of oscillopsia. An audiogram revealed normal pure tone thresholds and speech discrimination scores in both ears, and an auditory brainstem response was normal. Electrocochleography performed with transtympanic electrodes revealed normal potentials in response to tone bursts and clicks.

Examination revealed intact extraocular movements with no spontaneous, gaze-evoked or head shaking–induced nystagmus. Tones of 250 to 1500 Hz administered at intensities of 90 to 110 dB in the right ear evoked upward and counterclockwise eye movements. Positive pressure insufflation in the right external canal and tragal compression induced similar eye movements. The external canals and tympanic membranes were normal. The Weber test for hearing at 512 Hz lateralized to the right ear. Results of the Rinne test were positive bilaterally.

Diving disorders — barotrauma is defined and its common ear manifestation highlighted. Barotrauma is an injury to soft tissues resulting from a pressure differential between an airspace in the body and the ambient pressure, and the resultant expansion or contraction of that space can cause injury. The most common injury in divers is middle ear barotrauma, or "middle ear squeeze" (Box 3.4.2), and on descent, failure to equalize pressure changes within the middle ear space creates a pressure gradient across the eardrum.

The ear is a remarkably sensitive pressure fluctuation detector. In guinea pigs, behavioral measurements indicate a minimum detectable sound pressure of ∼20 μPa at 16 kHz. Such faint sounds produce 0.1-nm basilar membrane displacements, a distance smaller than conformational transitions in ion channels. It seems that noise within the auditory system would swamp such tiny motions, making weak sounds imperceptible. Here we propose a new mechanism contributing to a resolution of this problem and validate it through direct measurement. We hypothesized that vibration at the apical side of hair cells is enhanced compared with that at the commonly measured basilar membrane side. Using in vivo optical coherence tomography, we demonstrated that apical-side vibrations peaked at a higher frequency, had different timing and were enhanced compared with those at the basilar membrane. These effects depend nonlinearly on the stimulus sound pressure level. The timing difference and enhancement of vibrations are important for explaining how the noise problem is circumvented.

### Imaging of the eustachian tube and its function: a systematic review [^8648f164]. Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A normally functioning Eustachian tube (ET) is essential for maintaining a healthy middle ear and normal hearing. Failure of the ET to function correctly is a common cause of morbidity in both adults and children, and yet the anatomy, function and imaging options relating to the tube are still areas poorly understood by otolaryngologists and radiologists alike. Due to recent developments in the surgical management of Eustachian tube disorders, in particular with the introduction of balloon dilation of the ET, it is timely to review this important structure again, and assess what imaging can add in terms of both our understanding and diagnosis of Eustachian tube pathology.

The ET is a narrow, epithelial-lined tube extending from the middle ear to the nasopharynx. It is passively closed, but normally opens under the control of paratubal muscles during actions such as swallowing. The ET fulfils three main roles, which together facilitate middle ear health and the transmission of sound from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea. The first function is equalisation of middle ear pressure to the ambient atmospheric pressure: a necessity due to external pressure fluctuations and mucosal gas exchange. The second function is to permit the mucociliary clearance of middle ear secretions and the third is to prevent the retrograde travel of speech sounds and pathogen-laden secretions up the ET from the nasopharynx.

Failure of the above-mentioned actions is considered ET 'dysfunction' (ETD), which is usually classified as either obstructive or patulous. Obstructive ETD results from inadequate tube opening, caused by either dynamic dysfunction (muscular failure) or, more commonly, from obstruction of the tubal lumen by intrinsic changes or associated structures such as hypertrophic adenoids. Failure of the tube to open adequately typically results in the patient complaining of ear fullness, 'popping' sounds, discomfort, muffled hearing and tinnitus. Tympanic membrane retraction, cholesteatoma, perforation and middle ear effusion are all associated with ETD. Patulous ETD is far less common, and results from the ET remains permanently open. Patients with patulous ETD often complain of a feeling of pressure in their ear or of abnormal hearing of their own voice (autophony).

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^4c292d1d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

This review was conducted as part of a suite considering different interventions for Ménière's disease. A number of issues were identified as affecting the completeness and applicability of the evidence in all the reviews in this suite. These have been described in the companion review on systemic pharmacological interventions for Ménière's disease (Webster 2021a) and are replicated here, as they relate to this review:

There is a paucity of evidence about all of these interventions, despite some of them being in common use for Ménière's disease. All the evidence we found was of very low or low certainty, showing that we are unsure of the effects of the interventions, and future research may change the effect estimates a great deal.
We were unable to carry out many meta‐analyses. There were often differences in the actual outcomes assessed in the study, therefore we were unable to pool the data to achieve a more precise estimate of any effect. Study authors also often used different ways of measuring the same outcome, which prevented data from being combined. For example, vertigo was assessed with either a global score, or a frequency score, which could not be combined.
Certain outcomes were only assessed by some included studies. Some studies did not assess the impact of the disease on quality of life or tinnitus at all. Potential adverse effects of the interventions were also poorly reported or simply not assessed. The use of a positive pressure device requires the insertion of a ventilation tube. When used in people with chronic middle ear disease, this procedure has the potential to cause adverse effects (such as infection, ear discharge or persistent tympanic membrane perforation). It is unclear whether the same risks apply for people with Ménière's disease, but these should be assessed and reported.
We noted that unvalidated rating scales were commonly used in the studies included, particularly when looking at the global impact of treatments for vertigo. When such scales are used, it is difficult to know if they are accurately assessing the outcome, and also what size of change on this scale represents a meaningful difference in the outcome (the minimally important difference).
Finally, studies often failed to report clearly what treatments participants received before joining the trial, what maintenance treatment they continued on during the trial, and whether they received any additional treatments over the course of the trial. The impact of these additional treatments may be considerable, particularly for those studies with longer‐term follow‐up. Without knowing the background details of study participants (for example, the duration of their Ménière's disease, or what treatments they have tried in the past) it is difficult to identify the groups of people who may benefit from these treatments.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of tinnitus: recommendations from the US VA / DOD clinical practice guideline work group [^f2432a04]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD tinnitus history and symptoms — provider should first rule out transient ear noise, defined as the perception of sound, usually occurring in one ear at a time and described as high-pitched ringing or tone, lasting fewer than five minutes, and sometimes accompanied by a sense of hearing loss and aural fullness; transient ear noise is common and does not generally require clinical management. If transient ear noise is ruled out, the following pertinent information should be obtained (not in any particular order): frequency, laterality, quality (e.g., pulsatile, non-pulsatile), and intensity of tinnitus; circumstance and date of onset of tinnitus; impact of tinnitus on sleep, daily activities, or quality of life (screen the patient with a validated instrument, when indicated); hearing loss (e.g., asymmetric, bilateral, unilateral, sudden, recent); ear pressure or fullness with normal ear exam; presence of co-occurring conditions, such as anxiety, stress, depression, insomnia, dental issues (e.g., temporomandibular disorder [TMD]), cervical issues; and history of head or neck injury; blast exposure; noise exposure; hearing difficulties; sound tolerance issues; ear pain, drainage, or both; dizziness or vertigo; or possible ototoxic medication (see Appendix C).

### Longitudinal evaluation of clustering of chronic sinonasal and related symptoms using exploratory factor analysis [^a656f48d]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sinonasal symptoms are common and can have several underlying causes. When symptoms occur in specified patterns lasting 3 months or more they meet criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Approaches to CRS symptom measurement do not specify how to measure symptoms and treat specified sinonasal symptoms as generally interchangeable, suggesting that such symptoms should cluster on 1 or 2 latent factors.

Methods

We used questionnaire responses to 37 questions on the presence, severity, bother, and frequency of cardinal sinonasal and related symptoms lasting 3 months, from 3535 subjects at 3 time points over 16 months. We completed 5 exploratory factor analyses (EFA) to identify symptom clustering, 1 for each time point and 2 for the differences between adjacent questionnaires. The baseline EFA was used to provide factor scores that were described longitudinally and examined by CRS status.

Results

Five EFAs identified the same 5 factors (blockage and discharge, pain and pressure, asthma and cold/flu symptoms, smell loss, and ear and eye [mainly allergy] symptoms), with clustering determined by symptom frequency, severity, and degree of bother. Responses to individual questions showed changes over time but when combined into factor scores showed less longitudinal change. All symptom factor scores were progressively higher from never to past to current CRS status.

Conclusions

Although the current approaches to symptom characterization in CRS imply a single underlying latent construct, our results suggest that there are at least 3 latent constructs relevant to CRS. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these clusters have identifiable underlying pathobiologies.

### The prevalence of eustachian tube dysfunction symptoms in temporomandibular joint disorder patients [^98e2587d]. The Laryngoscope (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

Ear fullness and pressure is a common complaint seen in otolaryngology clinics and frequently is attributed to eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). In addition to traditional tympanometry and physical examination, the seven-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7) has recently been used to aid in the diagnosis of ETD and to assess its severity. Temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJD) is a common condition that causes similar symptoms to ETD and has been recognized as a potential confounding condition in patients presenting with ETD symptoms. We sought to determine the cross-sectional prevalence of ETD symptoms in patients with TMJD using the ETDQ-7.

Study Design

Prospective cross-sectional analysis.

Methods

An analysis was performed of ETDQ-7 scores in patients diagnosed with TMJD.

Results

A total of 21 patients with confirmed TMJD completed the ETDQ-7 at routine consult or follow-up for their TMJD. The mean ± standard deviation ETDQ-7 score for the cohort was 24.5 ± 12.5. Two-thirds of patients had an ETDQ-7 score of > 14.5, which has been used in the literature to denote clinically significant ETD. No single question was scored significantly higher than the others.

Conclusions

Symptoms of ETD are highly prevalent among patients with TMJD determined by patient-reported outcome measures. It is not clear if these symptoms reflect true derangement of eustachian tube function in these patients or whether there is only clinical similarity between ETD and TMJD. However, future research efforts may resolve this dilemma.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^2ad8bc86]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Table 1 — abbreviations and definitions of common terms — defines tympanostomy tube insertion, otitis media categories, and related ear findings with explicit thresholds. Tympanostomy tube insertion is surgical placement through a myringotomy for temporary middle ear ventilation, and tubes generally last several months to several years, with synonyms including ventilation tubes, pressure equalization (PE) tubes, grommets (UK), and bilateral myringotomy and tubes (BMT). Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) is OME persisting for 3 months or longer from onset or diagnosis. Persistent acute otitis media (AOM) includes relapse of AOM within 1 month after completing antibiotics, and when 2 episodes of otitis media occur within 1 month it may be difficult to distinguish recurrence from persistence. AOM is the rapid onset of middle-ear inflammation diagnosed by a distinctly bulging tympanic membrane with a middle ear effusion; OME is fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of AOM, and middle ear effusion (MEE) refers to fluid in the middle ear often from OME and during or after AOM. Tympanostomy tube otorrhea is discharge from the middle ear through the tube, a retraction pocket is a collapsed area of the tympanic membrane with sharp demarcation, and a tympanogram is an objective measure of tympanic membrane vibration and pressure, with a flat tracing if the middle ear is filled with fluid and a peak shifted based on pressure (left if negative, right if positive).

### Masticatory / temporomandibular disorders: practical assessment and care concepts for the otolaryngologist [^bee91976]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

This article assists the practicing otolaryngologist to better understand how malfunction within the masticatory system inclusive of the temporomandibular joints and associated musculoskeletal structures can lead to the onset of ear symptoms inclusive of pain, and sensations of fullness, pressure, buzzing, and ringing among others. This article aims to provide physicians evaluating ear symptoms with the listening and examination tools to help determine whether puzzling ear symptoms relate to malfunction within the masticatory system. If a temporomandibular problem is identified, the physician will be better able to ascertain the origins of the problem and provide common treatment options to patients.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^f863ee63]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Statement 1 — diagnosis of Ménière's disease: Clinicians should diagnose definite or probable Ménière's disease in patients presenting with 2 or more episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours (definite) or up to 24 hours (probable) and fluctuating or nonfluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or pressure in the affected ear, when these symptoms are not better accounted for by another disorder; this is a Recommendation based on observational studies with consistently applied reference standard and a preponderance of benefit over harms.

### Barotrauma [^ac242bf1]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

Barotrauma is pressure-induced injury. The application of direct pressure to the body may cause trauma, including positive pressure from artificial ventilation. Trauma may also be caused by the effects of pressure changes on gas-containing body spaces, not in communication with the environment. This can include the external ear, the middle ear (and, indirectly, the inner ear), the para-nasal sinuses, the lungs, the gut, and abscess cavities (for example, in the teeth). Gas may penetrate tissues adjoining the affected space (such as the anterior cranial fossa, via the ethmoid sinus), or may embolise via the blood stream. The most severe expression of this is cerebral arterial gas embolism, which may present as a stroke. The management of these problems includes prevention, the use of pressure-equalizing techniques, vasoconstrictor drugs, surgery, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

### Otorhinolaryngology and diving-part 1: otorhinolaryngological hazards related to compressed gas scuba diving: a review [^6dd81b51]. JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Scuba diving is becoming increasingly popular. However, scuba diving is associated with specific risks; 80% of adults and 85% of juvenile divers (aged 6–17 years) have been reputed to have an ear, nose, or throat complaint related to diving at some point during their diving career. Divers frequently seek advice from primary care physicians, diving physicians, and otorhinolaryngologists, not only in the acute setting, but also related to the long-term effects of diving.

Observations

The principles underpinning diving-related injuries that may present to the otorhinolaryngologist rely on gas volume and gas saturation laws, and the prevention of these injuries requires both that the diver is skilled and that their anatomy allows for pressure equalization between the various anatomical compartments. The overlapping symptoms of middle ear barotrauma, inner ear barotrauma, and inner ear decompression sickness can cause a diagnostic conundrum, and a thorough history of both the diver's symptoms and the dive itself are required to elucidate the diagnosis. Correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment result in a more timely return to safe diving.

Conclusions and Relevance

The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of otorhinolaryngological complications during diving. With the increasing popularity of diving and the frequency of ear, nose, or throat-related injuries, it could be expected that these injuries will become more common and this review provides a resource for otorhinolaryngologists to diagnose and treat these conditions.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^54b2c3f5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

A variety of different interventions have been proposed to treat people with Ménière's disease. These include dietary or lifestyle changes, oral treatments, treatments administered by injection into the ear (intratympanic) and surgical treatments. This review focuses on the use of positive pressure therapy to treat the symptoms of Ménière's disease.

Small pressure pulses are generated by a pump that is attached to tubing placed in the ear canal. Positive pressure therapy also requires the placement of a ventilation tube in the tympanic membrane, to encourage the pulsed pressure to transmit to the inner ear. The treatment is typically used for approximately five minutes at a time, and up to three times per day.

At present, there is no agreement on which is the ideal treatment for people with Ménière's disease – consequently there is no 'gold standard' treatment with which to compare this intervention.

How the intervention might work

As the underlying cause of Ménière's disease is poorly understood, so too are the ways in which the interventions may work.

Pressure changes in the middle ear can transmit to the inner ear through the round and oval windows. An increase in inner ear pressure has been suggested to result in decongestion of the inner ear vasculature, or to promote the opening of a temporarily blocked endolymphatic duct (Tjernström 1977). In this way, endolymph pressure is suggested to be altered. Intermittent positive pressure treatment was shown to reduce the development of endolymphatic hydrops in a guinea pig model (Sakikawa 1997).

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^c66a018d]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) — key term definitions specify that OME is the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs or symptoms of acute ear infection, and chronic OME is OME persisting for ≥ 3 mo from the date of onset (if known) or from the date of diagnosis (if onset is unknown). Acute otitis media (AOM) is the rapid onset of signs and symptoms of inflammation of the middle ear, and middle ear effusion is fluid in the middle ear from any cause that is present with both OME and AOM and may persist for weeks or months after AOM resolves. Hearing assessment gathers information about a child's hearing status via caregiver report or formal testing and does not include use of noisemakers or other nonstandardized methods. Pneumatic otoscopy examines middle ear mobility by changing ear canal pressure, with a normal eardrum moving briskly but becoming minimal or sluggish with fluid. A tympanogram objectively measures tympanic membrane vibration and pressure; with fluid the tracing is flat or nearly flat, and with air at abnormal pressure the peak shifts left if negative or right if positive. Conductive hearing loss reflects impaired sound transmission often associated with effusion, whereas sensorineural hearing loss results from abnormal transmission of sound from the sensory cells of the inner ear to the brain.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^915e4ca9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for Ménière's disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, AAO-HNS 2020 guidelines recommend to diagnose definite or probable Ménière's disease in patients presenting with ≥ 2 episodes of vertigo lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours (definite) or up to 24 hours (probable) and fluctuating or non-fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, or pressure in the affected ear, when these symptoms are not better accounted for by another disorder.

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^e2f6b402]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

HBOT risks and complications: Although the risk of serious side effects is small, reported risks include damage to ears, sinuses, and lungs from pressure changes, as well as temporary worsening of short-sightedness, claustrophobia, and oxygen poisoning, and major adverse events were not reported in most studies. In a population of 782 patients undergoing 11,376 sessions, the primary complication was difficulty equalizing pressure in the middle ear, occurring in 7% of patients.

### Forces required for isolated malleus shaft fractures [^a4764623]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis:

Isolated malleus shaft fractures are rare cases. A commonly reported cause is a finger pulled out from a wet outer ear canal after a shower or bath. The objective was to investigate experimentally the mechanism and forces needed to establish an isolated malleus shaft fracture.

Methods:

Ten fresh-frozen human temporal bones were adapted to allow visual inspection of the structures involved while negative pressure trauma was applied. Thirty malleus bones were broken and the required forces were measured. Measurements from 60 adult test subjects were used to create mathematical and physical models to calculate and measure the forces necessary for generating trauma. To calculate the maximum muscle force developed by the tensor tympani muscle, the muscle area and fiber type composition were determined.

Results:

The temporal bone experiments showed that applied negative pressure in a wet ear canal could not fracture the malleus shaft with only passive counterforce from supporting structures, although the forces exceeded what was required for a malleus shaft fracture. When adding calculated counteracting forces from the tensor tympani muscles, which consisted of 87% type II fibers, we estimate that a sufficient force is generated to cause a malleus fracture.

Conclusion:

The combination of a negative pressure created by a finger pulling outward in a wet ear canal and a simultaneous counteracting reflexive force by the tensor tympani muscle were found to be sufficient to cause an isolated malleus fracture with an intact tympanic membrane.

### Point prevalence of barotitis and its prevention and treatment with nasal balloon inflation: a prospective, controlled study [^88536985]. Otology & Neurotology (2004). Low credibility.

Introduction

The most common cause of barotitis is pressure changes induced during descent in aviation. The incidence after air flight has been reported to vary from 8% to 17%.

Objectives

We conducted this study to estimate the incidence of barotitis after flight, to evaluate whether the incidence of barotitis can be reduced by nasal balloon inflation during descent, and, finally, to estimate the effect of nasal balloon inflation in case of negative middle ear pressure after landing.

Study Design

Aircraft passengers were examined by otoscopy and tympanometry before and after flying and filled in a questionnaire inquiring about ear problems. On half of the flights, the passengers were asked to inflate a nasal balloon during descent, whereas the other half were control flights.

Results

A total of 188 passengers filled in the questionnaire. Of these, 134 were examined before and after the flight. Otoscopic signs of barotitis were found in 15% of the ears in the control group compared with 6% in the balloon inflation group. In ears with a negative pressure after flying, the pressure could be equalized by Valsalva's maneuver in 46%. Passengers who were unable to equalize the pressure in this way inflated a nasal balloon, and in 69%, this maneuver cleared the middle ear pressure.

Conclusion

The incidence of barotitis in this study of aircraft passengers was 14%. This figure could be reduced to 6% in passengers who performed nasal balloon inflation during descent. We recommend nasal balloon autoinflation in aircraft passengers who have difficulty clearing their ears during and after flying.

### A cochlear-bone wave can yield a hearing sensation as well as otoacoustic emission [^26907484]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Middle ear pressure transformation

The three ossicles of the middle ear — malleus, incus and stapes — connect the ear drum to the oval window. Sound is accordingly transmitted from the ear canal to the cochlea, and can analogously be re-emitted from the cochlea into the ear canal. How can these transfers be quantified?

Denote by A a and A ow the area of the tympanic membrane with respect to the oval window, and by l a and l w the length of the mallus with respect to the incus (Fig. 1). The pressure in the ear canal is p 3, it acts on the tympanic membrane and produces an angular momentum l a A a p 3. The pressure p 2 in the upper cochlear chamber yields an angular momentum l w A ow p 2, which must match the first one:

A second equation results from the fluid flows in the ear canal as well as in the upper cochlear chamber, j 3 and j 2, which must yield an equal angular deflection of the middle-ear bones:

Finally, the pressure p 1 in the lower cochlear chamber creates a fluid flow j 1 at the round window that depends on its impedance Z rw:

These three equations act as boundary conditions to the wave equations and allow to compute the extent to which a wave reaching the middle ear, either from the ear canal or from within the cochlea, is transmitted or reflected.

We first illustrate how this computation works by considering airborne sound travelling through the ear canal towards the tympanic membrane, with a wave vectorin which ρ air and κ are the air's density with respect to compressibility. Part of this wave will be reflected, such that the pressure in the ear canal is the sum of a forward- and a backward-travelling sound wave:

### The relation of allergy to eustachian tube dysfunction and the subsequent need for insertion of pressure equalization tubes [^1f552237]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most basic question to be answered in each case in which the choice of using a pressure equalization tube (PET) is being considered is: "what is the underlying pathophysiology of the middle ear disease being addressed?"

Methods

We will evaluate the hypothesis that the Eustachian Tube (ET) may become "dysfunctional" due to allergic mucosal edema and obstruction. We review the literature that evaluates the role of ET, the proposed affect that allergy may contribute to ET dysfunction (ETD), and the relation of allergic rhinitis to otitis.

Results

Proof that allergy affects the middle ear was supported by (1) over a dozen investigators using objective immunotherapy demonstrating over the past 70 years that 72% to 100% of the children with otitis media with effusion (OME) are atopic, (2) an association of allergic Th2 immune-mediated histochemical reactivity within the target organ itself, (3) establishment that inflammation within the middle ear is truly allergic in nature, and (4) direct evidence of a dose-response curve and consistency of results, which confirm that OME resolves on allergy immunotherapy.

Conclusion

Current medical evidence should heighten the awareness of physicians of the physiology that underlies ETD. The evidence supports the link between allergy and OME. The middle ear behaves like the rest of the respiratory tract, and what has been learned about the atopic response in the sinuses and lungs may be applied to the study of the immunologic mechanisms within the middle ear that lead to ETD requiring the use of PET.

### An update on the appropriate role for hyperbaric oxygen: indications and evidence [^2be1724f]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Table 1.
A Comparison of Criteria Used in RCTs That Evaluated HBOT versus Other Advanced Therapeutics on DFUs

HBOT is administered by placing the entire patient into a pressure vessel (chamber), whereupon 100% oxygen is respired at atmospheric pressures ranging from 2 times sea level (202.65 kPa) to approximately 2.4 times that experienced at sea level (243.18 kPa). HBOT has a very low but predictable occurrence of side effects, the most common of which is mild to moderate otic barotrauma from pressure-related changes in the gas volume of the middle ear, occurring in up to 10% of patients. A very rare side effect is central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifested as a grand mal seizure, the incidence of which is variously reported between 1:10,000 and 1:50,000. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a rare, relative contraindication to HBOT, the air trapping from which can predispose to pulmonary overpressurization, pneumothorax, arterial gas embolism, and even death. Myopia, usually reversible, has been reported in patients undergoing a prolonged course of daily therapy. Reduction in blood glucose after HBOT has been reported among patients with diabetes. However, it is not known if this is due to the timing of treatment in relation to medication administration, or some direct physiological effect of HBOT, the mechanism of which has not been elucidated, although increased peripheral insulin sensitivity has been observed. We will review data on the efficacy of HBOT, describe how the specialty registry reporting requirements mandated as part of healthcare payment reform can be harnessed to study the comparative effectiveness of HBOT, and propose a new paradigm for the appropriate use of HBOT.

### Prevention of otic barotrauma in aviation: a systematic review [^52a41085]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review of the published evidence relating to the prevention of otic barotrauma in aviation. In particular, this review sought to identify procedures, techniques, devices, and medications for the prevention of otic barotrauma as well as evaluate the evidence relating to their efficacy.

Data Sources

Ten databases including Embase, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using the full historical range.

Study Selection

English language articles including more than or equal to five participants or cases were included. Outcomes of interest were reduced severity or the successful prevention of otic barotrauma in participants undergoing gradual changes in pressure during air travel or its simulation.

Data Extraction

Articles and data were extracted and analyzed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses and other international guidelines.

Conclusions

This review highlights the lack of published evidence relating to what is a significant and increasingly common problem in otology. There is level 1 evidence that supports the efficacy of oral pseudoephedrine (120mg) in preventing otic barotrauma in adults. However, oral pseudoephedrine (1mg/kg) does not appear to be effective in children. There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of either nasal balloon inflation or pressure-equalizing ear plugs for the prevention of otic barotrauma. A recently reported, novel technique for insertion of temporary tympanostomy tubes is promising but requires further evaluation.

### A preliminary theoretical model of hydrodynamics in the inner ear [^643a5f96]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Head movement should create a transient pressure imbalance across the membranous inner ear. We used basic concepts of fluid dynamics to develop a theoretical model of the inner ear. According to this model, two contiguous fluidic systems-the perilymphatic system and the endolymphatic system-are in hydrostatic equilibrium across a compliant membrane. Our model demonstrates that changes in resistance or compliance in one system results in a transient distortion of the membranous inner ear until equilibrium between the two systems is restored. The concept of hydrodynamic pressure changes in the inner ear has received little attention, but it may represent a new approach to understanding the inner ear and treating inner ear diseases.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^9984c487]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Ménière's disease was first described by Prosper Ménière in 1861 as a condition characterised by episodes of vertigo, associated with hearing loss and tinnitus (Baloh 2001). Sufferers may also report a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. Typically, it initially affects one ear, although some individuals may progress to develop bilateral disease. A hallmark of the condition is that symptoms are intermittent ‐ occurring as discrete attacks that last from minutes to several hours, then resolve. However, over time there is usually a gradual deterioration in hearing, and there may be progressive loss of balance function, leading to chronic dizziness or vertigo.

The diagnosis of Ménière's disease is challenging, due to the episodic nature of the condition, clinical heterogeneity, and the lack of a 'gold standard' diagnostic test. Even the agreed, international classification system has scope for two categories of diagnosis – 'definite' and 'probable' (Lopez‐Escamez 2015). In brief, a diagnosis of definite Ménière's disease requires at least two episodes of vertigo, each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours, together with audiometrically confirmed hearing loss and fluctuating aural symptoms (reduction in hearing, tinnitus or fullness) in the affected ear. 'Probable' Ménière's disease includes similar features, but without the requirement for audiometry to diagnose hearing loss, and with scope for the vertigo episodes to last longer (up to 24 hours). Both categories ('definite' and 'probable') require that the symptoms are not more likely to be due to an alternative diagnosis, due to the recognised challenges in distinguishing between balance disorders.

### The clinical findings to notice mild elevation of intracranial pressure in an otology clinic [^e11e8305]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2023). Medium credibility.

Mildly elevated intracranial pressure appears to be a distinct pathology separate from idiopathic increased intracranial pressure and migraine. Many patients present with head fullness-pressure and dizziness, which is often suggestive of a clinical diagnosis of vestibular migraine. These patients may additionally have episodic vertigo as seen in endolymphatic hydrops and positional vertigo in addition to feeling dizzy. In most cases, hearing is normal. A long duration of the condition or a presence of associated ear pathologies, i.e., dehiscence, fistula, hypermobile footplate, or history of chronic ear infections can add hearing loss to clinical presentations. Low-pitch pulsatile tinnitus, when present, is an important symptom. The neuroimaging findings such as partially empty sella, blockage of the dural venous sinus or sigmoid sinus wall defects are frequently observed. The condition is diagnosed by measuring the lumbar puncture opening pressure. Typically, patients have normal cerebrospinal fluid chemistry and microscopy. Lowering the pressure during the lumbar puncture will resolve the patient's symptoms temporarily. Medical therapy is typically successful using carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and corrections of medical disorders that may be contributing to the increased pressure. A few require shunting or stenting procedures. In this review article, we define the condition in detail with illustrative cases that we collected from our practices.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^39236faa]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Caregiver understanding of otitis media (OM) and otitis media with effusion (OME) — caregivers should be counseled on the cause of recurrent AOM and OME and the rationale for inserting tympanostomy tubes, including that middle ear infections (AOM) or fluid buildup (OME) are most often caused by a poorly functioning eustachian tube, that young children have horizontal eustachian tubes that are not fully developed, and that a tympanostomy tube allows air to enter the middle ear directly through the small opening in the tube, which allows fluid to drain and eliminates the negative pressure that contributed to fluid buildup and ear infections.

### Clinical practice guideline: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (update) [^3e11059c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Otologic disorders causing vertigo — clinical features distinguishing benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) from other entities are outlined. BPPV is characterized by acute, discrete episodes of brief positional vertigo without associated hearing loss. Ménière's disease involves discrete episodic attacks with sustained vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, aural fullness, and tinnitus; the vertigo typically lasts longer (usually on the order of hours), is not triggered by any obligate head position changes, and diagnosis requires an associated contemporaneous decline in sensorineural hearing, with protracted nausea and vomiting more common. Acute peripheral vestibular dysfunction (vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis) presents with sudden, unanticipated, severe vertigo with a subjective sensation of rotational (room spinning) motion; if the auditory portion of the inner ear is affected, hearing loss and tinnitus may occur (consistent with labyrinthitis), and these syndromes are commonly preceded by a viral prodrome. The time course differentiates these from BPPV: in vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis the vertigo is of gradual onset, developing over several hours, followed by a sustained level of vertigo lasting days to weeks; vertigo is present at rest but may be exacerbated by positional changes. Superior canal dehiscence (SCD) causes attacks of vertigo and oscillopsia brought on by loud sounds, Valsalva maneuvers, or pressure changes of the external auditory canals and differs from BPPV in that vertigo is induced by pressure changes and not position changes. A perilymph fistula can produce episodes of vertigo and nystagmus triggered by pressure, can occur after surgery involving the middle ear or mastoid region or spontaneously, and may be accompanied by a fluctuating hearing loss. Posttraumatic vertigo can present with vertigo, disequilibrium, tinnitus, and headache.

Barotrauma during air travel — barotrauma can occur when pressure inside an air‑filled, enclosed body space is not the same as the air pressure inside the aircraft cabin, most commonly because of rapid changes in environmental pressure during ascent when cabin pressure falls rapidly and during descent when cabin pressure quickly rises. Middle ear barotrauma is usually not severe or dangerous, though rarely it can cause complications including dizziness, hearing loss, a perforated tympanic membrane, and permanent tinnitus; to help reduce risk, travelers with ear, nose, and sinus infections or severe congestion might choose to postpone flying to prevent pain or injury or use oral or nasal decongestants to help alleviate symptoms.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^a689e6b7]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

There are various causes of chronic inflammatory middle ear diseases. These include, for example, chronic infection, colonization of the nasopharynx with bacterial otopathogens, autoimmune diseases, trauma, specific dysventilation of the posterior or anterior tympanic pathways, environmental or genetic risk factors, or reduced ventilation of the middle ear by dysfunction of the eustachian tube (ET). The clinical picture is based on a chronic inflammation of the tympanic cavity and the mastoid mucosa. A disturbance of middle ear ventilation is suspected as one of the causes. There is a relationship between the pressure in the middle ear and the function of the ET, and it is believed that periodic opening of the ET allows an air flow between the middle ear and the nose to equal air pressure between the tympanic cavity and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the ET also plays an important role in the clearance of middle ear secretions and serves to protect the middle ear from infection and gastroesophageal reflux. The incidence of eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) in adults is reported to be 1%, whereas in children, it is reported to be nearly 40%. The term "tubal dysfunction", however, is used ambiguously. According to Schilder et al. three subtypes of ETD are described: the dilatory ETD, the baro-challenge–induced ETD, and the patulous ETD.

Here, we focus on dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD, which includes "functional obstruction", "dynamic obstruction", and "anatomical obstruction". Tubal dysfunction is considered a cause in the development of tympanic effusions in childhood and in chronic inflammatory middle ear diseases. A feeling of pressure in the ears or the inability to perform a Valsalva maneuver may also be included in the category of tubal dysfunction. The extent to which chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is related to tubal dysfunction is not yet understood.

We report on the rate of dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD detected with currently established standard clinical methods in patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease scheduled for middle ear surgery.

### Tubomanometry measurement success rate in clinical practice [^386f1625]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Tubomanometry (TMM) is an objective method for investigating Eustachian tube (ET) function, but difficulties in technique and interpretation may reduce its usability. The objective of our study was to investigate common difficulties with TMM in different ET dysfunction (ETD) patient groups and at different pressures (30, 40, and 50 mbars) when first introducing TMM to otologic practice. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether it would be possible to perform TMM at only one pressure and obtain a representative result.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of a 2-year cohort of 114 patients with a history of ETD treated at a tertiary referral center. Primary outcome was the success rate of TMM, secondary the reasons for unsuccessful measurements. Tertiary outcome was the correlation of TMM results at adjacent pressures.

Results

TMM success rate was 91%, varying 81 to 94% in different ETD patient groups and 87 to 94% at different pressures. Unsuccessful measurements resulted from air-leaks from the external ear canal, abnormal ear canal pressure curves (R < 0) and at 50 mbar, difficulties in reaching sufficient nasopharyngeal pressure. TMM results were similar in 88% of cases at 30 and 40 mbars and in 86% of cases at 40 and 50 mbars.

Conclusions

TMM success rate seems sufficiently high for clinical diagnostics, and most difficulties may be overcome with proper interpretation during the TMM measurement session, and thus repeating the measurements when necessary. Considering the diagnostic information that would be lost if using only a single, predefined pressure, we suggest using all three pressures.

### History of meniere's disease and its clinical presentation [^4a1d2ce2]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The term Meniere's disease is used to define either the classic triad of vestibular and cochlear symptoms and aural pressure from known or unknown causes or its clinical variants, vestibular and cochlear Meniere's disease. Some variants evolve after years into typical forms, whereas others do not. Some symptoms (positional vertigo) have been long underestimated in previous reports. The more we study our patients and correlate clinical findings and the natural history with pathologic studies on temporal bones and laboratory research, the more we will understand Meniere's disease and its causes. Some causes have already been identified as most probable. Extrinsic factors (inflammation, trauma, otosclerosis, autoimmunity, endocrine disorders, and such) interact with congenital (genetic) and developmental intrinsic factors (primary or secondary, acquired) into a multifactorial inheritance that is, to date, the best explanation for the basis of Meniere's disease. Endolymphatic hydrops is widely accepted as the pathologic substrate, but not all hydrops seems to be progressive or becomes clinically manifest. Endolymphatic hydrops is the result of a dysfunction in the mechanism of production/absorption of endolymph, which is mainly due to defective absorptive activity of the endolymphatic duct and sac. Hyperproduction of endolymph cannot be excluded in some cases. Ruptures of the labyrinthine membranes do not satisfactorily substantiate the multiform duration, recurrence, and repetitiveness of attacks of Meniere's disease, nor do they explain the entire complex of symptoms. It seems reasonable to explain symptoms of Meniere's disease on the basis of mechanical factors (as observed in temporal bone studies) associated with biologic and biochemical factors.

### Rare pulmonary barotrauma after explosive decompression: a case report [^b939e723]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Humans exposed to pressure changes may suffer from barotraumas – tissue damage in gas-filled cavities inside the body. Barotraumas are dependent on several factors such as the magnitude of the pressure change, the rate of change, and others. They may be common while diving or in aviation. During pressure changes within the atmosphere, typical barotraumas occur in the middle ear cavity, sinuses, and sparingly in the gastrointestinal tract, but lung barotraumas are very rare, as will be discussed. Lung barotrauma occurs during a decrease in pressure, when the expanding gas from the lungs cannot be ventilated sufficiently. This causes an increase intrathoracic pressure which at some point will cause structural damage – pneumothorax. There are some reports describing a development of pneumothorax in aviation. A few cases were reported, but they were classified as idiopathic and thus could not be automatically considered as barotraumas. An increased risk of flight-related pneumothorax is also found in humans who are predisposed to conditions such as Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and congenital pulmonary airway malformation/congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^ad65d95e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Literature review

Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by signs and symptoms of pressure dysregulation in the middle ear such as 'aural fullness', 'popping', discomfort, pain or 'under water sensation'and represents a common problem with reported incidences ranging from 0.9% to 5%.

According to Schilder et al, the three subtypes of Eustachian tube dysfunction include barochallenge-induced dysfunction in conditions of alteration of the ambient pressure, patulous Eustachian tube dysfunction and dilatory Eustachian tube dysfunction. The latter can be broken down into functional obstruction, dynamic dysfunction due to muscular failure and anatomical obstruction.

Acute episodes are often preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection, or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, which causes inflammation in the Eustachian tube orifice or lumen. Chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction is defined by symptoms lasting for more than 3 months and has been associated with damage to the middle ear and the eardrum. Complications include otitis media with effusion (glue ear), middle ear atelectasis (retraction of the eardrum) and chronic otitis media with defects of the tympanic membrane. Consequently, it must be considered the primary cause of herniation of the tympanic membrane.

We found the earliest mention referring to a 'hernia of the tympanic membrane' dating back to 4 November 1932. In a written protocol of a case discussion in 'The Section of Otology' a 24-year-old male patient was presented, who reported otorrhea from childhood up to the age of 17, which then dried up. Seven years later, the ear discharged again for several days. On examination, the right drum was red and bulging, but painless and without inflammation. Hearing by air conduction was reduced. Decades before the possibility to perform cross-sectional imaging, the authors discussed the following questions. 'Is this a hernia of the middle layer of the drum, or is it a cholesteatoma, and if so, is the radical mastoid operation justifiable in view of the fact that the only symptom of the patient is deafness in the right ear? Should one perform paracentesis?' They agreed on performing a conventional anteroposterior view radiography of the petrous bone, which showed no bony abnormalities. A subsequently performed paracentesis revealed 'very thick tenacious mucus'. The final diagnosis in this case remains unknown.

### Facial and trigeminal nerves neuropathy induced by atmospheric pressure changes: a meta-analysis [^8618c474]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Barometric pressure changes during flight or diving may cause facial barotrauma. Neuropathy of the fifth (CN5) or the seventh (CN7) cranial nerves is a rare manifestation of this condition. The aim of this study was to analyze risk factors for baroneuropathies of CN5 and CN7.

Methods

A search of PubMed and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify all published cases of CN5 and CN7 neuropathies. Only original case reports and series that documented events of neuropathies associated with the trigeminal nerve or facial nerve while flying, diving, or mountain climbing were included. Assessed variables included sex, medical history, age, setting (flight or diving), atmospheric pressure changes, number of episodes, symptoms, treatment, and recovery.

Results

We identified a total of 48 articles described > 125 episodes in 67 patients. Mean age was 33.5 ± 12.1 years with a male predominance (76.1%). Cases were equally distributed between flight and diving (50.7%, 46.3%, respectively). CN5 involvement was observed in 77.6% of patients, with ear pain and facial numbness as the most common symptoms. The latter was correlated with positive otolaryngology medical history. CN7 was involved in 88.1% of patients. Flying, as opposed to diving was correlated with spontaneous resolution of symptoms (86.7% vs. 42.3% of cases resolved spontaneously, respectively, p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Flight is an equal risk factor to diving with respect to CN5 and CN7 barotrauma. Involvement of CN7 was observed in most cases, but possibly due to report-bias. Positive medical history is a risk factor for facial numbness.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^23f12735]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the difficulties in diagnosis, the true incidence and prevalence of the disease are difficult to ascertain. A population‐based study in the UK using general practice data estimated the incidence to be 13.1 per 100,000 person‐years (Bruderer 2017), and the prevalence of the disease has been estimated at 190 per 100,000 people in the US (Harris 2010). It is a disorder of mid‐life, with diagnosis typically occurring between the ages of 30 and 60 (Harcourt 2014). Some studies report a slight female preponderance, and there may be a familial association, with approximately 10% of patients reporting the presence of the disease in a first, second or third degree relative (Requena 2014).

The underlying cause of Ménière's disease is usually unknown. Ménière's disease has been associated with an increase in the volume of fluid in the inner ear (endolymphatic hydrops). This may be caused by the abnormal production or resorption of endolymph (Hallpike 1938; Yamakawa 1938). However, it is not clear whether this is the underlying cause of the condition, or merely associated with the disease. Some authors have proposed other underlying causes for Ménière's disease, including viral infections (Gacek 2009), allergic (Banks 2012) or autoimmune disease processes (Greco 2012). A genetic predisposition has also been noted (Chiarella 2015). Occasionally, the symptoms may be secondary to a known cause (such as a head injury or other inner ear disorder) – in these cases it may be referred to as Ménière's syndrome.

Although Ménière's disease is relatively uncommon, it has a profound impact on quality of life. The unpredictable, episodic nature of the condition and severe, disabling attacks of vertigo cause a huge amount of distress. Quality of life (including physical and psychosocial aspects) is significantly reduced for those with Ménière's disease (Söderman 2002). The costs of the condition are also considerable, both in relation to medical interventions (appointments, diagnostic tests and treatments) and loss of productivity or sick days for those affected by the condition (Tyrrell 2016).

### On the relationship between menière's disease and endolymphatic hydrops [^60658c50]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

The relationship between Menière's disease and endolymphatic hydrops is ambiguous. On the one hand, the existence of cases of endolymphatic hydrops lacking the classic symptoms of Menière's disease has prompted the assertion that endolymphatic hydrops alone is insufficient to cause symptoms and drives the hypothesis that endolymphatic hydrops is a mere epiphenomenon. Yet, on the other hand, there is considerable evidence suggesting a relationship between the mechanical pressure effects of endolymphatic hydrops and resultant disordered auditory physiology and symptomatology. A critical appraisal of this topic is undertaken, including a review of key histopathologic data chiefly responsible for the epiphenomenon hypothesis. Overall, a case is made that A) the preponderance of available evidence suggests endolymphatic hydrops is likely responsible for some of the auditory symptoms of Menière's disease, particularly those that can be modulated by mechanical manipulation of the basilar membrane and cochlear microphonic; B) Menière's disease can be reasonably considered part of a larger spectrum of hydropic inner ear disease that also includes some cases that lack vertigo. C) The relationship with endolymphatic hydrops sufficiently robust to consider its presence a hallmark defining feature of Menière's disease and a sensible target for diagnostic detection.

### Early static pressure-related evoked brain potentials indications of central middle ear pressure control in humans [^c71eaddf]. Otology & Neurotology (2009). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of afferent subcortical components related to static pressure changes of the human middle ear.

Background

The normal middle ear function depends on a proper regulation of middle ear pressure, whereas an inadequate regulation with negative pressures is considered a major pathogenetic factor responsible for a variety of middle ear disorders. However, although studies on middle ear pressure and related clinical problems are common, studies on the role of its central control have been remarkably few. Hence, we attempted recording evoked brain potentials in response to static pressure stimulation of the middle ear in normal adult humans.

Methods

The experiments were conducted by stimulating the middle ear in 6 subjects with a novel computer-controlled static pressure triggering system for rapid synchronized pressure loads of +3 kPa. The resulting brain evoked responses were recorded from 64 surface electrodes using a standard electroencephalogram cap. A wide-band electroencephalogram acquisition method was adopted, signals were sampled at 20,000 Hz, and band-pass filtered between 150 and 3,000 Hz.

Results

Repeatable pressure evoked brain potentials and topographies were described for the first time. Hence, source localization could be adopted on a realistic head model, which showed the location of these early neural generators in the brainstem, followed by activity generated by the cerebellum.

Conclusion

The findings are in agreement with previous animal experiments and provide basic information for further investigations on central components related to static pressure changes of the human middle ear.

### Meniere's disease might be an autoimmune condition? [^470da995]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review our current knowledge of the pathogenesis of Meniere's disease, including viral infection and immune system-mediated mechanisms, and to discuss the pathogenesis as it relates to pharmacotherapy.

Systematic Review Methodology

Relevant publications on the aetiopathogenesis, molecular biology, genetics and histopathology of Meniere's disease from 1861 to 2011 were analysed.

Results and Conclusions

Meniere's disease is characterised by intermittent episodes of vertigo, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural pressure. The aetiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. Proposed theories of causation include viral infections and immune system-mediated mechanisms. The immune response in Meniere's disease is focused on inner ear antigens. Approximately one-third of Meniere's disease cases seem to be of an autoimmune origin although the immunological mechanisms involved are not clear. The diagnosis of autoimmune inner ear disease is based either on clinical criteria or on a positive response to steroids. The antiviral approach has virtually eliminated the use of various surgical methods used in the past. Steroid responsiveness is high, and with prompt treatment, inner ear damage may be reversible. The administration of etanercept improves or stabilises symptoms in treated patients. Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome can be directed toward preventing thromboembolic events by using antithrombotic medications. Only warfarin has been shown to be effective. Gene therapy can be used to transfer genetic material into inner ear cells using viral vectors and to protect, rescue, and even regenerate hair cells of the inner ear.

### Seasonality in benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a systematic review [^0172375f]. BMJ Neurology Open (2025). High credibility.

Correlation between AP and BPPV

Three included studies showed a significant positive correlation between AP and BPPV, suggesting that as AP rises, so does the number of BPPV cases. Two of these studies, by Korpon et al and Cao et al, theorised that this correlation may be related to an increase in inner ear pressure, which in turn might cause otoconial dislodgement subsequently leading to BPPV. Korpon et al and Cao et al based this theory on earlier studiesthat identified pressure-sensitive ion channels in the inner ear and what Korpon et al and Cao et al present as valves or valve-like structures that regulate inner ear pressure under the influence of changes in AP. The two groups present the link between inner ear pressure and AP via these valves as fact in their respective studies. However, while the referenced studies do discuss the valves extensively and propose potential mechanisms and roles, they do not draw definitive conclusions about the effect of AP on inner ear pressure via these valves. Neither of the referenced studies seems to completely validate the underlying mechanisms in Korpon et al and Cao et al 's theory of otoconial dislodgement caused by an increase in inner ear pressure.

Cao et al described a possible pathophysiological link between BPPV and migraine headache, and Korpon et al also discussed this link, referencing two studies showing that migraine headache is also associated with changes in AP. Korpon et al suggested that the association between AP and both BPPV and migraine, coupled with the association between migraine and BPPV, may support a causative mechanism for the two conditions. Multiple studies have reported on increased risk of BPPV in patients with migraine, and increased risk of migraine in BPPV patients has also been reported. The association between BPPV and migraine, along with their shared association with AP, supports Korpon et al 's theory of common pathophysiological mechanisms in the two conditions. Both studies also suggest a similar relationship between BPPV and Ménière's disease. Current literature supports this as Ménière's disease has also been shown to be associated with AP. The hypothesis that BPPV, like other inner ear diseases, may be affected by AP is noteworthy, and more investigation into this correlation is warranted.

### Prevalence of eustachian tube dysfunction in adults in the United States… [^fae7372e]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

© 2025 The eustachian tube is a dynamic, tubular structure linking the middle ear to the nasal cavity. It ventilates and clears fluid from the middle ear when open, and prevents transmission of pathogens, material, and sounds when closed. 1 Eustachian tube dysfunction is a common diagnosis applied to conditions where the eustachian tube is incapable of performing its functions adequately, resulting in symptoms including hearing loss, aural fullness, otalgia, and autophony. Eustachian tube dysfunction occurs with a variable range of severity between 2 distinct subtypes, and patients may fluctuate along this spectrum of disease, even between subtypes. The exact causes of ETD are not clearly understood, but there are associations with inflammatory disease. Eustachian tube dysfunction is diagnosed through a combination of clinical history, physical examination, tympanometry, audiometry, and other tests as indicated.

A recently presented clinical consensus statement defined obstructive ETD in terms of medical history and/or evidence of negative middle ear pressure.

1. We analyzed data from 9098 adults aged 20 years or older from the 2001 to 2006 and 2009 to 2012 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, an ongoing cross-sectional study of a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized US population. Eustachian tube dysfunction was defined as tympanometric middle ear pressure less than −100 dekaPascals in either ear in the absence of cold, sinus problem, or earache in the last 24 hours and head cold or chest cold in the last 30 days. In addition, although peak pressure measurements have been used previously to define ETD, 5 this can underestimate prevalence by excluding individuals with flat tympanograms, which may correspond to middle ear effusion.

Nonetheless, to our knowledge, these data provide the first nationally representative estimates of the prevalence of ETD among US adults. Studies are needed to identify risk factors and causes, and advance both a clinical and a public health-driven approach to this common disorder.

### An unusual case of temporal bone encephalomeningocele occurring together with normal pressure hydrocephalus [^7329bcef]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2017). Low credibility.

Temporal bone encephalomeningoceles are uncommon clinical entities that can be challenging to diagnose and treat. Common presenting complaints include symptoms of aural fullness, hearing loss, clear otorrhea and meningitis. Common etiologies are chronic middle ear disease and trauma. A significant proportion of cases are spontaneous, which occurs in relation to benign intracranial hypertension. Normal pressure hydrocephalus associated with temporal bone encepahomeningoceles has not been previously described. The authors present an unusual case of spontaneous right sided temporal bone encephalomeningocele associated with symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus. Surgical repair of the defect was successful. The diagnostic and management approach to this unique case are discussed.

### Autoinflation for otitis media with effusion (OME) in children [^4292657e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Otitis media with effusion (OME) is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity, common amongst young children. The fluid may cause hearing loss. When persistent, it may lead to behavioural problems and a delay in expressive language skills. Management of OME includes watchful waiting, medical, surgical and mechanical treatment. Autoinflation is a self-administered technique, which aims to ventilate the middle ear and encourage middle ear fluid clearance by providing a positive pressure of air in the nose and nasopharynx (using a nasal balloon or other handheld device). This positive pressure (sometimes combined with simultaneous swallow) encourages opening of the Eustachian tube and may help ventilate the middle ear.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy (benefits and harms) of autoinflation for the treatment of otitis media with effusion in children.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 20 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials in children aged 6 months to 12 years with unilateral or bilateral OME. We included studies that compared autoinflation with either watchful waiting (no treatment), non-surgical treatment or ventilation tubes.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were determined following a multi-stakeholder prioritisation exercise and were: 1) hearing, 2) OME-specific quality of life and 3) pain and distress. Secondary outcomes were: 1) persistence of OME, 2) other adverse effects (including eardrum perforation), 3) compliance or adherence to treatment, 4) receptive language skills, 5) speech development, 6) cognitive development, 7) psychosocial skills, 8) listening skills, 9) generic health-related quality of life, 10) parental stress, 11) vestibular function and 12) episodes of acute otitis media. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Although we included all measures of hearing assessment, the proportion of children who returned to normal hearing was our preferred method to assess hearing, due to challenges in interpreting the results of mean hearing thresholds.

Main Results

We identified 11 completed studies that met our inclusion criteria (1036 participants). The majority of studies included children aged between 3 and 11 years. Most were carried out in Europe or North America, and they were conducted in both hospital and community settings. All compared autoinflation (using a variety of different methods and devices) to no treatment. Most studies required children to carry out autoinflation two to three times per day, for between 2 and 12 weeks. The outcomes were predominantly assessed just after the treatment phase had been completed. Here we report the effects at the longest follow-up for our main outcome measures. Return to normal hearing The evidence was very uncertain regarding the effect of autoinflation on the return to normal hearing. The longest duration of follow-up was 11 weeks. At this time point, the risk ratio was 2.67 in favour of autoinflation (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.73 to 4.12; 85% versus 32%; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 2; 1 study, 94 participants), but the certainty of the evidence was very low. Disease-specific quality of life Autoinflation may result in a moderate improvement in quality of life (related to otitis media) after short-term follow-up. One study assessed quality of life using the Otitis Media Questionnaire-14 (OMQ-14) at three months of follow-up. Results were reported as the number of standard deviations above or below zero difference, with a range from -3 (better) to +3 (worse). The mean difference was -0.42 lower (better) for those who received autoinflation (95% CI -0.62 to -0.22; 1 study, 247 participants; low-certainty evidence; the authors report a change of 0.3 as clinically meaningful). Pain and distress caused by the procedure Autoinflation may result in an increased risk of ear pain, but the evidence was very uncertain. One study assessed this outcome, and identified a risk ratio of 3.50 for otalgia in those who received autoinflation, although the overall occurrence of pain was low (95% CI 0.74 to 16.59; 4.4% versus 1.3%; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 32; 1 study, 320 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Persistence of OME The evidence suggests that autoinflation may slightly reduce the persistence of OME at three months. Four studies were included, and the risk ratio for persistence of OME was 0.88 for those receiving autoinflation (95% CI 0.80 to 0.97; 4 studies, 483 participants; absolute reduction of 89 people per 1000 with persistent OME; NNTB 12; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

All the evidence we identified was of low or very low certainty, meaning that we have little confidence in the estimated effects. However, the data suggest that autoinflation may have a beneficial effect on OME-specific quality of life and persistence of OME in the short term, but the effect is uncertain for return to normal hearing and adverse effects. The potential benefits should be weighed against the inconvenience of regularly carrying out autoinflation, and the possible risk of ear pain.

### The rate of eustachian tube dysfunction in adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease is low [^b2f409bf]. Otology & Neurotology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the pathophysiological mechanisms of protection and ventilation of the middle ear by anatomical conditions, environmental and genetic factors also play a role in the development of chronic middle ear processes.

If evidence of ETD exists on testing, then balloon dilatation of the ET may be considered as an adjunct therapy, but a lot of patients (based on our observations: 82%) do not have evidence of ETD at the time of ear surgery.

It should be considered, however, that currently available clinical standard measurement methods and scores may not be sufficiently suited to detect tubal dysfunctions. One solution would be to apply more advanced testing for ETD, for instance, pressure chamber test. We did not perform pressure chamber test in this patient cohort from clinical routine practice. However, already established measurement procedures of ET function should be evaluated and developed further to correctly assess the informative value of the different measurement procedures and thus to increase the informative value of the measurements in their entirety.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^9d2dea63]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) versus acute otitis media (AOM) imaging — captions indicate that the left images show the eardrum on otoscopy and the right images depict the middle ear space; in OME "the middle ear space is filled with mucus or liquid", whereas in acute otitis media "the middle ear space is filled with pus, and the pressure causes the eardrum to bulge outward".

### Intracochlear pressures in simulated otitis media with effusion: a temporal bone study [^e00d9f95]. Otology & Neurotology (2018). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Simulated otitis media with effusion reduces intracochlear pressures comparable to umbo velocity.

Background

Otitis media with effusion is a common cause of temporary hearing loss, particularly in children, producing deficits of 30 to 40dB. Previous studies measured the effects of simulated effusion on ossicular mechanics; however, no studies have measured cochlear stimulation directly. Here, we compare pressures in the scala vestibuli and tympani to umbo velocity, before and after induction of simulated effusion in cadaveric human specimens.

Methods

Eight cadaveric, hemi-cephalic human heads were prepared with complete mastoidectomies. Intracochlear pressures were measured with fiber optic pressure probes, and umbo velocity measured via laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV). Stimuli were pure tones (0.1-14kHz) presented in the ear canal via a custom speculum sealed with a glass cover slip. Effusion was simulated by filling the mastoid cavity and middle ear space with water.

Results

Acoustic stimulation with middle ear effusion resulted in decreased umbo velocity up to ∼26dB, whereas differential pressure (PDiff) at the base of the cochlea decreased by only ∼16dB.

Conclusion

Simulating effusion leads to a frequency-dependent reduction in intracochlear sound pressure levels consistent with audiological presentation and prior reports. Results reveal that intracochlear pressure measurements (PSV and PST) decrease less than expected, and less than the decrease in PDiff. The observed decrease in umbo velocity is greater than in the differential intracochlear pressures, suggesting that umbo velocity overestimates the induced conductive hearing loss. These results suggest that an alternate sound conduction pathway transmits sound to the inner ear during effusion.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^a020e8ce]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) with structural damage — The text states individuals "should have prompt tympanostomy tube insertion when there is real or impending structural damage to the tympanic membrane caused by retraction (from negative middle ear pressure) or collapse (from atrophy or atelectasis)". It adds, "Although there are no randomized trials to support this approach, inserting the tube will equalize middle ear pressure and eliminate middle ear effusion, which may help avoid more extensive otologic surgery for ears with retraction pockets, atelectasis, or early signs of cholesteatoma".

### Ear, nose, and throat manifestations during pregnancy [^43ad1618]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this clinical review is to highlight the otolaryngological symptoms that occur in pregnancy. Where available, the authors discuss the current evidence of the etiology and management of the various presentations. While it is appreciated that many of these complaints are transient, their impact on the maternal quality of life can be significant, and therefore, medical practitioners should be aware of what to expect in order to provide reassurance to patients and also to safely manage such symptoms.

Data Sources

MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for publications related to otolaryngology and pregnancy.

Review Methods

All literature was searched for and reviewed by 2 authors independently. Search results were then cross-examined, and any differences were settled by consensus.

Results

Pregnancy leads to circulatory changes and increased susceptibility to viral reactivation, and along with the exertion of parturition, it can lead to tinnitus, facial palsies, and deafness. Rising levels of sex hormones and heightened sensitivity to allergens may influence the nasal mucosa, precipitating epistaxis and rhinitis. Increased progesterone and the increased intra-abdominal pressure of the growing fetus can lead to symptoms and sequelae of laryngopharyngeal reflux. Evidence for the treatment of pregnancy-induced symptoms is principally restricted to case reports and retrospective studies.

Conclusion

Recognition and understanding of pregnancy-related ear, nose, and throat complaints will allow otolaryngologists to reassure and manage these patients, improving their experience of the gestational period. High-quality evidence for their management is limited, with further research required.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^fe9c9863]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Statement 16. Patient outcomes — Clinicians should document resolution, improvement, or worsening of vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss and any change in quality of life in patients with Ménière's disease after treatment. Recommendation based on the controlled arms of RCTs, outcomes from RCTs, cohort studies, and observational studies with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Quality improvement opportunity is that tracking outcomes of therapy provides an opportunity for modification of management to optimize outcomes. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C; level of confidence in evidence is Medium due to Grade C evidence. Benefits are opportunity to adjust for more effective therapy, possibility of more accurate diagnosis, opportunity for hearing rehabilitation, and patient engagement; risks, harms, and costs are cost and time of visits. Benefit-harm assessment is preponderance of benefit over harms; policy level is Recommendation. Intentional vagueness is that the word symptoms can refer to vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, or pressure depending on what is of most concern to the patient; the role of patient preferences is Medium, as some patients with subjectively adequate disease control may choose not to follow up.

### Prudent healthcare in practice: integration of audiology services into primary care [^9dad93d7]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Future developments

Although still in its infancy, PC audiology services have scope to increase the services that can be offered and further reduce demand on GPs and ENT departments as the role of the healthcare scientist develops and expands. Dizziness is one of the most common presenting complaints to GP practices, and vestibular-trained AAPs could assist in diagnosis, further reducing pressure on GP services. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is a leading cause of dizziness in older populations, and consequently a basic BPPV assessment and treatment service would benefit both patients and GP practices.

From the data collected in 2021, ear infections were the most common reason for GP involvement despite being seen by an AAP. Developing the role of the AAP to allow them to prescribe topical antibiotics when required would drastically reduce the need for GP intervention in patients seen by the PC audiology team. Further, patients with complex ear canals (eg, following surgery) who also require wax removal are typically reviewed for regular microsuction in the ENT department. Additional training for AAPs on how to safely manage complex ears will serve to reduce this demand and prevent the need for ENT review.

### Clinical practice guideline: otitis media with effusion (update) [^dbda8547]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Medium credibility.

Otitis media with effusion (OME) risk factors and prevention — Numerous studies indicate that breast-feeding can decrease this risk by transmitting antibodies from mother to child and reducing environmental allergies. Additionally, removing tobacco smoke from the child's environment is recommended, as the duration of exposure appears to be linked to OME risk. Good hand hygiene and pneumococcal vaccination may reduce the development of AOM in this population as well. Limiting pacifier use in children < 18 months old decreases the incidence of AOM by about 30%, which would also reduce the prevalence of OME that routinely follows these episodes. Despite common advice to avoid supine bottle-feeding in infants to prevent otitis media, there are no well-designed studies to justify this claim beyond one small observational study that showed more abnormal tympanograms when children were fed supine. Similarly, feeding infants with nonventilated or underventilated bottles can generate negative pressure in the middle ear, but whether this leads to increased prevalence of OME is unknown.

### Diving medicine [^16151bc7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Exposure to the undersea environment has unique effects on normal physiology and can result in unique disorders that require an understanding of the effects of pressure and inert gas supersaturation on organ function and knowledge of the appropriate therapies, which can include recompression in a hyperbaric chamber. The effects of Boyle's law result in changes in volume of gas-containing spaces when exposed to the increased pressure underwater. These effects can cause middle ear and sinus injury and lung barotrauma due to lung overexpansion during ascent from depth. Disorders related to diving have unique presentations, and an understanding of the high-pressure environment is needed to properly diagnose and manage these disorders. Breathing compressed air underwater results in increased dissolved inert gas in tissues and organs. On ascent after a diving exposure, the dissolved gas can achieve a supersaturated state and can form gas bubbles in blood and tissues, with resulting tissue and organ damage. Decompression sickness can involve the musculoskeletal system, skin, inner ear, brain, and spinal cord, with characteristic signs and symptoms. Usual therapy is recompression in a hyperbaric chamber following well-established protocols. Many recreational diving candidates seek medical clearance for diving, and healthcare providers must be knowledgeable of the environmental exposure and its effects on physiologic function to properly assess individuals for fitness to dive. This review provides a basis for understanding the diving environment and its accompanying disorders and provides a basis for assessment of fitness for diving.

### The effect of CPAP on middle ear pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^61f1ee03]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the effect of short-term and long-term continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use on middle ear pressure (MEP) in adult ears.

Databases Reviewed

PubMed, Scopus, and Embase were searched through October 2020. Search strategies used a combination of subject headings (e.g. MeSH in PubMed) and keywords for CPAP and middle ear pressure.

Methods

English-language articles studying changes in MEP as measured by tympanometry or tympanograms in patients using CPAP were selected for inclusion. Data extraction from included articles included demographics, baseline, and follow-up data.

Results

A total of 7 articles representing 664 patients with weighted mean age of 42.5years (range 34.9–57.8yrs) were included. Meta-analysis of three qualifying studies demonstrated a positive correlation between higher CPAP pressures and degree of MEP rise during CPAP use compared to baseline with mean difference of 25.1daPa (95% confidence interval [18.7, 31.4]) at 5cm H2O and 81.9daPa (95% confidence interval [60.2, 103.5]) at 10cm H2O. Short-term effects of CPAP use were reviewed in four studies that showed a transient rise in MEP. Three separate studies examining the long-term effects of CPAP use showed resting MEP was higher in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which might be related to progressive eustachian tube dysfunction as a complication of severe OSA.

Conclusion

Short-term CPAP use is associated with transient elevations of MEP in adult ears. Long-term CPAP use might produce beneficial MEP changes, especially in patients with OSA and eustachian tube dysfunction.

### New tender, bleeding papule on the left ear [^75c81813]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) is a painful, inflammatory condition that impacts the skin of the ear. It is commonly associated with pressure on the pinna causing a nodule that may have erythema, bleeding and exudate. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with a history of basal cell carcinoma who presented with a new tender spot on the antihelix of her left ear. The tenderness of the new spot forced her to switch from holding her phone to her left ear to using her right ear. A shave biopsy confirmed CNH and ruled out non-melanoma skin cancer. Although most prior cases report association with sleeping on the side of the affected ear, this case was attributed to cell phone use. It is important to remember that non-traditional sources of pressure can also lead to CNH.

### Facial paresis and pulsatile middle ear mass [^73d44ebf]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Significance Statement

Head and neck paragangliomas are uncommon pathologies that present with common symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus and aural pressure. This article highlights an unusual presentation of a patient with facial paresis who was found to have a jugular paraganglioma. Emphasis is placed on how the otologic examination showed a pulsatile middle ear mass that led to the diagnosis. This case illustrates the importance of maintaining a healthy degree of clinical suspicion when encountering common complaints.

### Tympanometry versus direct middle ear pressure measurement in an artificial model: is tympanometry an accurate method to measure middle ear pressure? [^8cb31a61]. Otology & Neurotology (2003). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

Indirect tympanometric pressure measurements of the middle ear (ME) do not correspond to direct pressure measurements.

Background

Tympanometry is an accepted method for estimating ME pressures. These pressure values are different, however, when measurements are made directly.

Materials and Methods

Negative pressures were induced by volume changes in an artificial ME model with various "mastoid" volumes. Both tympanometric and direct pressure measurements were obtained simultaneously.

Results

A substantial difference was demonstrated between tympanometric and direct pressure measurements. There was a linear correlation between tympanometry and direct pressures between -46.8 and -93.6 mmH2O, with a tympanometric overestimation of 40% to 20%, respectively. The smaller the "mastoid" volume, the greater the overestimation. The correlation was not linear for direct pressures between zero and -46.8 mmH2O. Tympanometric overestimation was greatest (i.e., 4-14-times the actual pressure) in the pressure range between zero and -12 mmH2O.

Conclusions

Tympanometry does not yield precise ME pressure values. In a model with a larger "mastoid" and an actual pressure range of -46.8 to -93.6 mmH2O tympanometric readings are somewhat less unreliable (error of 40%-20%). However, tympanometry is in error of more than 400% in a model with a small mastoid in which the actual ME pressure is only slightly negative (i.e., range between -3.9 and -46.8 mmH2O). Therefore, this study implies that tympanometry has little use for measuring ME pressure especially in chronic ears or their sequelae that are usually characterized by having small negative pressures and small mastoids.

### A cochlear-bone wave can yield a hearing sensation as well as otoacoustic emission [^f8058d65]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Results

Fluid dynamics

We start from a one-dimensional model of the inner ear (Fig. 1, model parameters are given in Table 1). The basilar membrane extends in the longitudinal x direction and delineates two chambers. The one below the membrane is the scala tympani. We denote a pressure deviation therein from the resting pressure by p 1, a longitudinal fluid flow by j 1 and the cross-sectional area by A 1. The upper chamber comprises the scala media and scala vestibuli; this chamber's pressure deviation is p 2, its longitudinal fluid flow j 2 and its cross-sectional area A 2.

The longitudinal fluid flows in the upper and lower chamber carry momenta of ρ ∂ t j 1 and ρ ∂ t j 2, respectively, which must result from a longitudinal pressure gradient in that chamber:

Here ρ denotes the fluid density. The continuity equation states that a gradient in the longitudinal fluid flow of either chamber can only arise from a temporal change in the chamber's cross-sectional area or from a change in the fluid's density ρ 1/2. We denote by a 1 and a 2 the area change in the lower and the upper chamber, respectively. The total cross-sectional area of the respective chamber is A 1/2 + a 1/2. We then find

A deviation in the fluid's density from its resting value ρ 0 is caused by a change in pressure through the fluid's compressibility κ: ∂ t ρ 1/2 = ρ 0 κ ∂ t p 1/2.

The cross-sectional area of either cochlear chamber can change because of basilar-membrane vibration (Fig. 1b). We assume that the membrane's cross-section deforms parabolically, with a midpoint velocity V bm that is defined such that an upward membrane motion yields a positive velocity (Methods). This motion hence expands the lower chamber and shrinks the upper one:

### A cochlear-bone wave can yield a hearing sensation as well as otoacoustic emission [^e8452353]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Here, we also include the possibility that the cochlear bone around the upper and lower chamber can be deformed through the intra-chamber pressure. Two types of deformation of a given cross-section are conceivable. First, the circumference of a cross-section may change. This requires compressibility of the chamber's wall. Second, the circumference may remain constant but the shape of the cross-section may vary. As the elastic modulus of bone is high, the first type of deformation has a much higher impedance than the second. We hence only consider a deformation of the second type.

Which change in cross-sectional area results from a deformation that leaves the circumference constant? Let us approximate each chamber's cross-section by an ellipse-like shape that is deformed under internal pressure (Fig. 1b and section on the linear-response coefficient C (Methods)). As a pressure change produces an equal force at every angle, no deformation can result when the cross section is circular. However, an asymmetric ellipse-like object that lacks rotational symmetry will deform under a pressure change. The impedance associated with this deformation has been studied in the literature. Specifically, a decreasing internal pressure will increase the asphericity of the ellipse-like shape because, at constant circumference, the area is the smaller the more aspherical it is. Conversely, an enhanced pressure will tend to increase the cross-sectional area, which will hence deform towards a circle. For small deformations as we consider here, the area change depends linearly on the pressure deviation. The total change a 1/2 of the cross-sectional area of the upper respectively the lower chamber is hence the sum of one contribution from the membrane deflection and another contribution from the bone deformation:

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease or syndrome [^2da27d49]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ménière's disease is an incapacitating disease in which recurrent attacks of vertigo are accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus and/or aural fullness, all of which are discontinuous and variable in intensity. A number of different therapies have been identified for patients with this disease, ranging from dietary measures (e.g. a low-salt diet) and medication (e.g. betahistine (Serc®), diuretics) to extensive surgery (e.g. endolymphatic sac surgery). The Meniett® low-pressure pulse generator (Medtronic ENT, 1999) is a device that is designed to generate a computer-controlled sequence of low-pressure (micro-pressure) pulses, which are thought to be transmitted to the vestibular system of the inner ear. The pressure pulse passes via a tympanostomy tube (grommet) to the middle ear, and hence to the inner ear via the round and/or oval window. The hypothesis is that these low-pressure pulses reduce endolymphatic hydrops.

Objectives

To assess the effects of positive pressure therapy (e.g. the Meniett device) on the symptoms of Ménière's disease or syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 6 June 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing positive pressure therapy (using the Meniett or a similar device) with placebo in patients with Ménière's disease. The primary outcome was control of vertigo; secondary outcomes were loss or gain of hearing, severity of tinnitus, perception of aural fullness, functional level, complications or adverse effects, and sick days.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted authors for additional data. Where possible, we pooled study results using a fixed-effect, mean difference (MD) meta-analysis and tested for statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi² test and I² statistic. This was only possible for the secondary outcomes loss or gain of hearing and sick days. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (Cl).

Main Results

We included five randomised clinical trials with 265 participants. All trials were prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials on the effects of positive pressure therapy on vertigo complaints in Ménière's disease. Overall, the risk of bias varied: three out of five studies were at low risk, one was at unclear risk and one was at high risk of bias. Control of vertigo For the primary outcome, control of vertigo, it was not possible to pool data due to heterogeneity in the measurement of the outcome measures. In most studies, no significant difference was found between the positive pressure therapy group and the placebo group in vertigo scores or vertigo days. Only one study, at low risk of bias, showed a significant difference in one measure of vertigo control in favour of positive pressure therapy. In this study, the mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score for vertigo after eight weeks of treatment was 25.5 in the positive pressure therapy group and 46.6 in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -21.10, 95% CI -35.47 to -6.73; scale not stated - presumed to be 0 to 100). Secondary outcomes For the secondary outcomes, we carried out two pooled analyses. We found statistically significant results for loss or gain of hearing. Hearing was 7.38 decibels better in the placebo group compared to the positive pressure therapy group (MD) (95% CI 2.51 to 12.25; two studies, 123 participants). The severity of tinnitus and perception of aural fullness were either not measured or inadequate data were provided in the included studies. For the secondary outcome functional level, it was not possible to perform a pooled analysis. One included study showed less functional impairment in the positive pressure group than the placebo group (AAO-HNS criteria, one- to six-point scale: MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.81 to -0.39, 40 participants); another study did not show any significant results. In addition to the predefined secondary outcome measures, we included sick days as an additional outcome measure, as two studies used this outcome measure and it is a complementary measurement of impairment due to Ménière's disease. We did not find a statistically significant difference in sick days. No complications or adverse effects were noted by any study.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence, from five included studies, to show that positive pressure therapy is effective for the symptoms of Ménière's disease. There is some moderate quality evidence, from two studies, that hearing levels are worse in patients who use this therapy. The positive pressure therapy device itself is minimally invasive. However, in order to use it, a tympanostomy tube (grommet) needs to be inserted, with the associated risks. These include the risks of anaesthesia, the general risks of any surgery and the specific risks of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis associated with the insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Notwithstanding these comments, no complications or adverse effects were noted in any of the included studies.

### Can the negative pressures found in obstructive sleep apnea and eustachian tube dysfunction be related? [^69e46700]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is well known. When both exist in a single pediatric patient, one of the expected culprits is adenoid enlargement. We hypothesize, in contrast, that the negative pharyngeal pressure found in OSA may be transmitted to the middle ear as negative middle ear pressure (MEP), which subsequently results in pathology. The objective of this study was to determine whether the degree of OSA and MEP are associated while using MEP as a quantifiable measurement of ETD.

Study Design

Retrospective chart review.

Setting

Tertiary academic center (Jan 2000-Jan 2018).

Subjects and Methods

The relationship between apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and MEP was examined. A non-anatomic model was utilized to support causality.

Results

Thirty-four pediatric patients and twenty-three adult patients were included in the analysis. REM AHI showed a moderate negative correlation with MEP in children (r = -0.265), and a weak positive correlation with MEP in adults (r = 0.171). Children with an AHI in the severe OSA category had a more negative mean MEP than those in the mild category (p = 0.36). Adults with an AHI in the severe OSA category had a more positive mean MEP than those in the mild category (p = 0.11).

Conclusion

In children, increasing severity of OSA is associated with a negative MEP, suggesting that negative pressure associated with OSA may be transmitted to the middle ear. In adults, increasing severity of OSA is associated with a more positive MEP.

### Middle ear gas pressure regulation: the relevance of mastoid obliteration [^fb2deb23]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To establish a mathematical model of middle ear gas pressure regulation and to discuss potential implications for pathophysiology-oriented theoretical approach to middle ear surgery, with particular attention to mastoid obliteration.

Background

Numerous studies support that small mastoid volume is associated with cholesteatoma. Latest studies show that mastoid obliteration is an effective technique to lower the recurrence rate in these ears.

Methods

A mathematical model was used to predict the development of gas pressure balance in the function of different middle ear volumes (VME), considering normal and dysfunctional Eustachian tube. Published data as gas pressure input values and our 3D CT reconstruction data in healthy and pathologic middle ears of children were applied.

Results

The model predicted ≤ 6.66 daPa pressure fluctuations in VME ≥ 3 ml, compared to ≥ 16 daPa of a VME ≤ 1 mL at perfect ET function, because of the different pressure change rate and pressure buffer effect of the MEs. Substantially larger fluctuations can be expected in a VME < 3 mL with malfunctioning ET. Modeling mastoid obliteration predicts similar pressure fluctuations to a VME ≥ 3 mL resulting from elimination of gas exchange surface.

Conclusion

Pressure change is faster in smaller MEs than in larger ones. Healthy MEs between 3 and 6 mL are very sensitive to the duration of a potential ET dysfunction to develop ME pathology. In MEs with poor mastoid pneumatization and dysfunctional ET, typical in cholesteatoma cases, mastoid obliteration as surgical reduction of mucosal surface for gas exchange can improve ME gas pressure balance resulting in better long-term outcome.

Adolescent and young adult traumatic ear lacerations — timely repair and repiercing guidance include that "Trauma to the pierced external ear is common", and "All wounds should be cleaned and repaired within 12 to 24 hours". Technique notes state "A simple earlobe tear can be sutured under local anesthesia", and repiercing is timed as "If the hole has closed, the earlobe can be repierced in an unscarred area after ~3 months". Additional counseling advises that "Pointed earring posts may cause pressure sores or postauricular skin irritation when worn during sleep", and "The removal of jewelry at bedtime is indicated if switching to a different earring style does not resolve the problem", while "Parents of infants or young children with pierced ears should be informed of the risk of aspiration and ingestion of earring parts".

Patient-reported symptoms and likely diagnosis — Allergic rhinitis (AR), nonallergic rhinitis (NAR), acute upper respiratory tract infection, chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without nasal polyps, and CRS with nasal polyps — are contrasted by frequency descriptors. Rhinorrhea/sniffing in AR is described as very common with clear watery discharge, whereas NAR is common but less than AR overall; in acute infection it is common and may be clear to purulent and watery to mucoid with crusts; and in CRS (with or without nasal polyps) it is common and clear to mucoid. Ocular pruritus/watery discharge/red eyes is very common in AR but uncommon in NAR and acute infection and very uncommon in CRS. Nasal congestion or blocked nose/mouth breathing is very common and persistent in AR and very common, chronic, almost universal in CRS with nasal polyps. Facial or sinus pain/pressure is very uncommon in AR yet common in acute infection and in CRS without nasal polyps. Postnasal drip is uncommon and persistent in AR but very common in NAR and common in acute infection and CRS without nasal polyps. Nasal/palate/ear itching is common in AR and very uncommon in NAR, acute infection, and CRS with or without nasal polyps. Snoring is uncommon and persistent in AR but common in the other listed conditions, and sleep disturbance/sleep apnea is common across all listed conditions. Frequencies are based on expert evidence and opinion and the table was developed based predominantly on expert opinion.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 6 family travel [^d242d3d5]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Air travel and ear pain in infants and children — air travel is safe for most newborns, infants, and children, but children with chronic heart problems, lung problems, or sickle cell disease might be at risk for hypoxia during flight, and caregivers should consult a healthcare professional before travel. Ear pain can be troublesome for infants and children during descent, and pressure in the middle ear can be equalized by swallowing or chewing; thus, infants should nurse or suck on a bottle, and older children can try chewing gum. Antihistamines and decongestants have not been shown to be of benefit. Antihistamines are contraindicated under the age of 1 year, and the FDA and AAP caution against their use under the age of 6 years except for allergic conditions; the AAP recommends against the use of decongestants for any reason under the age of 4 years. No evidence suggests that air travel exacerbates the symptoms or complications associated with otitis media.

Ménière's disease — diagnostic evaluation and symptom management research needs include audiologic differentiation, imaging utility, migraine management, acute attack therapy, and trigger documentation. The page asks whether audiogram patterns can differentiate MD from retrocochlear pathology to prevent unnecessary imaging; explores correlations between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and disease degree and calls for data on the rate of retrocochlear or underlying lesions among MD presentations; questions whether all recalcitrant cases should receive migraine prophylaxis; states there is a clear need for well-designed trials of antiemetic, antivertigo, and oral steroid use for acute events; and urges better identification and documentation of individual triggers with examples including salt sensitivity, stress, allergy, and barometric pressure.

### Performing tympanometry using smartphones [^fc4bb3b9]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In a healthy patient, an increase in positive and negative pressure tense the eardrum and make it more stiff, which causes an increase in reflected sound energy. The tympanogram is generated on the smartphone by converting the sound energy into calibrated units of acoustic admittance magnitude (Fig. 3 d). The calibration process is performed by comparing reflections from the ear to reflections generated from cavities of known volumes.

Ears with middle ear fluid may have a stiff eardrum and the amount of reflected sound energy at different pressure levels may not have a pronounced peak. Patients with ear tubes or a tympanic membrane perforation will likely have a consistently attenuated reflection at different pressures that would indicate an unusually large ear canal volume. Middle ear conditions that affect the eardrum, like chronic eustachian tube dysfunction with a retracted eardrum and without fluid, may result in the tympanogram peak occurring at a negative pressure. An overly stiff eardrum, in the case of reduced ossicular mobility such as otosclerosis, may cause a lower than normal peak amplitude and an ossicular discontinuity may cause a higher than normal peak amplitude. The tympanogram output displayed on the smartphone (see Supplementary Fig. 2) can be interpreted in the same way as it is on commodity tympanometers.

### A case of Pott's puffy tumor associated with barosinusitis from scuba diving [^35d06b26]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Barosinusitis

Scuba diving is one of the fastest-growing "high-risk" recreational sports with an estimated 9 million certified divers in the United States alone. Barotrauma is common and is estimated to be experienced by 30% to 50% of divers. – Novice scuba divers are more vulnerable to barotrauma and middle ear disorders because of their inexperience in equalization techniques. Furthermore, children may be more at risk of middle ear pressure equalization problems because of immature Eustachian tube function.

The pathophysiology of diving-induced sinus barotrauma is well described and referred to in the scuba vernacular as "sinus squeeze". Boyle's Law, which states that the volume of gas is inversely proportional to its pressure at a given temperature, is fundamental in describing the pathogenesis of sinus barotrauma. Barosinusitis is often caused when sudden changes in ambient pressure are not compensated for by force equalization mechanisms within the sinuses. Normally, air pressure within the sinus cavities equilibrates with that of the surrounding nasal passages via openings in the sinuses called ostia. Blocked ostia or difficulty with equilibration can lead to uncompensated changes in the intrasinus pressure, which can result in varying degrees of sinonasal mucosal injury and inflammation. Divers experience great pressure variation over a short interval, which can lead to a cascade of changes directly impacting the ears and sinuses, as they are rigid air-filled cavities.

### Clinical practice guideline: Ménière's disease [^6e3a4d58]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Positive pressure therapy (Meniett device) in Ménière's disease — Evidence syntheses found no benefit for vertigo control and the use of positive pressure therapy, such as that with a Meniett device, is not recommended. Sved et al reviewed 4 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with follow-up from 2 weeks to 4 months and found no significant difference in vertigo control, and Van Sonsbeek et al reviewed 5 RCTs and determined there was no compelling evidence of effectiveness. The optimal frequency is 3 applications of pressure daily for at least 6 weeks; if there is no improvement after 6 weeks, then it is unlikely that the device is efficacious. Hearing levels were worse in users in 2 studies, and tympanostomy tubes are required with risks including persistent tympanic membrane perforation (approximately 2%–4%) and chronic otorrhea (approximately 1%). There may be rare exceptions in subpopulations at high risk for general anesthesia or with contraindications to other destructive procedures where this therapeutic modality may be utilized as a last resort to treat Ménière's disease, and providers need to clearly advise patients that current data suggest it may not be helpful in controlling symptoms.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 3 environmental hazards and risks [^6285dc99]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Scuba diving barotrauma — ear/sinus and pulmonary overpressure — details mechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and urgent actions. In the ear, the eardrum being pushed into the middle ear space can cause "pain, bleeding, and possibly rupture and even injury to the inner ear", and "Forceful equalization under these conditions can increase the pressure differential… resulting in round window rupture with perilymph leakage and inner ear damage"; "Healthcare professionals can coach this effort by observing movement of the tympanic membrane using simple otoscopy". For sinuses, "Paranasal sinuses… are especially susceptible to barotrauma, generally on descent", with risk factors including "Use of solid earplugs", "Medication (e.g., overuse or prolonged use of decongestants leading to rebound congestion)", "Ear or sinus surgery", "Nasal deformity or polyps", and "Chronic nasal and sinus disease that interferes with equilibration during the large barometric pressure changes encountered while diving". Divers who suspect ear or sinus barotrauma "should discontinue diving and seek medical attention". Symptoms of ear barotrauma include "Decreased hearing", "Pain", "Sensation of fullness", "Sensation of "water in the ear" (serous fluid/ blood accumulation in the middle ear)", "Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)", and "Vertigo (dizziness or sensation of spinning)". For pulmonary injury, "Scuba divers can reduce the risk for lung overpressure problems by breathing normally and ascending slowly when breathing compressed gas", because "Overexpansion of the lungs can result if a scuba diver ascends toward the surface without exhaling". During ascent, bubbles can escape into "3 possible locations: the pleural space, mediastinum, or pulmonary vasculature", with pleural entry causing "lung collapse or pneumothorax", mediastinal entry causing "mediastinal emphysema" that can track subcutaneously or to the larynx with "a change in voice characteristics", and alveolar rupture leading to "arterial gas embolism (AGE)". "Mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema might resolve spontaneously, but pneumothorax generally requires specific treatment to remove the air and reinflate the lung", and "AGE is a medical emergency, requiring urgent intervention with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (recompression treatment)".

### Predictors of non-rhinogenic facial pain or pressure in otolaryngology clinic [^a32e0a8b]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Identify demographic and clinical characteristics that may help differentiate non-rhinogenic facial pain or pressure (NRFP) from sinusitis.

Study Design

Retrospective single-institution study.

Setting

Tertiary Care Center Rhinology Clinic.

Methods

All patients presenting with a complaint of facial pain or pressure over a 3-year period were included. Patients were categorized into either NRFP or sinusitis groups based on computed tomography imaging and nasal endoscopy. Data pertaining to demographics, history, and SNOT-22 questionnaire domains were compared via univariate analysis as well as logistic regression with backwards variable selection.

Results

A total of 296 patients met inclusion criteria, of which 128 had NRFP and 168 had sinusitis. A significantly greater percentage of patients in the NRFP group were women of childbearing age (40.6% vs 28.0%, P = 0.02). Backwards variable selection resulted in a model with four variables predicting a diagnosis of NRFP-female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.998, P < .0001), no history of prior sinonasal surgery (OR = 0.340 for history vs no history, P < .01), low nasal domain score (OR = 0.551, P < .0001), and high ear/facial domain score (OR = 1.453, P < .01).

Conclusion

Accurately identifying patients with NRFP at initial presentation based on history would help direct patients to the appropriate care pathway and prevent ineffective treatments such as antibiotics and sinus procedures. Our findings suggest that the suspicion for NRFP should be higher in women of child-bearing age as well as patients with greater ear/facial symptoms or lesser nasal symptoms.

### Diagnosis of meniere's disease: routine and extended tests [^0fcf395a]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Meniere's disease can compromise the quality of life of some patients in a manner so seriously that it can cause social segregation, even from family. Hearing loss, tinnitus, aural pressure, and disturbances in equilibrium added to an emotional instability frequently present in these patients may take them to a progressive state of solitude and depression, marking their lives by personal tragedy and making life a living hell. The clinical picture of Meniere's disease fluctuates, however. Individually, subsidiary examinations become impotent in diagnosing Meniere's disease. To be called Meniere's disease, the cause must be unknown; otherwise it would constitute Meniere's syndrome. Taking all of this into consideration, one would call this an unusual situation, or at least confusing. The lack of an etiologic diagnosis in medicine always creates anxiety for doctors and patients. What is considered to be either a routine or an extended test may change from service to service. The physician does not need to order all tests. What the physician needs is a protocol he or she trusts. Test results can vary, even depending on the moment when they are performed. More important than the number of tests ordered is the strategy by which the tests should be put together at that certain moment. The authors believe that one should have his or her own protocol for diagnosis, always beginning with a detailed history taking being guided by them most of the time. It is the authors' understanding that patients with Meniere's disease should be followed closely by their ear, nose, and throat doctor in episodes of vertigo or fluctuation of their hearing, tinnitus, or aural pressure. Should the patient be experiencing a stable period, a clinical visit along with an audiovestibular workup should be performed at least once a year. By monitoring the course of the disease, clinicians would be able to detect early changes in symptoms and/or test results, giving them the possibility to intervene clinically as early as possible in acute episodes of vestibulocochlear disorganization, protecting the inner ear, and minimizing sequelae from spells of hydrops. The authors believe that only the association of clinical sense and as many subsidiary tests as are useful will lead to a desirable level of certainty in the diagnosis of Meniere's disease, and will allow clinicians to presume bilateral involvement, monitor the development of the disease, intervene in its natural course, and idealize appropriate treatment.

### Uniform registration agreements on cholesteatoma care: a nationwide consensus procedure [^20c4038f]. Otology & Neurotology (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Survey

Ninety-six out of 136 surveys were completed (70.5%); no incomplete surveys were returned. Both before and after the cholesteatoma operation, the most frequently reported symptom is "hearing loss". In addition, the two other most frequently reported symptoms are preoperative "otorrhea (ear discharge)" and "feeling of pressure in the ear". Postoperative symptoms are "tinnitus" and "feeling of pressure in the ear". The survey also showed that the factors determining whether surgery is perceived as being successful by patients are "no recurrence of the cholesteatoma", "improved hearing", and "no complications". The factors that patients considered crucial in determining the quality of care are "communication with the physician", "being able to discuss the fear of recurrence of the cholesteatoma", and "number of visits to outpatient clinic" (see Table 1). From the patient's perspective, it is important to include this data for the uniform registration of cholesteatoma care.

### Hearing loss and cerebrospinal fluid pressure: case report and review of the literature [^97010c0e]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

A decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure may result in an endolymphatic hydrops through a patent cochlear aqueduct or through the fundus of the internal auditory canal. This hydrops typically leads to low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. We describe the case of a man who presented with a subjective and objective hearing loss in addition to a headache 4 days after he had undergone a dural puncture. We treated him with a standard epidural blood patch. Immediately after treatment, his hearing improved and his headache resolved.

### Bone-conduction hearing and the occlusion effect in otosclerosis and normal controls [^9a438917]. Otology & Neurotology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to better understand bone-conduction hearing in subjects with normal hearing and in those with otosclerosis through the occlusion effect. With this study, the authors hope to lend credence to commonly accepted theories of bone-conduction hearing and the effect of lateralization during the Weber tuning fork test.

Background

There are three accepted theories defining bone-conduction hearing: compressional bone conduction describes an auditory percept produced by the compression and expansion of the cochlea leading to basilar membrane vibration; inertial bone conduction describes the inertia of the ossicular chain as a result of skull vibration during bone conduction testing; whereas skull vibration may also be transmitted to the external auditory canal, surrounding soft tissues, and para-auditory structures to illicit tympanic membrane vibration known as osseotympanic bone conduction.

Methods

Twenty normal volunteers and 17 unilateral otosclerosis patients underwent external canal sound pressure level measurement during bone-conduction testing using a standardized bone oscillator placement and stimulation paradigm. Sound was detected with a probe microphone placed in the external auditory canal in nonoccluded and occluded conditions after a 50-dB hearing level bone-conduction stimulus.

Results

There was no significant difference in sound pressure level between otosclerosis and normal subjects when the external auditory canals were nonoccluded. With occlusion, sound pressure level increased in both groups, but at a statistically significantly higher level for the otosclerosis group.

Conclusion

Sound measured in the external canal likely represents energy lost to the environment transmitted through the middle and external ear systems, aided by the effect of both inertial and osseotympanic bone conduction. Occluding the ear leads to sound trapping and amplification. Also, the pressure exerted against the tympanic membrane reduces middle ear compliance and increases the impedance mismatch between air and the middle ear system, reflecting sound back into the external canal. This effect is further enhanced by stapes fixation to explain our data in both groups of subjects. The final common pathway in "lateralization" is probably a product of higher than normal impedance mismatch at the oval window.

### Ear and vestibular symptoms in train operators after sudden air pressure changes in trains [^6c17ebd4]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A healthy 31-year-old train operator presented to our occupational health clinic reporting ear aches, headaches, dizziness, unsteadiness and even slight tinnitus. These symptoms first appeared when the patient started operating from a new train cabin. He described a sudden pressure gradient, experienced on some parts of the trajectory, which might have caused these problems. Although the cabins were equipped with a pressure equalising device, this was usually switched off because of the device creating an uncomfortable feeling in the cabin. The literature describes sudden pressure gradients as possible factors for passenger discomfort.

### Vestibular migraine or meniere's disease: a diagnostic dilemma [^9ebb5607]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Examinations of endolymphatic hydrops

Glycerin test

Glycerin test, or glycerol test, is believed to temporarily revert the inner ear pressure to normal by reducing the excessive endolymphatic fluid, and thereby improving inner ear function, especially in typical MD patients. Since this effect of glycerol is short-lasting, eventually the hearing threshold remains the same.

A temporary improvement in hearing, due to the effect of glycerol, could be seen in virtually 35.3~58.1% of MD patients. Nowadays, clinical data on glycerol use in VM patients are still lacking although some researchers have found EH in some VM patients.

Since EH are rarely present in VM patients, and some studies, to date, suggested that EH in MD patients are more severe and common, the association between glycerin test and the core symptoms may serve to distinguish between MD and VM.

### The effects of positive and negative middle ear pressures on auditory threshold [^5ef6a58c]. Otology & Neurotology (2006). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

To assess the effects of positive and negative middle ear pressures on auditory threshold.

Background

Nonatmospheric middle ear pressures can alter auditory threshold by their effects on tympanic membrane and ossicular chain mobility.

Methods

Experiments were conducted on guinea pigs by inducing alterations in pressure (positive and negative) with a syringe connected to the middle ear bulla cavity, the magnitude of the pressure being assessed with a water manometer. Elevated middle ear fluid pressures were also induced by attaching a saline-filled vertical tube to the saline-filled middle ear. The effect of these altered middle ear air and fluid pressures were assessed by recording auditory nerve-brainstem evoked responses.

Results

There was no effect on auditory threshold of positive middle ear air pressures (up to 250 mm H2O). A negative middle ear air pressure of -50 mm H2O induced a significant 9.5-dB threshold elevation, whereas more negative pressures (up to -150 mm H2O) did not induce an additional threshold elevation. Filling the middle ear cavity with saline induced a 10- to 16-dB elevation, whereas additional fluid pressures (up to 200 mm H2O) did not induce further elevations.

Conclusion

The major factor inducing threshold elevation in serious otitis media is not the alteration in middle ear pressure but rather the reduction in the volume of compressible air in the middle ear by the fluid.

(Endo-)lymphatic Overload Symptoms

PTCs frequently present symptoms that are related to overload of the olfactory lymphatic pathway. Nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sinusitis, have been linked to IICH. The mechanism involves CSF drainage along the perineural spaces of the cranial nerves, most commonly the olfactory nerve. As the endothelial layer of the olfactory nerve sheath is thinner in the nasal mucosa and ethmoid sinus, CSF penetrates into the lymphatic pathways of the nasal submucosa, traveling toward the regional lymph nodes. When the olfactory lymphatic drainage system becomes saturated with excess CSF, the fluid may leak into the nasal mucosa, leading to mucosal swelling and nasal obstruction. Leaking of excess CSF into the paranasal and nasal cavities may cause watery rhinorrhea or sinusitis. In our cohort, 62% of patients experienced rhinitis symptoms (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, or both), which is a greater proportion than that reported in the general population of Belgium. The overall incidence of rhinitis in Belgium has been estimated at 39.2%.

Notably, 9% of PTCs had already undergone septoplasty due to persistent severe nasal obstruction.

Rotational vertigo occurred in 64% of the PTCs. Hearing loss and vertigo may result from the transmission of increased CSF pressure to the medial or inner ear via the cochlear aqueduct. Meniere's disease and IICH share similar symptoms, such as a greater incidence of vertigo, tinnitus, aural fullness, sensorineural hearing loss, and headache. When lumbar punctures were performed in patients with IICH, vertigo, dizziness, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness improved. Additionally, medical management with diuretics and corticosteroids is similar for both IICH and Meniere's disease. This mechanism of olfactory overload may also explain the severe ear pressure experienced by 49% of PTCs during airplane flights.

Tinnitus

In our cohort of PTCs, 59% experienced pulsatile tinnitus. Among the younger cohort, the prevalence was greater (74%) than that in the older cohort (49%). Pulsatile tinnitus is a common symptom of IICH due to increased ICP acting on the blood vessels near the ear.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^dc85c6c6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Balance disorders can be difficult to diagnose and treat. There are few specific diagnostic tests, a variety of related disorders with similar symptoms, and a limited number of interventions that are known to be effective. To determine which topics within this area should be addressed with new or updated systematic reviews we conducted a scoping and prioritisation process, involving stakeholders. Ménière's disease was ranked as one of the highest priority topics during this process (along with vestibular migraine and persistent postural perceptual dizziness).

Although Ménière's disease is a relatively uncommon condition, the significant impact it has on quality of life demonstrates the clear importance of identifying effective interventions to alleviate the symptoms. There is considerable variation in the management of Ménière's disease on both a national and international scale, with a lack of consensus about appropriate first‐line and subsequent therapies.

This review is part of a suite of six that consider different interventions for Ménière's disease. Through these reviews, we hope to provide a thorough summary of the efficacy (benefits and harms) of the different treatment options, to support people with Ménière's (and healthcare professionals) when making decisions about their care.

### Middle ear pressure change as a function of body position [^0e3a9e8a]. The Laryngoscope (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To verify and assess immediate middle ear (ME) pressure changes as a function of body position.

Study Design

A prospective clinical trail.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-six adult volunteers having 52 normal, healthy ears had tympanometric ME pressures measured in an upright and recumbent positions. Recordings were obtained immediately after positioning and after 3 minutes. The main outcome measure was the pressure difference between upright and recumbent measurements, that is, positional ME pressure change.

Results

All ME pressure recordings were within (-)100 to (+)55 mmH(2)O. An instant and significant (P < .001) pressure elevation was recorded in all ears once position changed from upright to recumbent. The average pressure increment was 19 mmH(2)O. Once a recumbent ear was repositioned upright it demonstrated an immediate pressure drop and regaining the initial ME pressure. Assuming the volume of a normal ME cleft as 8 mL and following Boyle's law, an ME volume alteration of about 17 microL was required to induce such pressure change.

Conclusions

Positional pressure changes were within the range of normal daily ME pressure variations. The instantaneous pressure changes and reversibility may be explained by filling and emptying of blood vessels within the ME cleft, following gravity causing an alteration of the aerated volume. Individual differences of pressure change may follow variability of ME cleft volume, its surface, and vessel density.

### The effect of continuous positive airway pressure on middle ear pressure [^9c7eff71]. The Laryngoscope (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives/Hypothesis

While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is commonly used for obstructive sleep apnea treatment, its effect on middle ear pressure is unknown. The purpose of this study was to measure the effect of CPAP on middle ear pressure and describe the correlation between CPAP levels and middle ear pressures.

Study Design

Retrospective review of normal tympanometry values and a prospective cohort evaluation of subjects' tympanometric values while using CPAP at distinct pressure levels.

Methods

A total of 3,066 tympanograms were evaluated to determine the normal range of middle ear pressures. Ten subjects with no known history of eustachian tube dysfunction or obstructive sleep apnea had standard tympanometry measurements while wearing a CPAP device. Measurements were taken at baseline and with CPAP air pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H(2)O.

Results

The percentage of normal control patients with middle ear pressures above 40 daPa was 0.03%. In the study population, prior to a swallowing maneuver to open the eustachian tube, average middle ear pressures were 21.67 daPa, 22.63 daPa, 20.42, daPa, and 21.58 daPa with CPAP pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H(2) 0, respectively. After swallowing, average middle ear air pressures were 18.83 daPa, 46.75 daPa, 82.17 daPa, and 129.17 daPa with CPAP pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 cm H(2)0, respectively. The postswallow Pearson correlation coefficient correlating CPAP and middle ear pressures was 0.783 (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Middle ear air pressure is directly proportional to CPAP air pressure in subjects with normal eustachian tube function. Middle ear pressure reaches supraphysiologic levels at even minimal CPAP levels. Although further investigation is necessary, there may be otologic implications for patients who are chronically CPAP dependent. These findings may also influence the perioperative practice of otologic and skull base surgeons.

### Temporomandibular joint disorder and inner ear pruritus: resolution by eminectomy [^13c86877]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Recurrent dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disk is caused by many factors. Dislocation can result in an acute or chronic closed lock condition. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is often presented with otalgia symptoms. Other aural symptoms such as deafness, tinnitus, pressure/blockage, and vertigo are also commonly presented together with TMJ dysfunction (Clin Otolaryngol Allied Sci. 1980;5:23–36). However, pruritus associated with TMJ dysfunction in the inner ear has never been reported in the literature. We report a case history of TMJ dysfunction and associated inner ear pruritus, which are both resolved by eminectomy.

### Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease [^b0f29202]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of main results

Positive pressure therapy may slightly increase the proportion of people who experience an improvement in the frequency of vertigo at 3 to < 6 months. However, the evidence on the actual change in vertigo frequency, and global scores of vertigo, was very uncertain.

Positive pressure therapy may make little or no difference to disease‐related quality of life at 3 to 6 months. The evidence is very uncertain regarding the effect of positive pressure therapy on hearing at 3 to < 6 months, and we did not identify any evidence regarding the effect of treatment on tinnitus.

We did not identify any evidence on serious adverse events, or other (less serious) adverse effects related to positive pressure therapy, so cannot comment on potential harms of this treatment.

### Rare case of ballooning herniation of the tympanic membrane [^c96f944e]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Background

Although bulging of the tympanic membrane is commonly encountered, a ballooning herniation occupying the external auditory canal is extremely rare. The development of these lesions is thought to require a pre-existing defect of the tympanic membrane and recurrent positive pressure inside the middle ear. Habitual Valsalva manoeuvres, the so-called 'autoinflation', can transiently relieve symptoms in these patients but are also part of the pathomechanism in the first place. Severe cases are recommended to be treated surgically, while in mild cases observation may be a reasonable approach.
