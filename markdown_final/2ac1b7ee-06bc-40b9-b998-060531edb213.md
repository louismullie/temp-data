## Question

elevated total protein workup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a stepwise approach to the workup of an elevated total serum protein, with emphasis on detecting monoclonal gammopathies, interpreting results, distinguishing MGUS versus myeloma, and organizing follow-up and special considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about verification of the abnormality and the immediate clinical context. Then, I should define the core initial laboratory panel per contemporary guidelines. Next, I will interpret possible result patterns and map them to diagnoses and risk tools. After that, I need to evaluate for end-organ damage to separate MGUS from symptomatic plasma cell disorders. Finally, I should construct risk-adapted surveillance and integrate special populations such as CKD and IgM MGUS, while addressing the role of urine testing and advanced methods like mass spectrometry, and close with patient counseling and red flags for escalation.

> Let me first confirm the abnormality and anchor the clinical context. Elevated total protein on a chemistry panel is often incidental, so I should repeat the measurement to ensure persistence, verify no hemolysis or pre-analytical error, and immediately review for CRAB features suggestive of plasma cell disorders: hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, and bone pain or lytic lesions. Hold on, I should also ask about hyperviscosity symptoms in IgM settings and recurrent infections that might signal immunoparesis. I will not jump to conclusions until the repeat is confirmed and symptoms and basic labs are reviewed because these findings guide urgency and the breadth of testing I will order [^116BpJnY] [^113SFcY5].

> Next, I should order the core laboratory panel simultaneously to avoid diagnostic delay. I need SPEP with reflex to immunofixation to detect and type an M-protein, a serum free light chain assay to capture light chain–only disease and calculate the κ/λ ratio, and a CBC plus comprehensive metabolic panel to quantify anemia, creatinine/eGFR, and corrected calcium; if an intact M-protein sits in the beta region, I should be ready to quantitate immunoglobulins by nephelometry. Wait, let me verify reference intervals: for sFLC I should apply age-stratified cutoffs to reduce false positives where available, given the recent redefinition data. I should also ensure IFE confirmation when a new M-protein is suspected on SPEP to establish monoclonality and isotype with confidence [^117RkPAf] [^116bkfsy] [^113FSrZ1] [^116FQBWq].

> Now, about urine studies, I initially think SPEP plus sFLC alone has 100% sensitivity based on large laboratory series, suggesting UPEP with IFE could be deferred. Wait, let me verify this before I overstate it. That finding comes from an observational study and may not universally apply in all plasma cell disorders; guidelines still endorse comprehensive initial detection strategies and confirmatory testing, so I should reserve UPEP with IFE for patients with unexplained proteinuria, suspected AL amyloidosis, discordant serum results, or when serum assays are equivocal. I need to ensure I do not miss light chain excretion, especially if renal involvement is prominent or sFLC is abnormal without a clear SPEP spike [^117F2xiY] [^117RkPAf] [^116oz8hL].

> I will now examine the scenario where an M-protein is detected. Let me quantify the M-spike by SPEP densitometry, and if the band localizes in regions that hinder accurate quantitation, I should use nephelometric immunoglobulin quantitation to estimate the burden. I need to confirm isotype with IFE and assess the sFLC ratio; an abnormal ratio supports clonality, whereas a normal ratio with an intact immunoglobulin M-protein can still be consistent with MGUS. Hold on, I should also check for immunoparesis, meaning suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulins, because that carries prognostic implications [^113FSrZ1] [^117RkPAf] [^116bkfsy] [^116SarbZ].

> Next, I should risk stratify MGUS using validated models that avoid bone marrow when possible. The Mayo approach weighs isotype, M-protein magnitude, abnormal sFLC ratio, and immunoparesis; for IgG MGUS, an M-protein above 1.5 g/dL increases risk, and any abnormal ratio is an independent risk factor. Let me double-check that I communicate progression risk clearly, because it guides the cadence of surveillance and the threshold for additional imaging and marrow evaluation over time [^116SarbZ] [^113VMzX9].

> If no M-protein is seen on SPEP but the sFLC ratio is abnormal, I need to consider LC-MGUS. I should first reapply age-stratified reference intervals for the ratio and recheck renal function, because CKD can shift the ratio upward without true clonality, sometimes up to about 3.1. If the ratio remains abnormal after accounting for renal function and age, I can diagnose LC-MGUS and proceed with standard risk-informed follow-up, with heightened vigilance for end-organ syndromes such as AL amyloidosis if clinical signs emerge [^116FQBWq] [^116oz8hL].

> Conversely, if neither an M-protein nor an abnormal sFLC ratio is present, I should think polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Let me consider liver disease, chronic infections such as HIV, HBV, or HCV, autoimmune disorders like SLE or RA, chronic inflammatory states with elevated CRP, and rarer entities such as IgG4-related disease, where IgG4 levels above about 5 g/L are highly specific. I need to ensure I do not conflate IL-6–driven inflammation, often flagged by CRP persistently above 30 mg/L, with a clonal gammopathy, as the management pivots to treating the underlying inflammatory or hepatic condition rather than hematologic surveillance [^117V5GLa].

> I should now evaluate for end-organ damage to distinguish MGUS from symptomatic plasma cell disorders. Let me first confirm whether CRAB features are present: corrected calcium above approximately 11 mg/dL or more than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit, significant renal impairment, hemoglobin below 10 g/dL or a drop of at least 2 g/dL, and any lytic bone lesion on imaging. Hold on, I should not jump straight to bone marrow in every MGUS case; in apparent IgG MGUS with M-protein 15 g/L or less and no end-organ damage, routine marrow biopsy can be deferred, but if anemia, hypercalcemia, renal failure, bone pain, or imaging abnormalities are present, marrow evaluation becomes indicated alongside modern skeletal imaging such as low-dose whole-body CT or FDG-PET/CT depending on availability and clinical context [^113SFcY5] [^113vTGar].

> For low-risk MGUS, I need to set pragmatic surveillance. I should reassess at six months with CBC, creatinine, calcium, SPEP quantitation, and sFLC, and if stable thereafter, annual follow-up is reasonable; over time, if persistently stable beyond five years and life expectancy is limited, I might extend intervals or de-intensify testing, but I must individualize. Let me verify that these intervals align with both BSH and EMN consensus, which they do for low-risk categories [^115CTYvt] [^113WDeFy].

> For intermediate- or high-risk MGUS, I should monitor more closely. I will review every six months for the first two years, then annually if stable, staying alert for signs of progression such as a 25% or greater rise in M-protein, worsening anemia, new renal impairment, emergent hypercalcemia, or skeletal symptoms that trigger imaging. Wait, I should confirm risk category at baseline and periodically, because changes in M-protein magnitude, FLC ratio, or immunoparesis can shift risk and warrant adjusting the cadence or scope of surveillance [^115RveHs].

> For LC-MGUS, I need to ensure longitudinal tracking of sFLC with renal function and clinical surveillance for amyloid manifestations, including nephrotic syndrome, cardiac dysfunction, or neuropathy, which would prompt dedicated amyloidosis workup. Let me reconsider if I should add cardiac biomarkers in asymptomatic patients; in general I reserve NT-proBNP and troponin for those with clinical suspicion of AL rather than as universal screening markers during MGUS follow-up [^notfound].

> Special populations require nuanced interpretation. In CKD, I should double-check sFLC interpretation using renal-adjusted reference intervals, recognizing that a κ/λ ratio modestly up to about 3.1 can be physiologic in reduced GFR. I should also monitor kidney function more closely and avoid over-calling clonality in the setting of polyclonal FLC elevation. Hold on, I should verify that diet or protein intake is not conflating this picture; dietary advice for CKD should follow nephrology guidance independently of the gammopathy workup [^116oz8hL] [^114BkoQw].

> For transplant candidates with MGUS, I should confirm comprehensive evaluation for other plasma cell disorders but avoid excluding them from kidney transplantation solely due to MGUS. I need to counsel on a modestly increased risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease and other hematologic malignancies while ensuring shared decision-making and appropriate post-transplant monitoring plans [^117P1BuP] [^116DSze7].

> IgM MGUS deserves particular attention given its higher risk of progression to Waldenström macroglobulinemia. Let me ensure I ask about hyperviscosity symptoms, neuropathy, and lymphadenopathy, consider baseline cross-sectional imaging if clinically indicated, and have a lower threshold for marrow evaluation. I should also communicate that patients with an abnormal FLC ratio and an IgM M-protein above 1.5 g/dL carry substantially higher long-term progression risk, which justifies tighter surveillance and symptom education [^111S9yhV].

> I need to check inflammatory markers carefully. Persistent CRP elevation above about 30 mg/L makes IL-6–driven polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia more likely than a monoclonal process, so I should prioritize evaluation for liver disease, infection, and autoimmune conditions in that context. But wait, I should verify that CRP is not being used to monitor MGUS itself, because it lacks specificity for clonal progression and can mislead decision-making during follow-up [^117V5GLa] [^112CFRAQ].

> Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and deep responses can complicate conventional electrophoretic monitoring. I should confirm suspected drug interference if a new band appears during therapy and consider specialized methods such as mass spectrometry in select cases where distinguishing a therapeutic antibody from residual M-protein is critical. Hold on, I will not replace SPEP/IFE and sFLC with mass spectrometry routinely, but I will use it as an adjunct when analytical limitations materially affect management decisions [^113TKi3C].

> Patient counseling closes the loop. I must explain that MGUS is asymptomatic but lifelong, with an average progression risk around 1% per year for low-risk disease and higher when risk factors accumulate, and I should give clear instructions to report new bone pain, fatigue, weight loss, infections, neuropathy, edema, or dyspnea promptly. Let me ensure the follow-up plan, test cadence, and thresholds for escalation are documented and communicated to both the patient and primary clinicians to reduce anxiety and avoid unnecessary testing [^115CTYvt] [^113VMzX9].

> To summarize my algorithmic approach without oversimplifying: I confirm the elevated total protein and clinical context, obtain SPEP with reflex IFE plus sFLC and basic labs in parallel, interpret findings into monoclonal versus polyclonal patterns with renal- and age-aware sFLC cutoffs, assess for CRAB features and image or biopsy when indicated to exclude symptomatic plasma cell disorders, then implement risk-adapted surveillance with explicit criteria for progression. Along the way, I remain cautious about the limitations of urine testing and the potential value of selective urine IFE, the interpretive pitfalls in CKD, and the special monitoring needs in IgM MGUS, all while educating patients and coordinating care to ensure timely escalation if red flags arise [^116BpJnY] [^115CTYvt].

An elevated total protein level is most often due to **monoclonal gammopathies** or **polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia** [^117V5GLa]. Begin with a focused history and examination, then order **SPEP, sFLC, and IFE** to detect and confirm monoclonal proteins [^117RkPAf] [^116bkfsy] [^116BpJnY]. If a monoclonal protein is found, assess for **end-organ damage** with CBC, calcium, and creatinine, and consider bone marrow biopsy [^113SFcY5] and imaging [^113vTGar]. If the pattern is polyclonal, evaluate for infection, autoimmune disease, or liver disease with targeted labs and imaging [^117V5GLa]. Management is guided by the underlying cause, with **regular monitoring** [^112CFRAQ] for progression in monoclonal gammopathies [^115CTYvt].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

### History and physical examination

- **Symptoms**: Fatigue, weight loss, bone pain, recurrent infections, neuropathy, hyperviscosity [^115uLPTN].
- **Medical history**: Chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, liver disease, renal impairment, malignancies.
- **Medications**: Immunoglobulin therapy, biologics, chronic inflammatory treatments [^117V5GLa].
- **Family history**: Hematologic malignancies, autoimmune diseases.

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Step 1: confirm elevated total protein

Confirm elevation with **repeat testing** to ensure persistence and exclude laboratory error [^116BpJnY].

---

### Step 2: differentiate monoclonal vs. polyclonal gammopathy

- **Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)**: Detects monoclonal (M-protein) or polyclonal patterns [^113FSrZ1].
- **Serum free light chain (sFLC) assay**: Detects free light chains, especially in light chain myeloma or AL amyloidosis [^117RkPAf] [^117F2xiY].
- **Immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE)**: Confirms and types monoclonal proteins [^116bkfsy].

---

### Step 3: additional laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: Evaluate anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia.
- **Renal function tests**: Serum creatinine, eGFR, BUN.
- **Liver function tests**: ALT, AST, ALP, bilirubin, albumin.
- **Calcium and uric acid**: Hypercalcemia or hyperuricemia suggest myeloma [^111grAgz].
- **Beta-2 microglobulin**: Marker of tumor burden in plasma cell disorders [^111grAgz].
- **C-reactive protein (CRP) and ESR**: Assess inflammation [^117V5GLa].

---

## Imaging studies

Imaging should be **tailored to the clinical context**. A skeletal survey or whole-body low-dose CT can detect lytic lesions in suspected myeloma; MRI or PET-CT evaluates soft-tissue involvement or extramedullary disease [^111grAgz]; and abdominal ultrasound or CT assesses the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes in polyclonal gammopathy.

---

## Indications for bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is indicated when a **monoclonal protein exceeds 1.5 g/dL** or the sFLC ratio is abnormal. Additional triggers include clinical suspicion of multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, or AL amyloidosis [^113SFcY5], as well as unexplained cytopenias or an abnormal peripheral smear.

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Monoclonal gammopathies** | **Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia** |
|-|-|
| Multiple myeloma | Chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis) |
| Waldenström macroglobulinemia | Autoimmune diseases (SLE, RA, Sjögren's) |
| Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) | Chronic liver disease (cirrhosis, hepatitis) |
| Light chain amyloidosis | Sarcoidosis, Castleman disease |
| POEMS syndrome | Chronic inflammatory conditions [^117V5GLa] [^113vTGar] |

---

## Management strategies

### Monoclonal gammopathies

Treatment is **disorder-specific**: multiple myeloma is managed with chemotherapy, immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and autologous stem cell transplantation. Waldenström macroglobulinemia typically receives rituximab-based therapy, with plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity [^111S9yhV]. MGUS is managed with **regular surveillance** for progression, including CBC, calcium, creatinine, SPEP, and sFLC every 6–12 months [^112CFRAQ] [^113WDeFy].

---

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia

Management of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia focuses on **treating the underlying condition**, including infections, autoimmune diseases, or liver disease. Immunosuppressive therapy is used for autoimmune or inflammatory etiologies, and plasmapheresis is rarely used — reserved for severe hyperviscosity [^117V5GLa].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Follow-up and monitoring include **regular assessment** with CBC, renal function, calcium, SPEP, and sFLC [^115CTYvt]. Ongoing clinical reassessment should monitor for progression or complications [^113DeVzE]. Patients should be instructed to report new symptoms such as bone pain, fatigue, or infections [^113WDeFy].

---

## Potential complications

Potential complications include **hyperviscosity syndrome**, presenting with neurologic symptoms, visual disturbances, and bleeding. Renal impairment from light-chain deposition or amyloidosis may occur, along with bone disease with lytic lesions and fractures and increased infections related to immunosuppression [^115uLPTN].

---

Elevated total protein requires a **structured approach**: confirm the abnormality, distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal patterns, and pursue targeted labs and imaging. Management depends on the cause, with **regular monitoring** to detect progression or complications [^116BpJnY] [^1135LEiu].

### European myeloma network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: What to use and when [^111grAgz]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Additional laboratory tests should be performed for the diagnosis and follow-up of MM patients, such as a complete blood count to evaluate possible cytopenias, blood smears to look for circulating PC, and general biochemistry tests (renal and liver function tests, calcium, phosphate, uric acid, albumin, creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, β2-microglobulin). Quantification of serum immunoglobulins by nephelometry enables an indirect measurement of the M-protein or the recognition of a secondary hypogammaglobinemia and is recommended for any patient presenting with a gammopathy (oligo-, poly- or monoclonal).

The HevyLite® immunoassay quantifies both the involved and uninvolved intact immunoglobulin chains and quantifies them separately (IgGκ/λ, IgAκ/λ, IgMκ/λ). This assay has prognostic value for progression-free and overall survival and seems particularly useful when the M-protein is difficult to measure via serum protein electrophoresis. This assay is not yet part of the routine workup of MM patients but may be of value in the follow-up of patients and has been included in clinical trials.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, specifically with respect to diagnosis, the PHPT-IW-5 2022 guidelines recommend diagnosing hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism based on an elevated serum calcium level adjusted for albumin, in conjunction with an elevated or inappropriately normal intact PTH level. This should be determined using either a second or third generation assay on two occasions at least two weeks apart.

Semaglutide was initiated at 0.25 mg per week and escalated in a fixed-dose regimen every 4 weeks until the target dose was achieved (2.4 mg by week 16, or 1.0 mg by week 8 [STEP 2 only]). In STEP 1 and 2, the trial product was given as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions, which included counseling on diet and exercise; in STEP 3, it was given as an adjunct to intensive behavioral therapy, consisting of decreased energy intake, increased physical activity, and counseling sessions.

All outcomes were assessed as changes from baseline to week 68 for each treatment group in each trial. The overall change in CRP concentration by treatment was a prespecified secondary endpoint in each trial, while all other outcomes were post hoc.

Subgroup analyses were performed to assess the effect of participant characteristics on the change in CRP concentration in each treatment group. For these analyses, participants were stratified into subgroups based on clinical characteristics at baseline, such as body weight [3 mg/L (high)].

To investigate the effect of treatment on CRP-defined cardiovascular risk category, participants were separated into subgroups using the CRP cut-offs outlined earlier. The proportions of participants who changed category were then assessed.

### Optimization of utilization of serum protein analysis: Role of the electronic medical record in promoting consultation by pathology [^1141iAv3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Screening for monoclonal gammopathies is usually conducted through serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and serum free light chain tests. SPEP may then be followed by immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE). IFE may be ordered by the treating physician or at the discretion of the pathologist. We examined the appropriateness of IFE orders placed by treating physicians and report on our findings, the follow-up changes to the ordering process, and the results of those changes.

We retrospectively analyzed data from our laboratory spanning April 2009 through July 2012. In April 2009, clinicians had three test ordering options: SPEP with reflex IFE, SPEP only, and SPEP with IFE. In April 2010, this was limited to only the SPEP with reflex IFE option. We compared the rates of SPEP and IFE performed during the two periods, specifically from April 2009 through April 2010 and from May 2010 through July 2012. There was a substantial drop in the IFE/SPEP ratio from 0.47 to 0.21.

The review of electronic medical records by the consultant pathologist proved instrumental in improving utilization and enhancing the value of pathology consultations. Possible impacts on laboratory costs, revenue, and overall healthcare are also presented.

### Replacing urine protein electrophoresis with serum free light chain analysis as a first-line test for detecting plasma cell disorders offers increased diagnostic accuracy and potential health benefit to patients [^117F2xiY]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

To determine the most clinically effective diagnostic testing strategy for plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory, serum and urine samples from 2,799 patients with suspected plasma cell dyscrasias were tested using alternative diagnostic testing strategies. These strategies consisted of serum protein electrophoresis (SPE) combined with either urine protein electrophoresis (UPE) or serum free light chain (sFLC) analysis.

The combination of sFLC analysis and SPE demonstrated the greatest sensitivity (100%) by detecting abnormalities in all 124 patients diagnosed with plasma cell disorders. Routine sFLC testing would have offered significant health benefits for two patients in the study population. One patient with a markedly abnormal sFLC result was diagnosed with light chain deposition disease by renal biopsy, though no abnormalities were detected by SPE or UPE. Another patient, diagnosed with multiple plasmacytomas following a biopsy of a lung tumor, exhibited a grossly abnormal sFLC result but an equivocal weak-positive SPE result; no urine sample was received by the laboratory for this patient.

Our study suggests that the combination of SPE and sFLC analysis is the most clinically effective first-line diagnostic testing strategy for detecting plasma cell disorders in the clinical laboratory.

### Evaluation and clinical interpretation of hypergammaglobulinemia E: Differentiating atopy from immunodeficiency [^1153LbNo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Increases in total serum IgE levels can be observed in many diverse conditions, from infection to atopy to primary immunodeficiency. The differentiation of atopy from immunodeficiency is most often made on a clinical basis after considering findings from history, physical examination, and laboratory studies. However, the total IgE level is neither a sensitive nor a specific diagnostic marker for any particular disease and, therefore, should not be relied on to establish a diagnosis of either atopy or primary immunodeficiency.

### A test in context: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein [^114wkYA1]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

The inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) adds prognostic information on cardiovascular risk comparable to blood pressure or cholesterol. Values of 3 mg/l indicate lower, average, or higher relative cardiovascular risk, respectively. Global risk algorithms that include hsCRP outperform those using only Framingham covariates. Although diet, exercise, and smoking cessation are first steps for patients with a proinflammatory response, JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial data demonstrate that statins reduce by 47% the rate of first myocardial infarction, stroke, or confirmed cardiovascular death when given to patients with low-density lipoprotein-C levels of 2 mg/l (hazard ratio: 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.40 to 0.69; p < 0.00001). In U.S. guidelines, hsCRP carries a class IIb assessment and is most appropriate in primary prevention when clinical decisions to initiate statin therapy are uncertain. Ongoing multinational trials are pursuing whether reducing inflammation will decrease vascular event rates.

Monoclonal gammopathy: is it harmful enough to warrant screening?

The mechanisms by which different types of monoclonal gammopathy (MG) cause organ dysfunction and morbidity are incompletely understood. Although MG can lead to malignant transformation and paraprotein-mediated tissue damage, it has also been repeatedly associated with an increased occurrence of other diagnoses, such as monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS). The biological explanation for MGCS is even less well understood. It is possible that the mechanisms leading to cancerous and non-cancerous consequences overlap.

### An increase in dietary protein improves the blood glucose response in persons with type 2 diabetes [^112UYM4c]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

In single-meal studies, dietary protein does not result in an increase in glucose concentrations in persons with or without type 2 diabetes, even though the resulting amino acids can be used for gluconeogenesis.

- **Objective**: The metabolic effects of a high-protein diet were compared with those of the prototypical healthy (control) diet, which is currently recommended by several scientific organizations.

- **Design**: The metabolic effects of both diets, consumed for 5 weeks each (separated by a 2–5 week washout period), were studied in 12 subjects with untreated type 2 diabetes. The ratio of protein to carbohydrate to fat was 30:40:30 in the high-protein diet and 15:55:30 in the control diet. The subjects remained weight-stable during the study.

- **Results**: With the fasting glucose concentration used as a baseline from which to determine the area under the curve, the high-protein diet resulted in a 40% decrease in the mean 24-hour integrated glucose area response. Glycated hemoglobin decreased by 0.8% and 0.3% after 5 weeks of the high-protein and control diets, respectively; the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The rate of change over time was also significantly greater after the high-protein diet than after the control diet (P < 0.001). Fasting triacylglycerol was significantly lower after the high-protein diet than after the control diet. Insulin, C-peptide, and free fatty acid concentrations were not significantly different after the two diets.

- **Conclusion**: A high-protein diet lowers blood glucose postprandially in persons with type 2 diabetes and improves overall glucose control.

In regards to diagnostic procedures for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, specifically concerning bone marrow biopsy, the EMN 2014 guidelines recommend not performing routine bone marrow examination in asymptomatic patients with apparent IgG MGUS if the serum M protein is ≤ 15 g/L and there is no end-organ damage, until there is evidence of progression to symptomatic disease.

### Cerebrospinal fluid protein in Guillain-Barré syndrome: Need for age-dependent interpretation [^115g3pY8]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Low credibility.

Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total protein in patients with acute ascending paresis is indicative of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Recent studies have shown that the outdated, but still widely used, upper reference limit (URL) for CSF total protein of 0.45 g/L leads to false-positive results, mainly due to the lack of age adjustment. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of increased CSF total protein in adult GBS patients according to a new age-dependent URL.

- **Methods**: Patients with GBS treated at the Medical University of Innsbruck between 2000 and 2018 were included in this study. Demographic, clinical, electrophysiological, and CSF data were obtained from patients' medical charts. The frequency of increased CSF total protein, depending on disease duration, was compared using the conventional URL of 0.45 g/L and the age-dependent URL.

- **Results**: Ninety-seven patients with GBS, aged 57 ± 18 years, comprising 38% women, underwent CSF sampling within a median of 6 days after symptom onset. The median CSF total protein concentration was 0.65 g/L and correlated with disease duration. Overall, 74% of patients had elevated CSF total protein levels using the conventional URL, as opposed to 52% applying the age-dependent URL. At 0–3, 4–7, 8–14, and > 14 days after disease onset, elevated CSF total protein was found in 46%, 84%, 78%, and 100% of patients using the conventional URL, and in 32%, 53%, 65%, and 64% of patients using the age-dependent URL. In multivariate analysis, significant predictors of elevated CSF total protein were disease duration.

### The use of high-sensitivity assays for C-reactive protein in clinical practice [^112gPtho]. Nature Clinical Practice. Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity assays that accurately measure levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein have been proposed for use in assessments of risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A growing body of evidence supports recommendations for these tests in selected asymptomatic individuals deemed to be at intermediate risk of CVD according to traditional risk-factor assessments and who do not already warrant chronic treatment with aspirin and statin therapy. Data suggest that these high-sensitivity assays should be used in combination with measurements of LDL-cholesterol levels to assist risk stratification of selected patients for prevention of CVD.

### Mass spectrometry for the evaluation of monoclonal proteins in multiple myeloma and related disorders: An International Myeloma Working Group Mass Spectrometry Committee report [^113TKi3C]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Plasma cell disorders (PCDs) are a group of diseases characterized by clonal expansion of plasma cells. Central to the diagnosis and monitoring of most PCDs is the detection of monoclonal immunoglobulin components, which are generally overproduced by the expanding plasma cell clone. This overproduced monoclonal immunoglobulin, often referred to as an M-protein or paraprotein, typically is an intact immunoglobulin. It can also be either the free light chain (LC) component alone or, in rare instances, the heavy chain component alone.

While the M-protein is homogeneous and typically constant in any particular patient, the heterogeneity of M-proteins from patient to patient is significant. Thus, a diverse set of methods is employed to characterize and detect M-proteins. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) enables the detection and relative quantitation of the M-protein, whereas serum immunofixation electrophoresis (IFE) establishes the M-protein isotype.

Another widely utilized assay is the serum free light chain (sFLC) assay, which employs specific antibodies for the quantitation of circulating free kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) light chains (LCs). The sFLC assay is an analytically sensitive method for M-protein detection. An abnormal κ/λ FLC ratio (e.g. κ/λ 1.65) suggests the presence of an aberrant plasma or B-cell clone. However, not all patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have abnormal sFLC ratios at diagnosis. The sFLC assay has demonstrated a particularly important supportive role in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of PCDs, especially for am-

### Protein in optimal health: Heart disease and type 2 diabetes [^115ZULdY]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

Diets with increased protein and reduced carbohydrates have been shown to improve body composition, lipid and lipoprotein profiles, and glycemic regulations associated with treatment of obesity and weight loss. Derived from these outcomes, high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets are also being examined for treatment of heart disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets have been found to have positive effects on reducing risk factors for heart disease, including reducing serum triacylglycerol, increasing HDL cholesterol, increasing LDL particle size, and reducing blood pressure. These diets appear particularly attractive for use with individuals exhibiting the atherogenic dyslipidemia of metabolic syndrome. High-protein, low-carbohydrate diets have also been investigated for treatment of type 2 diabetes with positive effects on glycemic regulation, including reducing fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose and insulin responses, and the percentage of glycated hemoglobin. Specific effects of increasing protein compared with reducing carbohydrates have not been extensively investigated. Additional research is needed to determine specific levels of protein, carbohydrate, and fat for optimum health of individuals who differ in age, physical activity, and metabolic phenotypes.

### Is protein the forgotten ingredient: Effects of higher compared to lower protein diets on cardiometabolic risk factors. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^117D4XRE]. Atherosclerosis (2021). High credibility.

Higher protein (HP) diets may lead to lower cardiometabolic risk, compared to lower protein (LP) diets. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to investigate the effects of HP versus LP diets on cardiometabolic risk factors in adults, using the totality of the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

- **Methods**: Systematic searches were conducted in electronic databases, up to November 2020. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool the standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The main outcomes were weight loss, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, fat mass, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerol, fasting glucose and insulin, and glycated hemoglobin.

- **Results**: Fifty-seven articles reporting on 54 RCTs were included, involving 4344 participants (65% female, mean age: 46 (SD 10) years, mean BMI: 33 (SD 3) kg/m²), with a mean study duration of 18 weeks (range: 4 to 156 weeks). Compared to LP diets (range protein (E%): 10–23%), HP diets (range protein (E%): 20–45%) led to more weight loss (SMD -0.13, 95% CI: -0.23, -0.03), greater reductions in fat mass (SMD -0.14, 95% CI: -0.24, -0.04), systolic BP (SMD -0.12, 95% CI: -0.21, -0.02), total cholesterol (SMD -0.11, 95% CI: -0.19, -0.02), triacylglycerol (SMD -0.22, 95% CI: -0.30, -0.14), and insulin (SMD -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.03). No significant differences were observed for the other outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Higher protein diets showed small but favorable effects on weight loss and fat mass.

### Signs of intracranial hypertension in chronic inflammatory polyradiculoneuropathies-a cross sectional cohort study [^115SaUZt]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

There are several possible explanations: A normal total protein measurement at a specific time point might not fully capture dynamic fluctuations in CSF composition or other inflammatory mediators that may be driving the ICP elevation. Given the median 49.5-month interval between the diagnostic LP and the subsequent assessment for IH, it is possible that an elevation in total CSF protein developed over time during this diagnostic hiatus. Additionally, the specific type of IPN could play a role in this relationship, either directly or indirectly influencing the degree of CSF protein elevation. Our cohort mainly consisted of patients with typical CIDP (63.0%), but also sensory, distal, and multifocal CIDP, and anti-NF155 antibody paranodopathy — all subtypes commonly associated with high CSF total protein levels. Whether total CSF protein levels vary significantly across other CIDP subtypes remains a matter of debate. Furthermore, both the type and duration of immunotherapy may impact CSF protein levels and, therefore, potentially also the development of IH, though we were unable to assess this in the absence of longitudinal data. Notwithstanding, increased CSF protein is likely not the sole determinant. Other pathophysiological factors, such as altered CSF absorption or transient changes in intracranial dynamics, can lead to elevated ICP independent of total protein levels. Therefore, although our primary hypothesis focuses on elevated CSF protein, multifactorial mechanisms may explain instances of elevated ICP in some CIDP patients.

### Effect of dietary protein content on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition during overeating: A randomized controlled trial [^114N8bJQ]. JAMA (2012). High credibility.

The role of diet composition in response to overeating and energy dissipation in humans is unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of overconsumption of low, normal, and high protein diets on weight gain, energy expenditure, and body composition.

A single-blind, randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 25 healthy, weight-stable male and female volunteers in the US, aged 18 to 35 years, with a body mass index between 19 and 30. The first participant was admitted to the inpatient metabolic unit in June 2005, and the last in October 2007. After consuming a weight-stabilizing diet for 13 to 25 days, participants were randomized to diets containing 5% of energy from protein (low protein), 15% (normal protein), or 25% (high protein). They were overfed during the last 8 weeks of their 10- to 12-week stay in the inpatient metabolic unit. Compared to energy intake during the weight stabilization period, the protein diets provided approximately 40% more energy intake, equivalent to 954 kcal/d [95% CI, 884–1022 kcal/d].

Body composition was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry biweekly, resting energy expenditure was measured weekly by ventilated hood, and total energy expenditure by doubly labeled water prior to the overeating and weight stabilization periods and at weeks 7 to 8. Overeating resulted in significantly less weight gain in the low protein diet group (3.16 kg; 95% CI, 1.88–4.44 kg) compared with the normal protein diet group (6.05 kg; 95% CI, 4.84–7.26 kg) or the high protein diet group.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^111Er4Xm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

In normal healthy individuals, baseline CRP levels in blood are reported to be less than 10 μg/mL, with measured CRP below this threshold described as "high sensitivity CRP" values. In situations of tissue trauma or disease, CRP blood levels can increase 10- to 100-fold within 10–72 hours of the inciting cause (i.e. described as "conventional CRP" values), with higher levels correlating with disease severity. Although levels between 10 and 50 μg/mL are diagnostic of an ongoing inflammatory response that can be either acute or chronic, CRP levels above 100 μg/mL in any disease are diagnostic of fulminant inflammation and are associated with poor disease prognosis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for interpreting the diagnostic significance of CRP describe the difference between conventional and high sensitivity values and provide guidance only for conventional CRP levels.

C-reactive protein levels have been used to differentiate viral from bacterial infections. In uncomplicated viral infections, CRP levels increase minimally to approximately 20 μg/mL, whereas in bacterial infections, levels increase to over 40 μg/mL. These levels reflect the degree of tissue involvement and can help diagnose confounding complications. Zhang et al. reported that in 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, CRP levels varied from 28.7 μg/mL in non-severe disease (n = 82; range, 9.5–52.1 μg/mL) to 47.6 μg/mL in severe disease (n = 56; range, 20.6–87.1 μg/mL).

### Effects of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg on C-reactive protein in adults with overweight or obesity (STEP 1, 2, and 3): Exploratory analyses of three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials [^113RzMX3]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Inflammation is a key driver of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. C-reactive protein (CRP), an established biomarker of inflammation, is commonly elevated in people with overweight/obesity.

- **Methods**: STEP 1, 2, and 3 were 68-week, placebo-controlled trials of semaglutide for weight management in participants with overweight/obesity, with (STEP 2) or without (STEP 1 and 3) type 2 diabetes. Change in serum CRP from baseline to week 68 was assessed as a prespecified secondary endpoint for semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo (STEP 1, 2, and 3) and versus semaglutide 1.0 mg (STEP 2). Post hoc assessments included change in CRP by baseline characteristics (body weight, body mass index [BMI], glycaemic status, CRP concentration); change in CRP-defined cardiovascular risk category (3 mg/L [high]); and correlation between change in CRP and change in body weight, waist circumference, fasting serum insulin (STEP 1 and 3), fasting plasma glucose, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).

- **Findings**: The trials took place from June through November 2018 (STEP 1 and 2) and from August 2018 to April 2020 (STEP 3). In all trials, semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced CRP at week 68 versus placebo (estimated treatment difference [ETD; 95% CI] -44% [-49 to -39] in STEP 1, -39% [-46 to -30] in STEP 2, and -48% [-55 to -39] in STEP 3; all p < 0.05). In STEP 2, CRP reductions were greater with semaglutide 2.4 mg (-49%) than with 1.0 mg (-42%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (ETD [95% CI] -12% [-23 to 1]).

### Prediction of post-acute-sequelae of COVID-19 by cargo protein biomarkers of blood total extracellular vesicles in acute COVID-19 [^114r8agd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 invades the mitochondria of infected cells, resulting in disordered metabolism, mitophagy, and abnormal levels of mitochondrial proteins in extracellular vesicles. Blood extracellular vesicle SARS-CoV-2 proteins and mitochondrial proteins were quantified in COVID-19 to assess possible roles as biomarkers.

- **Methods**: Total extracellular vesicles were precipitated from the blood of age- and gender-matched participants with no infection (n = 10), acute COVID-19 (n = 16), post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC or long COVID) (n = 30), or post-acute COVID without PASC (n = 8), and their extracted proteins were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs).

- **Results**: Total extracellular vesicle levels of S1 (receptor-binding domain [RBD]) protein were significantly higher in acute infections than in uninfected controls, post-acute infection without PASC, and PASC. Total extracellular vesicle levels of nucleocapsid (N) protein were significantly higher in PASC than in uninfected controls, acute infections, and post-acute infection without PASC. Neither acute levels of S1 (RBD) nor N proteins predicted progression to PASC. Levels of neither SARS-CoV-2 protein in established PASC correlated with neuropsychiatric manifestations. Significant decreases in total extracellular vesicle levels of the mitochondrial proteins MOTS-c, VDAC-1, and humanin, and elevations of levels of SARM-1 were observed in acutely infected patients who would develop PASC. Significant decreases in total extracellular vesicle levels of MOTS-c and humanin, but not VDAC-1, and elevations of total extracellular vesicle levels were noted in patients.

### Mass spectrometry for the evaluation of monoclonal proteins in multiple myeloma and related disorders: an International Myeloma Working Group Mass Spectrometry Committee Report [^112gBgey]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Low credibility.

While the clinical utility of the electrophoretic methods to screen and monitor PCDs has been well established, several changes in the treatment of PCDs are pushing these methods to their analytical limits. Dramatic improvement in the treatment response of MM patients to new chemo and immune therapies is challenging long-held assumptions about this ominous disease. In particular, as durable remissions can now be achieved for most MM patients, highly sensitive methods capable of detecting low-level disease are important for patient counseling.

The long-standing routine serum electrophoretic methods (SPEP and IFE) are not capable of providing the analytical sensitivity needed to assess minimal residual disease (MRD). As a result, laboratories have turned to bone marrow (BM) aspirates and/or biopsies and detecting residual malignant plasma cells with high-sensitivity flow cytometry and their specific VDJH/DJH sequences by next-generation sequencing (NGS). These BM-based techniques are well established and currently available for MRD testing after therapy. However, these MRD methods require an invasive procedure and a lab with a higher level of expertise to perform the testing. Attesting to its impact on prognosis, NGS is now an FDA-approved method for measuring MRD in MM.

In addition, new monoclonal therapeutic antibodies (t-mAbs) designed to eradicate malignant plasma cells are producing interferences, making it difficult to distinguish between a patient's M-protein and the t-mAb drug on electrophoretic methods.

A search for a more convenient serum-based test to complement BM is ongoing.

### Higher protein intake during caloric restriction improves diet quality and attenuates loss of lean body mass [^116x5utM]. Obesity (2022). Low credibility.

Identifying high-quality proteins and the amount required for sufficient intake, which are influenced by several variables, remains controversial. Most measures of protein quality by amino acid composition and digestibility (protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score and digestible indispensable amino acid score) suggest that proteins from animal sources are more complete to varying degrees than plant sources. However, other nutrients often consumed in excess in the Western diet that tend to accompany animal protein intake may reduce the benefit of including "complete" proteins in the diet.

For example, observational studies have shown that in individuals who are not dieting, protein consumption from animal sources is associated with a dietary pattern that has a greater intake of saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugar, and less fiber, all of which lower diet quality. However, unlike reported high intakes of added sugar and sodium, SFA intake in the US (although still high) has been shown to be closer to recommended levels (≤ 10% of total energy intake, or ≤ 22 g/d). This is consistent with findings in this study, showing that SFA intake was 23 g/d at baseline and decreased to 17 g/d in both protein groups during caloric restriction (CR).

In this study, a greater intake of total protein during CR was largely from lean meats such as poultry and unprocessed red meat, as well as seafood, dairy, and nuts and seeds. Consequently, HEI components such as sodium and SFAs that may have worsened with increased total protein intake were at healthier levels during CR, and they did not differ significantly between the protein groups.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining the following tests in the laboratory evaluation of patients with anemia associated with CKD:

- **CBC** (including MCH, MCV, platelet count) in addition to the hemoglobin concentration.

- **Absolute reticulocyte count**: To assess bone marrow responsiveness (if indicated).

- **Assessment of iron status**: Percentage of hypochromic RBCs, but only if processing of blood sample is possible within 6 hours, or reticulocyte hemoglobin count. Equivalent tests such as reticulocyte hemoglobin equivalent, or a combination of transferrin saturation and serum ferritin, should be considered if the previous tests are not available or the patient has thalassemia or thalassemia trait.

- **Serum ferritin**: To assess iron stores.

- **Serum CRP**: To assess possible inflammation.

### Associations of homocysteine, C-reactive protein and cardiovascular disease in patients with renal disease [^11569Stv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

In the past year, evidence from epidemiological studies in patients with renal disease has confirmed associations between both elevated plasma total homocysteine concentrations and the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein with an increased risk of arteriosclerotic vascular disease. However, it remains to be determined whether lowering total homocysteine or reducing inflammation will prevent 'hard' clinical outcome events such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death. Randomized trials of homocysteine lowering are currently ongoing and should further clarify the nature of the observed association between elevated total homocysteine and cardiovascular risk in patients with or without renal disease, and whether it is causal and modifiable.

There are currently no known therapeutic interventions that specifically lower C-reactive protein levels in individuals or the prevalence of elevated C-reactive protein in the population. However, randomized trials of anti-inflammatory therapy (e.g. using selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors) aimed at preventing cardiovascular disease are currently being planned.

### Diets higher in protein predict lower high blood pressure risk in Framingham Offspring Study adults [^1119uQMw]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). High credibility.

Short-term clinical trials suggest that dietary protein lowers blood pressure (BP); however, the long-term effects of total, animal, and plant proteins are less clear. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of these dietary proteins on mean systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and incident high BP (HBP) risk among middle-aged adults in the Framingham Offspring Study.

- **Methods**: Men and women (aged 30–54 years) without prevalent HBP, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes with 3-day dietary records from exams 3 or 5 (n = 1,361) were included and followed for a mean of 11.3 years for the development of HBP. Protein intakes adjusted for body size were derived using the residual method. Analysis of covariance and Cox proportional hazards models were used to adjust for age, sex, education, height, activity, smoking, fat calories, diet quality, and body mass index.

- **Results**: Higher protein intakes were associated with lower mean SBP and DBP. Both animal and plant proteins lowered BP and led to statistically significant reductions in HBP risk, with hazard ratios of 0.68 and 0.51, respectively. Participants in the highest tertile of total protein intake had 40% less risk (95% confidence interval, 0.45–0.78) of developing HBP. Beneficial effects of protein were apparent for men and women and for normal-weight and overweight individuals. Higher protein diets, also characterized by higher fiber intakes, led to a 59% reduction (95% CI, 0.37–0.66) in HBP risk.

- **Conclusions**: Adults consuming more dietary protein from either plant or animal sources had lower long-term risks of HBP.

### Excessive diagnostic testing in acute kidney injury [^114TDFzo]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Not all diagnostic tests during the course of acute kidney injury (AKI) are specifically obtained for clarification of the cause or treatment of AKI — such as automated urinalysis, urine sodium, or urine total protein. We therefore focused on those tests used most commonly to diagnose specific causes of AKI, such as interstitial nephritis, paraprotein-related kidney disease, glomerulonephritides, and obstructive uropathy. Data on the number of tests performed, the number of tests that were abnormal, and the number that affected AKI diagnosis or management are shown in Fig. 2. Additional data on the frequency of abnormal results by AKI stage are shown in Table 4.

- **Diagnostic yield**:
	- The diagnostic yield was evaluated for blood and urine tests based on the number of abnormal tests that affected AKI diagnosis or management. Radiology tests were assessed by the number of abnormal tests that resulted in a procedural intervention. For renal ultrasonography, abnormalities other than hydronephrosis, such as atrophy, cortical thinning, and other chronic changes, were not included since interventions are not typically performed for these findings. Abbreviations: U Eos, urinary eosinophils; SPEP, serum protein electrophoresis; FLCs, serum free light chains; ANCA, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; Cryo, cryoglobulins; CTAP, computerized tomography of the abdomen and pelvis.

- **Frequency of abnormal results**:
	- The frequency (%) of abnormal results was calculated by dividing the number of tests ordered by the number of abnormal results, multiplied by 100.

### Are renal reference intervals required when screening for plasma cell disorders with serum free light chains and serum protein electrophoresis [^116oz8hL]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Renal impairment and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia may abnormally increase the serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio, giving false-positive results with reference intervals. We measured sFLCs with concomitant serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) in 281 patients. Results were interpreted relative to renal function (serum creatinine concentrations) and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Overall, 78 plasma cell disorders (PCDs) were detected with the serum panel of SPEP/sFLC compared to 76 with SPEP/UPEP.

In 13 samples with negative SPEP/UPEP, mildly increased ratios up to 3.1 (normal, 0.26–1.65) were observed: 10 were associated with increased serum creatinine and 1 with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia; 2 were unassociated with either condition. In 2 samples, decreased kappa/lambda ratios were identified that were clinically significant despite normal SPEP/UPEP. Two monoclonal gammopathies were identified with UPEP and sFLC, but samples were normal with SPEP. Screening for PCDs with a serum panel consisting of SPEP and the sFLC assays is a highly sensitive approach that could eliminate the need for UPEP. A mildly increased kappa/lambda ratio up to 3.1 was observed with increased serum creatinine and/or polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, which was consistent with pathophysiologic changes, and, therefore, renal reference intervals are recommended.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically concerning the evaluation of new fever in the ICU (inflammatory markers), the IDSA/SCCM 2023 guidelines recommend considering obtaining CRP, in addition to bedside clinical evaluation, if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed low-to-intermediate in critically ill patients with new fever and no clear focus of infection. Avoid obtaining CRP to rule out bacterial infection if the probability of bacterial infection is deemed high.

### Simultaneous testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein: Increased expenditure without demonstrable benefit [^116LpFSv]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

We analyzed the practice of paired erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein testing when evaluating fever or inflammation. In our hospital, this resulted in additional charges of $250,000-$400,000 per year without demonstrable added benefit to patient care. Extrapolating our results, we estimate reducing this practice could save up to $300,000,000 nationally.

### The harms of high protein intake: Conjectured, postulated, claimed, and presumed, but shown [^114JuJXt]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Low credibility.

High-protein (HP) diets and protein-supplemented foods and beverages have gained popularity among adults due to their potential benefits for appetite, energy intake, body weight, and body composition. Questions have arisen concerning whether dietary recommendations for protein are too low. However, health concerns regarding high-protein diets have been prevalent in the literature for over 60 years. Despite these concerns, the conjectured harms of HP diets, often cited in both lay and academic literature, frequently lack strong scientific evidence or are reasonably contradicted by scientific research.

In this paper, we discuss several of the postulated harms cited in academic and lay publications and investigate the strength of evidence supporting or refuting these asserted harms. We highlight areas of caution related to experimental design and interpretation of results, proposing areas of research that may help better determine the potential risks associated with high dietary protein intake.

### Investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin [^116kXCsb]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Serum ferritin level is one of the most commonly requested investigations in both primary and secondary care. While low serum ferritin levels invariably indicate reduced iron stores, raised serum ferritin levels can be attributed to multiple different etiologies, including iron overload, inflammation, liver or renal disease, malignancy, and the recently described metabolic syndrome. A key test in the further investigation of an unexpected raised serum ferritin is the serum transferrin saturation. This guideline reviews the investigation and management of a raised serum ferritin level. However, the investigation and management of genetic haemochromatosis are not addressed here and are the subject of a separate guideline.

### Laboratory detection and initial diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies [^116BpJnY]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The process for identifying patients with monoclonal gammopathies is complex. Initial detection of a monoclonal immunoglobulin protein (M protein) in the serum or urine often requires compilation of analytical data from several areas of the laboratory. The detection of M proteins depends on the adequacy of the sample provided, available clinical information, and the laboratory tests used.

- **Objective**: To develop an evidence-based guideline for the initial laboratory detection of M proteins.

- **Design**: To create evidence-based recommendations, the College of American Pathologists convened a panel of experts in the diagnosis and treatment of monoclonal gammopathies and the laboratory procedures used for the initial detection of M proteins. The panel conducted a systematic literature review to address key questions. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, recommendations were created based on the available evidence, the strength of that evidence, and key judgments as defined in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Evidence to Decision framework.

- **Results**: Nine guideline statements were established to optimize sample selection and testing for the initial detection and quantitative measurement of M proteins used to diagnose monoclonal gammopathies.

This guideline was constructed to harmonize and strengthen the initial detection of an M protein in patients displaying symptoms or laboratory features of a monoclonal gammopathy. It endorses more comprehensive initial testing.

### A diagnostic approach to hyperferritinemia with a non-elevated transferrin saturation [^114SLmej]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevated serum ferritin concentrations are common in clinical practice. In this review, we provide an approach to interpreting the serum ferritin elevation in relation to other clinical parameters, including patient history, transferrin saturation, serum concentrations of alanine and aspartate aminotransferases (ALT, AST), testing for HFE mutations, liver imaging, liver biopsy, and liver iron concentration. We used observations from a large series of patients with hepatic iron overload, documented by liver iron concentration measurement from two referral practices, as a gold standard to guide the interpretation of the predictive values of non-invasive iron tests. Three case studies illustrate common problems in interpreting iron blood tests.

### Association of circulating proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory protein biomarkers in extremely preterm born children with subsequent brain magnetic resonance imaging volumes and cognitive function at age 10 years [^117NQReF]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine elevated neonatal inflammatory and neurotrophic proteins in children born extremely preterm in relation to their later childhood brain magnetic resonance imaging volumes and cognitive function.

The study design involved measuring circulating inflammation-related proteins and neurotrophic proteins on postnatal days 1, 7, and 14 in 166 children at the age of 10 years (73 males; 93 females). Top quartile levels on two or more days for three or more inflammation-related proteins and for four or more neurotrophic proteins defined exposure. Associations among protein levels, brain magnetic resonance imaging volumes, and cognition were examined with multiple linear and logistic regressions.

Results showed analyses adjusted for gestational age at birth and sex. Children with three or more elevated inflammation-related proteins had smaller grey matter, brain stem/cerebellar, and total brain volumes than those without elevated inflammation-related proteins, adjusted for neurotrophic proteins. When adjusted for inflammation-related proteins, children with four or more neurotrophic proteins, compared with those with none, had larger grey matter and total brain volumes. Higher grey matter, white matter, and cerebellum and brainstem volumes were significantly correlated with higher IQ. Grey and white matter volumes were correlated with each other (r = -0.18; p = 0.021), and cerebellum and brainstem were highly correlated with grey matter (r = 0.55; P < .001) and white matter (r = 0.29; P < .001). Adjusting for other brain compartments, cerebellum and brainstem were associated with IQ (P = 0.016).

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [^116FQBWq]. JAMA Oncology (2025). High credibility.

- **Question**: Can the definition of light chain (LC) monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) be improved?

- **Findings**: In this cohort study of 75,422 individuals, standard reference intervals led to overdiagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies. Revised age-stratified reference intervals for free light chains (FLC) were calculated, and a new definition of LC-MGUS was proposed. The new definition decreased the prevalence of LC-MGUS by 82%.

- **Meaning**: A new definition of LC-MGUS can substantially decrease false-positive diagnoses and optimize care.

### The value of C-reactive protein and lactate in the acute abdomen in the emergency department [^114zjCBn]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnosing patients who present in the emergency department with acute abdominal pain can be challenging. In addition to history taking and physical examination, clinicians often use laboratory tests and radiological examinations to exclude diagnoses that can mimic acute abdominal pain, such as pneumonia. Physicians in the emergency department frequently base their decisions for a surgical consultation for laparotomy on the clinical presentation combined with biochemical abnormalities, such as high concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) or lactate. The question remains if these parameters are reliable for diagnosing an acute abdomen. The pitfall of relying on laboratory values could lead to overtreatment or undertreatment.

This report presents three patients with non-traumatic acute abdominal pain and abnormal C-reactive protein and/or lactate concentrations with a negative laparotomy. Furthermore, we discuss the usefulness of these markers in practice and their contribution to establishing a diagnosis through interventions in the emergency department.

### The innate immune response characterizes posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome [^112seHkh]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Total protein levels are elevated in CSF from PRES patients. We analyzed routine CSF parameters, comparing total cell numbers; lymphocytes, granulocytes, and erythrocytes; total protein in CSF; albumin in CSF and serum; IgG, IgA, and IgM levels in CSF and serum; lactate; and the frequency of BCSFB breakdown between PRES patients and controls. Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney test.

As expected based on previous studies, total protein (median in mg/l (IQR); PRES 419 (362.5), control 360 (312.7), p < 0.001) and albumin (median in mg/l (IQR); PRES 215 (166.5), control 187 (153.7), p < 0.001) were elevated in the CSF of PRES patients. To account for demographic differences between groups, controls were matched by age and sex, and the analysis was repeated accordingly. All results remained statistically significant (total protein in CSF, median (IQR); PRES 434 (394), control 368 (313.5), p < 0.05). Thus, we found elevated protein levels in CSF, whereas other routine parameters of CSF analysis were not significantly different.

### Waldenström macroglobulinemia treatment algorithm 2018 [^111S9yhV]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Most patients with IgM MGUS are found incidentally due to an elevation in serum total protein observed during a multi-channel chemical analyzer test. These patients do not experience fatigue. Imaging, if performed, typically reveals only modest enlargement of lymph nodes. They do not exhibit oronasal bleeding (hyperviscosity), nor do they show symptoms consistent with amyloidosis. These patients do not require treatment and should initiate a routine monitoring schedule to track changes in hemoglobin, IgM level, and M spike.

Among patients with IgM MGUS, those with two adverse risk factors — an abnormal serum free light chain ratio and a serum monoclonal protein level greater than 1.5 g/dL — have a 55% risk of progression at 20 years. This is in comparison to a 41% risk in those with one risk factor and a 19% risk in those with neither risk factor. Patients with IgM MGUS require lifelong monitoring for the development of Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

### What do the elevated protein levels mean in my patients with myeloma, amyloidosis, and related disorders [^115uLPTN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, light chain amyloidosis, and other plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized, in part, by abnormal production of paraproteins that are often responsible for the sequelae of those diseases. These paraproteins are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins produced by clonal antibody-secreting cells (usually plasma cells, but occasionally B lymphocytes). Significant heterogeneity exists in the presentation of these diseases, ranging from incidental detection of a monoclonal protein in an asymptomatic patient to life-threatening manifestations that require urgent diagnostic confirmation and intervention. Successful management of such scenarios requires a fundamental understanding of the laboratory assays at one's disposal, their role in the workup of paraproteinemias, and the interpretation thereof. This review broadly covers these assays and their roles in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of these diseases.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^112nLmed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Below we describe the findings for tests assessed in four or more studies: white blood cell count increase and decrease, neutrophil count increase and decrease, monocyte count increase, lymphocyte count decrease, platelets decrease, alanine aminotransferase increase, aspartate aminotransferase increase, albumin decrease, total bilirubin, CRP increase, procalcitonin increase, IL‐6 increase, creatine kinase increase, serum creatinine, and lactate dehydrogenase increase.

Table 1 provides a summary of findings for the individual tests, including sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios (DORs). All HSROC curves were close to the non-informative diagonal, with DORs varying between 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.78) and 4.53 (95% CI 1.89 to 10.88). As an indication, a test with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 70% has a DOR of 5.0.

### C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and cardiovascular disease prediction [^113Rmhst]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

There is debate about the value of assessing levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and other biomarkers of inflammation for the prediction of first cardiovascular events.

- **Methods**: We analyzed data from 52 prospective studies that included 246,669 participants without a history of cardiovascular disease to investigate the value of adding CRP or fibrinogen levels to conventional risk factors for the prediction of cardiovascular risk. We calculated measures of discrimination and reclassification during follow-up and modeled the clinical implications of initiation of statin therapy after the assessment of CRP or fibrinogen.

- **Results**: The addition of information on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a prognostic model for cardiovascular disease that included age, sex, smoking status, blood pressure, history of diabetes, and total cholesterol level increased the C-index, a measure of risk discrimination, by 0.0050. The further addition to this model of information on CRP or fibrinogen increased the C-index by 0.0039 and 0.0027, respectively (P < 0.001), and yielded a net reclassification improvement of 1.52% and 0.83%, respectively, for the predicted 10-year risk categories of "low" (< 10%), "intermediate" (10% to < 20%), and "high" (≥ 20%) (P < 0.02 for both comparisons). We estimated that among 100,000 adults 40 years of age or older, 15,025 persons would initially be classified as being at intermediate risk for a cardiovascular event if conventional risk factors alone were used to calculate risk. Assuming that statin therapy would be initiated in accordance with adult guidelines, this classification approach highlights substantial clinical implications.

### Global guidance for the recognition, diagnosis, and management of tumor-induced osteomalacia [^116ET9sF]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Biochemical workup and features

The challenges associated with diagnostic testing have been recently reviewed by Brandi et al; for the purposes of this global guidance document, we will focus on the most salient points for clinicians to consider. The first necessary step to diagnosis requires measuring serum phosphate in anyone being evaluated for musculoskeletal symptoms. Serum phosphate should be measured on a morning, fasting blood specimen. Serum phosphate concentration is normally higher in young children and decreases with age; therefore, it is important to ensure that an age-specific normal range is used. In adults, hypophosphatemia is defined as levels below 0.8 mmol/L (2.5 mg/dL). To establish chronic hypophosphatemia, there must be two values below the normal range on at least two occasions ≥ 2 weeks apart.

One study showed that, among 144 patients with TIO, 43.1% of cases with hypophosphatemia were not treated or misdiagnosed, and only 11.8% of patients seeking medical care for the first time were tested for serum phosphate.

Comprehensive laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, fasting serum phosphate, serum creatinine, calcium, albumin, and total alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Additional variables, including PTH, 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)2D, and FGF23, should also be measured. It should be emphasized that not all assays are standardized, and not all labs use the same reference values; therefore, care must be taken when interpreting results.

Measurement of 25(OH)D levels is necessary for diagnosing vitamin D deficiency.

### Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia: Assessment, clinical interpretation, and management [^117V5GLa]. The Lancet Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

This review outlines a practical approach to assessing and managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in adults. Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia is most commonly caused by liver disease, immune dysregulation, or inflammation but can also provide an important diagnostic clue of rare diseases such as histiocyte disorders, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Castleman disease, and IgG4-related disease. Causes of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can be divided into eight categories: liver disease, autoimmune disease and vasculitis, infection and inflammation, non-haematological malignancy, haematological disorders, IgG4-related disease, immunodeficiency syndromes, and iatrogenic (from immunoglobulin therapy). Measuring serum concentrations of C-reactive protein and IgG subclasses is helpful in diagnosis. IL-6-mediated inflammation, associated with persistently elevated C-reactive protein concentrations (≥ 30 mg/L), is an important driver of polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia in some cases. Although the presence of markedly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations (> 5 g/L) is around 90% specific for diagnosing IgG4-related disease, mildly elevated serum IgG4 concentrations are seen in many conditions. In most cases, managing polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia simply involves treating the underlying condition. Rarely, however, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia can lead to hyperviscosity, requiring plasmapheresis.

### Reaching C-reactive protein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals in dyslipidemic patients (from the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project [L-TAP] 2) [^1111R2V7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present substudy of the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project 2 was to assess dual C-reactive protein (CRP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment across a spectrum of low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients with dyslipidemia in eight countries in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Of the 9,518 patients studied overall, 45% were women, 64% had hypertension, 31% had diabetes, and 14% were smokers. Additionally, 60% were high-risk, and 79% were taking a statin. The median CRP level was 1.5 mg/L (interquartile range 0.2 to 2.8).

On multivariate analysis, higher CRP levels were associated with older age, female gender, hypertension, smoking, greater body mass index, larger waist circumference, LDL cholesterol level, and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. In contrast, being from Asia or taking a statin was associated with lower levels.

Across all risk groups, 59% of patients attained the CRP target of < 2 mg/L, and 33% had < 1 mg/L. Overall, 44% of patients attained both their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol target and a CRP level of < 2 mg/L, but only 26% attained their LDL cholesterol target and a CRP level of < 1 mg/L. In the very high-risk group with coronary heart disease and ≥ 2 risk factors, only 19% attained both their LDL cholesterol goal and a CRP level of < 2 mg/L, and 12% their LDL cholesterol goal and a CRP level of < 1 mg/L.

In conclusion, with treatment, most dyslipidemic patients do not reach the dual CRP and LDL cholesterol goals.
