## Question

A 34-year-old male is admitted to the trauma unit after sustaining a stab wound to the lower abdomen. During exploratory laparotomy, a laceration to the external iliac vein is identified and repaired. The patient is hemodynamically stable post-operatively and is transferred to the surgical ward. Over the next several days, his recovery is uneventful, and he remains afebrile with stable vital signs. As the surgical team prepares a management plan for the post-operative period, the junior resident asks about specific complications to monitor for in this patient.

According to current AAST guidelines, what specific complication should this patient be monitored for following his abdominal venous injury, and what is the rationale for this monitoring?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which specific complication should be monitored for after a repaired external iliac vein injury, according to current AAST guidelines, and why that monitoring is recommended. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline source that addresses abdominal and pelvic venous injuries. Then, I should verify the exact wording and scope of the recommendation. Next, I will consider the pathophysiologic rationale for that complication in this anatomic context. After that, I should review corroborating data on incidence and risk modifiers. Finally, I will translate this into practical monitoring steps and note any nuances about prophylaxis and surveillance imaging, making sure I don't overstate anything beyond the guideline text.

> Let me first confirm the authoritative source. The AAST-WSES 2020 guidelines on abdominal vascular injuries are the most relevant, high-credibility document, and they explicitly address inpatient care and monitoring after abdominal or pelvic venous injuries, which includes the external iliac vein territory we are dealing with here [^117BFKmZ].

> Wait, let me verify the exact recommendation. The guideline states: "Monitor patients with abdominal or pelvic venous injuries for possible development of DVT", which directly answers the question of what to monitor for after a repaired external iliac vein injury in this postoperative setting [^117BFKmZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the rationale. Venous injury disrupts endothelium and flow, creating Virchow's triad conditions; even after repair, stenosis, intimal irregularity, or residual thrombus can propagate, and major venous injuries carry elevated VTE risk in trauma cohorts, with iliocaval injuries showing markedly higher VTE rates than those without such injuries, reinforcing the need for surveillance for DVT in this population [^116QLVbi].

> I should double-check whether the guideline distinguishes repair from ligation. The AAST-WSES recommendation is phrased broadly for abdominal or pelvic venous injuries and does not specify repair versus ligation, so the monitoring imperative applies regardless of operative strategy; observational data suggest VTE risk remains substantial after both repair and ligation of iliocaval segments, supporting universal surveillance in survivors [^117BFKmZ] [^116QLVbi].

> Next, I should review how to operationalize "monitor for DVT". Let me think about practical steps: daily assessment for calf pain, swelling, erythema, and a 2–4 cm calf circumference difference; maintain a high index of suspicion in the first week and beyond, as DVT can present later; and escalate to duplex ultrasound if symptoms arise or if the patient becomes high risk, recognizing that routine screening asymptomatic patients is not mandated by trauma VTE guidelines and should be individualized to risk and feasibility [^116xR1kG] [^113vb2tN].

> But wait, what about prophylaxis and whether it changes monitoring needs. I need to ensure I don't conflate prevention with surveillance. Even when pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis is initiated, trauma patients remain at nontrivial risk, and the AAST-WSES directive to monitor for DVT stands irrespective of prophylaxis status; thus, surveillance remains indicated even if LMWH or UFH is on board, with the caveat to balance bleeding risk and timing of initiation per trauma VTE protocols [^117BFKmZ] [^116xR1kG].

> Let me reconsider whether any other complication rivals DVT for priority here. Compartment syndrome and edema are legitimate concerns after iliac vein procedures, and ligation can worsen edema, but the AAST-WSES guideline's explicit directive is to monitor for DVT after abdominal or pelvic venous injuries; edema and compartment risk should still be assessed clinically, yet they are not the guideline-specified surveillance target in this scenario [^117BFKmZ] [^113B29Pm].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. According to the AAST-WSES 2020 guideline, the specific complication to monitor for after a repaired external iliac vein injury is deep vein thrombosis, and the rationale is the high risk of thrombotic complications after major venous trauma, which persists despite repair and necessitates vigilant clinical surveillance for DVT during the postoperative course [^117BFKmZ] [^116QLVbi].

---

The AAST recommends monitoring for **deep vein thrombosis (DVT)** after repair of an external iliac vein injury because venous trauma and repair increase thrombotic risk [^117BFKmZ]. DVT can cause **pulmonary embolism** and chronic venous insufficiency, so early detection is critical. Monitor for unilateral leg swelling, pain, erythema, and tenderness, and use duplex ultrasound if DVT is suspected. Start pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis as soon as bleeding risk allows, and consider anticoagulation if DVT is diagnosed or if the repair is narrow or compromised [^116xR1kG] [^113Cn2rf].

---

## Rationale for monitoring DVT

- **Increased thrombotic risk**: Venous injury and repair disrupt endothelium and flow, promoting thrombosis [^notfound].
- **High incidence**: DVT occurs in ~12% after iliocaval injury, independent of repair vs ligation [^116QLVbi].
- **Serious complications**: DVT can cause PE and chronic venous insufficiency, so early detection is essential [^114NjU6U].

---

## Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT

Monitor for the following, keeping in mind that **DVT can be silent**:

- Unilateral leg swelling
- Pain or tenderness
- Erythema or warmth
- Dilated superficial veins
- Homans' sign (calf pain with dorsiflexion) — nonspecific and not diagnostic

---

## Diagnostic approach

Use **clinical assessment plus imaging** when DVT is suspected:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Indication** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Duplex ultrasound | First-line for suspected DVT | Noninvasive, high sensitivity/specificity | Operator-dependent, limited by edema/obesity |
| CT venography | Suspected DVT with inconclusive ultrasound | Detailed anatomy, detects pelvic DVT | Radiation, contrast risks |
| D-dimer | Low suspicion or rule-out | Sensitive, noninvasive | Nonspecific, false positives |

---

## Preventive strategies

- **Pharmacologic prophylaxis**: Start LMWH or UFH when bleeding risk permits; trauma patients are high risk and benefit from early prophylaxis [^116xR1kG] [^113XcU6c].
- **Mechanical prophylaxis**: Use IPC if pharmacologic prophylaxis is contraindicated [^1152U3WX].
- **Anticoagulation**: Consider therapeutic anticoagulation if DVT is diagnosed or if the venous repair is narrow/compromised [^notfound].

---

## Potential complications of untreated DVT

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Potentially fatal [^notfound].
- **Chronic venous insufficiency**: Edema, ulcers, disability [^notfound].
- **Post-thrombotic syndrome**: Chronic pain, swelling, skin changes [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Monitor for DVT**: Use daily clinical assessment and duplex ultrasound if suspected [^117BFKmZ].
- **Start prophylaxis**: Begin pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis when bleeding risk allows [^116xR1kG].
- **Treat DVT**: Initiate therapeutic anticoagulation if DVT is diagnosed or if the repair is compromised [^notfound].

---

The AAST recommends monitoring for **DVT** after external iliac vein repair because venous trauma and repair increase thrombotic risk; early detection and prophylaxis reduce morbidity and mortality [^117BFKmZ].

### Needs damage control [^113B29Pm]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Short-term and long-term data document that ligation of an injured external iliac vein is generally well tolerated in young and otherwise healthy trauma patients. Important principles of management after this ligation include the following: (1) elevation of the entire ipsilateral lower extremity when the patient is supine or sitting (unless compartment syndromes are impending); (2) elastic wraps whenever the patient is sitting or standing if any postoperative edema is present; and (3) a vigorous walking program once the patient has recovered from a laparotomy.

The disadvantages of ligation of the external iliac vein (and common iliac vein and inferior vena cava) were well demonstrated in the patient described. First, there was severe intraoperative bleeding from every pelvic venous collateral, including those around the injured bladder, that mandated extensive suture ligation. Second, the patient needed both a four-compartment fasciotomy of the leg during the first operation and a three-compartment fasciotomy of the thigh in the postoperative period. While the need for thigh fasciotomy is uncommon in injured patients, a compartment pressure exceeding capillary pressure (30–35 mm Hg) which is likely to be prolonged should always prompt consideration for performing the procedure. This is particularly true when diffuse swelling is due to ischemia/reperfusion or venous ligation rather than an isolated fracture. And, third, the patient developed early postoperative and chronic edema of the left lower extremity.

### Severe blunt trauma to the transplanted kidney [^111JVHQo]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

According to the current guidelines, laparotomy is the first-line therapy for renal injury with unstable hemodynamics, and NOM might be the choice with stable hemodynamics. Injured transplanted kidneys should be salvaged as much as possible, but NOM of severely injured transplanted kidneys remains controversial. When a transplanted kidney injury is treated conservatively, complications such as renal infarction, renal abscess, rebleeding, decreased renal function, and rejection have been reported.

To achieve hemostasis of massive abdominal hemorrhage in this case, it was necessary to stop bleeding from not only the renal injury but also the venous injury. Endovascular embolization cannot stop bleeding from the laceration of the external iliac vein. Given the severity and type of injury and the patient's unstable hemodynamics, it was impossible to salvage and repair the injured transplanted kidney. Nephrectomy was the best treatment option. This was a rare case of severe injury to the transplanted kidney that required nephrectomy.

### Venous ligation versus venous repair: does the procedure impact venous thromboembolism risk? [^112QNKQ8]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Traumatic lower extremity venous injuries are most commonly managed with either a vein ligation or repair procedure. Venous injuries are associated with an increased risk of developing venous thromboembolisms (VTE), but little is understood with regard to how specific surgical treatments may impact the risk of developing either a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a pulmonary embolism (PE). In this study of lower extremity venous injuries, we hypothesized that venous ligation would be associated with an increased risk of DVT but a lower risk of PE when compared with venous repair.

Methods

Patients were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (2008 to 2014) with at least one iliac, femoral, popliteal, or tibial venous injury and who received either a vein ligation or repair. The patients were then compared based on the type of procedure and the location of the injury to assess the risk of DVT and PE between the groups.

Results

A total of 1214 patients were identified. There was no difference between patients who received a vein ligation versus a repair with respect to age, injury severity score, or initial systolic blood pressure. There was no difference in the odds of developing either a DVT or PE between patients who were treated with vein ligation versus repair. There was also no difference in VTE rates when stratified by the location of the injury.

Conclusions

In individuals with lower extremity venous injuries, there is no difference in the rate of DVT or PE complications when comparing venous repair and ligation procedures. The role of anticoagulation remains to be elucidated following operative treatment.

OPTIMAL MEDICAL THERAPY AND SURVEILLANCE FOR PATIENTS WITH NIVL

Consensus recommendations:

The routine use of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy for untreated NIVL is not supported.
In treated patients with NIVL with no evidence of previous venous thromboembolism (either by imaging or history), there is no consensus that anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is necessary.
An assessment of thrombotic risk in patients with NIVL should be made. If anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is indicated, the agent, dose, and duration should be tailored accordingly.
Routine early and long-term clinical surveillance, including imaging of patients with NIVL following stent placement, should be performed. Imaging to assess the stent is per practitioner preference (eg, ultrasound or axial imaging). Attention should be paid to stent-related adverse events such as migration and stenosis/thrombosis.

The incidence of iliac vein compression in an asymptomatic population has been estimated between 25% and 66%. One series reported that nearly 25% of asymptomatic patients evaluated for abdominal pain in the emergency department had > 50% diameter compression and up to 66% had > 25% diameter compression (correlating to 50% area stenosis); none had a history of prior deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In 1 retrospective series of patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, 84% had evidence of iliac vein compression. In another study, 65% of patients with a DVT and iliac compression had additional contributing risk factors for DVT development. However, the presence of compression alone as a solitary risk factor has not been described; indeed, most patients with anatomic compression will never have a DVT. Thus, antithrombotic prophylaxis for anatomic compression alone is not currently warranted.

Authors recommendations

If there is urgent indication go into the abdomen and control the external iliac artery in the pelvis.
Vertical groin incision is the simplest way to gain proximal control of the femoral artery.
Blunt dissection is recommended in devastating vascular trauma.
The source of persistent back bleeding is frequently the deep femoral artery. This must be identified and controlled.
Temporary shunt and ligation are plausible damage control options for femoral vessels (Shunting is a much better option for arterial injuries). Don't hesitate in ligate the femoral vein if needed.
Temporary shunt for common and superficial femoral arteries is an excellent damage control solution. Authors strongly recommend a pre-emptive fasciotomy in such cases.
Interposition PTFE grafts are well tolerated.
Always cover your arterial vascular suture with viable well-vascularized soft tissue.
Decide (with the orthopedic surgeons) to achieve bone alignment prior to arterial repair.

Popliteal vessels

Blunt injuries are more often present and carry almost 3 times the risk of amputation in comparison to penetrating injuries. Popliteal vessels are challenging to approach and treat. It is the least accessible vessel in the lower extremity and the collateral flow around the knee is not sufficient to sustain viability of the lower leg if flow of the popliteal artery is interrupted. Popliteal artery traumatic injuries carry the highest limb loss rate of all extremity vascular injuries. Injuries requiring resection of more than 2 cm are not amenable to primary anastomosis. Popliteal vein injuries, which usually occur together with arterial injuries, should be repaired if possible, but never delay the surgery time in physiologically crashed patients. In the case of combined injuries intra-arterial shunts may play a particular role. Prophylactic fasciotomy is recommended in delayed injuries or those with complex soft tissue damage. In the usual case of major soft tissue trauma the decision is often one of primary amputation versus repair. The absolute indications for primary amputation in these cases are: more than 6 h of ischemic time and disruption of the posterior tibial nerve. The relative indications are: severe foot wounds, multiple trauma, injuries requiring extensive soft tissue coverage and tibial reconstruction.

Authors recommendations

Always begin a popliteal repair with a fasciotomy.
Proximal and distal control are mandatory (as are for all other vascular traumatic injuries).
Think about systemic heparin whether there are no potential bleeding injuries.
The posterior edge of the femur is the key anatomical landmark for managing popliteal injuries.
Careful with the popliteal vein and saphenous nerve is advised when dissecting the popliteal artery.
Go simple: bypass and exclude the injured popliteal artery.
Saphenous vein interposition grafts are recommended.

### External iliac vein injury and repair during robotic-assisted pelvic lymphadenectomy [^117EJrQ2]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To demonstrate a surgical video wherein an incidental external iliac vein injury was encountered and repaired robotically during a pelvic lymphadenectomy procedure.

Design

Step-by-step explanation of the technique using a surgical video.

Setting

A 70-year-old white woman was referred to our division for fallopian tube carcinoma. She presented with bilateral adnexal masses and increasing abdominal girth. Preoperative imaging did not reveal any retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or carcinomatosis. She was taken to the operating room for robotic-assisted debulking.

Interventions

Surgical staging was performed, including robotic hysterectomy, bilateral adnexectomy, pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, omentectomy, and pelvic washings. A 10-mm thermal laceration to the left external iliac vein occurred while using the monopolar scissors during left pelvic lymphadenectomy. After immediate clamping of the injury site with ProGrasp forceps, the laceration on the external iliac vein was primarily repaired by use of a running intracorporeal 4–0 polypropylene suture, using the robotic system. The insufflation pressure was increased to 20 mm Hg for the duration of primary repair to limit the hemorrhage. The increase in insufflation pressure was communicated to the anesthesiologist for close monitoring of the cardiopulmonary status.

Conclusion

Repair of external iliac vein injury, using the robotic system, was successfully and safely performed in this patient. Robotic repair of major vascular injuries should only be attempted by experienced laparoscopic surgeons with extensive vascular surgery experience, because these injuries are associated with significantly high mortality rate.

### Silent danger: coexistence of late-onset external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm and deep vein thrombosis [^112xdtHK]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

3 Discussion

EIA pseudoaneurysms are significant vascular complications following percutaneous interventions. While most cases present in the early post‐procedural period, delayed PA development remains a rare but challenging entity. This case describes a delayed EIA pseudoaneurysm associated with DVT, highlighting the need for careful follow‐up even after seemingly uncomplicated procedures.

Pseudoaneurysms develop due to the disruption of the arterial wall, leading to extravasation of blood into surrounding tissues and subsequent encapsulation by a fibrous sac. Risk factors include inadequate hemostasis, large‐bore catheter use, obesity, anticoagulant therapy, and repeated punctures. Studies have reported an incidence of pseudoaneurysm formation following arterial catheterization ranging from 0.2% to 0.3%. However, cases presenting beyond the immediate post‐procedural period, as in this patient, are exceptionally rare.

The association between pseudoaneurysms and DVT is well‐documented but uncommon. An expanding pseudoaneurysm can compress adjacent venous structures, leading to venous stasis and thrombosis. This mechanism was evident in our case, where the pseudoaneurysm compressed the external iliac vein, contributing to DVT formation. Delayed complications may occur due to inexperience in catheter manipulations and wire use, especially in operators who are new to interventional procedures.

The primary imaging modality for diagnosing pseudoaneurysms is Doppler ultrasonography, which provides detailed information on the lesion's size, flow characteristics, and associated thrombotic changes. Contrast‐enhanced CT angiography further aids in delineating anatomical relationships and assessing potential complications.

Treatment options include ultrasound‐guided compression, thrombin injection, endovascular stent graft placement, and open surgical repair. The choice of therapy depends on factors such as pseudoaneurysm size, location, and associated complications. Literature suggests that thrombin injection is highly effective for small pseudoaneurysms, while endovascular stenting is preferred for larger or symptomatic cases. In this case, the pseudoaneurysm's size and the presence of DVT necessitated covered stent deployment.

Endovascular techniques have gained widespread acceptance due to their minimally invasive nature, shorter recovery times, and favorable long‐term outcomes. However, complications such as endoleaks, restenosis, or graft thrombosis must be considered in follow‐up evaluations. Preventative measures, including adequate hemostasis, optimal puncture site selection, and careful patient monitoring, can significantly reduce pseudoaneurysm formation.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: prevention of venous thromboembolism in surgical hospitalized patients [^116xR1kG]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 surgical venous thromboembolism (VTE) guideline — external recommendations for cardiac, major vascular, and trauma surgery indicate that for cardiac surgery, one guideline recommended mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with optimally applied intermittent pneumatic compression, over no prophylaxis or pharmacological prophylaxis, and for patients whose hospital course is prolonged by ≥ 1 nonhemorrhagic surgical complication it suggested adding pharmacological prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) to mechanical prophylaxis. That source judged most cardiac patients to be at moderate risk for VTEs and at high risk of anticoagulant prophylaxis-related bleeding and concluded that in cardiac patients at usual risk for VTE the harms of anticoagulant prophylaxis outweighed the benefits, whereas anticoagulation may be of net benefit for patients with high-risk characteristics. The ACCP guidelines did not provide recommendations specific to major vascular surgery. An international consensus treated major vascular surgery as "major surgery", judging patients generally at moderate risk absent high-risk features such as age older than 60 years or prior VTE, and stated pharmacological prophylaxis was recommended in the absence of unusual bleeding risks. NICE 2018 guidelines recommend considering mechanical VTE prophylaxis on admission for patients who had a normal preoperative walking ability and whose planned surgery was anticipated to reduce their mobility, recommend considering pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for a minimum of 7 days for open vascular surgery or major endovascular procedures, including endovascular aneurysm repair, when VTE risk outweighs bleeding risk, and recommend considering mechanical prophylaxis on admission for these procedures if pharmacological prophylaxis is contraindicated. SIGN 2014 guidelines recommend that patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery should be offered mechanical thromboprophylaxis where feasible, and that those not at high risk for bleeding can also be offered pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. For major trauma including traumatic brain injury, acute spinal injury, and traumatic spine injury, VTE prophylaxis is suggested (over no prophylaxis) with LMWH, low-dose UFH, or mechanical prophylaxis, preferably with intermittent pneumatic compression; for patients at high risk for VTE, addition of mechanical prophylaxis to pharmacological prophylaxis is suggested when not contraindicated by lower extremity injury; and it suggests against placement of an IVC filter for primary VTE prevention and against periodic surveillance with venous compression ultrasound.

### Abdominal vascular trauma [^112TLzLG]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2016). Low credibility.

Patients with severe injury and physiological derangement may require damage control procedures like TIVS (figure 7) to maintain blood flow to the lower extremity and prevent the development of lower extremity ischemia. Distal pulses (palpated or Doppler tones) should be verified after securing the shunt. TIVS can be removed and replaced with a definitive vascular repair after the patient has been resuscitated and coagulopathy corrected. A study comparing patients requiring temporary shunting versus ligation for iliac artery injury found that the use of TIVS eliminated the need for later fasciotomies and amputations. Injuries to the internal iliac artery can be ligated with little consequence due to the rich pelvic collateral blood flow.

Looped temporary intravascular shunt within the iliac artery.

Advances in endovascular therapies have provided an alternative treatment for patients with injury to the iliac artery/vein. Placement of covered stent grafts across external and common iliac artery injuries have been described; however, these have been small series. Endovascular temporary balloon occlusion may be a temporizing measure to limit bleeding until exposure of the injured vessel can be obtained. Angiographic embolization of the internal iliac artery or its branches with coils or gelfoam is common and is generally well tolerated.

Iliac vein

Iliac vein injuries are frequently associated with iliac artery injuries. Access to common iliac vein injuries, especially on the right side, may be limited by the overlying common iliac artery. Transection of the artery for visualization and repair of the venous injury has been described historically, but is rarely advocated in modern times. Injuries to the common iliac vein and external iliac vein should be repaired primarily with a 4–0 or 5–0 Prolene suture. Larger venous injuries can be repaired using reverse saphenous interposition grafts or vein patch repairs. A study of complex venous reconstructions after traumatic injury by Pappas et al demonstrated a patency rate of 73% at 30 days postrepair. Postoperative anticoagulation should be considered if the venous repair results in significant narrowing of the diameter of the vein to prevent later thrombosis. Ligation of the iliac veins can be considered for large injuries or patients who are unstable. Previous studies have shown that ligation of the common or external iliac vein is well tolerated with few adverse sequelae.

Management of injuries in zone 3

Exposure and vascular control

The proximal vascular control of the iliac vessels is obtained by eviscerating the small bowel to the right and opening the retroperitoneum over the aortic bifurcation. Distal vascular control is achieved at the point the vessels come out of the pelvis proximal to the inguinal ligament. When bilateral injuries are present, the only way to achieve bleeding control is the total pelvic vascular exclusion, with a proximal cross-clamping of the aorta or vena cava, above their bifurcation, and a distal cross-clamping of the external iliac arteries or veins on both sides.

Vascular repair

Iliac arteries (IA)

Injuries of the common IA should be sutured or temporarily shunted if possible. Ligation of these vessels in the hypotensive patient leads to limb ischemia. In a stable or stabilized patient, depending on the type of injury, it is possible to perform a lateral arteriorraphy, an end-to-end anastomosis and an insertion of saphenous vein or PTFE graft. External IA may be ligated if omolateral internal IA is intact.

Iliac veins (IV)

Injuries of the IV are best repaired with a 4–0 or 5–0 polypropylene lateral suture or with ligation. If a significant narrowing of the lumen has occurred after the repair, postoperative anticoagulation therapy should be started to avoid thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

### Silent danger: coexistence of late-onset external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm and deep vein thrombosis [^115Gm26k]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Conclusion

Delayed EIA pseudoaneurysms remain a rare but potentially serious vascular complication. This case emphasizes the importance of recognizing and managing late‐onset pseudoaneurysms, particularly those associated with DVT. A multidisciplinary approach, early diagnosis, and appropriate intervention are essential to prevent life‐threatening complications and improve patient outcomes.

### Thoracic trauma WSES-AAST guidelines [^115c5GRa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Contraindications: Absolute contraindications include irreversible injury or comorbid conditions such as terminal malignancy and vascular disease or injury that prevents successful ECMO placement. Relative contraindications include mechanical ventilation lasting over 7 days before initiating therapy, chronic end-stage organ dysfunction without transplant eligibility, advanced age, or severe frailty. Relative contraindications also include brain injury, bleeding, and intolerance to anticoagulation

Anticoagulation Management: During ECMO, systemic anticoagulation is used. Different monitoring tests, such as partial thromboplastin time, activated clotting time, and anti-Xa, are used with varying therapeutic targets across different centers. Anticoagulation may be stopped temporarily while monitoring for clot formation in the oxygenator

Follow-Up: Physicians should focus on preventing complications related to ECMO. Approximately 80% of trauma patients requiring ECMO will experience at least one complication, such as self-limiting arrhythmia, bleeding at the cannulation site, brain or gastrointestinal hemorrhages, embolic events, or sepsis. For patients on VA ECMO, it is crucial to prevent arterial limb ischemia. Providing distal perfusion using an antegrade arterial catheter and, in suitable patients, surgical cannulation of the arterial site through the interposition of a dacron graft can help prevent limb ischemia. Daily ECMO monitoring should involve radiographic assessment of the cannulae position and direct inspection to detect early fibrin deposition in the oxygenator, tubing, and cannulas.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^1126xgss]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Values statement — The committee recognized the poor quality of evidence supporting several of the recommendations, particularly arising from the common use of surrogate end points and the sparse data demonstrating the relative efficacy of different treatment strategies on patient-important outcomes. The committee placed a relatively high value on preventing DVT and the postthrombotic syndrome, and in recommending the thrombolytic techniques over surgical thrombectomy, we placed a relatively high value on avoiding the potential complications of an infrequently performed surgical procedure. In recommending treatments for lesions uncovered by thrombus removal, we highly valued the avoidance of complications related to untreated iliac stenosis, and in recommending compression stockings, we considered this intervention to be relatively inexpensive, to not require expertise, and able to be applied on a large scale. Indirect evidence was occasionally used due to lack of more direct evidence. The guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum should be interpreted as a guide to be applied in the context of clinical judgment rather than as a rigid mandate, and clinical judgment is of the utmost importance in such situations.

Limb occlusion after aneurysm repair — epidemiology, risk factors, and presentation are summarized: Nearly 25% of all arterial reinterventions after open repair are due to limb occlusion, which is most common in patients with associated occlusive disease; limb occlusion appears to be greater in women and in grafts extending to the femoral artery. Endografts are at a higher risk for limb thrombosis than bifurcated surgical grafts, and although device dependent, the incidence of limb occlusion after EVAR is approximately 4%, with the majority of occlusions presenting within 12 months and nearly all within the first year after EVAR. Additional risks include unsupported limbs, fabric infolding and kinking between stents, and compromised outflow, with specific contributors such as occlusion of the internal iliac artery with or without extension of the endograft limb to the external iliac artery or unrecognized distal dissection; isolated limb occlusion usually manifests with claudication, whereas occlusion of the entire graft may be manifested with severe ischemia.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on follow-up after vascular surgery arterial procedures [^112VC6rK]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although follow-up after open surgical and endovascular procedures is generally regarded as an important part of the care provided by vascular surgeons, there are no detailed or comprehensive guidelines that specify the optimal approaches with regard to testing methods, indications for reintervention, and follow-up intervals. To provide guidance to the vascular surgeon, the Clinical Practice Council of the Society for Vascular Surgery appointed an expert panel and a methodologist to review the current clinical evidence and to develop recommendations for follow-up after vascular surgery procedures. For those procedures for which high-quality evidence was not available, recommendations were based on observational studies, committee consensus, and indirect evidence. Recognizing that there are numerous published reports on the role of duplex ultrasound for surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypass grafts, the Society commissioned a systematic review and meta-analysis on this topic. The panel classified the strength of each recommendation and the corresponding quality of evidence on the basis of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system: recommendations were graded either strong or weak, and the quality of evidence was graded high, moderate, or low. The resulting recommendations represent a wide variety of open surgical and endovascular procedures involving the extracranial carotid artery, thoracic and abdominal aorta, mesenteric and renal arteries, and lower extremity arterial revascularization. The panel also identified many areas in which there was a lack of high-quality evidence to support their recommendations. This suggests that there are opportunities for further clinical research on testing methods, threshold criteria, and the role of surveillance as well as on the modes of failure and indications for reintervention after vascular surgery procedures.

Prophylactic inferior vena cava filters

When should prophylactic inferior vena cava filters be used?

Recommendation

The use of prophylactic (in the absence of known VTE) inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) in trauma patients is controversial, but should be considered in very high-risk patients who cannot receive chemical VTE prophylaxis for long periods because of increased bleeding risk.

Discussion

IVCF currently have indications in patients with known acute proximal (popliteal, femoral or iliac) DVT or PE who have an absolute contraindication to therapeutic anticoagulation; have suffered complications of anticoagulation or who have recurrent VTE while on adequate anticoagulation. The introduction of the retrievable IVCF in 2003 markedly increased insertion rates. Despite earlier evidence of a significant reduction in the incidence of PE following prophylactic IVCF in trauma patients, more recent studies failed to show improvement in mortalityand report higher risk of DVT following insertion. In the absence of level I evidence, conflicting professional guidelines regarding the use of IVCF in trauma patients have emerged. We suggest consideration of prophylactic IVCF only in the highest risk patients with contraindications to chemoprophylaxis due to an ongoing risk of life-threatening bleeding. Examples of such high-risk conditions include severe head injury plus long bone fractures, head injury plus spinal cord injury, multiple long bone fractures, severe pelvic fracture plus long bone fractures and/or medical conditions that predispose to bleeding.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on endovascular intervention for trauma [^114dKdvr]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Extremity arterial injury — endovascular intervention: Endovascular intervention may be appropriate in patients who have sustained a low-velocity injury in which prolonged open exposure increases the risk of injury to adjacent vital structures or bleeding from operative dissection, with treatment for an arterial occlusion including stent placement or aspiration thrombectomy and embolization in cases of active extravasation. Two anatomic areas have emerged as the most frequent sites for endovascular repair — the iliac and the axillary–subclavian arteries — and endovascular intervention with stent placement in the external or common iliac artery has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair; for axillary–subclavian injuries, endovascular repair is more straightforward and associated with less morbidity. If definitive repair is not possible from an endovascular approach, or if hemodynamic instability develops, an occlusion balloon can be placed in conjunction with an open approach to minimize blood loss. Embolization for active hemorrhage in the extremities should be considered in the appropriate context of expendability of the embolized artery, recognizing that distal perforating branches can usually be embolized safely (Level of evidence, D; strength of recommendation, weak).

A 30-year-old man was referred to us after 48 days of gunshot injury to left groin, with torrential bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm of the left external iliac artery. He was successfully managed with a team of specialists involving trauma surgeon, vascular and plastic surgeon, general surgeons and intervention radiologist with the help of critical care specialists. He required judicious debridement, a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap, stenting of the external iliac artery, repair of the external iliac vein and ligation of the bilateral internal iliac artery. He had prolonged intensive care unit stay with open abdomen requiring specialised care. Errors in regular assessment of patient by clinical and radiological examination along with failure in early adequate debridement were responsible for trauma suffered by him. Though it is a rare injury, these devastating complications can occur after any gunshot injury and proper management guidelines must be established.

### Venous ligation versus venous repair: does the procedure impact venous thromboembolism risk? [^115q9AZ3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of patients with venous injuries included in the NTDB between the years 2008 and 2014. Patients were initially identified based on the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes that corresponded with venous injuries to the iliac (902.54), femoral (904.2), popliteal (904.42), tibial (904.5), anterior tibial (904.52), or posterior tibial (904.54) vessels. Below knee injuries, defined as tibial, anterior tibial, and posterior tibial venous injuries, were grouped and considered "distal" for analysis. All patients were then divided based on the procedure they received. Ligation procedures include both excision and occlusion of abdominal and lower limb vein ICD-9 codes (38.67, 38.69, 38.87, and 38.89). Repair procedures included: incision, resection with anastomosis, suture repair, and other repair of vessel procedures for the abdominal and lower limb vein ICD-9 codes (38.07, 38.09, 38.37, 38.39, 39.3, 39.32, 39.5, 39.56, 39.57, 39.58, 39.59, and 39.92). Patients were excluded if they received a lower extremity amputation (84.15 to 84.19). Age, gender, mechanism of injury, initial Glasgow Coma Scale, initial heart rate, initial systolic blood pressure, and calculated injury severity score were collected for all patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The primary outcome in this study was the development of DVT or PE during the initial hospitalization. This was assessed first by the management approach of the venous injury. Injuries were further stratified to assess if anatomic location was associated with a higher risk of developing DVT or PE. These outcomes were identified directly through the NTDB which includes a list of reported complications during the initial hospitalization. The patient list was cross referenced to the complication list to identify cases of DVT and PE. The NTDB does not contain data on the use of anticoagulants in the acute setting.

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Independent t-test was used for continuous data, which were reported as mean ± SD. χ² tests and OR with 95% CI were used for categorical data, which were reported as percentages. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05.

Iliac vein stent sizing and deployment — When iliac vein stent placement is performed, careful attention should be given to ensuring appropriate stent sizing to enable durable venous patency, freedom from chronic pain, and freedom from stent migration (Level of Evidence C, Strength of Recommendation Strong). The risk of stent migration is likely higher in treating NIVLs than in fibrotic postthrombotic lesions and is likely to be higher with use of smaller-diameter and shorter-length stents; in the iliac vein, the placement of stents with a diameter of < 12 mm should be performed rarely, if ever. Iliac vein stents should routinely be postdilated to nominal diameters; routine predilation of venous lesions before stent placement is recommended; when multiple stents are placed, there should be longitudinal overlap per the manufacturer's instructions for use (typically at least 2–3 cm); and if secure anchoring in a common iliac vein lesion is not strong, extension of stent placement or extension of a longer stent into the external iliac vein to enhance fixation may be considered.

Randomized trials and other studies have shown that thrombus reformation is frequent after ETR and that long-term benefits are most likely to be realized when patency is maintained; although no large prospective studies have compared antithrombotic therapy strategies after ETR, anticoagulation should be given for at least as long as comparable patients who did not undergo ETR, and, if feasible, strong consideration should be given to the use of LMWH during the weeks immediately following the procedure.

### Silent danger: coexistence of late-onset external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm and deep vein thrombosis [^11561LiL]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Pseudoaneurysm formation is a recognized complication following arterial catheterization procedures, with a typical onset occurring within days after the intervention. However, delayed‐onset pseudoaneurysms, especially those complicated by deep vein thrombosis (DVT), are relatively rare. EIA pseudoaneurysms arise from arterial wall defects leading to blood collection outside the arterial lumen, which is confined by surrounding tissues. If untreated, pseudoaneurysms may enlarge, rupture, or cause significant morbidity. DVT, a frequent complication of vascular interventions, is usually associated with venous stasis, hypercoagulability, or endothelial injury. However, in some cases, a pseudoaneurysm can contribute to venous compression and stasis, increasing the risk of thrombosis. In this report, we present a case of delayed EIA pseudoaneurysm formation associated with ipsilateral lower limb DVT following a routine coronary angiography. This rare presentation highlights the need for vigilance in evaluating post‐procedural limb swelling and underscores the role of endovascular techniques in management.

Methods

We conducted an international, cross-sectional survey of trauma providers. The survey was sponsored by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST). It was developed and disseminated using Qualtrics (Provo, Utah, USA), an online survey and distribution software.

A convenience sample from the AAST mailing list was included. Participants were invited to complete the survey using an anonymous, electronic link sent via the AAST listserv in March 2021. One reminder email was sent in April 2021. The survey link was also available to be accessed via the AAST webpage. Participation in the survey was voluntary and respondents consented to participate by completing and submitting the survey. Incomplete responses were excluded from analysis. The survey was estimated to take 5–10 min to complete.

Two trauma physicians and one clinical pharmacist initially developed the survey items based on guideline recommendations and gaps. Five trauma physicians and two advanced practice providers who were not study investigators completed pilot testing to review content, determine ease of use, and identify errors. Feedback from testers was then incorporated into the final version and the changes were approved by study investigators.

The survey was a 38-item questionnaire (online supplemental appendix A). It was separated into six sections, including: demographics, preferred pharmacological drug and dose, monitoring practices, screening of asymptomatic patients, duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis postdischarge, and timing to initiation of chemoprophylaxis in patients with TBI, solid organ injury, and SCI. Display logic was used for 17 questions based on previous responses. For example, if respondents answered they did not routinely dose adjust enoxaparin based on anti-Xa levels, questions on anti-Xa monitoring were not displayed and participants were automatically advanced to the next section.

### American Association for the Surgery of Trauma-World Society of Emergency Surgery guidelines on diagnosis and management of peripheral vascular injuries [^11545F7t]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The peripheral arteries and veins of the extremities are among the most commonly injured vessels in both civilian and military vascular trauma. Blunt causes are more frequent than penetrating except during military conflicts and in certain geographic areas. Physical examination and simple bedside investigations of pulse pressures are key in early identification of these injuries. In stable patients with equivocal physical examinations, computed tomography angiograms have become the mainstay of screening and diagnosis. Immediate open surgical repair remains the first-line therapy in most patients. However, advances in endovascular therapies and more widespread availability of this technology have resulted in an increase in the range of injuries and frequency of utilization of minimally invasive treatments for vascular injuries in stable patients. Prevention of and early detection and treatment of compartment syndrome remain essential in the recovery of patients with significant peripheral vascular injuries. The decision to perform amputation in patients with mangled extremities remains difficult with few clear indicators. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma in conjunction with the World Society of Emergency Surgery seeks to summarize the literature to date and provide guidelines on the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of peripheral vascular injuries. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Review study, level IV.

### Impact of venorrhaphy and vein ligation in isolated lower-extremity venous injuries on venous thromboembolism and edema [^114aUJAU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Following venous injury, venorrhaphy can restore outflow, although it risks thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Vein ligation is a faster option, although it potentially risks extremity edema. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the management of venous injury on VTE and extremity edema in patients with isolated lower-extremity venous injuries.

Methods

Patients with common iliac, external iliac, and femoral venous injuries over a 10-year period were stratified by age, shock, management of venous injury, injury severity, and timing and type of anticoagulation. Outcomes included development of extremity edema and VTE (pulmonary embolism, deep venous thrombosis). Outcomes were then evaluated to determine risk factors for symptomatic lower-extremity edema and VTE by the management of venous injuries.

Results

Eighty-four patients were identified: 20 common iliac, 27 external iliac, 37 femoral. Forty-nine underwent vein repair and 35 underwent vein ligation. Ninety-three percent were male with a mean Injury Severity Score and Glasgow Coma Scale score of 17 and 14, respectively. Venous thromboembolism occurred in 18 (21%), 15 (18%) deep venous thrombosis, and 4 (5%) pulmonary embolisms. Thirty-two (38%) patients developed lower-extremity edema. Those who underwent vein ligation had a greater degree of shock on presentation (RBC transfusions, 14 vs. 8 units; p = 0.03) and were more likely to receive prophylactic fasciotomies (60% vs. 33%, p = 0.01). There was no difference in time to or type of chemoprophylaxis between patients who underwent vein repair and those who received vein ligation. However, patients with vein ligation had fewer episodes of VTE (9% vs. 31%, p = 0.02) with no difference in symptomatic lower-extremity edema (37% vs. 39%, p = 0.88) or amputation rates (0% vs. 2%, p = 0.99).

Conclusion

Vein repair had a higher incidence of VTE while providing no additional benefit in reducing symptomatic extremity edema compared to ligation in patients suffering venous injury. Ligation of most extremity venous injuries can be performed without increasing patient morbidity.

The injured patient requiring hospitalization

The recent clinical practice guidelines for thromboprophylaxis sponsored by the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma / American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (AAST / ACS-COT)and those by the Western Trauma Association (WTA)offer a more pragmatic approach. Both guidelines suggest that the majority of hospitalized trauma patients should receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with the exception of ambulatory patients with expected length of stay < 24 hours. This is likely best achieved with LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin, tinzaparin, dalteparin, etc.), as it has been demonstrated, with moderate certainty, to reduce the risk of VTE as compared to subcutaneous administration of unfractionated heparin. The WTA provides additional clarification that patients capable of ambulation but who are confined to bed due to intoxication, restraints or other reasons likely also warrant pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. These recommendations are based on extrapolations from existing clinical decision rules (CDR) that predict the risk of VTE following traumatic injury.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery practice guidelines on follow-up after vascular surgery arterial procedures [^112bq11o]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity endovascular therapy (EVT) follow-up — The optimal frequency and method for follow-up after EVT for lower extremity arterial occlusive disease have not been established, and a follow-up program should be founded on patient-based clinical outcomes, hemodynamic status, and anatomic assessment. Mounting evidence suggests that optimizing medical management of patients with peripheral arterial disease will improve bypass graft or EVT patency as well as improve mortality, and in patients with critical limb ischemia suboptimal medical therapy can increase the risk of major amputation or death by a factor of 8. Clinical assessment consists of a focused history, physical examination with evaluation of peripheral pulses, evaluation of existing wounds, inspection of arterial access sites, and ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, and patients at higher risk for contrast-induced nephropathy — those with a preintervention serum creatinine concentration > 1.5 mg/dL or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and those with diabetes mellitus — should have repeated laboratory testing at the first follow-up visit.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^114SwE8F]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In the case of major pelvic injury, it is nevertheless agreed that damage-control interventional radiology and urgent resuscitative surgery should be initiated early and simultaneously. Adjunct techniques can be combined with a consecutive laparotomy if deemed necessary. This may decrease the high mortality rate observed in patients with major pelvic injuries who have undergone laparotomy as the primary intervention. However, non-therapeutic laparotomy should be avoided. Time to pelvic embolisation for haemodynamically unstable pelvic fractures may impact survival.

Angiography and embolisation are currently accepted as highly effective means with which to control arterial bleeding that cannot be controlled by fracture stabilisation. Radiological management can also be usefully applied to abdominal and thoracic bleeding. Martinelli et al. reported the use of intra-aortic balloon occlusion to reduce bleeding and permit transport to an angiography theatre. In contrast, Morozumi et al. suggested the use of mobile digital subtraction angiography for arterial embolisation performed in the clinic by trauma surgeons. A number of authors argue that permissive hypotension could achieve better survival by achieving pelvic stabilisation and/or angiography through DCR, hypertonic solutions and controlled hypothermia. Institutional differences in the capacity to perform timely angiography and embolisation may explain the different treatment algorithms suggested by many authors. Reports on transcatheter angiographic embolisation suggest a 100% higher mortality during off-hours due to lack of radiological service. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach to these severe injuries is required.

Local haemostatic measures

Recommendation 21

We recommend the use of topical haemostatic agents in combination with other surgical measures or with packing for venous or moderate arterial bleeding associated with parenchymal injuries. (Grade 1B)

Rationale

A wide range of local haemostatic agents is currently available for use as adjuncts to traditional surgical techniques to obtain haemorrhagic control. These topical agents can be particularly useful when access to the site of bleeding is difficult. Local haemostatic agents include collagen, gelatine or cellulose-based products, fibrin and synthetic glues or adhesives that can be used for both external and internal bleeding while polysaccharide-based and inorganic haemostatics are still mainly used and approved for external bleeding.

The use of topical haemostatic agents should consider several factors, such as the type of surgical procedure, cost, bleeding severity, coagulation status and each agent's specific characteristics. Some of these agents should be avoided when auto-transfusion is applied, and several other contraindications need to be considered. The capacity of each agent to control bleeding was initially studied in animals, but increasing experience in humans is now available.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Acute DVT without PE — In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without pulmonary embolism (PE) and a contraindication to anticoagulation, "we suggest that an IVC filter be considered based on various clinical risk factors, as outlined in the rationale". This recommendation is labeled "Strength of Recommendation: Consensus statement", and the evidence base notes "No studies were identified in the systematic review that met the inclusion criteria for this question". Despite limited evidence, "the panel agreed that most, but not all, patients with an acute proximal DVT and a contraindication to anticoagulation should receive an IVC filter", considering "cardiopulmonary status/reserve, extent and location of DVT, ongoing thrombotic risk, and expected duration of contraindication to anticoagulation". "In selected circumstances… it may be reasonable to not place an IVC filter", and "Monitoring for recurrence or extension of lower-extremity clot is recommended in such patients". The panel further judged that benefits "probably outweighs the harms", there is "probably no important uncertainty or variability in how patients value outcomes", there were no identified cost-effectiveness studies and routine placement/removal "entails moderate costs", and "acceptability of IVC filter placement varies among different stakeholders".

SAFETY OUTCOME ASSESSMENT

Safety reporting is commonly focused on the requirements of applicable regulatory bodies. However, studies should also strive to report safety outcomes in a manner that reflects the scientific and clinical conventions for the applicable disease area, ideally with the use of society-endorsed standardized definitions and reporting guidelines that can enable meaningful comparisons across studies. Advance consideration should be given to prespecifying, defining, and reporting the full range of safety events that may be expected to occur with a particular intervention. When no events occurred, this fact should be explicitly stated in reporting results. Given the variability in devices and treatments, the duration of follow-up may vary; in general, longer follow-up should be considered for devices that are intended for long-term implantation.

Any venous interventional procedure may be complicated by the development of thrombosis or bleeding. Symptomatic thrombosis can manifest as DVT, PE, both, or neither. DVT can be limited to a treated vein segment or can extend to involve additional segments and can lead to PE, PTS, or neither; PE can lead to right heart strain, hemodynamic compromise, death, or none of these consequences. Blood loss can be overt or occult and can result from device-related aspiration, device-related hemolysis, venous access site hemorrhage, vascular perforation or rupture, or development of a distant site of bleeding; concomitant anticoagulant and fibrinolytic drugs can contribute to the onset and severity of these events. Some bleeding events require blood transfusion or surgical or endovascular therapy to address. In reporting events, such details should be provided to enable their overall clinical impact to be discerned. To enable standardization of event reporting, guidelines have been developed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) investigators, and the Society of Interventional Radiology, among other bodies. – The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis scheme may be particularly applicable to VTE populations.

Safety events can be related to a specific device (eg, fracture of a stent), an overall endovascular treatment (eg, thrombosis of a venous segment treated with pharmacomechanical CDT followed by stent placement), associated treatments that were mandated by the protocol (eg, gastrointestinal bleed in a patient who was placed on antiplatelet therapy after stent placement), standard care (eg, subdural hematoma in a patient receiving anticoagulation for preexisting DVT), or none of these. Therefore, in reporting treatment-related events, investigators should provide the specific definition of relatedness that was used.

Management

Because of the patient's hypotension, multiple intra-abdominal vascular injuries and the obvious presence of other abdominal injuries (to be described), the left external iliac vein and the left common femoral vein were both ligated. As the patient was now more hemodynamically stable, however, the transected ends of the left external iliac artery were debrided and an interposition graft of 8 mm externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was placed between the left external iliac artery in the abdomen and the left common femoral artery in the groin.

An anterior wound in the bladder was seen along with extensive venous hemorrhage in the retropubic and left pelvic areas, presumably from ligation of the left external iliac and left common femoral veins. The surgical team then spent 30 minutes placing venous ligation stitches in these areas as well as applying fibrin glue. The anterior wound in the bladder was closed in two layers, while a posterior wound in the bladder was not repaired.

Laparotomy pad packing was placed in the retropubic and left pelvic areas, the open abdomen was covered with a silo, the incision in the left groin was partially closed (deep levels) to cover the PTFE graft, and the superficial layers of the left groin were packed open with dry gauze. At this point, the left leg was noted to be markedly swollen, though the left pedal pulses were still palpable. A left below-knee, two-incision, four-compartment fasciotomy was then rapidly performed by the attending surgeon and a second year fellow. The patient was transported to the intensive care unit with a systolic blood pressure of 142 mm Hg and a pulse of 160 beats/min after receiving 16 units of packed red cells, 1 unit of fresh frozen plasma, and 2 platelet packs (operation performed prior to massive transfusion protocols!).

TABLE 1
Description of the AAST renal injury grading.

If the injury is contained within Gerota's fascia, the tamponade effect and conservative management may include the placement of a JJ stent with a urinary catheter; securing a low‐pressure drainage can lead to a full renal reconstitution after as little as 6 weeks.

Operative management is commenced by visualizing the kidneys in Gerota's fascia (without opening the fascia); after performing a right or left visceral rotation as required, and if no expanding or pulsatile hematoma is present, with no visible urine leakage, then the kidney may be managed conservatively (this applies in the civilian sector to both penetrating and blunt injury). If there is a pedicle injury or active bleeding, a possible urinoma noted by expanding hematoma or visible urine leakage, around or engulfing the kidney inside Gerota's fascia, then the Gerota's fascia is opened and the kidney lifted out of the retroperitoneum from lateral to medial, with placement of noncrushing vascular clamps across the hilum (see Figure 2). This is the preferred trauma technique, especially if the patient is unstable, over the traditional approach of first dissecting out the vessels and then opening Gerota's fascia. The latter technique may be considered where there are no other intra‐abdominal injuries, the patient is stable, and there is only isolated renal trauma requiring exploration. In this scenario, the operative repair of the kidney has a much higher success rate. Access to the vascular pedicle may also be effected through the omental bursa.

FIGURE 2
Lateral approach to kidney during nephrectomy for trauma: Spleen, colon, and kidney mobilized to the midline from lateral. (illustration by Jennanice Kershaw).

Most often, renal repair is not possible in the unstable patient and nephrectomy is the procedure of choice, provided the presence of the contralateral kidney is confirmed either by palpation or previously visualized on ultrasound (ideally with Doppler flow checks) preoperatively as the normal size for age. The nephrectomy is performed with ligation of the artery, vein, and ureter to prevent urine reflux. If other injuries or physiological instabilities necessitate damage control surgery, temporary abdominal closure with either negative pressure wound closure or a Bogota bag is advised.

For the patient with no other injury indicating the need for surgery and a kidney injury identified on imaging, the preferred approach is nonoperative observation following the guidelines in Box 1.

### Survey of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in trauma patients: current prescribing practices and concordance with clinical practice guidelines [^114BeiLk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Agreement across clinical practice guidelines and surgical specialties is needed to standardize VTE chemoprophylaxis in trauma patients. Despite clear guideline recommendations, disagreement among trauma and consulting providers regarding the risk of bleeding versus the risk of thrombosis can lead to deviation from practice guidelines or delays in care. In addition, while the WTA and AAST/American College of Surgeons (ACS)-Committee on Trauma (COT) guidelines share similar recommendations, they are not identical and, due to a lack of robust evidence, each set of guidelines does not address all aspects of VTE prevention, such as timing of initiation in high-risk patient populations, specifics on how and when to monitor LMWH, and recommendations for selection of agent and duration of VTE chemoprophylaxis postdischarge. Therefore, despite a large amount of cohort data describing VTE practice innovations and outcomes, there remains a paucity of high-quality data to drive standard practices for all aspects of VTE prevention. Recommendations for VTE chemoprophylaxis span multiple specialties (neurosurgery, orthopedics, ACS) and efforts need to be focused on aligning practice recommendations among surgical specialties. To promote this goal, a National Institutes of Health sponsored conference titled '2022 Consensus Conference to Implement Optimal VTE Prophylaxis in Trauma' was held in May 2022 with the initial aim of bringing together a multidisciplinary cohort of trauma experts to review the current state of the science, identify gaps in the literature, and prioritize a future research agenda.

Limitations for this study include decreased generalizability of results due to the low response rate and high percentage of respondents at level 1 and academic institutions. Additionally, display logic decreased the response rates for some items. Despite these limitations, respondents were widely distributed geographically which supports the conclusion that broad variability exists and does not change the interpretation of findings. Survey questions asked participants to describe 'standard' practices for patients; therefore, the results do not represent patient-specific recommendations. In addition, the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol for inpatient VTE prophylaxis was released during the survey time period with the majority of responses collected prior to the publication of the AAST/ACS-COT recommendations. Therefore, practice changes as a result of the AAST/ACS-COT clinical protocol are not reflected in this study. Finally, providers may have different definitions for 'low'-risk or 'high'-risk TBI regarding the timing of initiation in these populations.

Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction — anticoagulant therapy after iliac vein stent placement is recommended for at least several months in most patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/post‑thrombotic syndrome (PTS) but may not be needed for most with nonthrombotic disease (Level of Evidence D, Strength of Recommendation Moderate). Decisions on post‑stent anticoagulation should be individualized, and patients with a poor anatomic result, ongoing risk factors for DVT recurrence, or unprovoked DVT should continue anticoagulation; patients being treated for anatomically extensive venous obstruction may benefit from more aggressive antithrombotic therapy, especially during the early postoperative period, based on observational patency data suggesting higher risk of patency loss in those with prior venous thrombosis.

Varicose veins — intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) role and selective use: Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) has been used successfully to evaluate iliac vein compression or obstruction and to monitor patients after venous stenting. For patients with varicose veins, IVUS should be used selectively in those with suspected or confirmed iliac vein obstruction. IVUS is important in assessing the morphology of the vessel wall, identifying lesions such as trabeculations, fibrotic valves, mural thickness, and external compression that are not seen with conventional contrast venography, and it provides measurements in assessing the degree of stenosis. In addition, IVUS confirms the position of the stent in the venous segment and the resolution of the stenosis.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^112u8MvD]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Haemodynamically stable patients, or those who can be stabilised during initial resuscitation, with an unidentified bleeding source, but not in need of immediate bleeding control, should undergo further investigation to determine the source of bleeding. During the primary survey, aside from monitoring vital signs, imaging studies (ultrasonography and CT) and laboratory blood tests (blood gas and coagulation status) are recommended.

In recent years, the accessibility of CT scanners has increased dramatically, replacing the need for conventional radiographic imaging. The diagnostic accuracy, safety and effectiveness of these immediate measures are dependent on pre-hospital treatment by trained and experienced emergency personnel and short transportation times. The proximity of the CT scanner to the resuscitation room in the emergency department has been shown to have a significant positive effect on the probability of survival for the severely injured patient. The trauma workflow, comprising immediate CT diagnosis and rapid bleeding control without patient transfer, as realised in the hybrid emergency room, may improve survival in severe trauma. If a CT scanner is not available in the emergency department, the clinician must evaluate the potential risks and benefits of patient transfer to a CT room, assuring continuous monitoring and resuscitation. In a well-structured environment and by a well-organised trauma team, CT seems to be safe and justified even in severely injured haemodynamically unstable patients.

In a retrospective study between 2016 and 2019, 2694 consecutive patients were admitted to a level I trauma centre and a strict emergency room algorithm followed. Injuries were missed in seven patients (0.26%; one epidural bleeding and six abdominal hollow organ injuries; two died), which highlights the need for continuous clinical and instrument-based examinations after completion of the tertiary survey.

Catheter angiography should be considered in patients with blunt pelvic trauma found to have active arterial extravasation, regardless of bleed size or patient clinical or laboratory values, while contrast extravasation on CT, high volume pRBC transfusions and ISS ≥ 16 can assist in identifying pelvic fracture patients for angiography with more precision.

A retrospective analysis and systematic review of epidemiology, radiologic examinations, patterns of injuries, therapeutic measures, clinical courses and outcomes showed that visceral perfusion should be monitored clinically and radiologically and follow-up via magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography angiography performed in order to rule out vascular complications after traumatic dissection of celiac artery.

### High mortality and venous thromboembolism risk following major penetrating abdominal venous injuries [^116QLVbi]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Penetrating injuries to the inferior vena cava and/or iliac veins are a source of hemorrhage but may also predispose patients to venous thromboembolism (VTE). We sought to determine the relationship between iliocaval injury, VTE and mortality.

Methods

The National Trauma Data Bank was queried for penetrating abdominal trauma from 2015–2017. Univariate analyses compared baseline characteristics and outcomes based on presence of iliocaval injury. Multivariable analyses determined the effect of iliocaval injury on VTE and mortality.

Results

Of 9,974 patients with penetrating abdominal trauma, 329 had iliocaval injury (3.3%). Iliocaval injury patients were more likely to have a firearm mechanism (83% vs. 43%, P < 0.001), concurrent head (P = 0.036), spinal cord (P < 0.001), and pelvic injuries (P < 0.001), and higher total injury severity score (median 20 vs. 8.0, P < 0.001). They were more likely to undergo 24-hr hemorrhage control surgery (69% vs. 17%, P < 0.001), but less likely to receive VTE chemoprophylaxis during admission (64% vs. 68%, P = 0.04). Of patients undergoing iliocaval surgery, 64% underwent repair, 26% ligation, and 10% unknown. Iliocaval injury patients had higher rates of VTE (12% vs. 2%), 24-hr mortality (23% vs. 2.0%) and in-hospital mortality (33% vs. 3.4%) (P < 0.001 for all). VTE rates were similar following repair (14%) and ligation (17%). Iliocaval injury patients also had higher rates of cardiac complications (10.3% vs. 1.4%), acute kidney injury (8.2% vs. 1.3%), extremity compartment syndrome (4.0 vs. 0.2%), and unplanned return to OR (7.9% vs. 2.5%) (P < 0.001 for all). In multivariable analyses, iliocaval injury was independently associated with risk of VTE (OR 2.12; 95% CI, 1.29–3.48; P = 0.003), and in-hospital mortality (OR = 9.61; 95% CI, 4.96–18.64; P < 0.001).

Conclusion

Iliocaval injuries occur in < 5% of penetrating abdominal trauma but are associated with more severe injury patterns and high mortality rates. Regardless of repair type, survivors should be considered high risk for developing VTE.

AAOS prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma — patient demographics and external risk factors are addressed as follows: While there is excellent evidence that patient demographics affect other measurable peri and post-operative outcomes, there is no evidence that it specifically affects their risk of surgical site infection in major extremity trauma. Implementation of this Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome (PICO) is quite feasible; however, patients should be counseled that this recommendation specifically addresses surgical site infection alone and does not address other outcome measures. There is minimal evidence to better inform surgeons regarding the impact of external risk factors for surgical site infection, and many studies were specific to certain fracture types and therefore could not be generalized to other types of fracture; future trauma registries may be able to address these issues more definitively if they include these particular types of external factors in their data sets.

2. The American College of Surgeons verifies trauma centers, and the clinical care rendered at level I and level II centers is expected to be equivalent. 3 Previous authors have demonstrated better survival and functional outcomes in patients with specific high mortality injuries at level I vs level II trauma centers.

4 However, a 2017 analysis found no difference in mortality among patients with penetrating trauma presenting to level I vs level II centers.
5. Owing to the increased number of surgical personnel, clinical volume, and resources at level I trauma centers, 3 we hypothesized that patients with torso stab wounds presenting to level I centers would have a shorter time to surgical intervention and a lower mortality, compared with level II centers. The research protocol was approved by the University of California, Irvine Human Research Protections, Regulatory Compliance institutional review board committee, and the Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried for patients 18 years or older admitted to the American College of Surgeons–verified level I or II centers after torso stab wounds. No informed consent was required because data were deidentified and available in the registry.

Patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale grade more than 1 of the head, neck, or extremities were excluded to select for patients with isolated torso injuries. Analysis was conducted from January 2010 to January 2016. Covariates with P <. 20 on univariable analysis were selected for entry in a multivariable logistic regression model to report the adjusted risk of mortality. All P values were 2-sided, with statistical significance level of P <.
05. Of 17 245 patients with torso stab wounds, 12 628 were treated at level I centers and 4618 were treated at level II centers. Both groups had a similar Injury Severity Score. Level I centers had a higher rate of laparotomy with shorter time to laparotomy and a higher rate of thoracotomy with no difference in time to thoracotomy. Patients with stab wounds at level I centers treated with thoracotomy and SNOM had a lower rate of mortality, compared with level II centers. Adjusting for covariates, patients treated at level I centers had a decreased risk of mortality compared with similar patients at level II centers. Patients undergoing thoracotomy or SNOM at level I centers had a decreased risk of mortality as well. Patients with stab wounds requiring thoracotomy had a nearly 50% lower risk of mortality when treated at level I centers vs those admitted to level II centers. Those with SNOM had a more than 30% lower risk of mortality compared with patients at level II centers.

Research Question 2: What is the optimal timing and type of anti-thrombotic prophylaxis for patients with splenic trauma treated with NOM? (High priority).

Statements. In the absence of contraindications related to associated injuries or conditions, such as intracranial hemorrhage, hemorrhagic diathesis, or patients under anticoagulation therapy, the best available evidence supports that deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis can safely be initiated within 48–72 h of admission for blunt splenic trauma, regardless of injury grade, without concern for exacerbation of bleeding, or failure of NOM [Quality of Evidence: Moderate]. Occurrence rates of thrombocytosis in patients after SAE seem comparable to patients who undergo splenectomy, in contrast with average platelet values in those managed with observation alone. So, SAE may be an independent risk factor for thrombotic events in WSES Class II–III (AAST Grades III–V) blunt splenic injuries [Quality of Evidence: Moderate]. Regarding the choice between low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) versus unfractionated heparin (UH), indirect evidence coming from trauma cases in general, and liver trauma specifically, suggests that LMWH is superior to UH for DVT and VTE prevention and may additionally reduce pulmonary embolism (PE) and mortality [Quality of Evidence: Low].

Recommendation. For patients with blunt splenic injuries treated with NOM with/without splenic artery angioembolization (SAE), in the absence of specific complications, the panel suggests that DVT and VTE prophylaxis with LMWH be started within 24 h from hospital admission for patients with WSES Class I (AAST Grades I–II) and within 48–72 h for those with WSES Class II–III (AAST Grades III–V) splenic injuries [Strength of Recommendation: Conditional recommendation, based on Moderate Quality of Evidence, Agreement 91.3%].

Trauma patients are at high risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE), and, without anti-thrombotic prophylaxis, more than 50% of patients may experience thrombotic complications. Thromboelastographic studies have identified a transition from trauma-induced coagulopathy to a hypercoagulable state at 48 h among patients with blunt solid organ injury, suggesting that 48 h might provide the optimal balance of minimizing the risk of both bleeding and VTE. Although DVT and VTE are not life-threatening complications, their association with pulmonary embolism (PE) carries potential morbidity and mortality. After major trauma, the reported mortality rate as a result of PE ranges from 0.4 to 50%.

Recommendation: There is not enough evidence to recommend specific hemodynamic monitoring in patients with splenic injuries treated with NOM. The panel suggests that all patients treated with NOM for high-grade splenic injuries (WSES Classes II–III, AAST Grade ≥ III) might receive continuous hemodynamic monitoring of vital parameters (pulse pressure, cardiac frequency, and peripheral O₂ saturation) and frequent serum hemoglobin and hematocrit levels evaluation (every 8 h) [Strength of Recommendation: Conditional recommendation, based on Very low quality of evidence, Agreement 93.5%]. In patients with low-grade splenic injuries and stable hemodynamic status (WSES Class I, AAST Grades I–II) treated with NOM, the panel suggests close medical and nursing monitoring with evaluations of hemoglobin and hematocrit levels every 12–24 h if no complication occurs [Strength of Recommendation: Conditional recommendation, based on Very low quality of evidence, Agreement 91.3%].

There are no studies available in the literature focusing on the best hemodynamic monitoring technique to be adopted in patients with splenic injuries treated with NOM; all the available evidence is derived from the description of NOM protocols in studies designed for other purposes; therefore, the quality of the evidence available is overall poor. Most patients with minor injuries (AAST Grade I or II) are admitted to the ward without continuous monitoring. On the other hand, subjects with an injury Grade of III or more receive continuous surveillance of vital signs through continuous monitoring in HDU or ICU.

A survey promoted by the AAST in 2004 showed that there were protocols for NOM of splenic injuries only in 30% of the respondent centers; all the patients with an AAST Grade III or higher splenic injury underwent continuous monitoring. Brillantino et al. in a retrospective study of 87 patients treated with NOM for splenic injuries, described their NOM protocol: each patient was evaluated with repeated arterial gas analysis every 12 h and complete blood cell count every 6 h until stability was reached. There was no mention of any hemodynamic monitoring and the admission to ICU. Teichman et al. described their protocol in a retrospective study including 107 patients: patients with low-grade injuries were on bed rest until two successive serum hemoglobin levels took every 12 h were within 10% of each other. There was no mention of other hemodynamic monitoring. Patients with high-grade injuries were admitted to the ICU until three successive hemoglobin levels, taken every 8 h after the first, were within 10% of each other.

### Society of Interventional Radiology clinical practice guideline for inferior vena cava filters in the treatment of patients with venous thromboembolic disease: developed in collaboration with the American college of cardiology, American College of Chest Physicians, American college of surgeons committee on trauma, American Heart Association, Society for Vascular Surgery, and Society for Vascular Medicine [^111hW18f]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter placement techniques — evidence summary and committee guidance: A low-quality observational study comparing fluoroscopic guidance with bedside intravascular ultrasound (US) guidance reported 117 intravascular US–placed filters versus 571 fluoroscopically placed filters, with procedural-related complications occurring more frequently with intravascular US (4.3% vs 0.4%, respectively; P = 0.006) and no difference in indwelling complications (IVC thrombosis, DVT, or PE). Given insufficient evidence, the committee cannot recommend one placement method over another, and regardless of technique, the method employed should clearly demonstrate vena caval anatomy and diameter(s), the location of the renal and iliac veins, and the presence or absence of thrombus in the vena cava at or near the planned implantation site. Evidence is also insufficient to guide choice of venous access (jugular versus femoral or other), which is likely dependent on operator experience and expertise and patient-specific characteristics, including the site and extent of venous thrombosis and previous operations or instrumentation. The panel judged that the benefits and harms of each technique are closely balanced; that the outcomes are meaningful with probably no important uncertainty in how people value them; that no cost-effectiveness studies were identified but there are moderate costs associated with increased resource utilization; and that any insertion method is acceptable and probably feasible to implement.

Management of pelvic fractures with associated hemorrhage — hemodynamically unstable patients should have a pelvic binder or circumferential sheet used to temporarily stabilize their pelvis, early activation of a massive transfusion protocol should be strongly considered, and when angiography is unavailable, preperitoneal packing and/or external fixation of the pelvis should be performed with early transfer to a designated trauma center recommended if this step is not possible; selective embolization is preferred over nonselective embolization, when possible, due to a lower risk of complications. Patients with pelvic fractures are at high risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Early initiation of pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis is recommended.

American Urological Association — urethral trauma evaluation and management — clinicians should perform retrograde urethrography in patients with blood at the urethral meatus after pelvic trauma (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Clinicians should establish prompt urinary drainage in patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C), and clinicians should perform percutaneous or open suprapubic tube placement as preferred initial management for most pelvic fracture urethral injury (PFUI) cases (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons may place suprapubic tubes (SPTs) in patients undergoing open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) for pelvic fracture (Expert Opinion). Clinicians may perform primary realignment (PR) in hemodynamically stable patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Option; Evidence Strength: Grade C), and clinicians should not perform prolonged attempts at endoscopic realignment in patients with pelvic fracture associated urethral injury (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should monitor patients for complications (e.g., stricture formation, erectile dysfunction, incontinence) for at least one year following urethral injury (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons should perform prompt surgical repair in patients with uncomplicated penetrating trauma of the anterior urethra (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should establish prompt urinary drainage in patients with straddle injury to the anterior urethra (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C).

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^115njU55]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Society of Interventional Radiology — iliac vein stenting after thrombus debulking: If a flow-limiting obstructive lesion is identified in the iliac vein after thrombus debulking and there is a good inflow from the leg veins, stent placement is recommended to reduce symptom severity and the risk of rethrombosis (Level of Evidence C, Strength of Recommendation Moderate). This is based on published studies and clinical experience suggesting frequent rethrombosis when untreated iliac vein lesions remain after ETR and is supplemented by data from 1 small randomized trial that found stents to be beneficial; however, the exact morphologic lesion criteria and degree of flow limitation that predict future rethrombosis and residual symptoms are poorly defined, the risks and uncertainties of long-term stent implantation should be discussed with patients before the initiation of ETR, and operators should be aware that undersized stents may be more likely to migrate, especially with shorter lesions.

Vascular surgery — baseline risk of major bleeding: Evidence from randomized and observational studies indicates bleeding risk benchmarks, with "the pooled weighted risk of major bleeding in the control (no prophylaxis) groups" reported as "0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%)", and an observational series of "973 patients" undergoing complex major vascular procedures reporting an incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage of "1.8%", with "only 0.4% of patients experiencing severe bleeding postoperatively". Given uncertainty in this population, the guideline states "we use the baseline risk from studies of general and abdominal-pelvic surgery (1.2%)".
