## Question

How should a 25 year old with depression and anxiety on bupropion 150mg daily, aripiprazole 5mg daily, and clonazepam 2mg BID, who also had ADHD on dexmethylphenidate 2.5mg BID, with uncontrolled anxiety and panic attacks, be managed?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about management of a 25-year-old with depression, generalized anxiety, ADHD, and uncontrolled panic attacks who is currently taking bupropion 150 mg daily, aripiprazole 5 mg daily, clonazepam 2 mg twice daily, and dexmethylphenidate 2.5 mg twice daily. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about safety and immediate risks from the current regimen, especially the high-dose benzodiazepine exposure. Then, I should confirm first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder and anxious depression and plan a careful SSRI/SNRI initiation. Next, I need to check how to taper the benzodiazepine safely while managing breakthrough panic, reconsider the role of bupropion and stimulants, and verify whether aripiprazole dose optimization is indicated. After that, I should review augmentation options if the first-line plan is inadequate, integrate CBT and behavioral strategies, and set monitoring parameters and contingencies with a realistic timeline supported by guidelines and trials.

> Let me first confirm the key problems in the current regimen. Clonazepam 4 mg/day suggests tolerance and dependence risk, which guidelines caution against for chronic management of panic disorder; benzodiazepines are generally not recommended as maintenance and, if used at all, are short-term bridges due to dependence and withdrawal concerns [^114iZuMB] [^11347y8h]. I should also verify that bupropion can aggravate anxiety and panic; the FDA labeling highlights anxiety, agitation, and panic attacks among emergent adverse effects, especially around dose changes, which fits the clinical picture of uncontrolled panic attacks here [^112KdZwp] [^1142YpEj]. Hold on, I need to ensure first-line therapy for panic disorder was actually attempted; SSRIs and SNRIs are recommended as first-line treatments across guidelines, and this patient is not yet on such therapy, which is a notable gap [^112hvzWB] [^1113KYCX] [^115MP9y2].

> Next, I should set immediate priorities anchored in safety. Do not abruptly stop clonazepam because of seizure and severe withdrawal risk; instead, plan a slow, structured taper with close clinical monitoring and patient education about withdrawal symptoms and rebound anxiety, consistent with guideline cautions and benzodiazepine labeling that highlights tapering difficulty, particularly at higher chronic doses [^114iZuMB] [^116QpDMY]. Priority 2: Initiate Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence Evidence. Wait, let me correct myself — what I meant is initiate evidence-based first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with an SSRI or SNRI while the taper proceeds, recognizing that the antidepressant will take several weeks to confer anti-panic efficacy, so expectations must be set and adjunctive non-benzodiazepine coping strategies emphasized [^112hvzWB] [^115MP9y2] [^1113KYCX].

> I will now implement first-line pharmacotherapy for panic disorder using an SSRI with regulatory or guideline support and start low to reduce activation. Sertraline or paroxetine are appropriate choices; for example, sertraline 25 mg daily for one week, then 50 mg daily, with subsequent titration based on response and tolerability, is consistent with guideline-endorsed first-line options for panic disorder, and fluoxetine also has FDA evidence for panic disorder with typical titration from 10 mg to 20–60 mg/day providing additional reassurance that SSRIs are efficacious in this indication [^112hvzWB] [^114PRVxT]. Hold on, I should verify the SNRI option if needed; venlafaxine XR is effective for panic disorder and comparable to paroxetine in head-to-head fixed-dose trials, but SSRIs are generally ranked slightly higher than SNRIs for remission and tolerability and are the preferred starting point, so I will reserve venlafaxine XR if the SSRI is not tolerated or ineffective [^111MTBBC] [^115MP9y2].

> Now, I need to detail a benzodiazepine taper that is slow enough to mitigate withdrawal while the SSRI takes effect. Let me consider a reduction by about 0.5 mg/day every one to two weeks as a starting framework, with weekly check-ins early on and readiness to pause if significant withdrawal emerges; this aligns with the principle to taper gradually and with product labeling data noting the challenges of long-term, high-dose benzodiazepine discontinuation in panic disorder populations [^114iZuMB] [^116QpDMY]. I should double-check the bridge concept: while historical reviews describe short-term benzodiazepine use as a bridge during early SSRI treatment, the goal here is a net downward taper given the already high daily dose and dependence risk, supplemented by CBT-based panic coping skills rather than substituting with more benzodiazepine exposure [^114ijhDE] [^11347y8h].

> Let me consider bupropion next, because I need to ensure we are not perpetuating anxiety. There is modest but consistent evidence that SSRIs outperform bupropion in anxious depression by about 6% absolute response difference, and FDA labeling for bupropion underscores anxiety and panic as adverse effects to monitor; therefore, after the SSRI reaches a therapeutic and tolerable dose over 4–6 weeks, I would begin a short taper off bupropion to remove a potential anxiogenic driver [^114UWDVJ] [^112KdZwp] [^1142YpEj]. Hold on, I should verify that we are not destabilizing mood during the transition; maintaining aripiprazole during the early SSRI phase can help buffer mood while bupropion is tapered, pending later reassessment of augmentation needs [^111EzeEL].

> I should review the stimulant exposure now, because stimulants can worsen physiological arousal and may exacerbate panic symptoms in vulnerable patients. Let me be cautious and reduce dexmethylphenidate to a single low morning dose while tracking panic frequency and ADHD function, and consider non-stimulant alternatives such as atomoxetine or guanfacine if panic symptoms improve with dose reduction; this is consistent with the overarching strategy of prioritizing anxiety stabilization with first-line agents before escalating sympathomimetic treatments, while recognizing the core first-line status of SSRIs/SNRIs for anxiety disorders [^1113KYCX] [^112hvzWB]. I should confirm that any stimulant adjustment is coordinated with behavioral ADHD supports to mitigate functional decline during this transition, pending longer-term ADHD optimization once panic is controlled [^1113KYCX].

> Wait, I should also verify whether the current aripiprazole dose is optimal as augmentation for depression and anxiety during this transition. A dose of 5 mg daily is at the lower bound of the augmentation range; evidence from augmentation studies and primary care guidance supports aripiprazole as an option for treatment-resistant depression, with typical effective ranges from 5 to 15 mg/day and signal for improved outcomes when titrating nonresponders from 2 to 5 mg/day, so after SSRI stabilization around weeks 6–8, I would consider increasing aripiprazole to 10 mg daily if residual depressive or anxiety symptoms remain and if tolerability allows [^111EzeEL] [^116hpqer] [^112zPuEw]. I need to check for akathisia and metabolic effects at each visit, given known risks with second-generation antipsychotic augmentation [^111EzeEL].

> But wait, what if the panic attacks persist despite an adequate SSRI trial at a therapeutic dose for 8–12 weeks? Next, I should review augmentation choices with some evidence in anxious depression or anxiety disorders. Mirtazapine added to an SSRI or SNRI shows greater benefit in patients with severe comorbid generalized anxiety and may improve both anxiety and depressive symptoms; thus, adding mirtazapine 15–30 mg at night could be reasonable if insomnia or SSRI sexual dysfunction are present, with the caveat that the signal is stronger when baseline anxiety is high and weaker otherwise [^116WXiXw] [^115f9K6T]. Alternatively, buspirone for generalized anxiety can be considered as an adjunct with a favorable dependence profile compared with benzodiazepines, and switching to or adding an SNRI such as venlafaxine XR is guideline-consistent if SSRIs are not tolerated or ineffective, though SSRIs are generally preferred first for panic disorder remission rates [^115VwRSw] [^115GSJay] [^115MP9y2].

> I need to ensure non-pharmacological therapy proceeds in parallel, not as an afterthought. Panic-focused CBT with interoceptive exposure and cognitive restructuring is first-line and as effective as medication for long-term outcomes; beginning CBT now will also provide skills to weather early SSRI activation and benzodiazepine taper discomfort, with combined therapy often outperforming monotherapy for sustained remission [^114iZuMB] [^1113KYCX]. Let me double-check that adjunctive skills like diaphragmatic breathing, paced breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation are taught early, and that sleep hygiene is reinforced to reduce nocturnal arousal that can trigger nighttime panic [^114iZuMB].

> Next, I should set a monitoring and safety protocol that anticipates predictable inflection points. Weekly follow-up for the first month during SSRI initiation and benzodiazepine dose reductions allows for withdrawal checks, panic diary review, vitals (heart rate, blood pressure), weight if aripiprazole is up-titrated, and regular suicidality assessment given antidepressant class warnings about emergent agitation and suicidal thoughts early in treatment and during dose changes; patients and families should be instructed to report abrupt worsening immediately [^112KdZwp]. For non-benzodiazepine rescue in distressing surges, I can consider short-term options like propranolol for somatic hyperarousal with the understanding that evidence for panic disorder is mixed and not equivalent to SSRIs or benzodiazepines, so this should be positioned as a limited symptomatic aid rather than core therapy during the taper window [^113B4oBR].

> Let me lay out a realistic timeline so expectations are clear and measurable. In week 1, start sertraline 25 mg daily while reducing dexmethylphenidate to a single low morning dose and making the first clonazepam decrement to 3 mg/day divided, with a panic diary and CBT intake scheduled; in week 2, increase sertraline to 50 mg daily if tolerated and reassess withdrawal and panic frequency; by week 4, consider sertraline 100 mg daily if needed and begin a brief bupropion taper if the SSRI is tolerated; at week 6, evaluate early response and, if residual depressive/anxiety symptoms persist, consider aripiprazole up-titration to 10 mg; by week 8, complete bupropion discontinuation and continue clonazepam taper toward 1 mg/day divided; by week 12, aim for clonazepam discontinuation or the lowest feasible maintenance while reassessing panic control and readiness for further SSRI titration or augmentation based on response, acknowledging that anti-panic benefits can take several weeks to consolidate [^113B4oBR] [^112hvzWB] [^116QpDMY]. I should confirm that adjustments are individualized; any sign of severe withdrawal or activation warrants slowing the taper or transient dose adjustments with shared decision-making [^114iZuMB].

> Finally, I will prepare contingencies. If severe benzodiazepine withdrawal emerges, I should slow the taper to 10–25% decrements every 2–3 weeks, pause as needed, and intensify CBT-based coping; if pharmacologic support is required, I would avoid increasing benzodiazepines long term and instead consider evidence-aligned, non-addictive options such as switching or augmenting to agents with anxiolytic efficacy like SNRIs or, when SSRIs are unsuitable, pregabalin per BAP guidance, while keeping propranolol as a short-term somatic adjunct with transparent discussion of its limits in panic disorder [^115GSJay] [^117RYKny] [^113B4oBR]. If SSRI activation occurs early, I should reduce the SSRI dose temporarily and consider a switch to a more tolerable SSRI such as escitalopram once stabilized, while reassuring the patient about the transient nature of activation and maintaining close follow-up [^113R5pVF] [^1113KYCX]. If panic worsens transiently during the taper before the SSRI takes full effect, I need to reinforce interoceptive exposure practice, safety planning, and limited-scope symptomatic aids rather than reverting to chronic high-dose benzodiazepines, in line with long-term dependence risk and guideline recommendations [^114iZuMB] [^11347y8h].

---

This patient has **uncontrolled anxiety and panic attacks** despite bupropion, aripiprazole, clonazepam, and dexmethylphenidate. The regimen is suboptimal because bupropion [^112KdZwp] and stimulants can worsen anxiety, and chronic high-dose benzodiazepines carry risks of dependence and cognitive impairment [^114iZuMB] [^11347y8h]. The most evidence-based next step is to initiate an **SSRI or SNRI** (e.g. sertraline, escitalopram, or venlafaxine XR) as first-line therapy for anxiety and panic [^1113KYCX] [^115MP9y2] while **tapering clonazepam** [^112hvzWB] [^114iZuMB]. Consider switching bupropion [^112KdZwp] to an SSRI/SNRI if anxiety persists, and reserve stimulants only if ADHD symptoms remain impairing after anxiety control. Add **CBT** and monitor for withdrawal, sedation, and serotonin syndrome.

## Evaluation of current pharmacotherapy

### Bupropion

- **Mechanism of action**: Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI).

- **Clinical considerations**: Bupropion can exacerbate anxiety and panic symptoms, particularly in patients with comorbid anxiety disorders [^112KdZwp].

- **Evidence**: Meta-analyses indicate bupropion is less effective than SSRIs for anxious depression and may worsen anxiety symptoms [^114UWDVJ] [^112KdZwp].

---

### Aripiprazole

- **Mechanism of action**: Partial agonist at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors; antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors.

- **Clinical considerations**: Aripiprazole is approved for adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) [^112zPuEw] but has limited evidence for primary anxiety disorders.

- **Evidence**: Open-label studies suggest potential benefit in treatment-resistant anxiety, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence is limited [^11617zhz].

---

### Clonazepam

- **Mechanism of action**: Benzodiazepine; enhances GABAergic neurotransmission.

- **Clinical considerations**: Effective short-term for anxiety and panic, but long-term use risks dependence, tolerance, cognitive impairment, and withdrawal [^11347y8h].

- **Evidence**: Guidelines recommend benzodiazepines only for short-term crisis management due to dependence and tolerance risks [^114iZuMB].

---

### Dexmethylphenidate

Dexmethylphenidate is a CNS stimulant that increases dopamine and norepinephrine. In patients with comorbid anxiety disorders, **stimulants can exacerbate anxiety** and panic symptoms; when anxiety is uncontrolled, they are generally contraindicated. Accordingly, use in this context warrants caution.

---

## Recommended pharmacological adjustments

---

### Discontinuation or tapering of anxiogenic medications

Bupropion should be gradually **tapered and discontinued** due to its potential to exacerbate anxiety and panic symptoms [^112KdZwp]. Dexmethylphenidate should likewise be **tapered and discontinued** or significantly reduced because stimulants can worsen anxiety and panic symptoms.

---

### Initiation of first-line pharmacotherapy for anxiety and panic disorders

Start an **SSRI or SNRI** (e.g. sertraline, escitalopram, or venlafaxine XR) as first-line therapy for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and panic disorder [^1113KYCX] [^114PRVxT] [^112hvzWB] [^115MP9y2]. Use a **start-low, go-slow dosing strategy** to minimize initial anxiety exacerbation [^114iZuMB].

---

### Benzodiazepine management

Clonazepam should be **gradually tapered** to minimize risks of dependence, tolerance, and cognitive impairment. Short-term use may be considered during SSRI/SNRI initiation to manage initial anxiety exacerbation, but long-term use should be avoided [^114iZuMB] [^11347y8h].

---

### Adjunctive pharmacotherapy

Consider **Buspirone** for generalized anxiety disorder, particularly if benzodiazepines are being tapered, and **Pregabalin** if SSRIs/SNRIs are insufficient or contraindicated [^115VwRSw] [^117RYKny].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

---

### Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)

CBT is **strongly recommended** for anxiety and panic disorders, particularly with exposure techniques, and **CBT for ADHD** should be considered for ADHD symptoms — especially if stimulants are discontinued.

---

### Mindfulness-based interventions

Consider **Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)** to reduce anxiety and improve emotion regulation.

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Regular exercise, good sleep hygiene, and stress-management techniques are **recommended** to reduce anxiety symptoms.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular **monitoring and follow-up** are essential to assess treatment response, adverse effects, and adherence. Schedule follow-up visits to track anxiety, depression, and ADHD symptoms; monitor closely for side effects during medication adjustments; and assess adherence to both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions.

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Current medication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Bupropion | Gradually taper and discontinue |
| Aripiprazole | - Continue if beneficial for depression <br/> - Limited evidence for anxiety |
| Clonazepam | - Gradually taper <br/> - Short-term use only |
| Dexmethylphenidate | Gradually taper and discontinue or reduce dose significantly |
| SSRI/SNRI | Initiate as first-line treatment for anxiety and panic disorders |
| Buspirone/Pregabalin | Consider as adjunctive therapy if needed |
| CBT | Strongly recommended |
| Mindfulness/Lifestyle | Recommended |

---

The current pharmacotherapy regimen is suboptimal for managing uncontrolled anxiety and panic attacks. Recommended steps include **tapering anxiogenic medications**, initiating a first-line SSRI or SNRI [^115MP9y2], and incorporating non-pharmacological interventions such as CBT and mindfulness-based strategies. Regular monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure optimal treatment outcomes.

### Efficacy of bupropion and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of major depressive disorder with high levels of anxiety (anxious depression): A pooled analysis of 10 studies [^114UWDVJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this work was to compare the efficacy of the norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor bupropion with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of major depressive disorder with high levels of anxiety, termed anxious depression.

Ten double-blind, randomized studies conducted from 1991 through 2006 were combined (N = 2122). Anxious depression was defined as a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D-17) anxiety-somatization factor score of 7 or more.

Among patients with anxious depression (N = 1275), response rates were greater following SSRI treatment compared to bupropion treatment according to the HAM-D-17 (65.4% vs. 59.4%, p = .03) and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (61.5% vs. 54.5%, p = .03). Additionally, there was a greater reduction in HAM-D-17 mean ± SD scores (-14.1 ± 7.6 vs. -13.2 ± 7.9, p = .03) and a trend toward statistical significance for a greater reduction in HAM-A mean ± SD scores (-10.5 ± 7.4 vs. -9.6 ± 7.6, p = .05) in favor of SSRI treatment among patients with anxious depression. No statistically significant difference in efficacy was observed between bupropion and the SSRIs among patients with moderate to low levels of anxiety.

There appears to be a modest advantage for the SSRIs compared to bupropion in the treatment of anxious depression, with a 6% difference in response rates. Using the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) statistic as one indicator of clinical significance, nearly 17 patients would need to be treated with an SSRI rather than with bupropion to obtain one additional responder.

### Optimizing pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder to achieve remission [^116gJXyY]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

More than half of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) exhibit chronic and persistent symptoms that may necessitate ongoing pharmacotherapy. Many of these patients also suffer from significant comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. There is a growing consensus among clinicians that the treatment goal for anxiety disorders should be remission. This includes minimizing anxiety and depression while resolving functional impairments.

Clinical management strategies for optimizing pharmacotherapy aimed at achieving remission in GAD focus on drug selection, dosing levels, and treatment duration. To optimize treatment for GAD with the goal of remission, it is advisable to choose an agent with proven effectiveness for GAD and its associated comorbidities, as well as a favorable side effect profile. Dosing and treatment duration should be sufficient, and considering adjunctive strategies for refractory patients may be warranted. This article discusses the optimization of pharmacotherapy with the aim of promoting remission in patients with GAD.

### The management of panic disorder [^114ijhDE]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

The evidence for benzodiazepines in panic disorder is compelling; along with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), they are a standard treatment for panic and other anxiety disorders. However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations. Extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Due to their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.

### Duloxetine in treatment of anxiety symptoms associated with depression [^116WLMDU]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) have symptoms of anxiety associated with their depression. Duloxetine, a potent and balanced dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is effective in the treatment of depression. We investigated its effects in treating the symptoms of anxiety in depressed patients. This investigation includes all the placebo-controlled studies of duloxetine in MDD but focuses on four trials where duloxetine was superior to placebo on the primary outcome measure of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD(17)) total score.

- **Study designs and methods**: Studies 1 and 2 included duloxetine at 60 mg/day (the recommended starting and therapeutic dose) and a placebo. Study 3 included duloxetine at 120 mg/day (administered as 60 mg twice daily), fluoxetine at 20 mg/day, and a placebo. Study 4 included duloxetine at 40 mg/day (administered as 20 mg twice daily), duloxetine at 80 mg/day (administered as 40 mg twice daily), paroxetine at 20 mg/day, and a placebo. Anxiety was assessed in all studies using the HAMD anxiety/somatization subfactor and the anxiety-psychic item (HAMD Item 10). Studies 3 and 4 also included the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA).

- **Results and findings**: Across the four studies, duloxetine at doses of ≥ 60 mg was compared with placebo on 10 outcomes and with either paroxetine or fluoxetine on 6 outcomes. In 8 comparisons, mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than placebo at the last study visit and/or across all study visits. In 3 comparisons, the mean improvement for duloxetine was significantly greater than paroxetine or fluoxetine. Duloxetine provided rapid and significant improvement in anxiety symptoms associated with depression.

### Prozac [^114PRVxT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Prozac in the treatment of panic disorder was demonstrated in two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter studies of adult outpatients who had a primary diagnosis of panic disorder (DSM-IV), with or without agoraphobia.

- **Study 1**: The study involved 180 randomized participants and was conducted over 12 weeks with a flexible-dose design. Prozac was initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week. Patients were subsequently dosed in the range of 20 to 60 mg/day based on clinical response and tolerability. A statistically significantly greater percentage of Prozac-treated patients were free from panic attacks at the endpoint compared to placebo-treated patients, with results showing 42% versus 28%, respectively.

- **Study 2**: This study enrolled 214 randomized participants and followed the same 12-week flexible-dose protocol as Study 1. Prozac was similarly initiated at 10 mg/day for the first week, with subsequent dosing adjustments between 20 to 60 mg/day guided by clinical response and tolerability. At the endpoint, a statistically significantly greater percentage of Prozac-treated patients were free from panic attacks compared to those receiving placebo, with results of 62% versus 44%, respectively.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^115yhizH]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Low credibility.

Combination interventions

With the exception of OFC, each treatment combination (i.e. two interventions/controls initiated simultaneously) had only been assessed in one study per combination, with wide-ranging effect sizes (ESs). We conclude that, given the methodological differences, no conclusions can presently be drawn about specific combinations from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD).

Secondary outcomes:

- **Subgroup analyses**: Additional analyses stratified between early-stage and substantive TRD criteria required for inclusion in each study are presented. For all treatments studied, effect size (ES) 95% confidence intervals (CIs) had large overlap when comparing studies defining TRD as 1 failed treatment (FT) and 2 FTs, suggesting treatment efficacy was not sensitive to TRD definition. The exception was buspirone, for which the ES and 95% CIs were considerably higher when TRD was defined as 2 FTs (1 FT = ES = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.61–1.07; 2 FTs = ES = 1.57, 95% CI: 1.14–2.02), although this consisted of only one small study.

Additional analyses stratifying treatment ESs by the duration of study treatment are presented. As previously mentioned, study durations were defined as 'short-term' (12 weeks). Perhaps surprisingly, subgroups of 'short-term' and 'adequate duration' studies did not result in consistent findings concerning treatment efficacy. Approximately half of the treatments studied in this subgroup analysis showed an effect size increase when focused on those studied at an 'adequate' duration, while half did not.

### The efficacy of nefazodone augmentation for treatment-resistant depression with anxiety symptoms or anxiety disorder [^114UtnKB]. Depression and Anxiety (2003). Low credibility.

Depression that fails to respond to multiple antidepressant trials, particularly when accompanied by anxiety, constitutes a difficult treatment challenge. Those with anxious depression may be less likely to respond to treatment than their cohorts without anxiety. Anxiety symptoms also predict a higher rate of suicide, particularly if the symptoms do not improve early in the course of treatment.

Eleven consenting outpatients with treatment-resistant depression and/or comorbid anxiety disorders were treated with nefazodone, which was slowly added to their ongoing treatment regimens. Doses were initiated at 50 mg a day and slowly increased by 50 mg increments until an optimum response was achieved. The Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI) Scale was employed to monitor the medication effects. In all 11 cases, nefazodone was efficacious and well tolerated in treating both depressive and anxiety components.

After nefazodone augmentation, the mean CGI score for combined depression and anxiety symptoms was (± sd) 1.52 (0.52) on a scale from 1 (very much better) to 7 (very much worse). Seven of the 11 cases achieved complete remission of depressive symptoms (χ² = 11.55, P < .005), and 9 of the 11 cases achieved complete remission of anxiety symptoms (χ² = 15.23, P < .0005). The mean effective dose for nefazodone (mean ± sd) was 200.0 (34.2) mg a day (range 50–300 mg a day). Nefazodone's unique pharmacologic profile may explain its unusual efficacy in these cases of treatment-resistant major depression.

### APA clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^113Lx4nn]. APA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for posttraumatic stress disorder, more specifically with respect to other medications, APA 2025 guidelines recommend that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for, or against the use of hypnotics (such as eszopiclone), MAOIs (such as brofaromine, phenelzine), norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (such as bupropion), serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors (such as nefazodone), ganaxolone, nepicastat, orvepitant, or augmentation with D-cycloserine or eszopiclone in patients with PTSD.

### Wellbutrin XL [^112KdZwp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: Instruct patients, their families, and/or their caregivers to be alert to the emergence of:
	- **Psychological symptoms**: anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity
	- **Movement disorders**: akathisia (psychomotor restlessness)
	- **Mood changes**: hypomania, mania
	- **Behavioral changes**: other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, suicidal ideation

	These symptoms are particularly important to monitor early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Advise families and caregivers to observe for these symptoms daily, as changes may occur abruptly. Symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, particularly if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. These symptoms may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior, indicating a need for very close monitoring and possible changes in medication.

- **Neuropsychiatric adverse events and suicide risk in smoking cessation treatment**: Although Wellbutrin XL is not indicated for smoking cessation treatment, it contains the same active ingredient as Zyban, which is approved for this use. Inform patients that some have experienced changes in mood and behavior such as:
	- **Mood changes**: depression, mania
	- **Psychotic symptoms**: psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions
	- **Aggressive and hostile behavior**: homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility
	- **Anxiety-related symptoms**: agitation, anxiety, panic
	- **Suicide-related symptoms**: suicidal ideation, suicide

	These changes have been reported when attempting to quit smoking.

Regarding the medical management for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to anticonvulsants, the BAP 2014 guidelines suggest offering pregabalin as an alternative initial treatment if SSRIs are deemed unsuitable. The guidelines recognize that higher daily doses of pregabalin may be associated with greater response rates.

### Efficacy of dose increase among nonresponders to low-dose aripiprazole augmentation in patients with inadequate response to antidepressant treatment: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial [^116hpqer]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The objective was to examine the efficacy of a dose increase of aripiprazole to 5 mg/d in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) who did not respond to 4 weeks of treatment with aripiprazole 2 mg/d in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parent study.

- **Method**: 221 subjects with Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition-diagnosed DSM-IV-TR MDD (mean ± SD age, 45 ± 11 years; 64% women) with inadequate antidepressant response were recruited from September 2008 to July 2009 and randomized to 60 days of double-blind augmentation with either aripiprazole or placebo in two 30-day phases. The study was performed across 8 academic hospital sites and 14 nonacademic (private clinic) sites throughout the United States. Randomization in a 2:3:3 ratio per sequential parallel comparison design was drug/drug (aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 1 and 5 mg/d in phase 2), placebo/placebo (placebo in both phases), and placebo/drug (placebo in phase 1 and aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 2). In phase 2, the efficacy of an aripiprazole dose increase to 5 mg/d in nonresponders to 2 mg/d was examined by assessing response rates (≥ 50% reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score [primary outcome measure]) and score changes in MADRS, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report, 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and patient-rated versions of the CGI-I and CGI-S scales.

- **Results**: Response rate for aripiprazole 2 mg/d in phase 1 was 18.5%.

- **Efficacy ratings for pharmacological agents used as maintenance therapy**: Importance of naturalistic and cohort studies. Evidence from RCTs is at the core of the recommendations in these guidelines. Nonetheless, RCTs are not the only source of clinically useful information, particularly when evaluating maintenance therapy. RCTs offer relatively limited follow-up time-frames while, for some patients, maintenance therapy may extend across decades. Furthermore, new medications are often assessed in studies with an enriched design (including only patients who have responded to the medication under study in the acute phase), thus limiting the generalizability of positive findings to patients who responded to the medication acutely.

Useful data can be obtained from large, often whole-population databases constructed from electronic medical records or electronic patient registries with large numbers of patients that would be difficult to obtain in RCTs. In some instances, they allow comparisons of multiple treatments. These large numbers make it possible to evaluate differences in rates of rare events such as less common side effects or suicide.

Patient cohorts followed in a specific setting provide another source of informative data. Their main advantage usually is the length of observation, in some instances reaching several decades. This comes at the cost of generalizability, in terms of both patient selection and non-random treatment allocation.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^114bPo8Z]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression being the largest cause of disability globally. Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together, and the patient burden and complexity increase when both are present. Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with a poorer chance of response to treatment, increased severity of depression, and an increased chance of suicide. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressant prescriptions increasing yearly, with 67.5 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience-based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and social anxiety disorder. Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions in relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis, while a small study has shown promising antidepressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder.

However, these trials did not examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.

There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines.

### Canadian network for mood and anxiety treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^116gW6b1]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Review general principles and assess medication status**: Examination of a patient presenting in a manic state should include an immediate assessment for risk of aggressive behavior, violence and safety threat to others, suicide risk, especially in those with mixed features, degree of insight, and the ability to adhere to treatment. Additionally, assess comorbidity, including substance use that may be aggravating or contributing to clinical presentation, and the availability of a psychosocial support network. A physical examination with laboratory investigations (described in Section 8) should be conducted but may be deferred for patients who are uncooperative. Results of the overall assessment should be used to establish the most appropriate treatment setting (e.g. ambulatory or inpatient).

- **Pharmacological treatment considerations**: Before initiating pharmacological treatment for a manic episode, it is imperative to rule out symptoms secondary to drugs of abuse, medications, other treatments, or a general medical or neurological condition, although symptomatic treatment may be applied on a short‐term basis. Steps should be taken to rule out any other factors that may be perpetuating symptoms, such as prescribed medication, illicit drug use or abuse, or an endocrine disorder. Any patients presenting with mania who have been taking antidepressants should have these medications discontinued. If there is a previous diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD), it is appropriate to immediately commence antimanic agents. If this is the first emergence of manic symptoms, clinicians are advised to confirm the diagnosis of BD by monitoring the patient.

- **Dsm‐5 diagnostic criteria**: Bipolar disorder encompasses a spectrum of diagnostic subgroups primarily divided according to the severity of mood elevation experienced during acute episodes. On this spectrum, BDI is placed at one pole due to the presence of threshold manic episodes in which features include inflated self‐esteem, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, psychomotor agitation, and risky behavior that leads to significant functional impairment. These may include psychotic features, and/or necessitate hospitalization. At the other end of the spectrum, cyclothymia is characterized by subthreshold presentation of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that, while chronic, do not meet diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode or manic/hypomanic episode. BDII sits between the two conditions with hypomanic episodes qualitatively like manic periods. Although distinct and observable, they are not of a sufficient duration or severity to cause significant functional impairment, hospitalization, or psychosis. Individuals with BDII also experience threshold depressive episodes.

	- DSM‐5 has replaced the BD not otherwise specified (NOS) category in DSM‐IV with two new categories: other specified bipolar and related disorder, and unspecified bipolar and related disorder. Additionally, DSM‐5 includes substance/medication‐induced bipolar and related disorder and bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. For a more detailed discussion of diagnostic categories, the reader is advised to consult DSM‐5 and recent Royal Australian guidelines.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). High credibility.

Panic disorder is characterized by unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. It is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its etiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reactions compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

- **Objectives**: To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews and contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

### Drug treatment for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia: systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^115MP9y2]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

For other antidepressants, SNRIs, when compared with placebo, were more efficacious in attaining remission, similar for dropout, and had significantly more associated adverse events. However, SNRIs were ranked lower than SSRIs for achieving remission and adverse events and might represent a second line treatment option for panic disorder. Tricyclic antidepressants were found to be statistically superior to placebo for dropout, remission, anxiety, and depression scores but worse for adverse events. Despite their efficacy, tricyclic antidepressants are associated with adverse effects, which are further exacerbated when combined with benzodiazepines. As such, the clinical use of tricyclic antidepressants alone or combined with benzodiazepines is limited because of the extent of the associated adverse effects.

For additional treatment options not included in previous meta-analyses, monoamine oxidase inhibitors were found to be significantly superior to placebo for remission but were not different from placebo for other outcomes. However, monoamine oxidase inhibitors have severely limited use in real world practice given their adverse effects profile, increased risk of hypertensive crisis, and multiple drug interactions. Noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors did not show much effect compared with placebo, although some guidelines have recognised their use as a potential treatment option for panic disorder. Given the limited evidence available and lack of demonstrable benefit, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors might not be a suitable treatment for panic disorder. Evidence is also insu

### A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation for major depressive disorder in adults with inadequate response to antidepressant therapy [^111Y6zTD]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2017). High credibility.

Participants in this study were men or nonpregnant/nonnursing women aged 18 to 65 years with a primary diagnosis of nonpsychotic major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders–Clinical Trial version (SCID-CT). The condition must have persisted for at least eight weeks before screening, with a lead-in baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score of 24 or higher. Participants needed to provide written informed consent before completing any study-related procedures and demonstrate willingness and ability to fully comply with study protocols.

Key exclusion criteria included inadequate response to at least six weeks of treatment at the maximum tolerated adult dose for MDD using two or more antidepressant monotherapies or approved augmentation therapies. Additionally, a lifetime history of treatment-resistant depression — defined as a nonresponse to adequate treatment for eight weeks or more at the maximum tolerated dose within the approved range for adults with MDD, involving two or more treatment regimens, including different classes of approved antidepressant monotherapies and augmentation treatments — was also grounds for exclusion. The study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) as augmentation therapy in individuals with minimal history of prior failed antidepressant treatments, rather than as a therapy for treatment-resistant depression. Consequently, including participants with treatment-resistant depression was considered to potentially undermine the study's objectives.

- **Clomipramine**: Considered effective for managing panic disorder.
- **Clonazepam**: an alternative for individuals not responding to first-line treatments.
- **Diazepam**: Recommended for its rapid onset of action.
- **Imipramine**: Useful for those needing a tricyclic antidepressant option.
- **Lorazepam**: Appropriate for managing acute episodes.
- **Mirtazapine**: Acts as a suitable second-line option with a different mechanism of action.
- **Reboxetine**: Provides a non-benzodiazepine alternative for treatment.

### Treatment of generalized anxiety disorder with escitalopram: Pooled results from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^113R5pVF]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

Escitalopram 10 mg/day is an effective and well-tolerated antidepressant. Three randomized controlled trials recently evaluated the safety and efficacy of escitalopram in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The trial designs were virtually identical, allowing data to be pooled across studies. Male and female outpatients, ages 18–80 years, with DSM-IV-defined GAD were randomized to double-blind treatment with escitalopram or placebo for 8 weeks. The escitalopram dose was fixed at 10 mg/day for the first 4 weeks, after which increases to 20 mg/day were permitted. The primary efficacy variable was the mean change from baseline in total Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) score.

Approximately 850 patients were randomized to double-blind treatment. In each individual study, escitalopram was significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.05) as measured by change from baseline in HAMA score. By-visit analyses of data pooled across studies revealed significantly greater improvement (p < 0.05) in the escitalopram group beginning at week 1 or 2 and continuing through week 8 for all primary and secondary efficacy variables. The mean change in HAMA total score from baseline to endpoint also was significantly greater for patients maintained at escitalopram 10 mg/day than for those receiving placebo. Escitalopram was generally well tolerated.

The studies included in this analysis were of short-term duration and excluded patients with significant medical and psychiatric comorbidities, such as major depressive disorder.

### Antidepressant augmentation versus switch in treatment-resistant geriatric depression [^112zPuEw]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The benefits and risks of augmenting or switching antidepressants in older adults with treatment-resistant depression have not been extensively studied.

- **Methods**: We conducted a two-step, open-label trial involving adults 60 years of age or older with treatment-resistant depression. In step 1, patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to augmentation of existing antidepressant medication with aripiprazole, augmentation with bupropion, or a switch from existing antidepressant medication to bupropion. Patients who did not benefit from or were ineligible for step 1 were randomly assigned in step 2 in a 1:1 ratio to augmentation with lithium or a switch to nortriptyline. Each step lasted approximately 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in psychological well-being, assessed with the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction subscales (population mean, 50; higher scores indicate greater well-being). A secondary outcome was remission of depression.

- **Results**: In step 1, a total of 619 patients were enrolled; 211 were assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, 206 to bupropion augmentation, and 202 to a switch to bupropion. Well-being scores improved by 4.83 points, 4.33 points, and 2.04 points, respectively. The difference between the aripiprazole-augmentation group and the switch-to-bupropion group was 2.79 points (95% CI, 0.56 to 5.02; P = 0.014, with a prespecified threshold P value of 0.017); the between-group differences were not significant for aripiprazole augmentation versus bupropion augmentation.

### Xanax [^116QpDMY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Dosage in generalized anxiety disorder**: The recommended starting oral dosage of Xanax for the acute treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is 0.25 mg to 0.5 mg, administered three times daily. Depending upon the response, the dosage may be adjusted at intervals of every 3 to 4 days. The maximum recommended dosage is 4 mg daily (in divided doses). Use the lowest possible effective dose and frequently assess the need for continued treatment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

- **Dosage in panic disorder**: The recommended starting oral dosage of Xanax for the treatment of panic disorder (PD) is 0.5 mg three times daily. Depending on the response, the dosage may be increased at intervals of every 3 to 4 days in increments of no more than 1 mg per day. Controlled trials of Xanax in the treatment of panic disorder included dosages in the range of 1 mg to 10 mg daily. The mean dosage was approximately 5 mg to 6 mg daily. Occasional patients required as much as 10 mg per day.

	- For patients receiving doses greater than 4 mg per day, periodic reassessment and consideration of dosage reduction is advised. In a controlled postmarketing dose-response study, patients treated with doses of Xanax greater than 4 mg per day for 3 months were able to taper to 50% of their total maintenance dose without apparent loss of clinical benefit.

	- The necessary duration of treatment for panic disorder in patients responding to Xanax is unknown. After a period of extended freedom from panic attacks, a carefully supervised tapered discontinuation may be attempted. However, there is evidence that this may often be difficult to accomplish.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^117P6GFX]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

In this secondary analysis, the addition of mirtazapine was more effective at treating generalized anxiety than placebo in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and severe anxiety symptoms. Mirtazapine may also be more effective at treating depressive symptoms and improving social functioning in those who have higher levels of anxiety. Conversely, there appears to be little clinical utility in adding mirtazapine in those without any anxiety. This should be formally assessed in future trials but may represent a strategy for stratifying treatment of resistant depression depending on symptom subtype.

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

- **Suicidal thoughts and behaviors**: Instruct patients, their families, and/or caregivers to be alert to the emergence of symptoms, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Symptoms include:
	- Anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility
	- Aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania
	- Other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, suicidal ideation

	Advise families and caregivers to observe for such symptoms daily, as changes may be abrupt.

### Effect of augmentation with aripiprazole or augmentation with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation versus switching to the antidepressant venlafaxine extended release/duloxetine on cognition: A comparative effectiveness research trial for antidepressant incomplete and non-responders with treatment-resistant depression (ASCERTAIN-TRD) [^1137t5Rp]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Subjective cognitive impairment is a key symptom of major depressive disorder (MDD). Improving cognitive function in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is an important treatment outcome. This study compared the impact of augmenting antidepressants with aripiprazole or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus switching to venlafaxine (or duloxetine for those not eligible to receive venlafaxine) on cognition in TRD patients.

In a predefined secondary analysis of a multi-site, open-label trial, patients with TRD were randomly assigned to aripiprazole augmentation, rTMS augmentation, or switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine in a 1:1:1 ratio, and they were treated for 8 weeks. Cognition was assessed using the Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire (CPFQ). A mixed-effects model with repeated measures was conducted. Among the 258 randomized subjects with at least one post-baseline CPFQ assessment (aripiprazole n = 91; rTMS = 70; venlafaxine XR/duloxetine = 97), neither aripiprazole nor rTMS demonstrated significant differences compared to the venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch group in cognitive outcome as measured by CPFQ scale (p > 0.025).

The mean (SE) change in CPFQ scores from baseline to Week 8 was -8.04 (0.77) for aripiprazole augmentation versus -6.70 (0.75) for venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch, and -8.81 (0.64) for rTMS augmentation versus -6.72 (0.55) for venlafaxine XR/duloxetine switch. Hedge's g values were 0.21 for aripiprazole augmentation versus switching to venlafaxine XR/duloxetine and 0.33 for rTMS augmentation versus switching.

### Citalopram versus other anti-depressive agents for depression [^116ptKAr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). High credibility.

Recent US and UK clinical practice guidelines recommend that second-generation antidepressants should be considered among the best first-line options when drug therapy is indicated for a depressive episode. Systematic reviews have already highlighted some differences in efficacy between second-generation antidepressants. Citalopram, one of the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) introduced in the market, is one of these antidepressant drugs that clinicians use for routine depression care.

- **Objectives**: To assess the evidence for the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of citalopram in comparison with tricyclics, heterocyclics, other SSRIs, and other conventional and non-conventional antidepressants in the acute-phase treatment of major depression.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to February 2012. No language restriction was applied. We contacted pharmaceutical companies and experts in this field for supplemental data.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with major depression to citalopram versus any other antidepressants.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (the number of patients who responded or remitted) and patient acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study).

### Propranolol for the treatment of anxiety disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113B4oBR]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2016). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, statistical equivalence of the efficacy of propranolol versus benzodiazepines in treating individuals with panic disorder, both with or without agoraphobia, has not been demonstrated. The evidence suggests that propranolol and benzodiazepines prescribed in clinical settings have similar effectiveness for the short-term treatment of these conditions. Other factors also need to be considered.

- **Onset of action**: Propranolol requires time for its effects to become prominent. SSRIs generally require a period of 2–4 weeks, while in some patients with panic disorder, the onset of action may take up to 12 weeks. Early adjuvant therapy with propranolol may therefore be considered.

- **Side effects profile**: The clinical effects of benzodiazepines are considered equivalent to the first-line pharmacotherapy of panic disorder, such as SSRIs. However, benzodiazepines carry a high risk of unwanted sedative effects, cognitive impairment, and dependence, with tolerance developing over time. Conversely, the side effects of SSRIs, while considerably frequent (e.g. > 10% experience gastrointestinal complaints, fatigue, insomnia, and headache), are temporary, reversible, and relatively benign. Propranolol's side effects occur less frequently and may include sleeping disturbances, nightmares, transient fatigue, and cold extremities (1–10%). The supporting evidence base for SSRIs remains broader and more consistent than for propranolol.

### Novel treatment approaches for refractory anxiety disorders [^113HYXYi]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The Anxiety Disorders Association of America convened a conference of experts to address treatment-resistant anxiety disorders and review promising novel approaches to their treatment. Workgroup leaders and other participants reviewed the literature and considered the presentations and discussions from the conference. The authors placed the emerging literature on new therapeutic approaches into clinical perspective and identified unmet needs and priority areas for future research.

There is a relative paucity of efforts addressing inadequate response to anxiety disorder treatment. Systematic efforts to exhaust all therapeutic options and overcome barriers to effective treatment delivery are needed before patients can be considered treatment refractory. Cognitive behavioral therapy, especially in combination with pharmacotherapy, must be tailored to accommodate the effects of clinical context on treatment response.

The literature on pharmacologic treatment of refractory anxiety disorders is small but growing and includes studies of augmentation strategies and non-traditional anxiolytics. Research efforts to discover new pharmacologic targets focus on neuronal systems that mediate responses to stress and fear. A number of clinical and basic science studies were proposed that would advance the research agenda and improve the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders.

Significant advances have been made in the development of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatments for anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, many patients remain symptomatic.

### Antidepressants versus placebo for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) [^116UGNsP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). High credibility.

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a mental health condition characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about everyday events. GAD is a common disorder and generally affects women twice as often as men. Treatments include various psychological and pharmacological therapies. Among the pharmacological therapies, antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), are commonly used for the treatment of GAD, and many studies have shown their benefit over placebo. Only one systematic review and meta-analysis comparing all antidepressants to placebo has been conducted in the past. Since then, new data on existing antidepressants have emerged, and new antidepressants have been introduced. An updated and more comprehensive review is needed to provide a stronger understanding of the efficacy, acceptability, tolerability, and impact on the quality of life of the various types of antidepressants compared to placebo.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antidepressants in GAD in adults, specifically to determine the efficacy of antidepressants in alleviating symptoms of GAD compared to placebo and to review the acceptability of antidepressants in GAD in terms of adverse effects, including the general prevalence of adverse effects compared to placebo.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Health Disorders (CCMD) register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and two trials registers in October 2022.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^116WXiXw]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

There is a lack of evidence to guide treatment of comorbid depression and anxiety. Preliminary evidence suggests mirtazapine may be effective in treating patients with both depression and anxiety symptoms.

- **Methods**: We undertook a secondary analysis of mirtazapine (MIR), a placebo-controlled trial of the addition of mirtazapine to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in primary care. We subdivided participants into three groups by baseline generalized anxiety disorder score (GAD-7): severe (GAD-7 ⩾ 16), moderate (GAD-7 = 11–15), no/mild (GAD-7 ≤ 10). We used linear regression, including likelihood-ratio testing of interaction terms, to assess how baseline anxiety altered the response of participants to mirtazapine as measured by 12-week GAD-7 and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) scores.

- **Results**: Baseline generalized anxiety moderated mirtazapine's effect as measured by GAD-7 (p = 0.041) and BDI-II (p = 0.088) at 12 weeks. Participants with severe generalized anxiety receiving mirtazapine had lower 12-week GAD-7 scores (adjusted difference between means (ADM) −2.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) −0.69 to −4.95) and larger decreases in BDI-II scores (ADM −6.36, 95% CI −1.60 to −10.84) than placebo. Conversely, there was no anxiolytic benefit (ADM 0.28, 95% CI −1.05 to 1.60) or antidepressant benefit (ADM −0.17, 95% CI −3.02 to 2.68) compared with placebo in those with no/mild generalized anxiety.

These findings extend the evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine in treating patients with severe generalized anxiety and treatment-resistant depression.

### Consensus statement on generalized anxiety disorder from the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety [^115yWU4k]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

- **Objective**: To provide primary care clinicians with a better understanding of management issues in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and guide clinical practice with recommendations on the appropriate treatment strategy.

- **Participants**: The 4 members of the International Consensus Group on Depression and Anxiety were James C. Ballenger (chair), Jonathan R.T. Davidson, Yves Lecrubier, and David J. Nutt. Four additional faculty members invited by the chair were Karl Rickels, Hans-Ulrich Wittchen, Dan J. Stein, and Thomas D. Borkovec.

- **Evidence**: The consensus statement is based on the 6 review articles that are published in this supplement and the scientific literature relevant to the issues reviewed in these articles.

- **Consensus process**: Group meetings were held over a 2-day period. On day 1, the group discussed the review articles and the chair identified key issues for further debate. On day 2, the group discussed these issues to arrive at a consensus view. After the group meetings, the consensus statement was drafted by the chair and approved by all attendees.

- **Conclusions**: GAD is the most common anxiety disorder in primary care and is highly debilitating. Furthermore, it is frequently comorbid with depression and other anxiety disorders, which exacerbates functional impairment. Antidepressants (serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsedating tricyclic antidepressants) are generally the most appropriate first-line pharmacotherapy for GAD, since they are also effective against comorbid psychiatric disorders.

### Use of atypical antipsychotics in refractory depression and anxiety [^1142JCRC]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Treatment options for bipolar depression and treatment-resistant unipolar depression include the augmentation of antidepressant therapy with a non-antidepressant drug, including atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone has shown effectiveness in combination with fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or citalopram for treatment-resistant unipolar depression, with reported remission rates ranging from 61% to 76%. Olanzapine combined with fluoxetine is both safe and effective in patients with bipolar depression and those with fluoxetine-resistant unipolar depression. Ziprasidone and aripiprazole augmentation of various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been reported to be effective in refractory unipolar depression in open-label studies. However, data on the use of quetiapine or clozapine as augmentation therapy for depression or anxiety are not yet available. Further double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of the augmentation of antidepressants with atypical antipsychotics in refractory depression and anxiety are justified based on the available literature.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^112QXSZ6]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

- **Study quality and RoB**: Contains the RoB ratings across criteria and studies. RoB ratings were mostly low (n = 57) to moderate (n = 51), with only 5% (n = 6) of studies being adjudged to have a high RoB. The RoB criterion most commonly identified as present was 'allegiance', likely due primarily to the potential conflict of interest between pharmaceutical companies funding research into their medications. Outlines the mean RoB ratings stratified by treatment class studied.

- **Primary outcomes**: Table 1 details the results of the meta-analyses, with subgroup analyses investigating TRD severity and duration of treatment presented, respectively. Below, the meta-analysis results for the most frequently investigated interventions are described. Figure 2 also presents the results for treatments studied in more than three studies as a forest plot.

- **Table 1**: Results of meta-analyses detailing intervention-level data. Standard error, 95% confidence intervals, and I² heterogeneity are also reported. This table includes studies regardless of TRD severity or treatment duration (which differed in their contribution to heterogeneity) but excludes high RoB and combination studies, which added heterogeneity to analyses.

- **Figure 2**: Forest plot displaying effect sizes for treatments examined in more than three studies.

- **Pharmacological interventions**: Antidepressant medications showed a wide range of effect sizes, with only desipramine (k = 2: ES = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.26–1.12, I² = 0%), mirtazapine (k = 2: ES = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02–1.36, I² = 0%), and bupropion (k = 4: ES = 1.19, 95% CI: 0.45–1.93, I² = 98%) assessed in more than one study.

### Pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder [^115VwRSw]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Less than one-third of people afflicted with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experience spontaneous remission, and the symptoms of GAD wax and wane throughout a person's life. The burden of GAD may be reduced with psychopharmacologic therapy. The medications with the most evidence of efficacy in GAD are the benzodiazepines, including a new long-acting formulation of alprazolam. These drugs have a low incidence of side effects but may cause physical dependence, withdrawal, and sedation.

Antidepressants are also efficacious in GAD but act less quickly than benzodiazepines. Tricyclic antidepressants, such as imipramine, may substantially reduce symptoms of anxiety but are not considered a first-line therapy because of their side effects spectrum. The extended-release formulation of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as paroxetine and sertraline, are also efficacious in GAD. While their association with sexual dysfunction may be intolerable for some adults, these drugs may be more appropriate than the benzodiazepines, because their chronic use does not lead to dependence. Buspirone also significantly reduces symptoms of GAD and is associated with less sexual dysfunction than SSRIs and less sedation than benzodiazepines.

Combining antidepressant and benzodiazepine therapy or combining medication treatment and psychotherapy may lead to an increase in improvement in patients not responding to one treatment approach alone. The most effective treatment for managing the reSymptoms of this chronic disorder will remain unknown until more long-term studies using both methods are conducted.

### Prozac [^115EuXZ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for major depressive disorder, 12% to 16% of patients treated with Prozac and 7% to 9% of patients treated with placebo reported anxiety, nervousness, or insomnia.

In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, insomnia was reported in 28% of patients treated with Prozac and in 22% of patients treated with placebo. Anxiety was reported in 14% of patients treated with Prozac and in 7% of patients treated with placebo.

In U.S. placebo-controlled clinical trials for bulimia nervosa, insomnia was reported in 33% of patients treated with Prozac 60 mg, and 13% of patients treated with placebo. Anxiety and nervousness were reported, respectively, in 15% and 11% of patients treated with Prozac 60 mg, and in 9% and 5% of patients treated with placebo.

Among the most common adverse reactions associated with discontinuation (incidence at least twice that for placebo and at least 1% for Prozac in clinical trials collecting only a primary reaction associated with discontinuation) in U.S. placebo-controlled fluoxetine clinical trials were:

- **Anxiety**: 2% in OCD
- **Insomnia**: 1% in combined indications and 2% in bulimia
- **Nervousness**: 1% in major depressive disorder.

### Pharmacotherapy augmentation strategies in treatment-resistant anxiety disorders [^117T6Yb6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). High credibility.

A large proportion of patients with anxiety disorders fail to respond to first-line medication interventions, despite evidence of the effectiveness of these agents.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of medication versus placebo augmentation in the treatment of patients with anxiety disorders who have failed to respond adequately to first-line drug therapies.

- **Search strategy**: The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety & Neurosis Group (CCDAN) specialised registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 3/8/2005, MEDLINE (January 1966 to July 2005) and PsycINFO (1966 to 2005, Part A). Unpublished trials were identified through the Controlled Trials database and the National Institute of Health's Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects (CRISP) service (1972 to 2005). Additional studies in any language were sought in reference lists of retrieved articles.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the medication augmentation of pharmacotherapy for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by class of augmentation agent and anxiety disorder. Overall effect estimates were calculated using a random-effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

- **Main results**: Twenty-eight short-term (average of seven weeks) randomised controlled trials (740 part…

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^115AZncF]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

- **Step 4: Add on or switch therapy (second-line agents)**: Second-line therapies for bipolar disorder management include several agents. Although olanzapine (level 1) is effective in preventing any mood, manic, or depressive episode, it is considered a second-line treatment due to safety concerns such as metabolic syndrome. Biweekly long-acting injectable risperidone monotherapy (level 1) or adjunctive therapy (level 2) has shown efficacy in preventing mood or manic episodes, but lacks clear efficacy for depressive episode prevention in trials. Further, there was a trend for the superiority of oral risperidone adjunctive therapy at six months in preventing any mood episode and mania, but not depression.

	- Carbamazepine (level 2) has not been evaluated in large placebo-controlled trials, but active comparator trials support its efficacy. Paliperidone (level 2) was more effective than placebo in preventing any mood or manic episode, though less effective than olanzapine. Ziprasidone oral adjunctive therapy (level 2) has demonstrated effectiveness in preventing any mood or manic episode, although there are conflicting data for acute treatment [see Sections 3 and 4].

	- A controlled trial indicated a trend for lurasidone adjunctive therapy to be superior in preventing any mood episode, though not manic or depressive episodes individually, with significant separation from placebo for those with an index depressive episode. Thus, lurasidone adjunctive therapy may be appropriate for patients who responded to this medication during an index depressive episode.

### Autism spectrum disorder: Consensus guidelines on assessment, treatment and research from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^112YU7Jk]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of autism spectrum disorder, specifically in relation to anxiety management, the BAP 2018 guidelines recommend considering a cautious trial of SSRIs in pediatric patients with ASD and anxiety. If SSRIs prove to be poorly efficacious, risperidone is suggested as a subsequent option. It is important to monitor for any worsening of anxiety in some children.

### Aripiprazole augmentation for treatment of patients with inadequate antidepressants response [^111me6Yf]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

This study evaluated whether augmentation with aripiprazole is beneficial and tolerable for patients with an inadequate response to antidepressants (ADs). Thirteen patients with nonpsychotic major depression, who had failed to respond to an adequate trial of at least one AD, were prescribed aripiprazole (dose: 5–30 mg) for 8 weeks. The dose of their preexisting ADs was not changed.

The treatment response was defined as the mean changes in the scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) from baseline to the end of treatment. Eleven (84.6%) patients returned for at least one follow-up visit, and seven (53.8%) patients completed the study. The HAM-D and Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scores decreased significantly from baseline to the end of treatment by 53.8% and 56.0%, respectively (Z = -2.937, P = 0.003; Z = -2.961, P = 0.003).

Seven (63.6%) patients showed a ≥ 50% reduction in the HAM-D score at the end of treatment. Three (27.3%) patients met the remission criteria at the end of treatment. There were no serious side effects. Despite the high dropout rate in this open study, aripiprazole appears to be reasonably effective and tolerated as an augmentation strategy in conjunction with conventional ADs treatment in patients with an inadequate AD response. These results highlight the potential benefits of aripiprazole for these patients. However, adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.

### Effects of aripiprazole augmentation in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (a double blind clinical trial) [^111h14gh]. Depression and Anxiety (2012). High credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disorder with an unknown etiology. Failure in OCD treatment is common, and finding effective augmentations in the treatment of OCD will benefit patients. Antipsychotic augmentation is a common strategy for treatment-resistant OCD. This trial evaluated the efficacy of adding aripiprazole in patients whose OCD was insufficiently responsive to adequate SSRI treatment.

- **Methods**: Thirty-nine adult outpatients who met the DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD and had treatment-resistant OCD were evaluated in a double-blind randomized clinical trial. The patients received either aripiprazole 10 mg/day or a placebo for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis with the last observation carried forward. All statistical tests were two-sided and were considered statistically significant at P < 0.05.

- **Results**: A significant reduction in total scores of Y-BOCS (P < 0.0001) was found in the aripiprazole group. Aripiprazole was generally well tolerated. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of observed side effects.

- **Conclusion**: Results of the present study indicate that aripiprazole could be an effective augmentation medicine in treatment-resistant OCD.

### Randomized controlled trial of riluzole augmentation for posttraumatic stress disorder: Efficacy of a glutamatergic modulator for antidepressant-resistant symptoms [^114ZF8P4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

The pharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have shown limited efficacy, prompting a call to investigate new classes of medications. This study investigated the efficacy of glutamate modulation with riluzole augmentation for combat-related PTSD symptoms resistant to treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial was conducted at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and Syracuse VA Medical Center between December 2013 and November 2017. Veterans and active-duty service members with combat-related PTSD (per the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale [CAPS]) who were not responsive to SSRI or SNRI pharmacotherapy were randomized to an 8-week augmentation with a starting dose of 100 mg/d of riluzole (n = 36) or placebo (n = 38) and assessed weekly for PTSD symptoms, anxiety, depression, disability, and side effects.

Intent-to-treat analyses (N = 74) of the primary outcome (CAPS for DSM-IV) showed no significant between-group difference in change in overall PTSD symptoms (F = 0.64, P = 0.422), with a small effect size (d = 0.25). There was clinically significant within-group improvement in overall PTSD symptoms in both groups, with a greater mean (SD) decrease in CAPS score in the riluzole group (-21.1 [18.9]) than in the placebo group (-16.7 [17.2]). Exploratory analyses of PTSD symptom clusters showed significantly greater improvement in hyperarousal symptoms in the riluzole group.

### Initial severity and antidepressant efficacy for anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder: An individual patient data meta-analysis [^111QQeVM]. Depression and Anxiety (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**:

- **Trials and participants**: We identified 34 trials but excluded one trial of paroxetine for panic disorder (PD) (29060/108) (Oehrberg et al. 1995) a priori, as it did not distinguish between full and limited-symptom panic attacks. Access to four other trials was denied. Electronic data was not available for a trial of fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (E079) (Montgomery et al. 1993), completed in 1991. GlaxoSmithKline considered the translation costs for three unpublished Japanese trials of paroxetine for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD) (29060/661, 29060/856, and PIR104776) to be prohibitive. One of these trials (PIR104776) was positive, indicating statistically significant results for the primary outcome, while the other three were negative.

We received access to 29 trials with 3,656 placebo-treated and 5,323 antidepressant-treated participants. Two trials of duloxetine for GAD included an active comparator, venlafaxine extended release. For GAD, we had access to eight trials (six positive) with 1,342 placebo-treated and 2,088 antidepressant-treated participants; for SAD, four trials (all positive) with 514 placebo-treated and 681 antidepressant-treated participants; for OCD, four trials (three positive) with 350 placebo-treated and 782 antidepressant-treated participants; for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), three trials (two positive) with 459 placebo-treated and 612 antidepressant-treated participants; and for PD, 10 trials (five positive) with 991 placebo-treated and 1,160 antidepressant-treated participants. See flowchart in Supporting Information Figure 1 for trial selection and Table 1 for baseline characteristics.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of augmentation and combination treatments for early-stage treatment-resistant depression [^111tKVfj]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly burdensome health condition, for which there are numerous accepted pharmacological and psychological interventions. Adjunctive treatment, including augmentation and combination, is recommended for the approximately 50% of MDD patients who do not adequately respond to first-line treatment. We aimed to evaluate the evidence for concomitant approaches for people with early-stage treatment-resistant depression (TRD; defined below).

- **Methods**: We systematically searched Medline and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science to identify randomised controlled trials of adjunctive treatment of ⩾10 adults with MDD who had not responded to ⩾1 adequate antidepressant. The Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool was used to assess study quality. Pre-post treatment meta-analyses were performed, allowing for comparison across heterogeneous study designs independent of comparator interventions.

- **Results**: In total, 115 trials investigating 48 treatments were synthesised. The mean intervention duration was 9 weeks (range 5 days to 18 months) with most studies assessed to have low (n = 57) or moderate (n = 51) RoB. The highest effect sizes (ESs) were from cognitive behavioural therapy (ES = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–2.07), (es)ketamine (ES = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.23–1.73), and risperidone (ES = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.29–1.61). Only aripiprazole and lithium were examined in ⩾10 studies. Pill placebo (ES = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81–0.98) had a notable ES, and only six treatments' 95% CIs did not overlap with pill placebo's.

### A novel augmentation strategy for treating resistant major depression [^114dJJyS]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment-resistant depression is a significant public health concern; drug switching or augmentation often produces limited results. The authors hypothesized that fluoxetine could be augmented with olanzapine to successfully treat resistant depression.

An 8-week double-blind study was conducted with 28 patients who were diagnosed with recurrent, nonbipolar, treatment-resistant depression without psychotic features. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups: olanzapine plus placebo, fluoxetine plus placebo, or olanzapine plus fluoxetine.

Fluoxetine monotherapy produced minimal improvement on various scales that rate the severity of depression. The benefits of olanzapine monotherapy were modest. Olanzapine plus fluoxetine produced significantly greater improvement than either monotherapy on one measure and significantly greater improvement than olanzapine monotherapy on the other measures after 1 week. There were no significant differences between treatment groups on extrapyramidal measures nor significant adverse drug interactions.

Olanzapine plus fluoxetine demonstrated superior efficacy for treating resistant depression compared to either agent alone.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^115f9K6T]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Low credibility.

Clarifying effective treatment for patients with treatment resistance in primary care is key, as these patients are a common group that suffer from poorer quality of life, are harder to manage, and utilize substantial healthcare resources. When depression and anxiety symptoms co-occur, they represent a more severe end of the population of depressed individuals. This severity is reflected in the baseline characteristics of participants in our high generalized anxiety group (GAD-7 ⩾16), who had higher baseline depression, rates of suicidal ideation, and financial struggles, alongside lower quality of life measures.

These results support existing evidence that mirtazapine is a useful treatment for managing generalized anxiety in individuals with depression. Additionally, this analysis suggests that the use of mirtazapine in those with severe generalized anxiety may improve both depressive symptoms and social functioning. This improvement was achieved by adding mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI, a strategy not previously examined in trials. These findings suggest a possible path to selectively targeting the addition of mirtazapine based on comorbid generalized anxiety symptoms when first-line treatment fails. This approach aligns with existing expert consensus-based guidance on using mirtazapine in those with anxiety-predominant depression.

Conversely, the findings did not provide evidence for adding mirtazapine in individuals without generalized anxiety symptoms who have failed to respond to first-line antidepressant therapy. This is important.

### A double-blind study of the efficacy of venlafaxine extended-release, paroxetine, and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder [^111MTBBC]. Depression and Anxiety (2007). Low credibility.

At the time of writing, no large-scale, controlled trial comparing a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor with a placebo for the treatment of panic disorder has been reported. This double-blind study compares the efficacy of venlafaxine extended-release (ER) and paroxetine with a placebo.

A total of 664 nondepressed adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of treatment with a placebo or fixed-dose venlafaxine ER (75 mg/day or 150 mg/day), or paroxetine 40 mg/day. The primary measure was the percentage of patients free from full-symptom panic attacks, assessed with the Panic and Anticipatory Anxiety Scale (PAAS).

- **Secondary measures**: Included the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, Clinical Global Impressions–Severity (CGI-S) and–Improvement (CGI-I) scales; response (CGI-I rating of very much improved or much improved), remission (CGI-S rating of not at all ill or borderline ill and no PAAS full-symptom panic attacks); and measures of depression, anxiety, phobic fear and avoidance, anticipatory anxiety, functioning, and quality of life.

Intent-to-treat, last observation carried forward analysis showed that mean improvement on most measures was greater with venlafaxine ER or paroxetine than with a placebo. No significant differences were observed between active treatment groups. Panic-free rates at endpoint with active treatment ranged from 54% to 61%, compared with 35% for placebo. Approximately 75% of patients given active treatment were responders, and nearly 45% achieved remission.

### Aripiprazole augmentation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder [^1128j2P9]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Due to their favorable side effect profile, atypical antipsychotic agents offer important therapeutic advantages in mood disorders. Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic agent with partial dopaminergic and serotonin 1A receptor agonist activity, may be particularly useful when used in conjunction with standard antidepressants in treatment-resistant depression. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis in depressed outpatients who have not experienced significant clinical improvement following an adequate trial of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

- **Method**: Twelve patients (mean ± SD age = 46.6 ± 11.3 years, 66.7% female) with major depressive disorder (MDD) diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-Axis I Disorders, who had failed to experience a clinical response following an adequate trial of an SSRI, were treated with open-label aripiprazole in addition to their SSRI for 8 weeks. Clinical response was defined as a 50% or greater decrease in depressive symptoms during the course of the trial (baseline-endpoint) as measured by the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score. Data were collected from August 2003 to July 2004.

- **Results**: Nine out of twelve (75.0%) patients completed the trial. Using a completer analysis, 5 out of 9 (55.6%) patients were classified as responders. An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis resulted in 7 responders (58.3%). The overall proportion of remitters was 3 out of 9 (33.3%) using a completer analysis and 5 out of 12 (41.7%) using the ITT analysis. Aripiprazole administration appeared safe, with no severe adverse effects reported.

### Treatment of residual anxiety symptoms with adjunctive aripiprazole in depressed patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^1136XFCw]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2005). High credibility.

Depression and anxiety are common disorders with substantially overlapping symptom complexes. Not surprisingly, treatment approaches are similar for both, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) as the initial therapy of choice. However, after first-line treatments have been deployed, residual symptoms are often problematic. Augmentation strategies to address these difficulties are an area of active investigation. This study assessed aripiprazole as adjunctive therapy to SSRIs for patients with persistent anxiety symptoms complicating a depression or anxiety disorder.

- **Methods**: Ten patients who had been receiving SSRIs for at least six weeks, but still had clinically significant anxiety symptoms, were enrolled in an open-label, flexibly-dosed study of adjunctive aripiprazole. Clinical status was assessed with the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A), Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS), and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS).

- **Results**: Eighty percent of the subjects experienced a greater than 50% reduction of symptoms on these outcome measures by week 2 of therapy and continued with further decreases in symptoms throughout the study.

- **Conclusions**: The results of this trial provide preliminary evidence that aripiprazole may be an effective adjunctive treatment in individuals on SSRIs with residual symptoms of anxiety or depression. More rigorous double-blind studies are warranted to confirm and elucidate the potential role of aripiprazole in these conditions.

### Aripiprazole: a clinical review of its use for the treatment of anxiety disorders and anxiety as a comorbidity in mental illness [^11617zhz]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Although anxiety disorders are common, optimal treatment is elusive. More than half of anxiety patients treated with an adequate course of antidepressants fail to fully improve; treatment resistance, residual symptoms, and recurrence/relapse remain a challenge. Recently, atypical antipsychotics have been considered for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. This review will explore the available data for the role of aripiprazole in the treatment of anxiety.

- **Methods**: PubMed and conference abstracts were searched for randomized, double-blind studies that investigated the efficacy of aripiprazole in anxiety; its efficacy in bipolar disorder and depression was also explored for comparison.

- **Results**: A number of studies have shown atypical antipsychotics to be effective in anxiety, and currently available data suggest that aripiprazole augmentation in patients with anxiety disorders is likely as effective as other atypical antipsychotic drugs. Although there have been no randomized, controlled trials, aripiprazole has been found to be effective in treating anxiety disorders in two open-label trials. This, combined with the larger database demonstrating its utility in bipolar disorder and depression, its safety profile, and its unique mechanism of action, makes aripiprazole for anxiety an intriguing avenue of exploration.

- **Limitations**: Data from large randomized, controlled trials on the use of atypical antipsychotics for anxiety in general, and aripiprazole in particular, are currently lacking.
