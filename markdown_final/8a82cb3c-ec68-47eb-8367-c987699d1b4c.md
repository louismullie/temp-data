## Question

Fomepizole for hepatitis C

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fomepizole has any role in the treatment or prevention of hepatitis C virus infection, essentially "fomepizole for hepatitis C". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what fomepizole is and what it is actually approved to treat. Then, I should verify whether any guidelines or trials link fomepizole to HCV therapy. Next, I will evaluate mechanistic plausibility for repurposing. After that, I need to compare this idea with the current evidence-based standard of care for HCV and check safety or interaction considerations. Finally, I should synthesize a bottom-line clinical recommendation with references to authoritative guidance and data.

> Let me first confirm the identity and indication of fomepizole, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating it with another class of drugs. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase indicated for ethylene glycol and methanol poisoning; it is not an antiviral and has no labeled hepatic antiviral activity, although case-based off-label use in acetaminophen toxicity has been described mechanistically to blunt toxic metabolite formation and oxidative stress, and pediatric methanol cases document its antidotal utility [^111vPpiu] [^111dvoBE] [^112D51GV].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative HCV guidance or systematic reviews even mention fomepizole as a therapy for hepatitis C. Scanning contemporary HCV treatment guidance and high-level evidence summaries, I see recommendations centered entirely on direct-acting antiviral combinations and supportive pretreatment evaluations, with no mention of fomepizole in any HCV treatment context, adult or pediatric [^115yLRfD] [^113SKUSF] [^115orF8j] [^1126KhDE].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could there be a mechanistic repurposing rationale that I'm overlooking. Fomepizole blocks alcohol dehydrogenase–mediated pathways relevant to toxic alcohols and has been explored in acetaminophen-induced liver injury, but HCV liver injury is driven by viral replication and host immune responses rather than a single toxic metabolite targetable by alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition; I initially wondered about immunomodulators, but wait, amantadine was the agent historically explored as an adjunct in HCV, not fomepizole, and even amantadine produced conflicting results and is not standard of care, underscoring that fomepizole lacks both antiviral mechanism and supportive data in HCV [^111dvoBE] [^116ENK3c] [^116W8a75].

> Next, I should review the established standard of care so I can contrast the speculative concept of fomepizole with proven therapies. Modern HCV management relies on pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral regimens that target viral NS3/4A protease, NS5A, and NS5B polymerase, achieving sustained virologic response rates generally exceeding 90–95% across diverse populations, with regimen selection and durations defined by high-quality guideline pathways and registrational trials such as those for sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir and other combinations [^115orF8j] [^115yLRfD] [^114orcFX].

> I need to check safety and pretreatment considerations to ensure I'm not missing a niche in which fomepizole might influence DAA use or monitoring. DAAs are generally well tolerated in postmarketing analyses, pretreatment labs and drug–drug interaction review are recommended, and evaluation for HBV coinfection is standard to mitigate reactivation risk during DAA therapy; none of these steps introduce a role for an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor, and fomepizole's hepatic metabolism does not create a therapeutic intersection with DAAs in this context [^111UP2tq] [^1137rkJk] [^112SKtWC] [^111HRdAV].

> Let me reconsider whether any subgroup, such as acute HCV or special populations, hints at a place for fomepizole; I should double-check acute and recent HCV data. Even in acute or recent infection, pangenotypic DAAs remain effective and are the focus of management strategies, again with no mention of fomepizole, which reinforces that there is neither mechanistic plausibility nor empirical evidence for its use in HCV [^114hUdCS].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Fomepizole is an antidote for toxic alcohol ingestions and has limited off-label exploration in acetaminophen poisoning; there is no guideline endorsement, mechanistic rationale, or clinical evidence supporting its use to treat or prevent hepatitis C, whereas pangenotypic DAA regimens are the evidence-based, guideline-recommended standard with high cure rates and established safety profiles, so there is no clinical role for fomepizole in HCV management outside a research setting [^111vPpiu] [^115yLRfD] [^115orF8j] [^111keHht].

---

Fomepizole is **not indicated or effective** for hepatitis C. It is an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor used solely for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning [^112GfWTW], with **no antiviral activity against HCV**. Current treatment for hepatitis C relies on **direct-acting antivirals (DAAs)** [^115yLRfD], which achieve high cure rates [^113SKUSF] and are the standard of care [^114hUdCS]. No **evidence or guidelines** support using fomepizole for hepatitis C [^115yLRfD].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical indications of fomepizole

Fomepizole is a **competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase** [^112GfWTW], preventing the conversion of methanol and ethylene glycol into toxic metabolites. It is **FDA-approved for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning** [^111vPpiu], in which it reduces toxic metabolite formation and improves outcomes [^111RVRie].

---

## Mechanism of action and relevance to hepatitis C

Fomepizole's mechanism — inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase — is **irrelevant to HCV**, which does not use this enzyme in its life cycle [^117ADiVc]. HCV is an **RNA virus** that relies on viral proteases and polymerases, not alcohol dehydrogenase, for replication [^113wVjhr]. Thus, fomepizole has **no plausible antiviral activity** against HCV [^114UmH12].

---

## Current standard of care for hepatitis C

The **standard of care** for hepatitis C is direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) [^115yLRfD], which target HCV-specific proteins and achieve high sustained virologic response (SVR) rates across genotypes [^113SKUSF] [^111keHht]. Recommended regimens include:

- **Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir**: 12 weeks, pangenotypic, high SVR [^113SKUSF] [^115yLRfD].
- **Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir**: 8–12 weeks, pangenotypic, high SVR [^113SKUSF] [^114hUdCS].
- **Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir**: 12 weeks for DAA-experienced patients [^113SKUSF] [^114orcFX].

These regimens are **safe, effective, and well tolerated** and have minimal drug interactions and short treatment durations [^111UP2tq].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding fomepizole in hepatitis C

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting the use of fomepizole for hepatitis C [^115yLRfD]. No **trials or case reports** have evaluated its efficacy or safety in HCV infection, and no guidelines recommend its use.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Fomepizole is generally safe when used for its approved indications, but it can cause **adverse effects** such as headache, nausea, dizziness, and injection-site reactions. Its safety in patients with chronic liver disease or hepatitis C is unknown [^111vPpiu], and off-label use may pose unnecessary risks without proven benefit.

---

## Expert opinions and guidelines

Expert guidelines from AASLD/IDSA [^115yLRfD] and WHO do not mention fomepizole for hepatitis C and **recommend DAAs** as the standard of care [^113SKUSF] [^114hUdCS].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

**Fomepizole is not indicated** or effective for hepatitis C. It has no antiviral activity against HCV, and **no evidence or guidelines support** its use in this context [^115yLRfD]. Clinicians should **use approved DAA regimens**, which are safe, effective, and guideline-endorsed [^111keHht].

### Pangenotypic direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^113SKUSF]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The evidence described in this review was considered and applied to update treatment guidelines for adults with chronic HCV infection. Based on this and other supporting evidence, the WHO issued a conditional recommendation, based on moderate quality of evidence, that pangenotypic DAA regimens be used for the treatment of persons with chronic HCV infection aged 18 years and above. In this recommendation, pangenotypic was defined as leading to SVR in over 85% of persons treated across all six major HCV genotypes.

At the time this guidance was issued, the pangenotypic regimens available to adults without cirrhosis included sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (12-week course), sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (12-week course), and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (8-week course). For adults with compensated cirrhosis, available regimens included sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (12-week course), glecaprevir-pibrentasvir (12-week course), and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir (24-week course or 12-week course in regions where genotype 3 prevalence is known to be less than 5%). A treatment duration of 24 weeks was recommended for sofosbuvir-daclatasvir given the lower SVR rates in persons with genotype 3 infection.

For adults with or without compensated cirrhosis, glecaprevir-pibrentasvir should be used for 16 weeks for persons with genotype 3 infection who have previously received interferon and/or ribavirin.

### Current therapy and new molecular approaches to antiviral treatment and prevention of hepatitis C [^116ENK3c]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Therapeutic options for hepatitis C are limited, especially for genotype 1. For genotypes 2 and 3, pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin can lead to a sustained virological response in up to 80% of patients. Unfortunately, adverse effects of interferon (IFN) and ribavirin are a major problem, and the list of contraindications for hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy is long, including decompensated cirrhosis of the liver and psychiatric disorders. Therefore, alternative therapeutic approaches are needed.

New delivery options for IFN and ribavirin are aimed at optimizing efficiency and reducing adverse effects. Recent progress in the molecular virology of HCV has identified new targets for antiviral intervention.

- **Inhibition of HCV gene expression** and replication, as well as immunotherapeutic concepts aimed at enhancing the cellular immune response against HCV, are being explored. The solution of the crystal structures of HCV key enzymes led to the design of specific inhibitors, including compounds active against the well-characterized NS3 serine protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which are currently in early-phase clinical investigation.

- **New strategies for inhibiting HCV gene expression**: These include the use of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and ribozymes.

- **Immunomodulation by agents such as**: Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase inhibitors, thymosin-alpha 1, histamine, or amantadine are being studied in combination with IFN and/or ribavirin. Immunotherapeutic vaccination with recombinant HCV E1 protein improved host immunity against HCV and thus seems to be a promising new option.

### Synergy of entry inhibitors with direct-acting antivirals uncovers novel combinations for prevention and treatment of hepatitis C [^113fdYvJ]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

The standard of care (SOC) in chronic genotype 1 HCV infection consists of pegylated IFN-α, ribavirin (RBV), and a protease inhibitor — telaprevir or boceprevir. Furthermore, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) such as sofosbuvir and simeprevir have been recently licensed. Although these are expected to revolutionize HCV treatment by offering a cure to the majority of treated patients, DAAs have distinct limitations in certain difficult-to-treat patient subgroups, such as those with advanced liver disease, transplant recipients, patients coinfected with HIV/HCV, and immune-compromised individuals. Challenges in these groups include resistance and side effects. Furthermore, not all genotypes respond similarly to DAA combinations, and high costs limit access to therapy in low-income, middle-income, and even high-income countries.

### Hepatitis in 2010: The dawn of a new era in HCV therapy [^115WZh8q]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). High credibility.

Although several antiviral treatments for HBV infection have recently reached the market, no direct-acting antiviral drugs to treat infection with HCV have been licensed in the 20 years since its identification. Excitingly, recent publications herald several small revolutions in the antiviral treatment of HCV that have considerable relevance for prospective HCV therapies.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^11256z6R]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances involving hepatitis C virus infection, particularly in patients with HIV co-infection, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend using a daily fixed-dose combination of sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg. This should be used with antiretroviral drugs that do not have clinically significant interactions, such as abacavir, bictegravir, dolutegravir, doravirine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, maraviroc, raltegravir, rilpivirine, and tenofovir alafenamide.

### Chronic hepatitis B finite treatment: similar and different concerns with new drug classes [^115HBoUB]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B, a major cause of liver disease and cancer, affects over 250 million people worldwide. Currently, there is no cure, only suppressive therapies. Efforts to develop finite curative hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapies are underway, consisting of combinations of multiple novel agents with or without nucleos(t)ide reverse-transcriptase inhibitors. The HBV Forum convened a webinar in July 2021, along with subsequent working group discussions to address how and when to stop finite therapy for demonstration of sustained off-treatment efficacy and safety responses. Participants included leading experts in academia, clinical practice, pharmaceutical companies, patient representatives, and regulatory agencies.

This Viewpoints article outlines areas of consensus within our multistakeholder group for stopping finite therapies in chronic hepatitis B investigational studies, including trial design, patient selection, outcomes, biomarkers, predefined stopping criteria, predefined retreatment criteria, duration of investigational therapies, and follow-up after stopping therapy. Future research of unmet needs is also discussed.

### Hepatitis C virus therapy update 2013 [^1143pyxz]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

We review here the recent literature regarding hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy through January 2013, discussing therapies, targets for new therapies, and what might be expected in this rapidly changing field.

- **Recent findings**: Boceprevir-based and telaprevir-based triple therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin marked the beginning of a new era in HCV therapy for genotype 1 patients. New direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are being developed, and new antiviral drug targets are being explored. New combination treatment regimens are expected to emerge soon, and there is hope for interferon-free regimens.

- **Summary**: The standard of care for treatment of HCV genotype 1 changed dramatically with the approval of two new DAA drugs — telaprevir and boceprevir — for use in pegylated interferon-based and ribavirin-based triple therapy in mid-2011. Experience has shown improved response rates and treatment durations for many patients with genotype 1 HCV infection. However, persistent limitations to HCV treatment still exist for patients with prior treatment failure and comorbid conditions. Patients on newer therapies suffer additional therapy-limiting side effects and drug-drug interactions. Genetic testing may provide some guidance, but additional options for therapy are still needed for HCV. Many new drugs are currently under investigation, and there is hope that effective and well-tolerated interferon-free regimens may become a part of future therapy.

### EASL 2017 clinical practice guidelines on the management of hepatitis B virus infection [^113oZbut]. Journal of Hepatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hepatitis B virus infection, particularly in the choice of antiviral regimens, the EASL 2017 guidelines recommend initiating long-term, potent nucleoside/nucleotide analogs with a high barrier to resistance as the treatment of choice, regardless of the severity of the liver disease. These analogs should be initiated in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, irrespective of the level of HBV replication, and assessment for liver transplantation should be conducted.

### Novel approaches for therapy of chronic hepatitis C [^1138pYYJ]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2006). Low credibility.

Currently available anti-HCV therapy is effective in only half of the patients and is limited by side effects that often necessitate discontinuation. Therefore, new treatment strategies are being developed, including:

- **Optimization of regimens**: Improving current treatment protocols to enhance efficacy and reduce side effects.
- **Use of additional agents**: Implementing drugs working via novel mechanisms to target the virus more effectively.
- **Anti-fibrotic strategies**: Developing strategies to prevent or reduce liver fibrosis associated with chronic hepatitis C.

Many new antiviral compounds are now being studied in preclinical and clinical trials. This review will focus on drugs that have already entered the stage of phase 2 or phase 3 studies.

### Amantadine in treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^116W8a75]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2005). Low credibility.

The treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) continues to be an important and growing challenge. As the response rate to FDA-approved treatment has improved over the past decade, there is an increasing number of difficult-to-treat patients, such as those who have failed prior antiviral therapy. The role of amantadine in the treatment of CHC remains unclear. Studies thus far have produced conflicting results, and type II error could not be excluded. This review summarizes results published in the literature from 1997 to 2003 and reviews the existing questions and controversies regarding the use of amantadine. Literature suggests that amantadine is ineffective as monotherapy. However, amantadine increased the sustained virologic response of certain treatment-naïve patients when used in combination with interferon and may be effective as an adjunct to interferon-based combination therapy in some patients who have failed or relapsed on prior therapy. Factors such as small sample size, patient characteristics, and differences in treatment protocols, including amantadine preparation and duration of therapy, might explain the conflicting observations of various studies. Further investigations are needed to define the optimal dosing and formulation of amantadine and its appropriate role in the management of CHC infection.

### Viral hepatitis [^1112ZDD1]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Viral hepatitis constitutes the most common entity seen in hepatology practice. Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended for patients with chronic hepatitis. Both lamivudine and interferon are established therapies against chronic hepatitis B, with other treatments not equally effective. Adefovir dipivoxil is a promising new treatment for lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B mutants. Lamivudine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin are effective in preventing recurrence of hepatitis B after transplantation. The combination of interferon and ribavirin has been shown to be effective for treatment of hepatitis C. Studies support the antiviral, antifibrotic, and antineoplastic effects of interferon therapy. Recurrence of hepatitis C after transplantation has been associated with more rapid progression to cirrhosis. Other major advances in the field of viral hepatitis during the past year are highlighted.

### Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis: is this a "dead-end" [^114bWvUT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

As already outlined, prednisolone treatment increased the rate of infectious complications in the STOPAH trial. This adverse effect, paired with the absence of long-term benefit, should make clinicians use prednisolone with vigilance. The Lille model, using common baseline variables and the evolution of bilirubin after one week of treatment, can identify patients at risk of death early in the course of prednisolone treatment, thus providing a tool for adjusting treatment. In contrast, the use of pentoxifylline can be completed uneventfully and without enhanced monitoring.

Overall, we believe that prednisolone did not show adequate effectiveness to be generally recommended, and pentoxifylline may have been tested in a population that did not allow its beneficial effect on renal function to be exerted. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis showed that prednisolone is not the only effective pharmacological agent for alcoholic hepatitis. Pentoxifylline was also shown to be effective, although its use is supported by weaker evidence than prednisolone. We propose that the use of each agent in clinical practice should be tailored to each individual patient's characteristics. Careful selection of drug, close monitoring, and early assessment of response (when prednisolone is used) can increase success rates in the treatment of this dreadful condition.

### Hepatitis C in clinical practice [^1136EAku]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus infection is now one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease. Primary care physicians play a crucial role in the diagnosis and initial workup of patients infected with this virus. Understanding which patients may be at risk is the first step. By understanding the correct use of hepatitis C virus diagnostic testing and the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy, providers will be better equipped to screen and counsel their patients.

### How will we manage acute HCV in men having sex with men in the era of all oral therapy [^115Vex4M]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2015). Low credibility.

With the advent of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (CHC) has been revolutionized. Modern interferon- and potentially also ribavirin-free combinations, consisting of 2 or 3 direct-acting antivirals (DAA), promise sustained virological response rates (SVR) of above 90%. This coincides with much shorter treatment durations and a much more favorable toxicity profile. Some DAAs even work across all HCV genotypes (pangenotypic) [BMJ, 349, 2014, g3308]. Lastly, HCV treatment in HIV-coinfected patients will no longer differ from HCV-monoinfected patients, as response rates under DAA in the setting of HCV-HIV coinfection have been as good as in HCV-monoinfected patients [J Hepatol, 61, 2014, 373]. Only drug-drug interactions with the new DAAs and concomitant antiretroviral therapy have to be accounted for due to shared metabolization pathways via the cytochrome p450 system.

### Fomepizole therapy for acetaminophen-induced liver failure in an infant [^111dvoBE]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Acetaminophen overdose is common in the pediatric population. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is effective at preventing liver injury in most patients when started shortly after the overdose. Delays to therapy increase the risk of hepatotoxicity and liver failure that may necessitate organ transplant. Animal studies have demonstrated that fomepizole may provide added benefit in acetaminophen overdose because of its ability to block the metabolic pathway that produces the toxic acetaminophen metabolite and its downstream inhibition of oxidative stress pathways that lead to cell death. Several adult case reports describe the use of fomepizole in patients at higher risk for poor outcomes despite NAC.

We describe a case of a 7-month-old female who presented in acute liver failure with persistently elevated acetaminophen concentration secondary to repeated supratherapeutic doses of acetaminophen to manage fever. Fomepizole and NAC antidotes were used in the management of the patient. She fully recovered despite demonstrating multiple markers of poor outcome on initial presentation. Although randomized trials are lacking, this case suggests that fomepizole may safely provide additional benefit in pediatric patients at risk for severe acetaminophen toxicity.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1126KhDE]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients undergoing antiviral therapy, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend initiating direct-acting antiviral treatment with an approved regimen in all pediatric and adolescent patients aged 3 years and older who have HCV infection, regardless of disease severity.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111HRdAV]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances related to hepatitis C virus infection, especially concerning patients with HBV co-infection, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining HBsAg for the assessment of active HBV coinfection. Additionally, HBV core antibodies and HBV surface antibodies should be assessed for prior infection in all patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV infection.

### Global adverse events reported for direct-acting antiviral therapies for the treatment of hepatitis C: an analysis of the World Health Organization VigiBase [^111UP2tq]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for the treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) have demonstrated sustained virologic response rates in 90% of patients and have greatly lessened the burden of HCV disease globally. Since sofosbuvir was approved as the first DAA in 2013, numerous other DAAs have come to market with new mechanisms of action, combinations, and genotype activity, broadening their clinical indications and expanding use worldwide. While 71 million persons have been diagnosed with HCV infection and over five million patients have been treated with DAAs globally, studies to identify potential rare adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are scarce.

Clinical trials identified few serious ADRs associated with DAAs, and so DAAs are considered generally safe. However, trials are limited in their ability to detect rare ADRs due to power limitations and are often suboptimal for identifying ADRs that occur in 'real-world' conditions due to trial inclusion criteria. For example, some patients receiving DAA therapy in practice may have more comorbidities, previous HCV treatment, or be of older age than those included in studies from which safety data are derived. Therefore, postmarketing surveillance is essential to identify potential safety signals.

DAAs are critical for patient care, yet exploration of potential rare ADRs for future study is important to identify if some patients may benefit from treatment with one DAA over another, or if additional monitoring during therapy is needed. Thus, on a global scale, we aimed to describe ADR reports of DAA therapies overall, and by specific classifications.

### Pangenotypic direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^1176vbVV]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Guidelines issued by the WHO are developed through an iterative process to address areas of uncertainty and unmet guidance needs. These processes are explicit and transparent, involving consultation with several multidisciplinary stakeholders to ensure benefits and barriers are evaluated systematically and comprehensively. Importantly, the evidence used to develop these guidelines is publicly available.

This review is one component of the evidence considered in developing the 2018 guideline on the care and treatment of persons diagnosed with chronic HCV infection. We summarize SVR12 and harm outcomes for three pangenotypic DAA regimens — sofosbuvir-velpatasvir, sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir — as well as sofosbuvir-ledipasvir, which were of particular relevance to decision-makers. Evidence for sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was considered, as countries where HCV is largely isolated to a single genotype have had success managing care with this non-pangenotypic regimen.

Across treatments, outcomes for persons with genotype 1 infection were the best represented, reflecting the high prevalence of this strain in the United States and Europe. In the overall population analyses, all treatments were associated with high rates of SVR12 across genotypes 1 through 4. These findings were generally consistent across stratifications by treatment experience. While the rates of SVR12 were again high across treatments for persons with cirrhosis and genotype 1 infection, relatively limited evidence was available for genotype 2, 3, or 4 infection.

### Hepatitis C direct-acting antiviral agents: Changing the paradigm of hepatitis C treatment in HIV-infected patients [^115dFRJ6]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease is a major source of mortality in HIV-infected patients. Approximately one-third of all patients with HIV are co-infected with HCV. Patients co-infected with HIV/HCV have shown lower rates of sustained virologic response with pegylated-interferon and weight-based ribavirin, as well as more rapid progression of fibrosis than those with HCV mono-infection. Several direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs), developed originally for HCV mono-infection, are being reevaluated for HIV/HCV co-infection. Additionally, entirely new DAAs are being developed, including interferon-free regimens with fewer side effects, allowing novel treatment opportunities for difficult-to-treat patients.

In order for HCV DAAs to be successfully used in the HIV/HCV co-infected population, several hurdles must be overcome, including adverse event management and drug-drug interactions. The aim of this review is to discuss the results of trials for new HCV therapies being developed for HIV/HCV co-infected patients, and the impact of interferon-free regimens on treatment in the future.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1143uhAr]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, particularly concerning patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), antiviral regimens are addressed in the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines. These guidelines recommend not adjusting doses of direct-acting antiviral therapy when using recommended regimens in patients with stage 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 CKD. However, they suggest considering an adjustment of ribavirin dosage in patients with stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD.

### Antizol [^112GfWTW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2009). Low credibility.

Antizol® (fomepizole) injection is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. The chemical name of fomepizole is 4-methylpyrazole. It has the molecular formula C4H6N2 and a molecular weight of 82.1. It is a clear to yellow liquid at room temperature, with a melting point of 25°C (77°F), and may present as a solid at lower temperatures. Fomepizole is soluble in water and very soluble in ethanol, diethyl ether, and chloroform. Each vial contains 1.5 mL (1 g/mL) of fomepizole.

### Identification of the best direct-acting antiviral regimen for patients with hepatitis C virus genotype 3 infection: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114VUaHr]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are effective in treating chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although results for patients infected with genotype 3 are suboptimal. Several regimens are available; however, direct comparisons have not been made and are unlikely to occur. We aimed to identify the most effective DAA regimen for patients infected with HCV genotype 3 and to assess the role of ribavirin.

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through March 2016. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to indirectly compare regimens in patients with and without cirrhosis. We calculated mean estimated sustained virologic response (SVR) with 95% credible intervals (95% CrI) per regimen and evaluated the effect of ribavirin as an odds ratio, focusing on recommended regimens and those under evaluation by regulatory authorities.

Our search identified 2167 articles; 27 studies (comprising 3415 patients) were included.

- **Patients without cirrhosis**: The highest SVR rates were estimated for those receiving sofosbuvir + velpatasvir with ribavirin (99%; 95% CrI, 98%-100%) and without ribavirin (97%; 95% CrI, 95%-99%), sofosbuvir + daclatasvir + ribavirin (96%; 95% CrI, 92%-98%), and sofosbuvir + peginterferon + ribavirin (95%; 95% CrI, 91%-98%), all for 12 weeks.

### Treating hepatitis C: Current standard of care and emerging direct-acting antiviral agents [^114UmH12]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

During the late 1990s and early 2000s, major advances were made in the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Interferon, combination interferon plus ribavirin (RBV), and pegylated interferon plus RBV increased sustained virologic response (SVR) rates from approximately 5% to 40–80%, depending on the genotype of the HCV infection. Advances in molecular biology have allowed investigators to begin understanding the mechanisms of HCV infection and replication. Developments in the understanding of viral kinetics have provided tools to identify patients who are most likely to attain SVR.

With the advances in the science of HCV infection, the first part of the 21st century has seen the development and early introduction of several direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs. These novel medications interfere with critical steps in HCV replication and have the potential to significantly increase SVR rates. This article reviews the key elements of HCV replication and evaluates the various classes of new and investigational DAAs that have the potential to create a revolution in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis C virus infection, particularly in the context of pretreatment evaluation, the AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining the following laboratory tests before initiating direct-acting therapy:

- **HCV RNA (viral load)**: This test is essential for determining the presence and amount of hepatitis C virus in the blood.

- **HCV genotype and subtype**: This is recommended if a non-pan-genotypic direct-acting antiviral therapy will be prescribed. Understanding the genotype and subtype of the virus can aid in customizing the treatment approach.

### What are the benefits of a sustained virologic response to direct-acting antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection [^111keHht]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens are safe and effective at eradicating hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Unfortunately, DAAs remain expensive, so treating all HCV-infected patients would substantially affect health care costs. It is therefore important to continue to assess the hepatic and extrahepatic benefits of a DAA-induced sustained virologic response (SVR). A DAA-induced SVR reduces a patient's risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and extrahepatic manifestations of HCV infection; there are also data indicating that an SVR can reduce mortality.

SVR is a relevant clinical end point, but further analyses are required to confirm its importance among diverse HCV-infected populations and to document the public health benefits of HCV elimination at the population level. We review the evidence for the benefits associated with SVRs in different clinical settings and challenges.

Fourteen of 16 patients in the ethylene glycol trial and 7 of 11 patients in the methanol trial underwent hemodialysis because of severe intoxication (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). All patients received Antizol® shortly after admission. The results of these two studies provide evidence that Antizol® blocks ethylene glycol and methanol metabolism mediated by alcohol dehydrogenase in the clinical setting. In both studies, plasma concentrations of toxic metabolites of ethylene glycol and methanol failed to rise in the initial phases of treatment. The relationship to Antizol® therapy, however, was confounded by hemodialysis and sig

### Hepatitis C therapeutics: Current status and emerging strategies [^117ADiVc]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2002). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an emerging global epidemic. The development of effective HCV antiviral therapeutics remains a daunting challenge due to the absence of adequate animal models and tissue-culture systems for the analysis and propagation of the virus. Despite these obstacles, inhibitors targeting the replicative elements of HCV, immune modulators, and non-specific hepatoprotective agents are being pursued, and exciting progress has been made. Successful therapeutic intervention for HCV will probably require combination approaches, as well as new strategies, including the discovery of host drug targets.

### Hepatitis C treatment highlights from the 2011 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease meeting [^114XSSfP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

The development of more effective hepatitis C (HCV) antivirals has progressed rapidly. The addition of orally administered medications that target the virus, known as direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), to pegylated interferon and ribavirin has dramatically increased sustained virologic response rates in genotype 1-infected patients. However, the side effect profile remains challenging, and the dosing schedule is complicated.

The DAAs currently in development hold the promise of once- or twice-daily dosing schedules, improved tolerance profiles, higher resistance barriers, and pan-genotypic antiviral activity. Emerging interferon-sparing combination DAA data indicate that interferon is not essential to achieve a sustained virological response. This advancement will expand the proportion of HCV-infected patients who can be considered for therapy and will allow for better-tolerated regimens.

Expertise in HCV antiviral resistance, drug metabolism, drug-drug interactions, and the optimization of drug adherence are now key requirements in the DAA era.

### Hepatitis C virus treatment: Simplifying the simple and optimizing the difficult [^115es1Fx]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The availability of safe, efficacious, oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) has ushered in a new era of hepatitis C treatment with the potential to eliminate hepatitis C as a public health threat. To achieve population-level effectiveness of these oral DAAs, hepatitis C treatment by a wide range of providers in different settings is essential to increase the number of persons treated. We provide a clinical review of hepatitis C treatment with a focus on practical tools for the management of hepatitis C in the majority of currently infected individuals who can be easily cured and on the optimization of treatment for those in whom treatment may not be as simple.

### Treatment failure and resistance with direct-acting antiviral drugs against hepatitis C virus [^116ZSv2H]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is based on the combination of pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin. The recent development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) molecules that are active on HCV, together with in vitro and in vivo studies showing that these drugs may lead to the selection of resistant viruses if administered alone, has raised concerns that resistance may undermine therapy based on DAAs.

A new standard-of-care treatment will soon be available for both treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients infected with HCV genotype 1. This new approach will be based on a triple combination of pegylated interferon-α, ribavirin, and a protease inhibitor (either telaprevir or boceprevir). Most failures to eradicate infection in treatment-adherent patients are due to an inadequate response to pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin, in the context of a low genetic barrier to resistance of first-generation protease inhibitors.

This article reviews:

- **Resistance patterns**: Patterns of resistance to HCV DAA drugs in development.
- **Mechanisms of treatment failure**: The mechanisms underlying treatment failure when these drugs are combined with pegylated interferon-α and ribavirin.

### Direct-acting antiviral agents and the path to interferon independence [^113wVjhr]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health problem; there are approximately 120 to 130 million chronic infections worldwide. Since the discovery of HCV 24 years ago, there has been a relentless effort to develop successful antiviral therapies. Studies of interferon-α-based therapies have helped define treatment parameters, and these treatment strategies have cured a substantial percentage of patients.

However, interferon-α must be injected, leading to problems with tolerability, adherence, and incomplete response in a large percentage of patients. New drug candidates designed to target the virus or the host have recently been introduced at an unprecedented pace. In phase I-III studies, these agents have exceeded expectations and achieved rates of response previously not thought possible. We are, therefore, entering a new era of therapy for HCV infection and interferon independence.

### The new paradigm of hepatitis C therapy: integration of oral therapies into best practices [^1119tiEq]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Emerging data indicate that all-oral antiviral treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) will become a reality in the near future. In replacing interferon-based therapies, all-oral regimens are expected to be more tolerable, more effective, shorter in duration, and simpler to administer. Coinciding with new treatment options are novel methodologies for disease screening and staging, which create the possibility of more timely care and treatment.

Assessments of histologic damage typically are performed using liver biopsy, yet non-invasive assessments have become the norm in some European countries and are becoming more widespread in the United States. Also in place are new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) initiatives to simplify testing, improve provider and patient awareness, and expand recommendations for HCV screening beyond risk-based strategies. Issued in 2012, the CDC recommendations aim to increase HCV testing among those with the greatest HCV burden in the United States by recommending one-time testing for all persons born during 1945–1965. In 2013, the United States Preventive Services Task Force adopted similar recommendations for risk-based and birth-cohort-based testing.

Taken together, the developments in screening, diagnosis, and treatment will likely increase demand for therapy and stimulate a shift in the delivery of care related to chronic HCV, with increased involvement of primary care and infectious disease specialists. Yet even in this new era of therapy, barriers to curing patients of HCV will exist. Overcoming these barriers will be essential to fully realizing the potential of these innovations.

### Antiviral treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infections: the past, the present and the future [^114tMW5w]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2007). Low credibility.

A decade ago, the standard therapy against chronic hepatitis B virus infections consisted only of lamivudine or IFN-alpha. Treatment with lamivudine and IFN has been compounded by the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains and the appearance of serious side effects, respectively. In the last 10 years, hepatitis B treatment has made significant progress. Several treatments are now licensed for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B, and others are under development. Here, we provide an overview of the potential and mode of action of anti-HBV agents that are currently available and/or may become available in the near future. Foremost among these newer compounds are adefovir dipivoxil, entecavir, and telbivudine.

### Can therapy of hepatitis C affect the development of hepatocellular carcinoma [^117QgdA2]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic inflammation induced by viral infections and their role in carcinogenesis is well recognized. Two hepatotropic viruses, hepatitis B and hepatitis C (HCV), have been linked worldwide to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although orthotopic liver transplant offers the best chance for cure and long-term survival, the demand for organs far outweighs the supply. The incidence of HCC in the United States has increased over the past three decades. HCV-induced cirrhosis is believed to play a significant role in the rising rate of HCC. Therefore, primary measures to prevent HCC in HCV-infected patients are urgently needed. Numerous studies of the HCV HCC patient have considered primary treatment with interferon-based therapy; however, secondary prevention currently seems to carry more promise. This article evaluates and assesses various treatments for primary and secondary chemoprevention in the setting of HCV.

### Management of hepatitis B: Our practice and how it relates to the guidelines [^113Q5MEG]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Seven drugs have been approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. Antiviral treatment has been shown to be effective in suppressing hepatitis B virus replication, decreasing inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, and preventing the progression of liver disease. However, medications do not eradicate hepatitis B virus; therefore, a key question is which patients need to start treatment and which patients can be monitored. Professional societies have developed guidelines to assist physicians in the recognition, diagnosis, and optimal management of patients with chronic hepatitis B.

These guidelines suggest preferred approaches, and physicians are expected to exercise clinical judgment to determine the most appropriate management based on the circumstances of the individual patient. This article reviews recommendations in hepatitis B guidelines and the basis for those recommendations, and we discuss what we do in our practice to illustrate factors that may influence decisions regarding hepatitis B management.

### Emerging therapeutic targets for hepatitis C virus infection [^111j5ETr]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a rapidly evolving field wherein traditional treatment with the nonspecific antiviral agents pegylated interferon (IFN)-alfa and ribavirin has been and will continue to be supplanted by combinations of targeted therapies against HCV, with and without concomitant pegylated IFN and/or ribavirin, resulting in markedly superior rates of viral clearance. Exhaustive study of HCV structure and replication through the development of in vitro systems has enabled the development of numerous novel direct-acting antiviral agents that currently are undergoing clinical trials. As our understanding of the HCV virus and its antiviral targets increases, the future of HCV therapy holds the promise of high rates of viral eradication in all patient populations, many or all of whom will be treatable with IFN-free combinations of all-oral agents.

### Acute hepatitis C: current status and remaining challenges [^1158mqGp]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

The acute phase of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represents a key point in the evolution of hepatitis C. In some patients, the infection resolves spontaneously, whereas in others, it develops into chronic disease. However, because acute hepatitis C is often asymptomatic, detection and diagnosis are usually difficult. What is more, there are no established treatment guidelines, leaving physicians to make several challenging decisions, such as whether to treat, when to treat, and what treatment regimen to use.

Pegylated interferon alfa monotherapy is most commonly used to treat patients with acute hepatitis C; the role of ribavirin has yet to be established. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology of acute hepatitis C, its risk factors, and routes of transmission and treatment practices. We also discuss data from published clinical studies and focus on unresolved issues for which additional studies are needed in order to establish standardized treatment guidelines for the management of acute hepatitis C.

### Pangenotypic direct acting antivirals for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^115QQ2oP]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

In 2017, the World Health Organization established a target to eliminate chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by the year 2030. A recent mathematical model suggests that by focusing public health programs on preventing infection in persons who do not inject drugs, providing harm reduction services to persons who inject drugs, and expanding HCV diagnosis services and treatments to 90% of infected persons, the global elimination goal is achievable by 2032. Nonetheless, challenges persist. Political barriers will need to be overcome while securing funding from national and international public health sources. This is complicated by diminishing investments in global health funding and trends toward universal health coverage and away from disease-specific programming. However, several countries, such as Brazil and Australia, have developed innovative approaches to funding HCV programs.

Prior to 2014, HCV treatment centered on the use of interferon-based regimens with generally low cure rates, long durations of therapy, and substantial toxicity. The introduction of highly effective and well-tolerated short-course oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy without interferon that can cure HCV infection with high rates of sustained virological response (SVR) within weeks has transformed the treatment landscape. In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) updated its guidelines for the screening, care, and treatment of persons with HCV infection to recommend DAA-based regimens in place of IFN-based regimens. Since the publication of the 2016 guidelines, DAA regimens have been increasingly adopted.

### Direct-acting antiviral therapy for treatment of acute and recent hepatitis C virus infection: A narrative review [^114hUdCS]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Following the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989, three decades of basic, translational, and clinical research culminated in the development of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, which is a curative oral treatment for HCV infection. The availability of DAA therapy revolutionized HCV clinical management, including acute (duration of infection < 6 months) and recent (duration of infection < 12 months) infection. Several DAA regimens, including the contemporary pan-genotypic combinations of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir and glecaprevir-pibrentasvir, have been shown to be safe and effective among people with acute and recent HCV infection, highlighting their potential in an HCV controlled human infection model. This article describes the natural history and management of acute and recent HCV infection in the era of DAA therapy and outlines a strategy for the use of DAA therapies in the setting of an HCV controlled human infection model.

### Expert opinion on the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C [^111p6tUR]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

A major problem for physicians managing patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is addressing patients with an end-of-treatment virological response but no sustained virological response (SVR), known as relapsers, or patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA detectable at the end of treatment with standard therapy, known as non-responders.

Re-treatment of relapsers is more likely to yield favorable results than re-treatment of non-responders. Re-treatment with peginterferon plus ribavirin (RBV) has been investigated in patients who relapsed after interferon monotherapy or interferon plus RBV therapy. Patients who have relapsed following treatment with standard interferon-based regimens often respond to re-treatment with peginterferon plus RBV. In these patients, SVR rates of 41–59% have been reported.

Response to re-treatment is most likely in non-genotype 1 patients, those with mild or moderate fibrosis, and patients with low viral load at baseline. Peginterferon plus RBV re-treatment should therefore be considered for all patients who have previously responded to a conventional interferon-based regimen and subsequently relapsed.

We have outlined the many challenges that lie ahead for healthcare providers as we attempt to reverse the rising morbidity and mortality associated with HCV. The new opportunities afforded by screening and improved diagnostics, education, and treatment have created great excitement both in the medical community and in our patients. These opportunities raise the prospect of eradicating HCV-related liver disease and eventually transmission. In the United States, HCV has all the attributes of an eradicable disease, except for sufficient public investment. Delivering care effectively, safely, and broadly to all patient populations in an economically acceptable fashion must be our goal now and over the next 5–10 years.

The treatment of hepatitis C has dramatically improved over the past decade. Unlike any other chronic viral infection, a significant proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis C can be cured. However, the standard therapy, which includes pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin, has its limitations. There is limited efficacy in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, and the side effect profile necessitates the development of new therapeutic approaches. This review describes the efficacy and optimization of the standard therapy of hepatitis C and its problems in special patient populations. New treatment directions beyond interferon alpha-based therapies are on the horizon.

### Hepatitis C: How should we manage the patient [^111v91ch]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2004). Low credibility.

The patient with HCV infection may present with a variety of problems, ranging from the asymptomatic patient with mild liver damage to a patient presenting with complications of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis of hepatitis C may be a complete surprise to the patient or an expected diagnosis in someone with known risk factors. Similarly, the physician may be faced with a patient who knows very little about hepatitis C or someone who has read extensively on the subject.

The initial consultation is useful for gaining information on the patient's background. A physical examination may provide clinical clues on the stage of liver disease. The consultation offers the physician an opportunity to educate the patient on hepatitis C and to organize confirmatory and other investigations that will help decide on the next line of management, such as whether the patient is a candidate for combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin.

### Antiviral therapy for hepatitis B virus infections: new targets and technical challenges [^116LU9gE]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2002). Low credibility.

There are presently only two licensed therapies for treating liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV): interferon-alpha and lamivudine. Neither agent was specifically developed as an antiviral compound for treating patients infected with HBV. Both therapies are limited in the clinic by a low response rate; in the case of lamivudine, selection of drug-resistant mutants is an issue, while troublesome side effects limit the use of interferon-alpha.

Several promising nucleoside/nucleotide analogues are undergoing clinical trials, including adefovir dipivoxil and entecavir, both of which appear to be active against lamivudine-resistant HBV. In addition to these nucleoside/nucleotide analogues, it will be important to develop new agents with different modes of action. These can be added to the antiviral cocktails that will be required to adequately suppress and hopefully eliminate HBV replication.

### Hepatitis C virus genotype 3: Clinical features, current and emerging viral inhibitors, future challenges [^115gjo9K]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a global burden on healthcare that affects over 150 million people worldwide. In the past, HCV genotype 3 was considered difficult to treat relative to other genotypes. Genotype 3 has been associated with a higher rate of complications, including fatty liver disease, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality. However, with the advent of first- and second-generation direct-acting antivirals, genotype 3 can be treated effectively. Additionally, these new drugs are well tolerated by patients and have significantly fewer side effects compared to ribavirin and interferon-based regimens.

However, while great strides have been made in overcoming biological barriers, our next challenge lies in overcoming economic and financial obstacles if we are to eradicate HCV genotype 3. Herein, we review the clinical features associated with HCV genotype 3 and emerging treatment regimens, and challenges associated with treatment.

### Is 3 the new 1: Perspectives on virology, natural history and treatment for hepatitis C genotype 3 [^111NUBB3]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Affecting 2–3% of the world's population, hepatitis C is a common viral infection and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Hepatitis C genotype 1 is the dominant viral genotype among Western patients. Over the last 20 years, during the era of interferon-based therapy, it was far more difficult to treat than genotypes 2 and 3. Accordingly, significant research focused on new antiviral agents for the dominant genotype 1 patients. Now, as promising specific treatments are being introduced for genotype 1, the attention of clinicians and researchers has turned back to the 50–70 million patients infected with a nongenotype 1 hepatitis C. Furthermore, after recent, larger randomized trials, it has been realized that genotype 2 is truly interferon sensitive, while genotype 3 patients are far less successful with therapy. In this fundamentally altered landscape, genotype 3 is now potentially the most difficult to treat and an area of intense research for new drug development. Herein we review the virology, natural history, and treatment of genotype 3 hepatitis C.

Pretreatment characteristics and potential biomarkers that may predict response must be systematically collected and analyzed as part of clinical trials. Six months after discontinuation of all therapies is a pragmatic choice for establishing "sustained" HBsAg loss. However, there may be more seroreversions to HBsAg positivity beyond 6 months, and HBsAg loss may increase over time, highlighting the need for longer-term follow-up studies of new drugs.

### Host-targeting agents for prevention and treatment of chronic hepatitis C - perspectives and challenges [^112iBLNd]. Journal of Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major cause of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. Furthermore, HCV-induced liver disease is a major indication for liver transplantation. In recent years, direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) targeting HCV enzymes have been developed. DAAs increase the virologic response to anti-HCV therapy but may lead to the selection of drug-resistant variants and treatment failure. At the time of writing, strategies to prevent HCV infection are still lacking, and antiviral therapy for immunocompromised patients, patients with advanced liver disease, and those co-infected with HIV/HCV remains limited.

Alternative or complementary approaches to address the limitations of antiviral therapies include boosting the host's innate immunity or interfering with host factors required for pathogenesis. Host-targeting agents (HTAs) provide an interesting perspective for novel antiviral strategies against viral hepatitis since they have:

- **A high genetic barrier to resistance**: This makes them more effective in avoiding resistance issues common with traditional therapies.
- **Pan-genotypic antiviral activity**: They are effective across various strains of the virus.
- **Complementary mechanisms of action to DAAs**: This synergy allows HTAs to work alongside standard care or DAAs in clinical development.

This review highlights HTAs against HCV infection that have potential as novel antivirals and are currently in preclinical or clinical development.

### Global hepatitis elimination 2030: Immediate action is the need of the hour [^113fRJjz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

The disease we know today as viral hepatitis can be traced back to 5th century Greece as epidemics of jaundice, along with multiple documented outbreaks in the 19th and 20th centuries. Hepatitis is caused by a group of viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E. Hepatitis A and E are spread from infected food and water, whereas hepatitis B, C, and D are spread by infected blood and bodily fluids. Hepatitis A and E usually cause self-limiting disease, but the bulk of global health issues are due to hepatitis B and C. These two viruses can cause chronic hepatitis and are the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Viral hepatitis is the second leading viral cause of death globally after COVID-19.

Viral hepatitis is more prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), which account for 80% of the global hepatitis burden. Of these, Bangladesh, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, and Vietnam, along with the Russian Federation, are responsible for two-thirds of this burden.

In April 2024, the WHO released its first report at the World Hepatitis Summit in Lisbon, Portugal. An estimated 254 million people are living with hepatitis B and 50 million are living with hepatitis C globally. In 2022, 2.2 million people were newly infected by viral hepatitis, with 1.2 million being hepatitis B infections and nearly 1.0 million hepatitis C infections. The report also estimated that the number of deaths from viral hepatitis increased from 1.1 million in 2019 to 1.3 million in 2022, caused mainly by hepatitis B (83%) and hepatitis C (17%).

### Focus on drug interactions: The challenge of treating hepatitis C virus infection with direct-acting antiviral drugs in the HIV-positive patient [^113pPoB6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The successful treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is necessary for the survival of HIV-infected patients. This review covers the outcomes of therapy, first-generation HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), and their drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs). Understanding DDIs between HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) and the DAAs in development is important to ensure the best management of HIV/HCV coinfected individuals.

The two first-in-class DAAs were approved for clinical use in 2011. Initial trials with boceprevir or telaprevir, added to standard therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients, revealed that triple therapy is efficacious with significantly improved sustained virological response rates. However, these DAAs were associated with more severe adverse effects and significant DDIs with multiple drugs, including ART. Early data on DAAs in development suggest improved efficacy and safety and the potential for fewer DDIs.

Anti-HCV therapy is fundamental in coinfected patients, but the approved therapies are suboptimal. The first generation of approved HCV DAAs improved the efficacy of therapy in coinfected patients but have multiple safety concerns, including potentially serious drug interactions with ART. Early results from newer DAAs are promising.

### Genetically modified interferon: Is there a consensus yet [^117NYesR]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection has evolved during the last decade from interferon monotherapy to combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin. National and international guidelines recommend either 6 or 12 months of interferon/ribavirin combination therapy depending on the pre-treatment virological status of the patient. However, the choice for second-line treatment of patients who do not achieve sustained viral clearance with combination therapy has yet to be defined.

This commentary examines previously published studies of the use of consensus interferon for patients with hepatitis C virus infection. The characteristics of the treated populations and their response to treatment are evaluated, and potential roles for this type of interferon in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection are considered.

### Hepatitis C virus genotype 3: Clinical features, current and emerging viral inhibitors, future challenges [^116iQGYN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents a global burden on healthcare, affecting over 150 million people worldwide. In the past, HCV genotype 3 was considered difficult to treat relative to other genotypes. Genotype 3 is associated with a higher rate of complications, including fatty liver disease, fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and mortality. However, with the advent of first- and second-generation direct-acting antivirals, genotype 3 can be treated effectively. These new drugs are well tolerated by patients and have significantly fewer side effects compared to ribavirin and interferon-based regimens.

Despite these advancements, the next challenge lies in overcoming economic and financial obstacles to eradicate HCV genotype 3. This review discusses the clinical features associated with HCV genotype 3, emerging treatment regimens, and challenges associated with treatment.

### Omeprazole-induced hepatitis [^117SHWDg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Omeprazole, the first proton pump inhibitor (PPI) showing effective acid inhibitory ability, provides satisfactory therapy for gastro-esophageal reflux symptom relief and healing of erosive esophagitis. It is also effective in treating peptic ulcer disease. At the time of writing, the efficacy and safety of omeprazole were well established in many trials. However, omeprazole-related hepatotoxicity is not well recognized, especially in the pediatric population. We report a case of a child who developed hepatitis following omeprazole intake, and we believe this is the first case report of omeprazole-induced hepatitis in the pediatric population.

### Ribavirin [^115tDwao]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ribavirin capsules are a nucleoside analogue indicated for use in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated) for the treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) in patients aged 3 years and older with compensated liver disease. Patients with the following characteristics are less likely to benefit from re-treatment after failing a course of therapy: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection.

- **Chronic hepatitis C (CHC)**: Ribavirin capsules, when used in combination with interferon alfa-2b (pegylated and nonpegylated), are indicated for the treatment of CHC in patients aged 3 years and older with compensated liver disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 5.10), and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

	- The following points should be considered when initiating ribavirin capsules combination therapy with PegIntron® or INTRON A®:

	- Combination therapy with ribavirin capsules/PegIntron is preferred over ribavirin capsules/INTRON A as it provides substantially better response rates [see Clinical Studies (14)].
	- Patients with the following characteristics are less likely to benefit from re-treatment after failing a course of therapy: previous nonresponse, previous pegylated interferon treatment, significant bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis, and genotype 1 infection [see Clinical Studies (14)].
	- No safety and efficacy data are available for treatment duration lasting longer than one year.

### Hepatitis C virus resistance to direct-acting antiviral drugs in interferon-free regimens [^113PegPh]. Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has progressed considerably with the approval of interferon-free, direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-based combination therapies. Although most treated patients achieve a virological cure, HCV resistance to DAAs plays an important role in the failure of interferon-free treatment regimens.

The presence of viral variants resistant to NS5A inhibitors at baseline is associated with lower rates of virological cure in certain groups of patients, such as those with genotype 1a or 3 HCV, those with cirrhosis, and prior nonresponders to pegylated interferon-based regimens. DAA-resistant HCV is generally dominant at virological failure, most often relapse.

Viruses resistant to NS3–4A protease inhibitors disappear from peripheral blood in a few weeks to months, whereas NS5A inhibitor-resistant viruses persist for years. Re-treatment options are available, but first-line treatment strategies should be optimized to efficiently prevent treatment failure due to HCV resistance.

### Retreatment of chronic hepatitis C infection: Real-world regimens and outcomes from national treatment programs in three low- and middle-income countries [^117K7BRE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Achievement of hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) relies upon a simplified public health approach and affordable generic direct acting antiviral (DAA) regimens. DAAs recommended as initial therapy combinations and available from generic manufacturers, such as sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV), cure about 95% of those treated and are available in over 100 countries. Patients who fail initial treatments should be retreated with second-line therapy. Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir (SOF/VEL/VOX) is the only evidence-based retreatment option in resource-limited settings recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), based on trials showing 96–98% sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12, i.e. cure) in patients previously treated with another DAA-based regimen. However, SOF/VEL/VOX is not available as a generic formulation and is not widely accessible in LMICs.

As access to HCV treatment in LMICs grows and more people are treated, the volume of patients requiring second-line therapy will increase. These patients need timely and effective retreatment to prevent progression of liver disease and secondary HCV transmission. In the absence of recommended regimens (e.g. SOF/VEL/VOX) for retreatment, clinicians in LMICs have utilized alternative therapeutic regimens and durations, typically based on SOF in combination with the NS5A inhibitors ledipasvir (LDV) or DCV for 12–24 weeks with or without the addition of ribavirin (RBV). Retreatment studies have been conducted with SOF/VEL+RBV and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in high-demand areas.

### The new paradigm of hepatitis C therapy: Integration of oral therapies into best practices [^114r8fz5]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

It is likely that the rapid improvements in treatment efficacy and tolerability anticipated with interferon-sparing regimens will also transform our approach to disease staging. The historic low efficacy and safety of interferon-based regimens led to the recommendation for liver staging to determine whether the benefits of treatment would outweigh the risks. For most patients, this required that there be more than just portal fibrosis. Liver biopsy was considered the best test for this purpose, but the procedure is costly, invasive, and in a small minority of cases can result in complications such as significant bleeding, organ puncture, or death. The accuracy in staging disease can often be compromised by variability in tissue sampling or interobserver or intra-observer histopathological scoring.

As treatment efficacy for genotype 2 and 3 infections improved, biopsy was no longer routinely recommended to justify treatment necessity. Continual enhancements in treatment efficacy and safety for all genotypes will change the primary goal of staging from the justification of treatment benefit to the identification of persons with cirrhosis or bridging fibrosis. These individuals may need longer treatment courses and require hepatocellular carcinoma screening and portal hypertension management. Accordingly, the most important characteristic of a staging test is the negative predictive value for the detection of cirrhosis.
