## Question

Parasite eggs in stool

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when and how to test for parasite eggs in stool, including pre-analytical steps, test selection, interpretation, and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the optimal specimen collection strategy. Next, I will examine which diagnostic modality to choose based on suspected pathogens. After that, I need to interpret results in light of sensitivity and epidemiology. Finally, I should consider special populations, treatment and public health steps, and the evolving role of molecular diagnostics, while double-checking areas where guidelines conflict or where my initial assumptions might be wrong.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability, because this drives whether stool O&P is appropriate at all. In immunocompetent patients with acute watery diarrhea under 7 days and no travel or high-risk exposures, routine O&P is not recommended; I should prioritize bacterial and viral etiologies first and reserve parasite testing for those with persistent symptoms, travel or immigration from endemic regions, immunocompromise, eosinophilia, or outbreak settings [^1127bbtn] [^112iFnqa]. Hold on, I should verify the chronic diarrhea guidance: the AGA suggests against O&P testing in chronic diarrhea without travel or recent immigration, except to test for Giardia, which is a key exception I must remember [^116QZx9f] [^1134NFay].

> Next, I should review specimen collection strategy, since egg shedding is often intermittent. Historically, three stool specimens collected over 7–10 days maximized sensitivity; wait, let me verify whether this remains universally required. The 2024 IDSA/ASM guidance supports a more cost-effective approach: obtain a second specimen if the first is negative and symptoms persist, and a third only if suspicion remains, which balances yield with resource use, though some labs still default to three samples and coccidia in particular warrant repeated sampling due to intermittent shedding [^112KmqmR] [^112iFnqa] [^113rZ85u]. I need to ensure proper transport: use parasite transport vials when available and consult the lab for preservatives and handling, especially if antigen or NAAT testing is planned [^112iFnqa] [^1119mVu5].

> I will now examine which diagnostic modality to choose based on the suspected pathogen and patient factors. For protozoa such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, and Cystoisospora, I should preferentially order targeted immunoassays or NAATs because they outperform conventional O&P for these organisms; for Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, I should specifically request modified acid-fast staining or NAATs since routine O&P may miss them, and I must remember that Cryptosporidium oocyst shedding is intermittent, so serial sampling improves detection [^116UiUUP] [^113rZ85u] [^1158WYMW]. For helminths, especially soil-transmitted helminths, microscopy with concentration remains the mainstay; Kato–Katz is the WHO-endorsed standard for quantifying eggs per gram and is useful in endemic settings, though sensitivity drops in low-intensity infections and requires trained microscopists [^113GDnmp] [^1173dLoj]. But wait, what if Strongyloides is suspected? Stool O&P is insensitive for Strongyloides, so I should request specialized methods like Baermann, agar plate culture, or serology, and consider duodenal sampling if suspicion is high and stool is negative [^117JaHZ3] [^1161Y6TC] [^1121XoZ9].

> Let me consider the role of molecular diagnostics, because I need to ensure I'm not underutilizing them. Multiplex qPCR panels markedly increase sensitivity for protozoa and can detect helminth DNA when egg burdens are low; however, I should confirm assay scope, as some commercial panels do not cover all species, and I must coordinate with the lab on specimen preservatives and inhibition controls to avoid false negatives [^114JAAwD] [^111TKFAs] [^1122ijEp]. Hold on, I should verify limitations: molecular tests may not be available for all parasites, can be confounded by inhibitors without proper extraction, and may detect nonviable material, so results must be interpreted in clinical context and, when negative but suspicion persists, complemented by microscopy or serology [^111TKFAs] [^111bBGRD].

> Now, I should interpret positive and negative results carefully, keeping sensitivity and epidemiology in mind. A positive egg identification is generally specific for the species when morphology is classic, but I must watch for abnormal egg forms that can mislead even experienced morphologists, and I should correlate with travel, exposure, and clinical picture; for example, Dicrocoelium eggs in stool may reflect spurious infection after eating liver, so a liver-free diet and repeat testing can clarify true infection versus pseudoparasitism [^111jrtEi] [^111jmZNE]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a single negative O&P reliably excludes parasitic infection; I should correct that. Sensitivity varies by pathogen and intensity: for helminths, single-sample sensitivity can be modest, and for Strongyloides it is particularly poor, so serial testing or alternative methods are often needed when clinical suspicion is high [^117JaHZ3] [^113Z9jkE]. For schistosomiasis, egg microscopy can miss light infections, and combining serology with urine CCA improves detection of active infection in migrants, which I should leverage when stool is negative but risk is substantial [^114UTxYF] [^111j36vy].

> I need to ensure I address special populations and high-risk scenarios. In immunocompromised hosts, protozoal infections are more likely to be severe and chronic, and standard O&P may not include Cryptosporidium or Cyclospora, so I should specifically request modified acid-fast staining or NAATs and consider broader evaluation including colonoscopy with biopsy for CMV or microsporidia when appropriate [^114yp9hy] [^116DfZam]. For migrants and refugees from endemic regions, eosinophilia is common and stool O&P alone is insufficient; I should add serology for Strongyloides and Schistosoma based on origin and consider presumptive therapy in selected asymptomatic patients with eosinophilia after excluding contraindications [^114NevUZ] [^116uXnnE]. In children, I should avoid reflex O&P in low-risk scenarios and align with pediatric guidance that reserves parasite testing for those with travel, immunocompromise, or persistent symptoms, while remembering that pinworm is diagnosed with perianal swabs, not stool [^113mRKvA] [^115HqWTZ].

> Next, I should review treatment and public health steps once a parasite is identified, and I need to check dosing and follow-up. For soil-transmitted helminths, albendazole or mebendazole are first-line; for schistosomiasis, praziquantel is standard, though it has limited activity against juvenile worms, so symptom timing relative to exposure matters and retreatment may be needed; for Strongyloides, ivermectin is preferred and immunocompromised patients warrant careful monitoring for hyperinfection [^113GDnmp] [^116MpZ6D] [^117JaHZ3]. I should confirm public health implications: neurocysticercosis implies a household tapeworm carrier in many cases, so screening close contacts and notifying public health may be indicated even though stool microscopy for Taenia eggs has low yield, which means I should not falsely reassure based on negative stool alone [^111SoYX8] [^114d2so6].

> I will now examine the evolving diagnostic landscape and quality assurance, because I need to ensure my lab choices reflect current capabilities. Digital microscopy and AI-assisted detection show promise for augmenting morphological diagnosis and mitigating the global decline in expert microscopists, but they complement rather than replace targeted antigen and molecular assays, and I should verify which organisms are covered by any AI model before relying on it [^112tMH7K] [^111bBGRD]. For programmatic or post-elimination surveillance, antigen and molecular biomarkers such as CAA and qPCR are increasingly important because egg microscopy lacks sensitivity at low intensities, and I should align with WHO TPPs for surveillance tools when advising public health partners [^113zZ7im] [^1173dLoj].

> Finally, let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check it against guidelines. Start with pretest probability using duration of diarrhea, travel and immigration history, immunocompromise, eosinophilia, and outbreak context; avoid low-yield O&P in acute, nontravel, immunocompetent cases and prioritize Giardia when appropriate; collect 1–3 stool samples guided by persistence of symptoms and suspected pathogen, ensuring proper preservatives; select tests strategically — NAAT or antigen assays for protozoa, microscopy with concentration for helminths, and specialized methods or serology for Strongyloides and schistosomiasis; interpret results in clinical context, repeating or adding serology or tissue sampling when suspicion remains despite negative tests; and treat per species while considering public health steps for communicable infections like Taenia carriage [^112iFnqa] [^116UiUUP] [^117JaHZ3] [^111SoYX8].

Parasite eggs in stool are best detected by **three stool samples over 7–10 days** [^112KmqmR] to overcome intermittent shedding and low sensitivity of single tests [^1158WYMW]. Use **formalin-ethyl acetate concentration** [^111qEikm] and Kato-Katz for helminths [^113GDnmp], and modified acid-fast staining for protozoa [^113rZ85u]; add antigen/NAAT for Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Entamoeba histolytica [^116UiUUP] when suspicion is high [^112iFnqa]. Interpret results with clinical context and travel history [^116zjLa6], and repeat testing or use serology if suspicion persists [^116uXnnE]. Molecular methods improve sensitivity [^114JAAwD] but are not yet standard; microscopy remains the gold standard [^112tMH7K].

## Factors influencing accuracy of stool egg detection

Several factors influence the **accuracy** of stool egg detection, including:

- **Parasite load**: Low-intensity infections are more difficult to detect [^113GDnmp].
- **Intermittent egg shedding**: Many parasites shed eggs intermittently, necessitating multiple samples [^116MpZ6D].
- **Sample quality**: Improper collection, storage, or handling can reduce detection rates [^112myRHA].
- **Laboratory expertise**: Experienced technicians are essential for accurate identification [^111bBGRD].
- **Diagnostic method used**: Molecular methods are more sensitive than traditional microscopy [^111j36vy].

## Clinical implications of parasite egg detection

Detecting parasite eggs in stool has **important clinical implications**:

- **Guiding treatment**: Identifying the specific parasite allows targeted antiparasitic therapy [^114ywQvd].
- **Public health**: Detection of parasite eggs informs public health interventions, such as mass drug administration and sanitation improvements [^1173dLoj].
- **Monitoring treatment efficacy**: Follow-up stool examinations can assess treatment response and detect reinfections [^113VNqzF].

---

## Limitations and challenges of stool egg examination

Despite its utility, stool egg examination has several **limitations and challenges**:

- **Low sensitivity**: Single-sample examinations can miss low-intensity or intermittent infections [^1158WYMW].
- **Labor-intensive**: Requires skilled personnel and significant time [^112tMH7K].
- **Limited availability**: Advanced molecular methods are not widely available in resource-limited settings [^113GDnmp].
- **Misidentification**: Morphologically similar eggs can lead to misdiagnosis [^1122ijEp].

## Recent advancements in parasite egg detection

Recent advancements have improved **parasite egg detection**, including **molecular diagnostics** — PCR and qPCR offer high sensitivity and specificity, enabling detection of low-intensity infections [^115xTWBq] — and **digital microscopy**, which enhances accuracy and reduces operator fatigue [^112tMH7K]. Artificial intelligence is being developed to automate egg detection and classification, further improving diagnostic accuracy [^112GWNuY].

### A rational approach to the stool ova and parasite examination [^1132cBTA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Examination of multiple stool specimens per patient to rule out parasitic infection continues to be recommended in the literature. Attractive alternatives have been proposed, such as examination of a single specimen, but data to support their use have been inconclusive.

Methods

We reviewed the results of comprehensive stool ova and parasite examinations performed during a 1-year period to determine the incremental value of examining > 1 specimen. Next, we implemented rejection criteria, allowing analysis of only a single specimen in most cases, and studied the impact of the change by reviewing data from a subsequent year.

Results

Prior to implementation of rejection criteria, 91% of parasites were detected in the first specimen submitted, although many clinical evaluations (72%) involved the submission of only 1 stool specimen. When at least 3 specimens were submitted, the sensitivity of examining the first in the series was 72%. Even the latter sensitivity provides negative predictive values of approximately 98%, approximately 97%, approximately 95%, or approximately 93% when the prevalence of parasites among those tested is 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20%, respectively. Examination of additional specimens after examination of the first specimen that yielded a positive finding revealed previously undetected parasites in only 10% of cases. After the application of rejection criteria, the parasite detection rate did not change significantly.

Conclusions

Comprehensive examination of a single stool specimen is sufficient for most patients, when the prevalence of infection among the tested population is up to 20%. Rational use of the stool ova and parasite examination relies on communication between clinician and laboratory, and retention of deferred specimens in case examination of additional specimens is clinically warranted.

### Parasites in human stool: to ignore or not to ignore? [^113LXjpt]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Human stool contains a myriad of microorganisms, of which the vast majority are nonpathogenic and represent an important component of the healthy microbiome. The increasing use of molecular techniques has allowed the rapid identification of bacteria, viruses and parasites in human stool. This review focuses on the 3 main classes of parasite responsible for human disease, helminths, protozoa and ectoparasites, and highlights the importance of differentiating between pathogenic and nonpathogenic parasites.

### Improvement of the diagnosis of intestinal protozoa using a multiplex qPCR strategy compared to classical microscopy: a prospective study on 3, 500 stool samples over 3 years [^114JAAwD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The role of Blastocystis spp. in clinical manifestations, including irritable bowel syndrome, is also debated. Whether its presence is a consequence or a promoter of dysbiosis remains to be demonstrated. What seems quite clear is that some genotypes such as ST4 or ST7 would be associated with mucosal inflammation through various mechanisms, while ST1 would be associated with asymptomatic cases. The use of qPCR for routine diagnosis of intestinal protozoan infections will contribute to collecting more epidemiological data on those parasites and help in deciphering their role in the pathophysiology of intestinal disorders. Its possible interplay with non-pathogenic protozoa should be also considered. This is all the more important as a Blastocystis -positive qPCR was associated with the detection of non-pathogenic protozoa by microscopy in one-third of cases, with higher parasite loads than when they were found alone by PCR. Therefore, Blastocystis could be considered as an indicator of food contamination with parasites. The same stands for D. fragilis. Noteworthy, the presence of D. fragilis accompanied 64% of cases with pinworm egg detection. This association has been already described, and the hypothesis of a possible transmission of D. fragilis by pinworms has been proposed since the finding of D. fragilis DNA in the worm.

By contrast, Cryptosporidium spp. and Cystoisospora belli were always detected as single parasites in positive samples, and the significance of this finding remains to be elucidated.

Conclusion

Overall, the AllPlex GIP proved very efficient to detect most protozoan parasites, in the vast majority of cases from the first stool sample. Therefore, we think that it is highly suitable for labs with limited microscopic expertise, provided that internal quality controls are implemented in the workflow, to verify the reproducibility of successive batches, and that labs apply to external quality assessment programs. However, complementary techniques should be performed in case of persistence of clinical signs or immune deficiency, not to miss Cystoisospora belli or microsporidia. Besides, when a helminthosis is suspected on the basis of travel history or clinical signs, appropriate concentration methods must be combined to detect eggs or larvae, and samples should be repeated thrice. Finally, the high specificity of the molecular detection of Blastocystis spp. and D. fragilis should prompt revisiting the epidemiology and virulence of these two intestinal protozoa.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^113NuSmX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 1855 stool samples, belonging to 572 different children (56% female, 44% male) with an average age of 7.9 years, were tested within this 10-year period.

24 patients were found to have a positive result for parasites/helminths, which equates a prevalence of 4.2%. In all (24/24, 100%) patients with positive stool findings Blastocystis was detected, 6/24 (25%) of the patients had a co-infection with one (4/24, 16.6%) or several (2/24, 8.3%) other parasites, of which the most common one was Endolimax nana (3/24; 12.5%), see Table 1. None of the affected patients was immunosuppressed. 84/572 (14.7%) of the patients had their stool tested at the same time for viral infections, while in 20.8% (119/572) stool cultures were performed.

Table 1
Patient's characteristics with positive and negative stool samples for parasitic/helminthic infections

The correlation of an immigrant background and a positive result for Blastocystis was statistically significant (p-value = 0.02), but there was no significance calculated for the correlation of fever, duration of the symptoms, gender and the presence of parasites/helminths.

For those 24 patients with a positive stool result, on average 2.6 stool samples (a total of 64) per patient were analyzed for parasitical infections and a mean of 2.0 detected the parasites.

The majority (548/572; 95.8%) of all enrolled patients (55% female, 45% male; average age 7.9 years) had negative stool results for parasites/helminths and on average 3.2 stool samples per patient were analyzed.

### Beyond O&P times three [^112Mssrg]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Although examination of the stool for ova and parasites times three (O&P ×3) is routinely performed in the United States (US) for the evaluation of persistent and/or chronic diarrhea, the result is almost always negative. This has contributed to the perception that parasitic diseases are nearly non-existent in the country unless there is a history of travel to an endemic area. The increasing number of immigrants from third-world countries, tourists, and students who present with symptoms of parasitic diseases are often misdiagnosed as having irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease. The consequences of such misdiagnosis need no explanation. However, certain parasitic diseases are endemic to the US and other developed nations and affect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Testing for parasitic diseases either with O&P or with other diagnostic tests, followed by the recommended treatment, is quite rewarding when appropriate. Most parasitic diseases are easily treatable and should not be confused with other chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. In this review, we critically evaluate the symptomatology of luminal parasitic diseases, their differential diagnoses, appropriate diagnostic tests, and management.

### Unexpected hosts: imaging parasitic diseases [^115D4KFF]. Insights Into Imaging (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and treatment

Diagnosis is made by detection of the eggs in faeces, urine, or affected tissues. Antigens and antibodies in serum or urine can help staging the infection. DNA of the fluke can be found in sera and faeces with PCR. Treatment is praziquantel.

### Clinical significance of mites in urine [^111Rb2Ke]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2005). Low credibility.

We report a case where a mite egg found in urine caused diagnostic confusion. The possibility of gut or bladder mite infection should be entertained only after repeated identification of mites in urine or stool samples from a symptomatic patient with no other cause for the symptoms and where the possibilities of contamination and spurious infection have been excluded.

### Rationale for quality assurance in fecal egg monitoring of soil-transmitted helminthiasis [^1143TuzX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Substantial investment has been made into the once "neglected" tropical disease, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and into control programs that operate within a framework of mapping baseline disease distribution, measuring the effectiveness of applied interventions, establishing when to cease drug administration, and for posttreatment evaluations. However, critical to each of these stages is the determination of helminth infection. The limitations of traditional microscope-based fecal egg diagnostics have not provided quality assurance in the monitoring of parasite disease and suboptimal treatment regimes provide for the potential development of parasite resistance to anthelmintic drugs. Improved diagnostic and surveillance tools are required to protect therapeutic effectiveness and to maintain funder confidence. Such tools may be on the horizon with emergent technologies that offer potential for enhanced visualization and quality-assured quantitation of helminth eggs.

### Common intestinal parasites [^1127bbtn]. American Family Physician (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute diarrhea, more specifically with respect to ova and parasite examination, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend to do not obtain ova and parasite examination in immunocompetent patients with diarrhea lasting < 7 days without a history of travel to areas with endemic parasites.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^114BdLT4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a retrospective study of pediatric patients between 0 and 18 years, who are under the care of the Children's hospital Aarau and whose stool has been tested in the last 10 years (December 2008–December 2018) for parasites and helminths. No exclusions. Following informations were extracted from the medical record of each patient included in the study: sex, date of birth, date, amount and result of stool samples tested, the main and a maximum of two further symptoms why the stool was tested, duration of symptoms (more or less than 4 weeks), possible known underlying diagnoses, allergies and regular intake of medication, travels abroad (including destination) in the last 6 months, migration background and further stool tests. Treatment (product and duration) of patients with a positive stool result was also noted.

All fecal specimens were sampled in a tube containing Sodium Acetate Formalin (SAF) and sent to the microbiology laboratory in the hospital of Aarau. Parasite eggs, larvae, and protozoa are then concentrated using the "Para-Pak SpinCon Stool Concentration System". In a first step the fecal specimen is treated with an surfactant and passed through a preliminary screen by gravity flow. The specimen is then forced by centrifugation through a series of two screens with successively smaller mesh. The resulting pellet is then examined for the presence of parasites by standard wet mount procedures. This method remained the same for the entire 10 years.

Chronic abdominal pain was defined as abdominal pain that persisted for more than 4 weeks in the absence of red flags (blood in the stool, nocturnal diarrhea, jaundice, persistent vomiting, hematemesis, dysphagia, unintentional weight loss, joint pain, past surgical history and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease). The term immigrant is used in this manuscript for patients, who recently migrated to Switzerland and therefore underwent a health screening.

Statistical analysis

Means with standard deviations (SD) were calculated for each of the measurements of interest. To identify correlations between qualitative data Pearson's chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were performed. Data entry and statistical analysis were performed using R, R commander and XLSTAT. A p-value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ethical statement

The study was conducted in accordance to the ethical principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments. Furthermore, it was approved by the local ethical committee (Ethics committee of Northwest Switzerland, EKNZ, trial number 2018–02219).

### Eosinophilia in a patient from south America [^116uXnnE]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Asymptomatic eosinophilia is a common finding in returning travelers and immigrants from parasite-endemic areas. We present a 49-year-old man from Guyana who immigrated to the United States 4 years prior to examination. He had persistent asymptomatic eosinophilia, and multiple stool examinations were negative for ova and parasites. Although the list of parasitic diseases associated with eosinophilia is extensive, the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic eosinophilia with negative stool evaluations is rather limited. We discuss herein elements of the clinical history and examination essential for evaluating eosinophilia in patients at risk of parasitic diseases and present a simple algorithm to guide diagnostic testing. Despite the importance of repeated stool examinations for the presence of ova and parasites, in practice this test is not sensitive. Serologic testing for chronic parasitic infections is often necessary. Most cases without a definitive diagnosis can be conservatively managed with serial monitoring or empirically treated with antihelminthic therapy, but patients with an absolute eosinophil count of more than 3000/microL or more than 1500/microL for more than 6 months are at risk of end organ damage and should be referred for specialized parasitic and/or hematology consultation.

### Myxobolus sp., another opportunistic parasite in immunosuppressed patients? [^111inyny]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

During a study of intestinal parasitic infections in human immunodeficiency virus-positive patients, a parasite belonging to the phylum Myxozoa, recently described from human samples, was identified in one sample. When this parasite was stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining method, the features of the spores were identified: they were pyriform in shape, had thick walls, and had one suture and two polar capsules, with each one having four or five coils. The suture and two polar capsules were observed with the chromotrope-modified stain. The number of stools passed was more than 30 per day, but oocysts of Isospora belli were also found. Upon reexamination of some formalin- or merthiolate-iodine-formaldehyde-preserved samples an identical parasite was found in another sample from a patient presenting with diarrhea. Strongyloides stercoralis larvae and eggs of Hymenolepis nana and Ascaris lumbricoides were also found in this sample. Given that both patients were also infected with other pathogens that cause diarrhea, the possible pathogenic role of this parasite could not be established. The probable route of infection also could not be established.

### Parasites-strongyloides [^117JaHZ3]. CDC (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for strongyloidiasis, more specifically with respect to stool examination, CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that traditional stool examinations are insensitive and require up to 7 stool examinations to reach a sensitivity of 100%.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^116QZx9f]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Ova and parasite testing without high-risk travel exposure (AGA) — In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea with no travel history to or recent immigration from high-risk areas, the AGA suggests against testing for ova and parasites (other than Giardia), a Conditional recommendation with low-quality evidence. In the absence of travel or immigration from high-risk areas, the practice of routinely testing the stool for ova and parasites is highly unlikely to identify important causes of chronic watery diarrhea.

---

### Parasites-strongyloides [^113Z9jkE]. CDC (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for strongyloidiasis, more specifically with respect to stool examination, CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain serial stool examinations as the gold standard for the diagnosis of Strongyloides infection.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^113mRKvA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Although data regarding helminth and parasitic infections amongst European children is still sparse, based on our data stool examinations are performed more often than needed relying frequently on a loose indication. Immune competent children suffering from acute diarrhea -especially under the age of 2 years-, constipation or from abdominal pain without diarrhea and without history of travelling, should not be tested. Even though stool testing is not invasive it should be only applied in patients with a risk factor. In children with a suggestive anamnesis of functional disorders (including functional toddler's diarrhea), clinicians should refer to the Rome IV Criteria and abstain from pro forma stool examinations. The probability of a negative result in those patients is high and one might only detect Blastocystis or Endolimax nana, whose clinical consequence is debatable. Immune compromised children, immigrants or pediatric patients with bloody or protracted diarrhea should have 2 different stool specimens examined.

### Human schistosomiasis resistance to praziquantel in China: should we be worried? [^113VNqzF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2011). Low credibility.

Parasitological examinations.

In November of 2009, all individuals aged 6 years and older from the 33 natural villages (also called production groups) in the study area were asked to participate in a cross-sectional infection survey. With written informed consent, a stool sample was collected from each participant. The stool was first examined for presence of infection using the miracidial hatch test. Briefly, the hatch test consists of straining 30 g of a subject's stool through nylon mesh to isolate parasite eggs, which are then incubated in an Erlenmeyer flask of dechlorinated water at 28–30°C and observed at regular intervals for up to 8 hours for the presence of hatched miracidia. For individuals found to be hatch test-positive, a subsequent Kato–Katz fecal smear test (for each person, one homogenized stool sample and three 41.7-mg slides) was conducted to quantify egg excretion (in units of eggs per gram of feces [EPG]).

All infected individuals were treated with two times the recommended dosage of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) for approximately 2 and 3 weeks after the infection survey. After an additional week (approximately 1 month after the initial infection survey), individuals were retested for infection using the hatch test. Those found to be infected were retreated until infection was not found. Although praziquantel has a biphasic efficacy period and it has been recommended that treatments be staged 3 weeks apart, in our case, the examinations were conducted in the winter season when snails do not shed cercariae, transmission is negligible, and hence, infection with juvenile parasites unlikely. Furthermore, because transmission is negligible, residual infection is likely to result from treatment failure rather than advancement of new juvenile infections.

### Anthelmintic drugs for treating ascariasis [^113GDnmp]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

Peripheral eosinophilia occurs during migration of A lumbricoides larvae through the infected person's lungs, but sometimes appears at other stages of A lumbricoides infection (Ehrhardt 2008). In individuals with heavy infections, a mass of worms may be detectable following X‐ray of the abdomen. The worms contrast against the gas in the bowel, typically producing a 'whirlpool' effect (Reeder 1998). Ultrasound and endoscopy are useful for diagnosis of hepatobiliary and pancreatic duct involvement (Reeder 1998). Computed tomographic (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may identify worms in the liver or bile ducts, but are not usually necessary (Khuroo 1985; Khuroo 1990).

Parasitological diagnosis of ascariasis is made by examining stool specimens for the microscopic identification of eggs. Characteristic eggs may be seen on direct examination of faeces or by using concentration techniques (CDC 2009). Faecal smears and the Kato technique, also referred to as Kato thick smear examination, consist of the microscopic examination of a known amount of faecal material that allows an egg count to be performed (Katz 1972; Santos 2005; WHO 2001; WHO 2011). This method is widely used to confirm ascariasis infection and is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the standard method for evaluating prevalence and intensity of soil‐transmitted helminthiasis in endemic communities. It is an easy technique to use in field situations or when a great number of specimens need to be examined. However, it requires well‐trained laboratory technicians and quality control measures to ascertain accurate diagnosis of ascariasis and other helminth infections (Bergquist 2009; Montresor 1998; Pawlowski 1985). The sensitivity of faecal smears decrease with low‐intensity infection and with liquid stool samples. The stool filtration method, which has been previously described for finding Schistosoma mansoni eggs in stool samples, is an option to detect A lumbricoides eggs (Bell 1975). Intensity of infection is measured in terms of eggs per gram (epg) of faeces and is classified as a light‐intensity infection (between one and 4999 epg), moderate‐intensity infection (between 5000 and 49,999 epg), or heavy‐intensity infection (more than 50,000 epg) based on the report of WHO Expert Committee (WHO 2002). Adult worms are occasionally present in the stools. They may pass through the mouth, nose, or rectum and are recognizable by their macroscopic characteristics (WHO 2011). An increasing number of studies have presented the results of development and standardization of molecular tests for intestinal pathogens (Ayana 2019; Cools 2019; Papaiakovou 2019). However, until 2019, molecular diagnosis for A lumbricoides was mainly restricted to research settings with no commercial tests available (Khurana 2017; O'Connell 2016).

### Abnormal helminth egg development, strange morphology, and the identification of intestinal helminth infections [^111jrtEi]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Occasionally, abnormal forms of parasitic helminth eggs are detected during routine diagnostics. This finding can prove problematic in diagnosis because morphologic analysis based on tightly defined measurements is the primary method used to identify the infecting species and molecular confirmation of species is not always feasible. We describe instances of malformed nematode eggs (primarily from members of the superfamily Ascaridoidea) from human clinical practice and experimental trials on animals. On the basis of our observations and historical literature, we propose that unusual development and morphology of nematode and trematode eggs are associated with early infection. Further observational studies and experimentation are needed to identify additional factors that might cause abnormalities in egg morphology and production. Abnormal egg morphology can be observed early in the course of infection and can confound accurate diagnosis of intestinal helminthiases.

### Implementation of a clinical decision support tool for stool cultures and parasitological studies in hospitalized patients [^111Qwaj5]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

There is substantial evidence that stool culture and parasitological examinations are of minimal to no value after 3 days of hospitalization. We implemented and studied the impact of a clinical decision support tool (CDST) to decrease the number of unnecessary stool cultures (STCUL), ova/parasite (O&P) examinations, and Giardia / Cryptosporidium enzyme immunoassay screens (GC-EIA) performed for patients hospitalized > 3 days. We studied the frequency of stool studies ordered before or on day 3 and after day 3 of hospitalization (i.e., categorical orders/total number of orders) before and after this intervention and denoted the numbers and types of microorganisms detected within those time frames. This intervention, which corresponded to a custom-programmed hard-stop alert tool in the Epic hospital information system, allowed providers to override the intervention by calling the laboratory, if testing was deemed medically necessary. Comparative statistics were employed to determine significance, and cost savings were estimated based on our internal costs. Before the intervention, 129/670 (19.25%) O&P examinations, 47/204 (23.04%) GC-EIA, and 249/1,229 (20.26%) STCUL were ordered after 3 days of hospitalization. After the intervention, 46/521 (8.83%) O&P examinations, 27/157 (17.20%) GC-EIA, and 106/1,028 (10.31%) STCUL were ordered after 3 days of hospitalization. The proportions of reductions in the number of tests performed after 3 days and the associated P values were 54.1% for O&P examinations (P < 0.0001), 22.58% for GC-EIA (P = 0.2807), and 49.1% for STCUL (P < 0.0001). This was estimated to have resulted in $8,108.84 of cost savings. The electronic CDST resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of evaluations of stool cultures and the number of parasitological examinations for patients hospitalized for more than 3 days and in a cost savings while retaining the ability of the clinician to obtain these tests if clinically indicated.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for strongyloidiasis, more specifically with respect to endoscopy and biopsy, CDC 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that duodenal aspirate is more sensitive than stool examination, and duodenal biopsy may reveal parasites in the gastric crypts, in the duodenal glands, or eosinophilic infiltration in the lamina propria. Recognize that larvae can frequently be seen by a simple wet-mount in fluid from a bronchoalveolar lavage.

### Functional significance of low-intensity polyparasite helminth infections in anemia [^112N5Yqf]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

We wanted to quantify the impact that polyparasite infections, including multiple concurrent low-intensity infections, have on anemia.

Methods

Three stool samples were collected and read in duplicate by the Kato-Katz method in a cross-sectional sample of 507 children from Leyte, The Philippines. The number of eggs per gram of stool was used to define 3 infection intensity categories — uninfected, low, and moderate/high (M+) — for 3 geohelminth species and Schistosomiasis japonicum. Four polyparasite infection profiles were defined in addition to a reference profile that consisted of either no infections or low-intensity infection with only 1 parasite. Logistic regression models were used to quantify the effect that polyparasitism has on anemia (hemoglobin level < 11 g/dL).

Results

The odds of having anemia in children with low-intensity polyparasite infections were nearly 5-fold higher (P = 0.052) than those in children with the reference profile. The odds of having anemia in children infected with 3 or 4 parasite species at M+ intensity were 8-fold greater than those in children with the reference profile (P < .001).

Conclusion

Low-intensity polyparasite infections were associated with increased odds of having anemia. In most parts of the developing world, concurrent infection with multiple parasite species is more common than single-species infections. This study suggests that concurrent low-intensity infections with multiple parasite species result in clinically significant morbidity.

### Rationale for quality assurance in fecal egg monitoring of soil-transmitted helminthiasis [^112myRHA]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

A major limitation of traditional fecal egg microscopy is the requirement for a localized "expert" in parasite egg identification at the point of sample analysis to distinguish between a range of different microscopic image features such as pollen, air bubbles, and other confounding debris from different parasite ova, which range in size from 20 to 200 μm. In the Kato-Katz method, a volumetric semisolid stool specimen is spread thinly over an area of approximately 490 mm², which equates to approximately 31 and 197 nonoverlapping fields of view (FOV) at 40× and 100× magnification, respectively. For the McMaster and FLOTAC methods, the areas of fluidized stool to be imaged range from 100 to 324 mm². The lack of routine quality assurance in STH monitoring is complicated by the technical challenge of accurately counting helminth eggs. Stool specimens are inherently unstable and prone to rapid deterioration, which limit their storage and transport for off-site evaluation, and any putative reevaluation. Kato-Katz preparations of hookworm ova clear rapidly such that it is impractical to store slides and virtually impossible to assess technician error rates. Egg count errors can have a significant impact on reporting anthelmintic drug efficacy when reports are based on cure rate. Error is not uncommon in diagnostic microscopy and digital slide recording permits images of samples to be easily reexamined to provide quality assurance. However, the acquisition of digital microscope images from traditional FEC methods with many FOV cannot easily be achieved and there are impracticalities with recording and storing large numbers of images per sample.

### Human intestinal parasite burden and poor sanitation in rural Alabama [^114Xm42s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Using field-tested molecular assays, 34.5% of individuals living in a high-risk environment within a region of the southern United States were found to have stool samples testing positive for N. americanus (hookworm). Even though the parasite burden was low, with up to 0.059 fg/μL of parasite DNA and an estimated egg burden up to 2.1 epg of stool, there is evidence of endemic and autochthonous infection within this population. In addition, 73% of Lowndes County residents who were tested and completed the questionnaire reported exposure to raw sewage inside their home, and even though not statistically significant (likely due to small sample size), 72.7% with this exposure tested positive for parasitic infection. By using qPCR, gastrointestinal parasites known to be endemic to developing countries have now been identified in a resource-limited county in Alabama, among people who have never traveled abroad, likely from autochthonous infection.

###: an unusual parasitological diagnosis in a reference international health unit [^111jmZNE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Finding Dicrocoelium dendriticum eggs in human feces is exceptional and there are few prevalence data available. True infection occurs after accidental ingestion of ants containing metacercariae and spurious infection through the consumption of infected animal liver. Differential diagnosis between true and pseudo-infections is performed through stool examination after a diet free of liver. In addition, microscopy can help to differentiate the type of infection. We report six cases, all from sub-Saharan Africa, detection of this fluke at the Tropical Medicine Unit Vall d'Hebron-Drassanes (Barcelona, Spain). Dicrocoelium dendriticum transit eggs were visualized in five cases and there were no subsequent visualizations after diet, which reinforces that all these cases were false parasitism. In one case, few embryonated eggs were observed and the patient was treated for a possible true parasitism. There is a need to investigate the prevalence of D. dendriticum in our country focusing on the distinction between true and spurious infections.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112iFnqa]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Parasitic diarrhea diagnostics — during initial evaluation, including in immunocompetent children > 2 years old, bacterial and viral etiologies should be considered first if symptoms are less than 2 weeks, and in community-acquired diarrhea routine parasite testing is not indicated and usually should not be performed. When clinically indicated, ova and parasite (O&P) examination should be requested; historically 3 specimens collected over a 7–10 day period were recommended, but cost-effective options include obtaining a second specimen only if the first is negative and symptoms persist, with a third submitted only if the patient remains O&P negative and symptomatic. Targeted use of immunoassay testing or nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) can serve as a screen, immunoassays for Giardia may be sensitive enough that only a single specimen is needed with additional samples considered when suspicion remains, and no data define the number of specimens needed when NAAT is performed. Specimen preservatives depend on intended testing and manufacturer recommendations, and it is imperative to consult the laboratory to ensure proper transport conditions.

### Smartphone microscopy of parasite eggs accumulated into a single field of view [^112wnnbj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are nematode parasites that infect up to 2 billion people, with children in the developing world the most at risk from anemia, malnutrition, and developmental delay.–Increasingly, STH are controlled by preventive chemotherapy through mass drug administration (MDA) within a paradigm of mapping disease distribution, monitoring MDA efficacy, strategic cessation of drug intervention, and postelimination surveillance.

The monitoring of STH in resource-limited settings is constrained by poor laboratory infrastructure and capability leading to misdiagnosis. Parasite assessment has traditionally been done using the Kato–Katz method, the diagnostic standard of the World Health Organization, in which a fixed amount of stool (approximately 40 mg) is placed on a microscope slide and spread thinly over an area up to 25 mm in diameter. However, accurate diagnosis requires skilled microscopists, who can identify nematode ova in real time, across multiple fields of view (FOV). The optical resolution to identify nematode eggs (20–200 μm) requires magnifications of 40 to 100×, which constrain FOV to 4.45 and 1.78 mm in diameter and represents 31 and 197 nonoverlapping FOV on the Kato–Katz slide, respectively. The McMaster method is a flotation-based veterinary parasite diagnostic–recently adapted for human application. Stool is homogenized in dense fluids causing the eggs to float to a common focal plane for microscopy. Gridlines that correspond to total searchable areas of 100 and 324 mm² facilitate examination of 0.15 and 0.5 mL of captured fluid, respectively. The Flotation translation Cringoli (FLOTAC) apparatus also facilitates the microscopy of eggs over multiple grid-lined FOV after centrifuge-enhanced flotation.

Manually finding and discriminating eggs from debris in stool by traditional microscopy is laborious and, combined with the rapid clearing of hookworm ova in the Kato–Katz method, limits quality-assured fecal egg counting and the monitoring of STH. Here, we provide proof of concept for an alternative approach that uses fluidic geometries to concentrate eggs into a single FOV–and combines this with mobile phone digital photomicroscopy.–

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1158WYMW]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Diagnosis — Health care providers should specifically request Cryptosporidium testing because standard ova and parasite testing may not include Cryptosporidium spp. Monoclonal antibody-based direct fluorescent assays and antigen-detection assays (such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EIA]) can be used to diagnose cryptosporidiosis because of their enhanced sensitivity and specificity as compared with microscopy. Oocyst excretion can be intermittent; therefore, the parasite might not be detected in every stool, and stool specimens collected on 3 consecutive days should be examined before considering test results to be negative. Some immunochromatography assays have been shown to have poor sensitivity and specificity, and with rapid test methods, confirmation by microscopy should be considered.

### Development of a PCR assay for diagnosing trematode (opisthorchis and haplorchis) infections in human stools [^115xTWBq]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

We developed a combined conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR (qPCR)-based assay for detecting and discriminating between Opisthorchis viverrini and Haplorchis taichui parasite infections. The first PCR amplifies the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of parasites, and differential diagnosis is achieved by performing qPCR with specific primers and SYBR Green I. The detection limit of the assay was found to be 2.0 × 10² plasmid copies in a test in which a stool sample was spiked with a single egg, which is equivalent to 5 eggs per gram (EPG). The testing of 34 clinical stool samples that had been demonstrated to contain "Opisthorchis-like" eggs by microscopy showed that the novel assay exhibited a sensitivity of 100% for "Opisthorchis-like" parasitic infections, and 71% and 91% of these samples were found to be infected with O. viverrini and H. taichui, respectively. A further four parasitic infections were diagnosed in the 16 negative samples, and the microscopic findings of these samples were confirmed to be false negatives by sequencing analysis. The assay also displayed high specificity during the testing of 10 samples containing other common parasites. The fact that our qPCR SYBR Green I-based assay detected submicroscopic traces of parasitic DNA and was able to differentiate between parasites that produce eggs with similar morphologies indicates that it has a good potential for development of diagnostic application to use in areas where multiple parasites coexist.

### Molecular diagnostics for soil-transmitted helminths [^116UnMd4]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Applications of Qpcr as an STH Diagnostic

The WHO has set a worldwide goal to eliminate childhood morbidity caused by STH by 2020. Dictating which communities receive anthelmintic drugs, how often they receive them, and when community treatment is stopped is based on population prevalence rates determined by a small community sampling. Therefore, the very sensitive nature of qPCR (even post-treatment where eggs are often no longer visible), the improved ability to detect multiple helminths in a given sample and the ability to reproducibly quantitate egg burden, would be a huge asset to control programs.

Research studies are already utilizing qPCR for mass screening of stool samples for STH in malariaand in vaccine studies (currently underway) as stool can be stored relatively easily (see about preservatives in the section Technical Considerations in Using qPCR as an STH diagnostic) and sent offsite for qPCR not only for STH but also for protozoa and other gastrointestinal pathogens.

One of the most common criticisms of qPCR is the high cost compared with traditional methods. In one price comparison, a multiplex platform was estimated to cost about the same in consumables as the cost of microscopy, and consumable cost for multi-parallel singleplex qPCR of one group was estimated to be almost half the cost of microscopyon a per test basis. Thus, depending on the technique used, cost may not be a prohibitive factor.

### Detection of protozoan and helminth parasites in concentrated wet mounts of stool using a deep convolutional neural network [^112tMH7K]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The ongoing global burden of parasitic diseases continues to demand sensitive laboratory testing for appropriate detection and management of these organisms. With increased global travel and recent mass human migration/displacement events, lab testing is even more critical today for laboratories outside of regions traditionally endemic for many parasites. Despite advancements in diagnostic methods such as antigen detection, nucleic-acid amplification tests (NAATs), and genomic-based assays in both clinical microbiology and parasitology specifically, manual microscopy remains the gold standard for the detection and identification of most parasites. Unfortunately, traditional parasitology faces numerous challenges in the clinical laboratory, such as the length of time it takes to be competent or proficient in the discipline and, in turn, maintaining competency when dealing with staff turnover. It is also laborious, time-consuming, and interpretation is largely subjective. Being a sub-discipline of applied zoology, parasitology requires a deep understanding of anatomy, biology, taxonomy, and epidemiology, adding additional challenges to maintaining competency.

Traditional stool microscopy for parasitology involves the ova-and-parasite (O&P) exam, which consists of a concentrated wet mount for detecting helminth eggs/larvae and protozoan cysts, and a permanent stained smear for detecting protozoan cysts and trophozoites; however, in many parts of the world, only wet mounts are performed. Because of progress seen in areas such as infrastructure, sanitation, health care, and hygiene and personal habits, fewer parasite cases are seen in developed countries. Those infections that are seen are often in immigrants from, or people who traveled to, areas with a higher incidence of endemic parasitic diseases. As such, laboratorians can spend considerable time manually examining stool specimens only to see positive rates of 2%–5%. Over time, this can lead to low job satisfaction, fatigue, and "burnout", which can lead to diagnostic errors.

Since traditional parasitology still relies on the recognition and identification of morphological features, digital microscopy and artificial intelligence provide an excellent opportunity to assist in the screening and detection of clinical specimens for parasites. Proof-of-concept technologies have been described, but there are very few commercially available assays available for detecting and identifying gastrointestinal parasites.

The work described here represents a functional extension of a 2020 study; this time, it analyzed the wet mount portion of the O&P exam using a novel detection model and an additional scanner system. The goal of this study was to demonstrate improved sensitivity for the detection of parasites in true-positive specimens while reducing the need to review true-negative specimens on a microscope.

### Common intestinal parasites [^114ywQvd]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Intestinal parasites cause significant morbidity and mortality. Diseases caused by Enterobius vermicularis, Giardia lamblia, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, and Entamoeba histolytica occur in the United States. E. vermicularis, or pinworm, causes irritation and sleep disturbances. Diagnosis can be made using the "cellophane tape test". Treatment includes mebendazole and household sanitation. Giardia causes nausea, vomiting, malabsorption, diarrhea, and weight loss. Stool ova and parasite studies are diagnostic. Treatment includes metronidazole. Sewage treatment, proper handwashing, and consumption of bottled water can be preventive. A. duodenale and N. americanus are hookworms that cause blood loss, anemia, pica, and wasting. Finding eggs in the feces is diagnostic. Treatments include albendazole, mebendazole, pyrantel pamoate, iron supplementation, and blood transfusion. Preventive measures include wearing shoes and treating sewage. E. histolytica can cause intestinal ulcerations, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, fever, gastrointestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Amebas can cause abscesses in the liver that may rupture into the pleural space, peritoneum, or pericardium. Stool and serologic assays, biopsy, barium studies, and liver imaging have diagnostic merit. Therapy includes luminal and tissue amebicides to attack both life-cycle stages. Metronidazole, chloroquine, and aspiration are treatments for liver abscess. Careful sanitation and use of peeled foods and bottled water are preventive.

Neurocysticercosis — tapeworm carrier detection and public health actions highlight low diagnostic yield of stool microscopy and the need for notification and screening in selected settings; stool examination for ova is often negative in tapeworm carriers and even multiple examinations may not detect the tapeworm carrier, with the yield of microscopy generally low; among patients who apparently acquired infection in the United States, tapeworms were documented in close contacts of 22% of NCC cases, and most authorities would recommend screening for cases acquired outside endemic areas; tapeworm carriers pose a public health risk, including risks within households and mother-to-child transmission, and local public health authorities should be notified of cases of NCC, noting that NCC or tapeworm carriage is reportable in many states and regions but reporting is not mandated nationally.

Table 3
Consensus indicators about the diagnosis and evaluation of IBD.

Routine stool examination and fecal pathogen culture

IBD shares clinical symptoms with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and infectious enteritis, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea and altered bowel habits. For accurate and prompt diagnosis of IBD, routine examination of stool and stool cultures is essential, especially in cases with initial UC. Several studies have shown that fecal calprotein (FC) and lactoferrin are highly sensitive for distinguishing IBD and IBS, and that the levels of FC and lactoferrin were significantly higher in patients with IBD than in those with IBS or healthy people. However, as indicators of inflammation, the levels of these markers may also be increased in infectious enteritis and colitis. The most common pathogen in enteric infections is Clostridium difficile followed by Escherichia. coli. To exclude infections, fecal pathogen culture should be obtained at the first visit. In some potential high-risk areas, it is a routine test to screen certain parasites such as schistosomes and endemic amebiasis. To improve the accuracy of diagnosis, routine examination of stool and stool culture is essential before the diagnosis of initial UC.

### A randomized controlled trial to investigate safety and variability of egg excretion after repeated controlled human hookworm infection [^117FL4CS]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Controlled human hookworm infections could significantly contribute to the development of a hookworm vaccine. However, current models are hampered by low and unstable egg output, reducing generalizability and increasing sample sizes. This study aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, and egg output of repeated exposure to hookworm larvae.

Methods

Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized, double-blindly, to 1, 2, or 3 doses of 50 Necator americanus L3 larvae at 2-week intervals. Volunteers were monitored weekly and were treated with albendazole at week 20.

Results

There was no association between larval dose and number or severity of adverse events. Geometric mean egg loads stabilized at 697, 1668, and 1914 eggs per gram feces for the 1×50L3, 2×50L3, and 3×50L3 group, respectively. Bayesian statistical modeling showed that egg count variability relative to the mean was reduced with a second infectious dose; however, the third dose did not increase egg load or decrease variability. We therefore suggest 2×50L3 as an improved challenge dose. Model-based simulations indicates increased frequency of stool sampling optimizes the power of hypothetical vaccine trials.

Conclusions

Repeated infection with hookworm larvae increased egg counts to levels comparable to the field and reduced relative variability in egg output without aggravating adverse events.

### Abnormal helminth egg development, strange morphology, and the identification of intestinal helminth infections [^112DNud5]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Despite recent advances in molecular diagnostics, microscopic analysis of ova and larvae, and to a lesser degree adult worms, remains the mainstay for the diagnosis of intestinal helminths in humans and animals worldwide. In most cases, such morphologic diagnosis relies upon the identification of the helminth genera or species based on the characteristic morphology of eggs because adult parasites are rarely available. When unfamiliar egg morphologies are observed, parasitologists will often consult with atlases and textbooks that describe the morphology of eggs produced by various species of helminth infecting the host feces being examined to determine the species of helminth concerned. These references generally describe the standard presentation of eggs without consideration of potential abnormal forms. In addition, students are generally only provided the best specimens during practical classes in which they are taught to identify parasites.

The authors of this article conduct disparate work in intestinal helminths of humans and animals. They routinely undertake classical morphologic diagnosis of parasites in their respective roles and have extensive experience in morphologic methodologies. Casual discussions between the authors revealed that they had each observed highly abnormal forms of helminth eggs from humans and animals during the course of their work.

### Decreased sensitivity ofsp. egg microscopy in women and HIV-infected individuals [^111Fzp34]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

It has been postulated that impaired host immunity due to HIV infection reduces parasite egg excretion. Schistosoma /HIV interactions have also been shown to differ by sex. We hypothesized that egg excretion would vary based on both HIV status and sex. We examined data from more than 1,700 participants in eight studies conducted in northwest Tanzania between 2010 and 2016. Schistosoma infection was defined by circulating anodic antigen (CAA) serum levels ≥ 30 pg/mL and/or egg positivity in either stool by Kato Katz method or urine by filtration. We used multivariable analyses to determine the impact of confounding factors such as sex, age, previous praziquantel treatment, and worm burden as measured by serum CAA level, on the relationship between egg excretion and HIV status. HIV-infected individuals were significantly less likely to excrete schistosome eggs than HIV-uninfected individuals, even after controlling for worm burden and sex (OR = 0.6 [0.4, 0.9], P = 0.005). Furthermore, after controlling for worm burden and HIV status, women had lower odds of egg excretion than men (OR = 0.4 [0.3, 0.5], P < 0.001). Sensitivity of egg microscopy was lower in HIV-infected women than HIV-uninfected men (41% versus 61%, P < 0.001), whereas sensitivity in women remained low in both groups (33% versus 37%, P = 0.664). Our study is the first to report that women with Schistosoma infection excrete fewer eggs than men for a given worm burden, regardless of HIV the status. These findings suggest that guidelines for use of microscopy to diagnose Schistosoma infections in HIV-infected individuals and in women merit reconsideration.

### Abnormal helminth egg development, strange morphology, and the identification of intestinal helminth infections [^1111svjK]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The combined incidental findings described in this report demonstrate the potential for morphologically abnormal helminth egg morphologies to occur in certain host species. These abnormalities might confound or mislead inexperienced morphologists regarding the identity of such helminth eggs and thereby lead to incorrect or missed diagnoses. The current standard morphologic descriptions address only the commonly observed morphologies of intestinal helminth eggs, and the potential for substantial deformity is not generally considered by laboratory staff. In addition, numerous ecologic studies are conducted on parasites of wildlife, which frequently rely on nonlethal sampling through identification of eggs in fecal samples by researchers who might not have extensive training in morphologic identification of parasitic ova. Moreover, many parasite species of wildlife have poorly described or unknown egg morphology data available. The presence of abnormal eggs might lead to spurious descriptions of new species in such studies. Furthermore, many parasite species of wildlife have poorly described or unknown egg morphology data. Should abnormal eggs be observed, especially in an unusual host, molecular characterization might be necessary to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

Our findings and evidence from the historical literature suggests that immaturity of egg-producing helminths might be a major cause of the observed egg deformations we have described. Other etiologic factors such as host immunity cannot be discounted on the basis of such preliminary findings, and more work is needed to understand the causes and mechanisms leading to the passage of deformed eggs. This report serves to highlight the existence of such phenomena and the potentially underrecognized challenge that malformed helminth eggs represent in terms of correctly diagnosing helminth infections in humans and animals. We hope that more research will occur to determine the causes of these aberrations and the diversity of their occurrence across helminth taxa. Such research should consider the intensity of host infection, host or helminth age associations, and, ultimately, immunologic mechanisms. Our collaborative investigation also further highlights how even casual communication between scientists working on very different subjects can be unexpectedly enlightening, particularly in the highly interdisciplinary area of parasitology.

### Interventions to improve disposal of child faeces for preventing diarrhoea and soil-transmitted helminth infection [^115Hko2p]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Diarrhoea episodes among individuals, whether or not confirmed by microbiological examination. We defined an episode according to the case definitions used in each reviewed study. A third of the included studies used the WHO definition, which is the passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day or more than usual for the individual (WHO 2013), while others used other definitions, which are defined in the results section. We treated this outcome as dichotomous, whether an individual had one or more episodes of diarrhoea.
Infection with one or more of the following species of STHs: Ascaris lumbricoides (round worm), Trichuris trichiura (whip worm), Ancylostoma duodenale, or Necator americanus (hookworm). We defined infection as the presence of eggs, or juvenile nematodes, or both in the stools of the participants. We included any accepted diagnostic techniques.

Secondary outcomes

Dysentery (bloody diarrhoea).
Severe diarrhoea (clinical features associated with greater severity of diarrhoea illness include: high stool frequency or stool output and persistent diarrhoea (Bhandari 2002)).
Persistent diarrhoea (diarrhoea lasting 14 days or longer).
Clinical visits for diarrhoea.
Intensity of STH infection (number of eggs per gram of stool).
Presence of pathogenic microbes in stool assays.
Anthropometry (weight‐for‐age and height‐for‐age).
Serology.
Other markers of infection and disease.
Mortality.
Use and adoption of the intervention (behaviour change).
Adverse events.

### Sustainable surveillance of neglected tropical diseases for the post-elimination era [^113zZ7im]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers

At present, surveillance for NTDs is dependent on a disparate range of biomarkers, most not well suited for post-elimination surveillance. For example, in areas endemic for Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis, WHO recommends the Alere Filariasis Test Strip (FTS), which measures circulating filarial antigen in human blood. However, the FTS is cross-reactive with Loa loa antigens, which limits its utility for post-elimination surveillance in (previously) coendemic settings. STH and schistosomiasis are routinely detected using microscopy-based diagnostic tools that count the number of parasite eggs excreted in urine or stool. However, the low sensitivity of these methods when infection intensities are very low means they are considered inadequate for elimination surveillance.

Diagnostics, however, are likely to keep improving as programs progress, and TPPs that specify the minimum and ideal characteristics for diagnostics for post-elimination surveillance are already published for schistosomiasis, STH, and trachoma and are in development for lymphatic filariasis. According to published TPPs, acceptable post-elimination surveillance diagnostics for schistosomiasis, STH, and trachoma would be based on detection of antibodies in finger-stick blood samples that could be used with minimal or no infrastructure.

### Circulating antigen tests and urine reagent strips for diagnosis of active schistosomiasis in endemic areas [^117NqkYw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Reference standards

S. haematobium

For diagnosis of S. haematobium infection, the reference standard is microscopy of urine for examination of schistosome eggs. To increase sensitivity, urine samples can be concentrated by sedimentation, filtration, or centrifugation techniques (Gryseels 2006), or more samples can be examined (Feldmeier 1993). We therefore included studies that use all of these concentration techniques, and to estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single urine sample (lower‐quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple urine samples (higher‐quality reference standard).

S. mansoni

For diagnosis of S. mansoni infection, microscopic examination of schistosome eggs in stool is the reference standard. Sensitivity is increased by preparing a faecal thick smear using the Kato‐Katz (KK) method (Gryseels 2006) or by examining multiple stool samples (Feldmeier 1993). To estimate the effect of the quality of the reference standard, we accepted studies using microscopy on a single stool sample (lower‐quality reference standard) and studies performing microscopy on multiple stool samples (higher‐quality reference standard).

It is important to note that some regions experience mixed infections of S. haematobium and S. mansoni. In such situations, microscopy of both stool and urine samples must be carried out to confirm infection.

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, MEDION, and HTA (Health Technology Assessment). The MEDLINE search strategy is outlined in Appendix 3. We further translated the MEDLINE search to EMBASE and BIOSIS databases to identify additional records. To avoid missing studies, we did not use a diagnostic search filter. We performed the searches on 12 January 2012 and repeated them on 16 November 2012, 29 August 2013, and 30 June 2014.

Searching other resources

We looked through reference lists of relevant reviews and studies and websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI), and the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE). When possible, we contacted study authors to request extra information.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two independent review authors first looked through titles and abstracts to identify potentially eligible studies. Full‐text articles of these studies were obtained and assessed for study eligibility by two independent review authors using the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and by consultation with a third review author when necessary.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^1113s3Mj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Space-occupying lesions of the liver — diagnosis and microbiology testing focus on distinguishing parasitic from pyogenic causes: the primary diagnostic dilemma is differentiating parasites (Entamoeba histolytica and Echinococcus) from bacterial or fungal pyogenic abscesses; in endemic regions for E. histolytica, serology or serum antigen detection tests can be helpful to exclude amebic abscess, whereas stool examination is generally not. Liver aspirates may be submitted for direct microscopic evaluation for parasites. When amebic disease is unlikely, the abscess should be aspirated and the contents submitted in anaerobic transport for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures; the wall and abscess contents should be sampled when possible; aerobic and anaerobic bacterial culture should be requested; and blood cultures can also be helpful if collected prior to antimicrobial therapy. Commonly recovered isolates include Klebsiella spp. E. coli, other Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas spp. Streptococcus spp. (including Streptococcus anginosus group), Enterococcus spp., viridans group Streptococci, S. aureus, Bacteroides spp. Fusobacterium spp. Clostridium spp., and rarely Candida spp.

### Detection of protozoan and helminth parasites in concentrated wet mounts of stool using a deep convolutional neural network [^112GWNuY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

This study has several practical limitations. First, the discrepant resolution was complicated and required multiple re-preps due to organisms not included in "ground truth", as well as challenges with low-prevalence specimens and approaching the practical limit of detection of conventional microscopy. Furthermore, it was difficult to obtain some organisms due to the global rarity of their diseases. This resulted in some classes (e.g. S. japonicum) failing to reach the desired 10 positive specimens. Likewise, there are at least two organisms that are not trained or detected in this model. The first is Cryptosporidium, while despite some laboratories using wet mount to detect this parasite, this is not considered good practice and therefore was not trained on the wet-mount model. Detection is better achieved by antigen detection or NAAT. The second organism group is the Acanthacephala. The acanthacephalans are rare zoonotic parasites in humans. As recently reviewed, most cases are identified by detection of adult worms in stool and not by detection of eggs in stool. As such, acanthacephalan eggs will not specifically be detected by this model. Pilot testing using Moniliformis as a representative of the Acanthacephala revealed that the model identified Moniliformis eggs as Ascaris; however, with only one specimen to test this inclusion, the actual sensitivity for that detection cannot be determined. An additional limitation is that for some specimens in the validation set that were obtained from other countries, it is not known whether the specimens were always screened for other organisms when assigning "ground truth", vs part of a specific screening initiative only (e.g. Schistosoma). As such, we cannot definitively state that all unexpected positive results for the complete study set were unique detections not previously known, albeit the majority were specimens reported per standard of care. The scanner used in this study only scanned 20 × 20, and not the entire 22 × 22 coverslip, which could conceivably lead to missed organism detections. Lastly, the specimens in this study did not have corresponding trichrome stains to comprehensively compare the total findings with.

### Prevalence of strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis among migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114NevUZ]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Background

Global migration from regions where strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis are endemic to non-endemic countries has increased the potential individual and public health effect of these parasitic diseases. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of these infections among migrants to establish which groups are at highest risk and who could benefit from screening.

Methods

We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis prevalence among migrants born in endemic countries. Original studies that included data for the prevalence of Strongyloides or Schistosoma antibodies in serum or the prevalence of larvae or eggs in stool or urine samples among migrants originating from countries endemic for these parasites and arriving or living in host countries with low endemicity-specifically the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, and 23 western European countries-were eligible for inclusion. Pooled estimates of the prevalence of strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis by stool or urine microscopy for larvae or eggs or serum antibodies were calculated with a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was explored by stratification by age, region of origin, migrant class, period of study, and type of serological antigen used.

Findings

88 studies were included. Pooled strongyloidiasis seroprevalence was 12.2% (95% CI 9.0–15.9%; I² 96%) and stool-based prevalence was 1.8% (1.2–2.6%; 98%). Migrants from east Asia and the Pacific (17.3% [95% CI 4.1–37.0]), sub-Saharan Africa (14.6% [7.1–24.2]), and Latin America and the Caribbean (11.4% [7.8–15.7]) had the highest seroprevalence. Pooled schistosomiasis seroprevalence was 18.4% (95% CI 13.1–24.5; I² 97%) and stool-based prevalence was 0.9% (0.2–1.9; 99%). Sub-Saharan African migrants had the highest seroprevalence (24.1·% [95% CI 16.4–32.7]).

Interpretation

Strongyloidiasis affects migrants from all global regions, whereas schistosomiasis is focused in specific regions and most common among sub-Saharan African migrants. Serological prevalence estimates were several times higher than stool estimates for both parasites. These data can be used to inform screening decisions for migrants and support the use of serological screening, which is more sensitive and easier than stool testing.

### Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract [^115gWCKx]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Intestinal parasites continue to be a significant health problem in both developed and developing countries. In developed countries, protozoans are more commonly the cause of gastrointestinal infections than are helminths. Some protozoan parasites have stages in which, in addition to being resistant to chemicals used for water treatment, they are small enough to pass through commonly used filtration processes. The relatively large size of helminth eggs increases the likelihood of their removal during water filtration. The direct impact of protozoan parasites on both human and animal health is considerable, and there is some evidence that infection may contribute to the development of various forms of intestinal dysregulation as well as disseminated infection, especially in AIDS patients. Protozoans of special interest, due to either their frequency of isolation or their role as emerging pathogens, include Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Cyclospora cayetanensis, and the microsporidians, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon intestinalis.

### Comparison of a urine antigen assay and multiple examinations with the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique for diagnosis of opisthorchiasis [^1175Vz8s]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Infection with the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini remains a serious health problem in Southeast Asia. The resulting disease, opisthorchiasis, is considered a neglected tropical disease under the grouping of food-borne trematodiasis. Opisthorchis viverrini together with Clonorchis sinensis have been classified as group 1 carcinogens with infection-causing bile duct cancer in humans (cholangiocarcinoma; CCA). With the highly effective drug praziquantel widely available, the fundamental approach to combat CCA in endemic areas requires a comprehensive public health campaign that includes the control and elimination of O. viverrini and its carcinogenic relative, C. sinensis. To achieve such a goal, a robust and practical diagnostic tool for improved screening of O. viverrini and C. sinensis in endemic areas is needed.

Definitive diagnosis of O. viverrini infection has to date depended on conventional parasitological methods to detect eggs in feces, the most sensitive of which is the formalin-ethyl acetate concentration technique (FECT). Currently, these methods are unreliable at light intensities (fewer than 20 worms) of infection, and have several drawbacks. First, egg detection in stools requires the extensive time of experienced microscopists to detect and distinguish O. viverrini eggs from those of coendemic minute intestinal flukes. Further, fecal eggs may be absent in prepatent infection and when egg passage is obstructed by chronic fibrosis or by dead adult worms after recent anthelmintic treatment. Repeated stool examination is recommended to increase the reliability of fecal examination, but this increases the logistical complexity, cost, and human resources of population screening.

### Molecular diagnostics for soil-transmitted helminths [^111TKFAs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Technical Considerations in Using Qpcr As an STH Diagnostic

Despite the sensitive, rapid, and quantitative nature of qPCR for the diagnosis of STH, there are important methodological considerations in test design and results interpretation. Stool contains bile acids and other substances that inhibit the PCR product amplification. Early on in the use of molecular diagnostics for fecal pathogens, there were significant sensitivity problems when DNA extraction techniques that were not specifically designed to remove these inhibitorswere used. PCR inhibitors are largely removed without problem using 1) more recent in-house developed protocols,2) tissue kits with additional inhibitor removal steps, and 3) stool and soil-engineered kits for DNA extraction.

A more clinically validated study will also amplify an internal control for each specimen to ensure efficient PCR inhibitor removal and to eliminate the possibility of false negatives in the molecular diagnostic results.,

Sensitivity can also be decreased by formalin fixation of the stool prior to DNA extraction. While specific stool preservation methods have not been directly compared in helminth detection through qPCR, in studies assessing the impact of different preservative measures on protozoal DNA amplification,–it has been shown that samples stored in potassium dichromate can be stored at room temperature for prolonged periods before qPCR without any significant loss in sensitivity.

Unlike bacteria, which have cell walls that are easy to lyse, some physical stress is required to optimize the release of the nucleic acids from helminth eggs or larvae (and even some protozoa). While freeze-thaw cycles, heating, and/or sonication do appear to offer an advantage over standard lysis buffer methods, the use of a tissue homogenization ("bead beating") step with beads resistant to degradation (i.e. not glass) likely offers the most thorough disruption of parasite ova, thereby increasing molecular-based assay sensitivities significantly. The amount of stool extracted, the type of physical disruption method used, as well as the relative efficiency of commercial kits in extracting DNA, likely explain much of the variability in sensitivity in published studies (see Table 1).

### Symptoms of intestinal schistosomiasis presenting during treatment of large B cell lymphoma [^1145bq7f]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2004). Low credibility.

We report a case of chronic intestinal schistosomiasis presenting in a previously asymptomatic 34-year-old woman from Saudi Arabia with large B cell lymphoma. The patient presented with abdominal pain, constipation, recurrent rectal bleeding, and persistent mild eosinophilia during chemotherapy. Stools were repeatedly negative for parasite ova, but duodenal and colonic biopsies demonstrated Schistosoma eggs and eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation. Immunosuppressed patients with schistosomiasis may have diminished egg excretion. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion since stool test results may be negative and intestinal biopsies may be needed to make the diagnosis.

### Unexpected zoonotic and hybrid schistosome egg excretion patterns, Malawi, 2024 [^114fuS77]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Our findings not only provide evidence of complex hybridization events in the natural setting among S. haematobium, S. mansoni, and S. mattheei but also highlight the greater relative abundance of zoonotic and hybrid schistosome species ova in feces compared with paired urine samples. That observation suggests that S. mattheei and associated hybrids, previously linked to urogenital schistosomiasis in humans, may dominate in intestinal infections by migrating to the intestinal mesenteries, just as S. mattheei likely does in other mammalian hosts where it causes rectal schistosomiasis. POC-CCA tests were not designed to detect zoonotic schistosomiasis; although we acknowledge that patients X and Y were both POC-CCA positive, those results do not assure the ability of POC-CCA tests to detect S. haematobium group intestinal infections because we did not perform detailed inspection of feces from POC-CCA–negative participants in the field.

In summary, we detected S. haematobium × S. mattheei hybrid ova from 2 patients in Malawi. Further fecal sampling and molecular testing with species-specific TaqMan probe assays will be essential for monitoring intestinal schistosomiasis in coendemic areas where zoonotic transmission could occur.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients: expert review [^112R8rog]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in elderly patients — initial evaluation and differential: When elderly persons present with symptoms such as diarrhea, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and weight loss, providers should have a strong clinical suspicion for IBD, but compared with persons younger than 40 years those older than 60 years are more likely to have mimics including colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–induced pathology, radiation enteritis or colitis, or microscopic colitis. The first diagnostic steps should include laboratory investigations that include a complete blood count and serum albumin, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein levels; liver enzymes and urea and creatinine levels serve to assess comorbidities and provide a baseline for toxicity monitoring. Stool testing for Clostridium difficile in all new presentations of diarrhea, regardless of antibiotic use history, and selective testing of stool for culture and ova and parasites may be appropriate. Cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography is appropriate in elderly persons with acute symptoms, especially when abdominal pain is prominent, and colonoscopy with histologic confirmation remains a cornerstone of diagnosis.

Increased SCFA Production Is Observed across Diverse Helminth and Host Species

To determine whether increases in SCFA availability also occur in other host-parasite settings, we examined metabolite concentrations in the colon of pigs experimentally infected with A. suum and in stool samples from human patients experimentally infected with Nector americanus. A. suum is a parasite of pigs that is closely related to the human parasite A. lumbricoides, a whipworm that infects approximately 25% of the world's population, and N. americanus, a human hookworm, is predominantly found in the tropics and subtropics where it is estimated to infect approximately 740 million people. Analysis of colon contents from pigs experimentally infected with 3 doses of 300 fertilized A. suum eggs on 3 consecutive days revealed increased total SCFA concentrations at 8 weeks after infection (Figure 7 A). This was due to significant increases in propionate and butyrate and a trend toward increased acetate concentrations in infected pigs (Figure 7 B). We next performed an analysis of SCFA concentrations in hookworm-infected patients. Stool samples were obtained from eight otherwise healthy volunteers with diet-managed (gluten-free diet for > 6 months) celiac disease. All eight subjects (Pt1–Pt8) underwent voluntary infection with 20 infective larvae and were assessed 8 weeks after infection. Stool samples were collected prior to, and 8 weeks after, the second infection. From the total of eight patients, six individuals exhibited an increase in total SCFAs (Figure 7 C) and two showed reduced total SCFAs after infection (Figure 7 C). Changes to total SCFAs were reflected by alterations to acetate, propionate, and butyrate, but the degree to which any one metabolite was altered differed between individuals (Figure 7 D). Despite a trend toward increased SCFA concentrations after hookworm infection, this did not reach statistical significance, probably reflecting the small sample size. It is important to note that diet has a major impact on SCFA concentrations and our data do not include comparison to dietary metadata. However, all patients were instructed to maintain their normal (gluten-free) diet over the course of the trial and adherence to these instructions was regularly checked by a trained nurse. Taken together, these data raise the intriguing possibility that helminth-induced increases in bacterial-derived SCFAs might represent a phenomenon that is conserved across multiple host and parasitic species.

### Toward mass drug administration stopping criteria forControl programs [^1173dLoj]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

National control programs for the preventive chemotherapy of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) use mass drug administration (MDA) to reduce infection levels in communities and rely on diagnostic tests to monitor program progress and inform interventions. Control programs for Schistosoma mansoni have conventionally employed stool examinations using the Kato–Katz method for program monitoring. Limitations of the Kato–Katz technique include the substantial time and effort required to make and read slides, its poor sensitivity at low levels of infection, and the occasional unwillingness of participants to provide stool samples. Nevertheless, it is widely available and has been the most relied-on technique for evaluating the prevalence of intestinal schistosomiasis for decades. Therefore, it is the method recommended by the current WHO guidelines for S. mansoni control programs.

The introduction of a commercially available point-of-care (POC) test for circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) provides the promise of a more field-friendly rapid test for monitoring S. mansoni control programs. Like the Kato–Katz method, it can distinguish active from former infections and rapidly becomes negative, following successful treatment. Unlike Kato–Katz, it is a measure of worms rather than eggs, as CCA is produced in the parasite's blind gut and regurgitated into the bloodstream. The antigen is then cleared by the kidneys and excreted in host urine. The POC-CCA has better sensitivity than Kato–Katz for light infections. It is also easier to obtain urine than stool from individuals being monitored, and despite being a commercial product, the POC-CCA is comparable in cost to Kato–Katz when all expenses are taken into consideration. However, as with the introduction of any new test, especially if there are differences in sensitivity or specificity compared with the existing test, new cutoffs must be established for proper program use.

### Diagnostic evaluation of newly arrived asymptomatic refugees with eosinophilia [^1171QVub]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Refugees may arrive for resettlement with asymptomatic parasitic infections, and eosinophilia may be the only clue to the presence of infection. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of eosinophilia and develop a standardized approach to the evaluation of asymptomatic refugees with eosinophilia.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records of refugees seen from October 1998 through May 2002 at Boston Medical Center. Data examined included age, country of origin, absolute eosinophil count, results of stool ova and parasite testing, and results of serological testing for Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma species, and filaria.

Results

Eosinophilia — defined as an absolute eosinophil count of ≥ 450 cells/microL — was present in 266 (12%) of 2224 refugees. Patients with eosinophilia ranged in age from 2 months to 81 years and had arrived from Africa, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. Absolute eosinophil counts ranged from 450 to 3224 cells/microL. Pathogens were identified in stool samples of 76 (29%) of 265 patients. Serological testing for S. stercoralis, Schistosoma species, and/or filaria was done for 120 (45%) of 266 patients. Results of serological testing were positive for S. stercoralis in 45 (39%) of 115 patients, for Schistosoma species in 15 (22%) of 67 patients, and for filaria in 18 (51%) of 35 patients. Serological evidence of parasitic infection was seen at all levels of eosinophilia and in patients with and without pathogens identified in their stool samples.

Conclusions

Systematic evaluation for parasites in asymptomatic, newly arrived refugees with eosinophilia should include stool ova and parasite examination, serological examination for S. stercoralis for all patients, and serological examination for Schistosoma species and filaria in patients from regions where these organisms are endemic.

### Duodenal obstruction-an unusual presentation of strongyloides stercoralis enteritis: a case report [^1117i5DR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Strongyloidiasis is usually associated with anemia, hypocholesterolemia and hypoalbuminemia. Eosinophilia is an inconsistent finding, present in up to 35% during the acute phase, and less frequent in patients with chronic or disseminated disease. Most patients with duodenal obstruction presented low eosinophil count indicating a chronic infection. Eosinopenia and low IgE level have been associated with a poor prognosis, in patients with disseminated disease.

Duodenal obstruction may be caused by different diseases, including tuberculosis, primary intestinal lymphoma, Crohn's disease, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and gastrointestinal stromal tumor. Despite extensive preoperative work-up, three out of the nine cases presented in Table 1, the diagnosis was made after exploratory laparotomy. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is essential for correct diagnosis of Strongyloides -related duodenal obstruction. The diagnosis of strongyloidiasis may be confirmed by the presence of the larvae in the stools. This is an easy performed, broadly available and inexpensive method for detection of the parasite. However, stool examination is relatively insensitive, and diagnostic yield of a single specimen is approximately 30%. The sensitivity of fecal smear could be increased to up to 60%, if five or more stool samples are examined. Of note, S. stercoralis is the only helminth that secretes larvae in the stools. Thus, the presence of eggs in the fecal smear is unlikely.

Other methods such as duodenal aspirate or biopsy are more invasive therefore less desirable. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the examination of a duodenal aspirate for ova and larvae is the most sensitive diagnostic procedure, with a false-negative frequency of less than 10%. Endoscopic findings include duodenal mucosal edema, erythema, hemorrhagic spots, ulcerations, and in some cases megaduodenum. Duodenal white villi is also a common endoscopic feature, and should alert the physician for the diagnosis of strongyloidiasis. Recently, Kishimoto et al. showed that the S. stercoralis larvae identification in duodenal biopsies is feasible in 71% of cases. In eight out of the nine cases presented in Table 1, the diagnosis was made by duodenal aspirate/biopsy, or analysis of surgical specimen. These findings confirmed the poor reliability of stool analysis for the parasite identification

Nevertheless, the presence of the worm in the appendiceal lumen could also contribute to appendicitis, as reported in a case of D. latus infection presenting with chronic right lower abdominal pain mimicking subacute appendicitis. In this previously published case, colonoscopic images revealed the tapeworm lodged in the appendiceal orifice.

Although diphyllobothriasis is not life-threatening, accurate diagnosis and species identification are essential, not because treatments differ by species — they are generally treated similarly — but to update epidemiological data, monitor species geographic distribution, and guide infection control strategies.

Diagnosis relies on detecting proglottids or eggs in stool specimens, which are characteristic of diphyllobothriid cestodes but are insufficient for identification at species or even genus level. Measuring eggs is important to avoid misidentification of morphologically similar trematode eggs. Identification to the species level requires molecular methods, especially sequence analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (cox1).

Based on morphological criteria, the eggs observed in our patient's stool were first identified as Diphyllobothriidae. Molecular analysis was necessary to refine identification.

Our routine Seegene multiplex PCR assays, Allplex GI-Parasite and Allplex GI-Helminth, returned negative results. These assays enable the detection of six protozoa and eight helminths and microsporidia, respectively, in stool specimens. The Allplex GI-Parasite Assay targets Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium spp. Entamoeba histolytica, Dientamoeba fragilis, Blastocystis spp. and Cyclospora spp. The Allplex GI-Helminth Assay detects Ancylostoma spp. Ascaris spp. Enterobius vermicularis, Hymenolepis spp. Necator americanus, Strongyloides spp. Taenia spp. and Trichuris trichiura, alongside microsporidia (Enterocytozoon spp. and Encephalitozoon spp.). This explains the negative results, as Dibothriocephalus is not included in the assay panels. Furthermore, there is no information regarding potential cross-reactivity within the Diphyllobothriidae family.

Arrows indicate eggs of normal morphology (65–75 µm). Original magnification ×400.

Even for experienced morphologists, variability in size and shape of helminth eggs adds a layer of complexity to diagnosis. For example, unusually large Trichuris spp. eggs were observed in the stool of a child in the Bahamas. The size of these eggs was outside of the typically observed range for human-infecting T. trichiura whipworms (normal eggs also were observed in the patient) and instead were within the range of the canine T. vulpis and feline T. campanula (felis) worms. Otherwise, however, the eggs were not morphologically consistent with either of these animal whipworm species. Whether this case was an abnormal egg shedding by T. trichium worms, a zoonotic Trichuris species, or even human infection with a novel species is unknown. Modern molecular diagnosis would aid in species resolution, but this approach is not necessarily an option in underserved areas.

### Clinical significance of respiratory involvement in cryptosporidiosis: cross-sectional study of children with diarrhea and respiratory symptoms in Uganda [^1113aikE]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

We found some evidence to suggest that cryptosporidiosis was associated with respiratory compromise. Children with confirmed respiratory cryptosporidiosis had lower oxygen saturations at presentation than other children who underwent sputum induction, although this difference was not apparent in children with and without Cryptosporidium in the stool. In the Malawi study, respiratory rates, oxygen saturation and frequencies of respiratory symptoms were similar between stool-positive and stool-negative children. We focused our study on patients with cough or unexplained tachypnea to enrich the sample with children who would be eligible for sputum induction according to our approved ethics protocol. As such, we cannot assess differences in the frequency of cough between groups. Previous studies have, however, found that children with Cryptosporidium diarrhea are more likely to have cough than those with diarrhea due to other causes. We speculate that Cryptosporidium was the likely cause of respiratory signs and symptoms in at least some of the children in our study, as evidenced by the fact that nearly 40% of sputum-positive children in our study had negative bacterial cultures (compared with only 24% of sputum-negative children, P = 0.044). No studies have systematically investigated respiratory viral pathogens in our patient population however analysis of a small number of samples from this study (n = 48) reveals that viral carriage is high (> 90%, unpublished). The clinical significance of this finding is not clear and warrants further investigation.

We characterized children using parameters (gender, age, HIV status, nutritional and hydration status, concurrent bacterial infection) that have been proven to predict adverse outcomes, including hospitalization, in many other circumstances. When adjusted for these, however, the risk of hospitalization was still significantly higher for children with Cryptosporidium in sputum compared with those with only enteric infection. This implies that the presence of Cryptosporidium in the respiratory tract represents a severe presentation. If confirmed, then respiratory cryptosporidiosis may be a useful prognostic marker. We speculate that respiratory involvement above and beyond enteric involvement may indicate enhanced susceptibility and/or greater parasite burden. Numerous historical case reports have emphasized respiratory cryptosporidiosis as a feature of disseminated disease in immunocompromised patients. However, it is also plausible that in this age group, this reflects the first time that some children have been infected and thus they have no prior immunity. This could result in higher parasite burden. The latter is supported by a study in Malawi, which found that children with respiratory cryptosporidiosis tended to shed the parasite for a longer period than those whose infection was limited to the gastrointestinal tract.

### Capsule endoscopy is a feasible procedure for identifying a diphyllobothrium nihonkaiense infection and determining the indications for vermifuge treatment [^114Aqt8e]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Diphyllobothrium is a member of Cestoda family, which is the largest parasite of humans. The diagnosis of diphyllobothriasis is based on the detection of eggs in the stool. Because the remainder of the scolex causes a relapse in diphyllobothriasis, the scolex must be completely discharged to cure the parasite infection. However, the scolex or forefront of the Diphyllobothrium is difficult to detect with gastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, because most Diphyllobothrium attach to the jejunal wall. In the present case, capsule endoscopy detected proglottids as well as forefront of the parasite at jejunum. Based on the results of capsule endoscopy, the patient underwent additional vermifuge (anthelminthic) treatment to cure the diphyllobothriasis and discharged a worm measuring 3 m in length with a scolex. Capsule endoscopy is a practical option to determine whether additional vermifuge treatment is required through the detection of the proglottids as well as a scolex or forefront of the parasite.

Detection of single- and co-infections of STHs from faecal, egg and worm isolates

To understand the genetic diversity and differentiation of STH populations worldwide, we analysed data from 1000 DNA samples with known or suspected STH infections. This sample cohort included 150 samples from 13 countries (including adult worm and faecal samples) selected for sequencing based on confirmed helminth infections via microscopy or qPCR, along with 850 publicly available genomic datasets (including purified eggs, adult worms, and faecal samples) from 19 countries. In total, the 1000 genomic datasets, derived from 128 individual adult worms, 842 faecal samples, and 30 semi-purified egg samples, represented 27 countries (Supplementary Data 1) from six continents.

Sequencing reads from each dataset were mapped to eight mitochondrial and nuclear reference genomes of STHs and other gastrointestinal helminths reported to infect humans (Supplementary Data 2). Out of 842 faecal samples, 175 were positive by sequencing for at least one helminth species (minimium threshold of 10 helminth reads / million reads mapped; Supplementary Fig. 1a) spanning 14 different countries (Fig. 1a, c and Supplementary Fig. 2a). We suspect that our approach resulted in false-negatives, due to (i) the low parasite prevalence of many infections and in turn, low proportion of parasite DNA present particularly in complex faecal samples, and (ii) the conservative minimum read threshold necessarily to ensure sensitivity and specificity of detection. Reads mapping to A. lumbricoides were the most abundant (96 single-infections and 27 co-infections containing two or more species), which might be expected given that Ascaris worms are highly fecund (females deposit > 200,000 eggs per day)and would result in a larger proportion of Ascaris DNA being sequenced relative to other parasites present. The next largest number of infections was caused by N. americanus (35 single infections and 13 co-infections), followed by T. trichiura (six single infections and 15 co-infections). We also assessed whether we could detect other helminth species present in faecal samples by sequencing, mapping reads to Schistosoma mansoni (eight single infections and one co-infection), Strongyloides stercoralis (one co-infection), Enterobius vermicularis (two co-infections), and Ancylostoma ceylanicum (one single infection and two co-infections). Among the 158 samples derived from worms or pools of eggs, 154 were helminth-positive by sequencing, spanning 15 different countries (Fig. 1b, d and Supplementary Fig. 1b). A. lumbricoides was the most abundant helminth present in the cohort tested (71 single infections and 20 co-infections), followed by T. trichiura (26 single infections and 22 co-infections), S. stercoralis (16 single infections), N. americanus (five single infections, nine co-infections), S. mansoni (11 single infections, one co-infection), and one co-infection each, by E. vermicularis and Ancylostoma duodenale.

### A large-scale study on the prevalence of intestinal parasites in patients referred to medical laboratories in urmia, northwest iran [^115k15Q4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Enterobius vermicularis, or pinworm, is among the most prevalent nematode infections worldwide. Humans are the only natural host for E. vermicularis, and it is spread among people living in crowded environments directly through egg ingestion. The diagnosis of enterobiasis can be achieved by cellophane tape or pinworm paddle tests, in which adhesive tape is placed on the perianal area and then examined under a microscope to detect eggs. Stool examination is not recommended for the diagnosis of enterobiasis, yet eggs are rarely detectable in stool. In the present study, an accidental case of enterobiasis was diagnosed by observation of eggs in the stool examination.

Salehi et al. (2020) carried out research on IPIs in 52 children with cancer in Ahvaz, Southwest Iran. They reported that 38.38% of their studied population was infected/colonized by a variety of intestinal parasites/commensals. Similar to the present study they reported Blastocystis (23%), Endolimax nana (7.7%), Entamoeba coli (1.92%), and Chilomastix mesnili (1.92%) as the most prevalent protozoa. However, they also reported Strongyloides stercoralis (3.84%) which was not detected in the present study. They concluded that Blastocystis and Endolimax nana are the most prevalent in individuals admitted to Baqaei2 Hospital of Ahvaz, Iran. Comparing their reported prevalence with the present study shows that IPIs/Cs in Ahvaz in children with cancer are considerably higher than our results in Urmia.

Abbaszadeh et al. (2021) in a meta-analysis studied intestinal parasites among intellectually disabled individuals in Iran. They reported an overall pooled prevalence of 41% with a range of 21–68% across subgroups. The most prevalent reported parasites were Entamoeba coli (16.2%), Blastocystis spp. (12.2%), Giardia duodenalis (11.9%), and Enterobius vermicularis (11.3%) followed by Strongyloides stercoralis (10.9%) and Hymenolepis nana (2.8%). Based on the results of their study, IPIs are highly prevalent in intellectually disabled humans compared to our studied population (6.5%).

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of infectious diarrhea [^114yp9hy]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Immunocompromised hosts with persistent diarrhea — evaluation and HIV testing considerations include that besides stool examination, other investigations may be necessary for the HIV-infected patient, including blood cultures for diagnosis of MAC infection and colonoscopy with biopsy for CMV enteritis. Diarrhea caused by protozoa such as Cryptosporidium, Cyclospora, Cystoisospora or microsporidia is more likely to be severe, chronic, or relapsing in immunocompromised people, and because microscopic examination of stool for ova and parasites is unlikely to include testing for Cryptosporidium and Cyclospora, clinicians should specifically request Cryptosporidium and/or Cyclospora testing. Noninfectious etiologies including adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy or chemotherapy also may account for persistent diarrhea in immunocompromised hosts, and in some patients with diarrhea lasting ≥ 30 days, testing for HIV may be appropriate.

Fundoscopy is an important part of evaluation of patients with potential hydrocephalus or cerebral edema. By contrast, in parenchymal NCC with small number of cysts or granulomas, fundoscopy is unlikely to detect papilledema. However, fundoscopic examination should be performed to exclude intraocular cysticerci, which occurs in a small proportion of patients. Antiparasitic therapy may lead to blindness in some cases with unsuspected intraocular parasites. An indirect fundoscopic examination may be more sensitive for detection of parasites. Ocular ultrasound examination is an alternative method to screen for ocular involvement.

Patients acquire infection from a tapeworm carrier (usually either the patient with NCC or a close contact). However, there is a prolonged incubation period between infection with NCC and onset of symptoms. Many of the tapeworm carriers who originally transmitted infection may have cleared the intestinal infection or may no longer live near the patient. Presently, stool microscopy is the only available diagnostic test for tapeworms. Stool examination for ova is often negative in tapeworm carriers. Even multiple examinations may not detect the tapeworm carrier. Even when ova are found, the morphology of the ova cannot distinguish T. solium from other Taenia species. Thus, the yield of microscopy for identification of tapeworm carriers is generally low even in cases with apparent transmission outside of endemic areas. Nevertheless, among patients who apparently acquired infection in the United States, Sorvillo et al.documented tapeworms in close contacts of 22% of NCC cases. Thus, most authorities would recommend screening for cases acquired outside endemic areas. Newer methods such as antigen detection in stool or detection of tapeworm-stage specific antibodies by immunoblot might improve the usefulness of screening, but these are presently only research techniques and not commercially available at present.

Tapeworm carriers pose a public health risk, especially if they are food handlers. There are also risks of transmission within the household and from mother to child. Thus, identification of a tapeworm carrier is an important public health issue and local public health authorities should be notified of cases of NCC (NCC or tapeworm carriage is reportable in many states and regions, but reporting is not mandated nationally). Public health authorities should be notified of cases and involved in investigation of tapeworm carriers.

### Accuracy of diagnostic tests for schistosoma mansoni infection in asymptomatic Eritrean refugees: serology and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen against stool microscopy [^114UTxYF]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The unprecedented increase in number of African refugees arriving in Europe is confronting clinicians and general practitioners with the question of whether or not and how to screen migrants from endemic regions for Schistosoma mansoni infection.

Methods

We assessed the accuracy of 3 different diagnostic tests for S. mansoni infection (stool microscopy [samples prepared by sedimentation technique], serology, and point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen [POC-CCA] urine cassette test) in 107 newly arrived asymptomatic Eritrean refugees in Switzerland.

Result

Sixty-three study participants (59%) tested positive by at least 1 of the 3 methods. Thirty-seven participants (35%) were considered to have active schistosomiasis, either due to the detection of parasite eggs in stool and/or the presence of a concordant positive serology and urine POC-CCA test, which we consider to be a suitable surrogate marker of active infection. Of 23 microscopy-positive participants, 22 were positive by serology (95.7% sensitivity) and 21 were positive by the urine POC-CCA test (91.3% sensitivity). The combination of serology and urine POC-CCA testing detected all 23 microscopy-positive study participants (100% sensitivity).

Conclusions

With a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 82.2%-100%), the combination of serology plus urine POC-CCA testing appears to be the most sensitive screening option for asymptomatic S. mansoni infection in Eritrean refugees, compared with stool sedimentation microscopy.

### The presence of serum anti-ascaris lumbricoides IgE antibodies and of trichuris trichiura infection are risk factors for wheezing and / or atopy in preschool-aged Brazilian children [^117EpUDw]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

The presence of high levels of anti- A. lumbricoides IgE antibodies would reflect at least a partial immunity to infection, which would explain the association of wheezing with IgE antibodies and not with A. lumbricoides eggs in the stool. This immunity would therefore explain the absence of correlation between A. lumbricoides eggs in the stool and this parasite specific serum IgE antibodies, observed in this and in a previously reported study. The frequency of antibody-eliciting larvae invasion should be directly proportional to poor sanitation, such as a lack of a sewage system, which was also associated with more frequent wheezing in the studied population.

In addition to association with wheezing, we identified a clear association between the presence of anti- A. lumbricoides IgE antibodies and atopy. However, as mentioned earlier, there are conflicting reports on intestinal helminthic infections decreasing, not affecting or increasing atopy and allergic symptoms, although a systematic review and meta-analysis found that A. lumbricoides infection was associated with a significantly increased risk of asthma. The fact that A. lumbricoides eggs were not associated with wheezing and atopy, while there were strong associations of anti- A. lumbricoides IgE antibodies with these two outcomes, may explain why some previous studies relying only on the detection of helminthic eggs did not identify these associations. In addition, one widely accepted hypothesis that has been put forward to explain these discrepant findings is that high worm burden and chronic helminthic infections would lead to the production of immunoregulatory cytokines and to protection against atopy and asthma, while low worm burden or recent infection would promote atopy and allergy. The present data corroborate this hypothesis, since the studied children are very young and probably had been infected recently. Moreover, these children had low to moderate A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura egg burdens. It is possible that several months or years in the future, with repeated or chronic T. trichiura infections, the tendency would be for infection-associated regulatory cells reducing atopy. This phenomenon would account for the findings of an investigation carried out recently in Salvador by our research group, which showed that early infection by T. trichiura protected against the development of aeroallergen skin test reactivity in later childhood. This finding in older children, and the demonstration in the present report of a positive association between T. trichiura infection and wheezing in infants, is consistent with the acute-chronic infection hypothesis explaining different types of association between helminth infection and atopy, mentioned above.

### The brief case: hidden intruders-serendipitous discovery of an infection after appendicitis surgery [^112nJn3Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Microscopic examination of stool smears revealed numerous ovoid, unembryonated eggs measuring approximately 65 × 45 µm, with morphological features strongly indicative of a diphyllobothriid cestode (Fig. 1).

Fig 1
(A, B): Direct wet mount microscopy of the patient's unstained stool specimen showing ovoid, unembryonated eggs (65 × 45 µm).

Results obtained with the multiplex PCR Allplex GI-Parasite and Allplex GI-Helminth assays (Seegene) were negative, while the NovoDiag Stool Parasite multiplex PCR detected the presence of Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiensis/latus DNA in the stool sample. The final identification was confirmed based on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (cox1) gene sequencing using Sanger method and the JB6/JB5R primers, as previously described. The obtained 606 bp sequence allowed us to identify the causative agent as Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiensis (GenBank accession number), with > 99% identity to reference sequences from Genbank and 100% coverage. The sequencing analysis was performed by the laboratory of Parasitology of the Rennes University Hospital (France), per routine testing.

Histopathological examination of appendectomy specimens revealed acute appendicitis. The pattern of inflammation was predominantly suppurative, with evidence of a transmural inflammatory process and mild periappendicular peritonitis, likely caused by the stercolith. No eggs were observed in the appendiceal tissue.

The patient was definitively diagnosed with diphyllobothriasis caused by Dibothriocephalus nihonkaiensis. He was treated with a single dose of praziquantel at 10 mg/kg while hospitalized. The tapeworm was considered eliminated, as no further worm or proglottid release was observed post-treatment. The patient reported no residual abdominal pain. The control stool examination was negative months after treatment.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116DfZam]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Isosporiasis — diagnosis is by identifying I. belli oocysts in stool (or duodenal aspirates using the Entero-Test) or developmental stages in biopsy specimens, with oocysts relatively large (23–33 μm long by 10–19 μm wide) yet potentially difficult to find and sometimes shed in low numbers even by individuals who have severe diarrhea. Although staining is frequently variable, the organism can be identified with use of a modified acid-fast stain, staining bright red on a green background, and it also autofluoresces when viewed by ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy. Histologic findings can include blunting and clubbing of villi and hypertrophied crypts and an increase in lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in the lamina propria, with peripheral eosinophilia occurring in up to half of patients. Serologic tests are not available, and polymerase chain reaction is a promising diagnostic tool but is not yet commercially available in the United States.

### Proton pump inhibitor use is associated with a reduced risk of infection with intestinal protozoa [^116zw6Jc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can kill some human protozoan parasites in cell culture better than the drug metronidazole. Clinical data showing an antiprotozoal effect for PPIs are lacking. The objective of the study is to determine if PPI use is associated with a reduced risk of having intestinal parasites.

Methods

We obtained electronic medical record data for all persons who received a stool ova and parasite (O & P) examination at our tertiary care academic medical center in Cleveland, Ohio, between January 2000 and September 2014. We obtained the person's age, whether they were taking a PPI at the time of the O & P examination, and whether the pathology report indicated the presence of any parasites. χ² with Yates correction was used to determine if PPI use was associated with stool protozoa.

Results

Three intestinal protozoa were identified in 1199 patients taking a PPI (0.3%), and 551 intestinal parasites were identified in the 14,287 patients not taking a PPI (3.9%). There was a statistically significant lower likelihood of finding protozoa in the stool of a person taking a PPI compared with those not taking a PPI (P < .0001).

Conclusions

Patients taking a PPI were statistically less likely to have an intestinal protozoa reported on stool O & P examination compared with those not taking a PPI.

### Identifying helminth infections via routine fecal parasitological examinations in Korea [^112Bbk49]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

We conducted this study to explore the extent of occult helminth infection identified by fecal parasitological examinations or organ-specific examinations such as colonoscopy and abdominal ultrasonography (US) during health checkups. We analyzed 197,422 fecal samples from 99,451 subjects who received health checkups at a single center over 10 years. We found that 3,472 (1.8%) samples from 3,342 (3.4%) subjects tested positive for parasitic ova, including clonorchiasis, metagonimiasis, trichuriasis, ascariasis, trichostrongylosis, taeniasis, and enterobiasis. The detection rate for clonorchiasis was higher in those who were taking their first examination than in those who had been examined previously. The detection rate for clonorchiasis decreased gradually over the 10 years. Only 2.5% of the patients with clonorchiasis showed US or computed tomography (CT) images that were compatible with the disease. Clonorchiasis patients who had abdominal US or CT images that suggested clonorchiasis were older and had lower body mass indices and higher eosinophil counts than did those whose US or CT images did not suggest the disease. We observed worms in 9% of the patients with trichuriasis who had received a colonoscopy. Colonoscopy also uncovered adult worms in 0.03% of subjects who were not identified as having Trichuris trichiura ova in their fecal helminth examinations. In summary, our study shows that occult helminth infection is fairly frequently identified by a variety of methods during health checkups, which suggests that doctors need to make greater effort to identify and treat occult helminth infections in Korea.

### New insights into the kinetics and variability of egg excretion in controlled human hookworm infections [^1156x4r1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Four healthy volunteers were infected with 50 Necator americanus infective larvae (L3) in a controlled human hookworm infection trial and followed for 52 weeks. The kinetics of fecal egg counts in volunteers was assessed with Bayesian multilevel analysis, which revealed an increase between weeks 7 and 13, followed by an egg density plateau of about 1000 eggs/g of feces. Variation in egg counts was minimal between same-day measurements but varied considerably between days, particularly during the plateau phase. These analyses pave the way for the controlled human hookworm model to accelerate drug and vaccine efficacy studies.

### Schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection in rural Zimbabwe: implications of coinfection for excretion of eggs [^114hNxbe]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Stunted development and reduced fecundity of Schistosoma parasites in immunodeficient mice and the impaired ability of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1)-infected humans to excrete schistosome eggs have been described. This study explores the effect that HIV-1-associated immunodeficiency has on the excretion of schistosome eggs in a large cohort of coinfected individuals.

Methods

In a cross-sectional survey, urine and stool samples were obtained from and HIV-1 status was determined for 1545 individuals. More extensive data, including quantitative measures of intensity of infection in schistosomiasis and immunodeficiency, were collected in the Mupfure schistosomiasis and HIV longitudinal cohort, composed of 379 participants of whom 154 were coinfected with HIV-1 and Schistosoma parasites.

Results

In the cross-sectional survey, the overall prevalence of schistosomiasis was 43.4%, and 26.3% of the participants were infected with HIV-1. Schistosome infections were due to Schistosoma haematobium in 63.6% of cases, S. mansoni in 18.1% of cases, and dual infections in 18.4% of cases. Intensities of Schistosoma infections, measured by the number of eggs excreted and by the level of circulating anodic antigens, did not differ between HIV-1-negative and HIV-1-positive participants coinfected with S. haematobium, S. mansoni, or both. CD4 cell counts were significantly lower in HIV-1-positive participants and in S. mansoni-infected HIV-1-negative participants than in other participants.

Conclusion

The present study suggests that adult HIV-1-related immunodeficiency does not impair the ability to excrete eggs in low-intensity infection with S. haematobium, S. mansoni, or both and that infection with HIV-1 may not have major implications for diagnosis and surveillance of schistosomiasis.

### Clinical and laboratory evaluation of new immigrant and refugee children arriving in Greece [^114bS9Yf]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Eosinophilia is a common finding among immigrants and refugees from parasite-endemic regions and was noted in 22.7% of our study population. In migrant children, infection with helminthic parasites is the commonest cause of eosinophilia. However, aetiologic diagnosis of gastrointestinal parasitosis may prove difficult as many individuals are asymptomatic, and stool parasitology may be negative during the pre-patent phase of the infection. At the same time, even in subjects presenting in the post-patent period, a negative stool investigation does not always preclude infection, since methods of parasite detection are often insensitive, and recognition of ova, cysts or adult parasites in stool largely depends on the experience of the examining scientist and the laboratory technique employed. Furthermore, investigation of parasitic infection requires direct examination of multiple stool samples, collected several days apart, in addition to a stool culture for Strongyloides, serology for both Strongyloide s and Schistosoma, urine microscopy for Schistosoma and filarial serology depending on the migrant's country of origin. Collectively considering the above obstacles, some experts recommend presumptive treatment with albendazole of all asymptomatic migrant children presenting with eosinophilia, who originate from endemic countries, as it is a more feasible and cost-effective approach. For practical and logistic reasons we were only able to obtain a total of twenty single stool samples for microscopy from sixty-eight participants with eosinophilia at the time of the present study, and all yielded negative results. It is evident that this precludes any conclusions regarding the prevalence of parasitic infections in our population. It is worth mentioning though that, stool specimens obtained according to recommendations that were subsequently tested by microscopy, revealed positive findings in five out of one-hundred new migrant children attending our clinic during 2014–2015 regardless of eosinophilia (personal data on file).

### Capillaria ova and diagnosis of trichuris trichiura infection in humans by kato-katz smear, Liberia [^115zZCTv]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Kato-Katz smears are the most commonly used diagnostic tool for detecting and quantifying soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in field surveys. Although this method has some shortcomings, its advantages are field suitability and fast microscopic enumeration of worm eggs. Whereas sensitivity is low for light infections because of the small amount of stool examined (≈41 mg), the specificity of Kato-Katz for diagnosis of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infection is considered to be high. In contrast, hookworm eggs are difficult to differentiate by morphology, but quantitative PCR (qPCR) enables differentiation among Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale, and A. ceylanicum eggs.

Among helminth eggs found in human feces, the barrel-shaped eggs of T. trichiura worms are considered to be characteristic, with a length of 50–55 µm, a width of 22–24 µm, and clearly protruding bipolar plugs. Similar eggs of other members of the Trichiuridae family may be differentiated from T. trichiura eggs by size and morphology when observed at high magnification, but these eggs have rarely been found in human fecal samples. Therefore, the presence of eggs of zoonotic members of the Trichiuridae family is generally not considered a confounder for detecting T. trichiura by Kato-Katz smear.

### Schistosomiasis among travelers: new aspects of an old disease [^111RGWNm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Laboratory Findings

For patients with acute schistosomiasis, physical examination findings were usually unremarkable. Laboratory test results showed eosinophilia in 73% and mildly abnormal liver function in 17%. Eosinophilia was more prevalent in patients with acute than with chronic schistosomiasis (Table 1).

Diagnoses were confirmed by serologic testing for 120 (87.6%) patients. For only 35 (26.9%) patients, mostly those with chronic schistosomiasis, were schistosome ova found in urine, semen, or stool samples (Table 1). For 6 patients, the diagnosis was established by chance in a tissue biopsy; subsequent testing showed ova in the stool or urine of 5 of these 6 patients. A diagnosis of schistosomiasis was made for 1 additional patient, whose colectomy specimen (colectomy performed because of familial adenomatous polyposis) contained schistosome ova 10 years after exposure.

Treatment

Praziquantel was offered to all 113 patients, but follow-up information after treatment was available for only 65. Eosinophil counts declined from a mean ± SD of 2,100 × 10⁹ /L ± 1,850 to 970 × 10⁹ /L ± 1,575 (p < 0.01). Because respiratory symptoms were the least self-limiting form of acute schistosomiasis, response to therapy was evaluated in these patients. Among the 38 patients with respiratory symptoms, 4 cases resolved before praziquantel therapy, and follow up was incomplete for 12. Of the remaining 22 patients, in 9 cases there was an acute exacerbation of symptoms after praziquantel therapy, lasting from a few days to 3 weeks. Corticosteroids were prescribed for 5 patients with protracted respiratory symptoms, and repeated courses of praziquantel were prescribed for 6. Overall, in 20 of 22 cases, symptoms improved within 2 months after therapy. A history of asthma was not associated with a worsening of symptoms after therapy.

### Schistosomiasis among travelers: new aspects of an old disease [^116MpZ6D]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Our study illustrates the problems encountered in diagnosing Schistosoma infection in patients evaluated during acute schistosomiasis. Stool and urine examinations for ova were largely negative, diagnoses relied on serologic testing, and therefore most diagnoses were made post facto. Although serologic testing appears to be very sensitive, a caveat must be added that most serum samples were collected relatively late in the course of acute schistosomiasis. For the acutely ill febrile returning traveler, serologic test results may be negative, as occurred for 2 of our patients for whom an additional specimen was required for diagnosis.

The ability to diagnose chronic schistosomiasis by ova detection was higher (Table 1); however, for many patients, only serologic testing gave a positive result. Thus, ova detection, which is the main diagnostic tool in schistosomiasis-endemic countries, often gives negative results for travelers. Negative results occur during the acute stage because symptoms start before oviposition and during the chronic stage because of low-level or intermittent oviposition. Successful ova detection entails multiple examinations of stool or urine; sensitivity depends greatly on technique and expertise, which may be declining at many Western institutions.

Treatment of schistosomiasis can also be problematic. Praziquantel is considered the drug of choice for schistosomiasis but possesses little activity against the juvenile forms of the helminth (schistosomulae). Of our patients who were exposed in Lake Malawi, 11 took praziquantel soon after exposure while abroad, as a form of preemptive therapy for later schistosomiasis, which is a common recommendation for visitors to Lake Malawi. Of these, acute schistosomiasis developed in 7, symptoms lasted 5–45 weeks, and chronic schistosomiasis developed in 2. These cases show that praziquantel given shortly after exposure does not preclude later clinical infection.

The limitations of praziquantel for treating acute schistosomiasis were clearly seen in our patients. For those who had fever and rash, symptom duration was relatively short, and the contribution of therapy is unclear. For patients with respiratory symptoms, therapy was sometimes associated with an acute exacerbation of symptoms. For some patients, cough and dyspnea continued for many months after treatment. Our policy is to repeat praziquantel treatment after 3 months, which may be why we did not see chronic schistosomiasis in this group.

### Development of two antibody detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for serodiagnosis of human chronic fascioliasis [^11275cqA]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

Coprological examination based on egg detection in stool samples is currently used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of human fascioliasis. However, this method is not effective during the acute phase of the disease and has poor sensitivity during the chronic phase. Serodiagnosis has become an excellent alternative to coprological examination in efforts to combat the effects of fascioliasis on human and animal health. Two novel recombinant Fasciola hepatica proteins, i.e., a ferritin (FhFtn-1) and a tegument-associated protein (FhTP16.5), were used as antigens to develop in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. The assays were optimized and validated using 152 serum samples from humans with a known infection status, including healthy subjects, patients with chronic fascioliasis, and patients with other parasitic diseases. The FhFtn-1 ELISA was shown to be 96.6% sensitive and 95.7% specific; the respective parameters for the FhTP16.5 ELISA were 91.4% and 92.4%. The performances of the FhFtn-1 and FhTP16.5 ELISAs were compared with that of an available commercial test (the DRG test) using a subset of serum samples. Our in-house tests were slightly more sensitive than the DRG test in detecting antibodies against F. hepatica, but the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence for the potential of the FhFtn-1 and FhTP16.5 ELISAs as diagnostic tools for human fascioliasis, as might be implemented in conjunction with standard assays for large-scale screenings in areas where the disease is endemic and for the detection of occasional cases in clinical laboratories.

### Sensitive diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up of schistosoma mansoni infections in asymptomatic Eritrean refugees by circulating anodic antigen detection and polymerase chain reaction [^111j36vy]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Schistosomiasis affects more than 230 million individuals worldwide and is mainly endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. The increasing number of African refugees and migrants traveling to Europe from or passing through Schistosoma -endemic regions stresses the importance of screening for Schistosoma infections, but at the same time raises the question of which diagnostic test is most suitable for this specific population. Although the commercially available point-of-care (POC) test detecting circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) is being used more often for diagnosing S. mansoni infection in non-endemic study settings, – the detection of Schistosoma -specific antibodies remains the most widely used and recommended first-line test for screening, whereas the detection of eggs in urine or stool is still often used as a reference standard to confirm infection as well as to determine the species.

These diagnostic methods, however, lack the sensitivity to detect infections of low intensity. In particular, in the case of refugees and migrants, diagnosing schistosomiasis is challenging because microscopy is often negative when performed on a single stool sample, and antibody detection is unable to differentiate between active and past infection. An alternative and more sensitive method for the diagnosis of imported Schistosoma infections in routine laboratory settings is the detection of Schistosoma -specific DNA. For example, Schistosoma internal transcriber-spacer-2 (ITS2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been shown to detect egg-negative cases and demonstrate that individual DNA loads decrease after treatment, indicating its suitability to monitor efficacy of treatment. In addition, a significant number of microscopy-negative cases have detectable levels of circulating anodic antigen (CAA), a unique gut-associated antigen that is excreted continuously by adult worms and is therefore detectable within weeks of infection as well as in chronic infections. – CAA is detected by highly sensitive and specific monoclonal antibodies, making the up-converting particle (UCP) lateral flow (LF) CAA test highly specific. The presence of CAA in urine or serum demonstrates the presence of living worms, indicating active infection. CAA levels decline rapidly (within weeks) after treatment with praziquantel, making this test suitable for both individual and community screening as well as for follow-up after praziquantel treatment. The UCP-LF CAA test is a genus-specific test able to identify active Schistosoma infections of all known species. This test has shown high accuracy in detecting the four major Schistosoma species in different endemic, – as well as non-endemic routine diagnostic settings. –

### Community epidemiology approach to parasitic infection screening in a remote community in Ecuador [^115RcXSs]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

The Awa indigenous people of Ecuador live in remote areas and were included in health programs only recently. The first screening for parasitic infections in the Awa communities was implemented in the context of community epidemiology. During the site visits in each community, the health-care staff collected the samples for stool microscopy and serology for Strongyloides. A total of 705 individuals consented for the study, representing 40% of the Awa population living in the targeted communities; 184 (26%) participants supplied a stool sample. Giardia intestinalis was found in about 11% of samples. Prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura was 54.9% and 36.9%, respectively. No hookworm eggs were found. In addition, Strongyloides stercoralis larvae were found in eight individuals (4.3%), whereas serology was positive in 22.7% of the individuals tested. The community-based approach resulted in an impressive participation. There was a high prevalence of parasites associated with relevant morbidity.

### Where have all the diagnostic morphological parasitologists gone? [^111bBGRD]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Advances in laboratory techniques have revolutionized parasitology diagnostics over the past several decades. Widespread implementation of rapid antigen detection tests has greatly expanded access to tests for global parasitic threats such as malaria, while next-generation amplification and sequencing methods allow for sensitive and specific detection of human and animal parasites in complex specimen matrices. Recently, the introduction of multiplex panels for human gastrointestinal infections has enhanced the identification of common intestinal protozoa in feces along with bacterial and viral pathogens. Despite the benefits provided by novel diagnostics, increased reliance on nonmicroscopy-based methods has contributed to the progressive, widespread loss of morphology expertise for parasite identification. Loss of microscopy and morphology skills has the potential to negatively impact patient care, public health, and epidemiology. Molecular- and antigen-based diagnostics are not available for all parasites and may not be suitable for all specimen types and clinical settings. Furthermore, inadequate morphology experience may lead to missed and inaccurate diagnoses and erroneous descriptions of new human parasitic diseases. This commentary highlights the need to maintain expert microscopy and morphological parasitology diagnostic skills within the medical and scientific community. We proposed that light microscopy remains an important part of training and practice in the diagnosis of parasitic diseases and that efforts should be made to train the next generation of morphological parasitologists before the requisite knowledge, skills, and capacity for this complex and important mode of diagnosis are lost. In summary, the widespread, progressive loss of morphology expertise for parasite identification negatively impacts patient care, public health, and epidemiology.

### Common intestinal parasites… [^115HqWTZ]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

Adult worms are quite small; the males measure 2 to 5 mm, and the females measure 8 to 13 mm. The worms live primarily in the cecum of the large intestine, from which the gravid female migrates at night to lay up to 15, 000 eggs on the perineum. The eggs can be spread by the fecal-oral route to the original host and new hosts. Eggs on the host's perineum can spread to other persons in the house, possibly resulting in an entire family becoming infected. Ingested eggs hatch in the duodenum, and larvae mature during their migration to the large intestine. Fortunately, most eggs desiccate within 72 hours. In the absence of host autoinfection, infestation usually lasts only four to six weeks. Disease secondary to. Pinworm infection should be suspected in children who exhibit perianal pruritus and nocturnal restlessness. Direct visualization of the adult worm or microscopic detection of eggs confirms the diagnosis, but only 5 percent of infected persons have eggs in their stool.

The "cellophane tape test" can serve as a quick way to clinch the diagnosis. 6, 7. This test consists of touching tape to the perianal area several times, removing it, and examining the tape under direct microscopy for eggs. The test should be conducted right after awakening on at least three consecutive days. This technique can increase the test's sensitivity to roughly 90 percent. Both species share a common life cycle. Eggs hatch into rhabditiform larvae, feed on bacteria in soil, and molt into the infective filariform larvae. Enabled by moist climates and poor hygiene, filariform larvae enter their hosts through pores, hair follicles, and even intact skin. Maturing larvae travel through the circulation system until they reach alveolar capillaries. Breaking into lung parenchyma, the larvae climb the bronchial tree and are swallowed with secretions.

Six weeks after the initial infection, mature worms have attached to the wall of the small intestine to feed, and egg production begins. 16 Compensatory volume expansion contributes to hypoproteinemia, edema, pica, and wasting. The infection may result in physical and mental retardation in children. Eosinophilia has been noted in 30 to 60 percent of infected patients. While clinical history, hygiene status, and recent travel to endemic areas can give important clues, definitive diagnosis rests on microscopic visualization of eggs in the stool.

### DPDx-ascariasis… [^111qEikm]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Life Cycle: Adult worms live in the lumen of the small intestine. A female may produce approximately 200, 000 eggs per day, which are passed with the feces. Unfertilized eggs may be ingested but are not infective. Larvae develop to infectivity within fertile eggs after 18 days to several weeks, depending on the environmental conditions. After infective eggs are swallowed, the larvae hatch, invade the intestinal mucosa, and are carried via the portal, then systemic circulation to the lungs. The larvae mature further in the lungs, penetrate the alveolar walls, ascend the bronchial tree to the throat, and are swallowed. Upon reaching the small intestine, they develop into adult worms. Between 2 and 3 months are required from ingestion of the infective eggs to oviposition by the adult female. Adult worms can live 1 to 2 years. Ascaris lumbricoideseggs are passed in the stool of the infected host.

Fertilized eggs are are rounded and have a thick shell with an external mammillated layer that is often stained brown by bile. In some cases, the outer layer is absent. A. lumbricoidesin an unstained wet mount of stool, 200x magnification. A larva is visible in the egg. A. lumbricoidesin an unstained wet mount of stool. A. lumbricoidesfertilized, decorticated eggs. A. lumbricoidesdecorticated, fertile egg in wet mounts, 200x magnification. Laboratory Diagnosis Microscopic identification of eggs in the stool is the most common method for diagnosing intestinal ascariasis. The recommended procedure is as follows:

- Collect a stool specimen.
- Preserve the specimen in formalin or another fixative.
- Concentrate using the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation technique
- Examine a wet mount of the sediment.

Molecular methods for the detection of egg/worm DNA in human stools are increasingly used in research settings, often in multi-parallel formats for detecting this and other soil-transmitted helminths. Laboratory Safety Standard precautions for the processing of stool samples apply. Ascaris spp. eggs require weeks in the environment to develop to an infective stage; thus infectious eggs are not likely to be encountered in clinical specimens.
