## Question

Doxazosin vs tamsulosin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about choosing between doxazosin and tamsulosin for BPH/LUTS, including efficacy, safety, special populations, and practical prescribing guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinctions and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify comparative efficacy from high-quality evidence. Next, I will examine safety profiles, including cardiovascular and sexual adverse effects. After that, I need to consider special scenarios like hypertension, cataract surgery, and combination therapy. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and state a bottom-line recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic differences because they drive clinical trade-offs. Doxazosin is a non-subtype-selective alpha-1 antagonist that blocks alpha-1A, alpha-1B, and alpha-1D receptors, which provides BPH symptom relief but also vasodilation and blood pressure effects, whereas tamsulosin is alpha-1A–selective with about a 10:1 preference for alpha-1A over alpha-1B, theoretically reducing vascular effects while maintaining prostatic smooth muscle relaxation [^1054f296] [^19f30e36].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical implication of that selectivity. The AUA guideline explicitly notes that tamsulosin and silodosin have lower potential for orthostatic hypotension and syncope than terazosin or doxazosin, aligning with the concept that alpha-1A selectivity reduces vascular alpha-1B blockade and first-dose hypotension risk, though tamsulosin still carries a hypotension warning and can cause dizziness, particularly early in therapy or on re-initiation [^1054f296] [^1063d0ab].

> Next, I should review efficacy, and I need to ensure I don't overstate differences. High-quality guidance concludes that all approved alpha-1 blockers, including doxazosin and tamsulosin, have broadly similar efficacy for IPSS improvement, typically in the 5–8 point range versus 2–4 points with placebo, with no consistent superiority of one agent over another in head-to-head comparisons, so efficacy should not be the deciding factor in most cases [^58f1071f] [^e11d7c57].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety without separating signal by outcome. For cardiovascular effects, doxazosin has a higher risk of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, especially at initiation and with dose titration, and is associated with falls and fractures in observational data, whereas tamsulosin has a more favorable hemodynamic profile but still shows a transient increase in severe hypotension requiring hospitalization in the first 8 weeks of use and after restarts, with a persistent smaller risk during maintenance therapy, so counseling on posture and timing remains important for both [^1054f296] [^1063d0ab] [^7fab1889].

> I should double-check sexual adverse effects because patients often ask about this. Tamsulosin is associated with a higher risk of ejaculatory dysfunction than placebo and compared with some other alpha blockers, with meta-analytic data showing roughly a 7–10% incidence and substantially higher odds versus placebo, whereas doxazosin has a lower risk of ejaculatory dysfunction, closer to placebo in some analyses, which can matter for sexually active men prioritizing ejaculatory function [^83a11981] [^b1d54f40] [^12f41e8a].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with hypertension. Doxazosin can be advantageous when the patient also needs blood pressure control, as it is approved for hypertension and can reduce BP in hypertensive men with BPH, but in normotensive patients it may still cause modest BP reductions and orthostatic symptoms, so I need to check baseline BP, co-medications, and fall risk before choosing it [^1054f296] [^2aa11d93] [^824a7787].

> I need to ensure I address cataract surgery. Both agents can cause intraoperative floppy iris syndrome, but the AUA advises discussing this risk preoperatively and coordinating with ophthalmology; tamsulosin's alpha-1A selectivity does not eliminate this risk, so surgical planning should proceed assuming potential IFIS regardless of the alpha blocker chosen [^e11d7c57].

> Next, I should review combination therapy and disease modification. Doxazosin provides symptom relief but does not reduce long-term risks of acute urinary retention or surgery, whereas 5-alpha reductase inhibitors do; in MTOPS, combination therapy with doxazosin plus finasteride reduced overall clinical progression more than either monotherapy, and finasteride-containing arms reduced AUR and invasive therapy, so in men with larger prostates or higher PSA, adding a 5-ARI to an alpha blocker is reasonable if symptoms persist or progression risk is high [^35950ef9] [^3716e1b3] [^0744183f].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a PDE5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction. I should confirm hemodynamic interactions. Tadalafil augments the hypotensive effect of doxazosin with clinically meaningful standing BP drops, whereas tamsulosin 0.4 mg has minimal interaction with tadalafil, making tamsulosin the safer alpha blocker when PDE5 inhibitors are coadministered, though patients should still be counseled on orthostatic symptoms [^e1cd4d83] [^6005b5b1].

> I will now examine practical prescribing details to avoid pitfalls. Doxazosin requires dose titration from 1 mg to a typical 4–8 mg maintenance dose to mitigate first-dose hypotension, whereas tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily is effective without titration and can be started at full dose in most patients, which simplifies initiation and may improve adherence, though I should still advise taking it consistently and watching for dizziness early on [^62aa4d4f] [^56a40b4b].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework, and I should confirm it aligns with guidelines. Choose tamsulosin as first-line for most men with bothersome moderate-to-severe LUTS/BPH, particularly if they are normotensive, have fall risk, are on PDE5 inhibitors, or prioritize ejaculatory function, and choose doxazosin when the patient also needs antihypertensive therapy, has no significant orthostatic risk, and accepts titration and monitoring, recognizing that both are acceptable first-line options per AUA and that efficacy differences are small [^e11d7c57] [^58f1071f] [^1054f296].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line and make sure I'm not overstating. For most patients, tamsulosin offers comparable symptom relief with less orthostatic hypotension and a simpler dosing regimen, while doxazosin is a reasonable alternative when blood pressure control is desired and the patient can tolerate titration and monitoring; in men with larger prostates or higher progression risk, consider adding a 5-ARI to either alpha blocker to reduce long-term complications, and always counsel on cataract surgery considerations and potential sexual adverse effects before deciding [^e11d7c57] [^35950ef9] [^1054f296].

Doxazosin and tamsulosin are both effective alpha-1 blockers for BPH/LUTS [^58f1071f], but they differ in **selectivity and side effects**. Tamsulosin is **alpha-1A selective** [^1054f296], causing less orthostatic hypotension and requiring no dose titration [^56a40b4b], but it has a higher risk of ejaculatory dysfunction [^83a11981]. Doxazosin is **non-selective** [^1054f296], lowering blood pressure and often requiring titration [^62aa4d4f]; it is useful for patients with coexisting hypertension but increases risks of dizziness, syncope, and falls, especially early in therapy [^7fab1889]. Both improve symptoms and flow [^58f1071f], so choose tamsulosin for most patients and doxazosin when blood pressure control is needed or tamsulosin is not tolerated.

| **Feature** | **Doxazosin** | **Tamsulosin** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Non-selective α1-blocker (α1A, α1B, α1D) | α1A-selective blocker |
| Blood pressure effect | Significant; can cause orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, syncope [^1054f296] | Minimal; less orthostatic hypotension [^1054f296] |
| Dose titration | Required (start 1 mg, titrate to 2–8 mg) [^62aa4d4f] | Not required (0.4 mg daily) [^56a40b4b] |
| Ejaculatory dysfunction | Lower risk [^83a11981] | Higher risk (≈10%) [^12f41e8a] |
| Clinical use | Useful with coexisting hypertension | First-line for most BPH patients |
| Safety concerns | Higher risk of falls, fractures, and cardiovascular events [^7fab1889] [^67ba693b] | Lower risk of falls and cardiovascular events [^notfound] |

---

Both drugs improve IPSS and Qmax [^58f1071f]; **select based on comorbidities, fall risk, and patient preferences** [^e11d7c57].

### Tamsulosin: current clinical experience [^56a40b4b]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

During the past decade, our understanding of the epidemiology and natural history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has improved considerably. Population-based studies confirm that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are very common among aging men. These studies have confirmed that men with moderate-to-severe symptoms have 4 to 6 times more trouble and interference with activities of daily living and twice the level of worry as those with mild symptoms. The realization by patients and their physicians that most men > 50 years of age will develop LUTS, has resulted in increased awareness of pharmacologic agents, principally alpha-adrenergic antagonists, as a first line of therapy for this condition. Alpha blockers were introduced > 30 years ago to treat LUTS and today are the mainstay in pharmacologic therapy. Among the alpha blockers, tamsulosin more selectively targets the alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptor subtype and is as effective as conventional alpha(1) blockers in treating LUTS caused by BPH. Its subselectivity and pharmacodynamic properties may provide advantages in safety, tolerability, and administration compared with other alpha blockers, such as terazosin and doxazosin. Unlike other alpha blockers, tamsulosin does not require titration to be efficacious. Because of its rapid onset of action and lack of clinically significant effect on blood pressure in normotensive and hypertensive patients, a therapeutic dose is delivered at the onset of treatment. Studies have documented that tamsulosin produces rapid improvements in LUTS and peak urinary flow rates, and these responses have been found to be durable.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^58f1071f]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical therapy — alpha blockers for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) — Clinicians should offer one of the following alpha blockers as a treatment option for patients with bothersome, moderate to severe LUTS/BPH: alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, or terazosin. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) Multiple phase III RCTs, Phase IV studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses have demonstrated the efficacy of alpha blockers for the treatment of LUTS and BPH, and there is nearly universal agreement that they are all relatively equally effective in terms of IPSS improvement, with an expected range of improvement of 5–8 points, compared to an expected effect of placebo from 2–4 points, with data demonstrating equal efficacy across all alpha blockers and no particular subset more or less suited for such treatment.

### Finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7a312167]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a non-malignant enlargement of the prostate in aging men, can cause bothersome urinary symptoms (intermittency, weak stream, straining, urgency, frequency, incomplete emptying). Finasteride, a five-alpha reductase inhibitor (5ARI), blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, reduces prostate size, and is commonly used to treat symptoms associated with BPH.

Objectives

To compare the clinical effectiveness and harms of finasteride versus placebo and active controls in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library (which includes CDSR (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects), HTA (Heath Technology Assessments), and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and which includes EMBASE and MEDLINE), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information) and Google Scholar for randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). We also handsearched systematic reviews, references, and clinical-practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials in the English language with placebo and/or active arms with a duration of at least 6 months.

Data Collection and Analysis

JT extracted the data, which included patient characteristics, outcomes, and harms. Our primary outcome was change in a validated, urinary symptom-scale score, such as the AUA/IPSS. A clinically meaningful change was defined as 4 points. We also categorized outcomes by trial lengths of ≤ 1 year (short term) and > 1 year (long term).

Main Results

Finasteride consistently improved urinary symptom scores more than placebo in trials of > 1 year duration, and significantly lowered the risk of BPH progression (acute urinary retention, risk of surgical intervention, ≥ 4 point increase in the AUASI/IPSS). In comparison to alpha-blocker monotherapy, finasteride was less effective than either doxazosin or terazosin, but equally effective compared to tamsulosin. Both doxazosin and terazosin were significantly more likely than finasteride to improve peak urine flow and nocturia, versus finasteride. Versus tamsulosin, peak urine flow and QoL improved equally well versus finasteride. However, finasteride was associated with a lower risk of surgical intervention compared to doxazosin, but not to terazosin, while finasteride and doxazosin were no different for risk of acute urinary retention. Two small trials reported no difference in urinary symptom scores between finasteride and tamsulosin. Finasteride + doxazosin and doxazosin monotherapy improved urinary symptoms equally well (≥ 4 point improvement). For finasteride, there was an increased risk of ejaculation disorder, impotence, and lowered libido, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, finasteride had a lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension, and versus terazosin, finasteride had a significant, lower risk of asthenia, dizziness, and postural hypotension.

Authors' Conclusions

Finasteride improves long-term urinary symptoms versus placebo, but is less effective than doxazosin. Long-term combination therapy with alpha blockers (doxazosin, terazosin) improves symptoms significantly better than finasteride monotherapy. Finasteride + doxazosin improves symptoms equally - and clinically - to doxazosin alone. In comparison to doxazosin, finasteride + doxazosin appears to improve urinary symptoms only in men with medium (25 to < 40 mL) or large prostates (≥ 40 mL), but not in men with small prostates (25 mL). Comparing short to long-term therapy, finasteride does not improve symptoms significantly better than placebo at the short term, but in the long term it does, although the magnitude of differences was very small (from < 1.0 point to 2.2 points). Doxazosin improves symptoms better than finasteride both short and long term, with the magnitude of differences ∼2.0 points and 1.0 point, respectively. Finasteride + doxazosin improves scores versus finasteride alone at both short and long term, with mean differences ∼2.0 points for both time points. Finasteride + doxazosin versus doxazosin improves scores equally for short and long term. Drug-related adverse effects for finasteride are rare; nevertheless, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder, versus placebo. Versus doxazosin, which has higher rates of dizziness, postural hypotension, and asthenia, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder. Finasteride significantly reduces asthenia, postural hypotension, and dizziness versus terazosin. Finasteride significantly lowers the risk of asthenia, dizziness, ejaculation disorder, and postural hypotension, versus finasteride + terazosin.

### A review of combination therapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^64b3d0e6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Trials of monotherapy with alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha(1)ARAs) and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) have found that the former drug class is effective in managing benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improving the maximal urinary flow rate in shortand long-term treatment, regardless of prostate size, whereas the latter drug class is effective in reducing prostate size and preventing disease progression in longer-term treatment. The differing mechanisms of action and areas of efficacy of these 2 drug classes make them promising candidates for combination therapy.

Objective

This article reviews key trials of monotherapy and combination alpha(1)ARV5ARI therapy in the treatment and prevention of BPH-related voiding dysfunction.

Methods

MEDLINE (1976–2006) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1976–2006) were searched for relevant clinical trials and reviews using the terms benign prostatic byperplasia, lower urinary tract symptoms, LUTS, alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonists, alpha-blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, combination therapy, MTOPS, SMART, PREDICT, adverse events, alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin, dutasteride, and finasteride. Abstracts from selected professional conferences also were reviewed.

Results

Three previous trials of alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy found no therapeutic benefit for combination therapy relative to monotherapy, but their conclusions were limited to some extent by their designs, particularly the duration of treatment. Data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, however, indicated a potential role for long-term use of alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy, particularly in patients with greater symptom severity (mean score of 17 on the American Urological Association symptom index), larger prostate volume (mean, 32 g), and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (> 1.5 ng/mL) at baseline. In the MTOPS study, combination therapy with the alpha(1)ARA doxazosin and the SARI finasteride was significantly more effective than either component alone in reducing BPH-related symptoms (P = 0.006 vs doxazosin monotherapy; P < 0.001 vs finasteride monotherapy) and lowering the rate of overall clinical progression (P < 0.001 vs either monotherapy). In addition, there are data from a subgroup analysis of MTOPS suggesting that the presence of prostatic inflammation may indicate a greater likelihood of treatment efficacy with combination alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy.

Conclusions

The available data suggest that combination alpha(1)ARA/5ARI therapy is beneficial in the treatment of BPH and the associated symptoms. The greatest efficacy was evident in patients with an enlarged prostate, more severe symptoms, and higher PSA levels. There are limited data suggesting that the presence of prostatic inflammation may indicate a greater likelihood of treatment efficacy with combination therapy.

### Α-blockers, 5-α-reductase inhibitors, acetylcholine, β 3 agonists, and phosphodiesterase-5s in medical management of lower urinary tract symptoms / benign prostatic hyperplasia: how much Do the different formulations actually matter in the classes? [^13b2b6e5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Many monotherapies are currently available to clinically treat and alleviate symptoms of lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia: α-blockers, 5ARIs, PDE5Is, β-3-andrenoceptor agonists, and anticholinergic agents. Current studies have evaluated the effective of these treatments in comparison to other groups or in combination therapies. The current review evaluates the effectiveness of class formulations. Based on the findings, α-blockers, specifically doxazosin and terazosin, were most effective in reducing IPSS scores and peak urinary flow rate, while being most cost-effective. However, further clinical investigations are required to evaluate the clinical implications of different formulations.

### Α-blockers for benign prostatic hyperplasia: the new era [^6dacc8a9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

α1-Adrenoceptor blockers are the most frequently prescribed medical therapy in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptom suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH). The purpose of this review is to highlight the evolution of adrenoceptor blockers with emphasis on newly approved drugs.

Recent Findings

Over the past years new formulations of several α1-adrenoceptor blockers were introduced to the market. Five long-acting α1-blockers are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of symptomatic LUTS/BPH: terazosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, alfuzosin and silodosin. Silodosin is the only adrenoceptor blocker that exhibits true selectivity for the α1-adrenoceptor subtypes. This unique adrenoceptor selectivity profile likely accounts for the very favorable cardiovascular safety profile.

Summary

Tamsulosin, alfuzosin slow release and silodosin do not require dose titration. Alfuzosin, terazosin, doxazosin and silodosin have all been shown to be effective in relieving LUTS/BPH independent of prostate size. Low incidence of orthostatic hypotension has been reported for silodosin, but abnormal ejaculation is the most commonly reported adverse effect.

### Tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^24e6eced]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4,122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4–26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49, -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3, -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59, 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65, 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg-0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

### Effect of doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system 4 mg vs tamsulosin 0.2 mg on nocturia in Chinese men with lower urinary tract symptoms: a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open, parallel study [^5a38c35f]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of the doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (doxazosin-GITS) 4 mg and tamsulosin 0.2 mg on nocturia in Chinese men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Methods

Data were analyzed from a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open, parallel study of Chinese men aged 50–84 years with LUTS/BPH. Two hundred patients were randomized to receive daily treatment with 4 mg doxazosin-GITS (n = 100) or 0.2 mg tamsulosin (n = 100) for 8 weeks. Nocturia was assessed by question 7 of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS-question 7) and a frequency-volume chart (FVC) at weeks 4 and 8. Self-reported quality of sleep and quality of life by the last question of the IPSS questionnaire were also evaluated.

Results

A total of 189 patients (94 receiving doxazosin-GITS, 95 tamsulosin) completed the study. The reduction from baseline in mean nocturia was greater with doxazosin-GITS than tamsulosin by the FVC (1.7 vs 1.3 at week 4; 2.1 vs 1.7 at week 8, both P = 0.001) and by the IPSS-question 7 (1.5 vs 1.1 at 4 weeks, P = 0.001; 2.0 vs 1.6 at 8 weeks, P < .001). The patients who reported improved quality of sleep was significantly more with doxazosin-GITS than tamsulosin (43.6% vs 27.4% at 4 weeks, P = 0.020; 81.9% vs 67.4% at 8 weeks, P = 0.022), and quality of life was better with doxazosin-GITS (2.5 vs 2.8 at 4 weeks, P = 0.001; 2.1 vs 2.5 at 8 weeks, P < .001).

Conclusion

In Chinese patients with LUTS/BPH, doxazosin-GITS is slightly better than tamsulosin in reducing the frequency of nocturia.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^e11d7c57]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Medical therapy — alpha blockers: Clinicians should offer one of the following alpha blockers as a treatment option for patients with bothersome, moderate to severe LUTS/BPH: alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, or terazosin. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) When prescribing an alpha blocker for the treatment of LUTS/BPH, the choice of alpha blocker should be based on patient age and comorbidities, and different adverse event profiles (e.g., ejaculatory dysfunction [EjD], changes in blood pressure). (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A) When initiating alpha blocker therapy, patients with planned cataract surgery should be informed of the associated risks and be advised to discuss these risks with their ophthalmologists.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^6005b5b1]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) alpha blocker–PDE5 coadministration — The hypotensive effects of terazosin and doxazosin can be potentiated by concomitant use of a PDE5, such as sildenafil or vardenafil; tamsulosin at a dose of 0.4 mg/day, however, does not appear to significantly potentiate the hypotensive effects of sildenafil, and patients utilizing both these medications should be counselled appropriately regarding the risk for drops in blood pressure and symptoms associated with this.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) alpha-1 blockers — Given the similar efficacy of the approved alpha-1-adrenergic antagonists, the choice of specific agent should consider the differing adverse events profiles of each. The quinazolin derivatives, terazosin and doxazosin, are non-specific alpha-1 receptor blockers that are both approved for the treatment of hypertension, as well as BPH, while tamsulosin, alfuzosin, and silodosin have lower potential to cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope than either terazosin or doxazosin; tamsulosin may further have slightly less effect on blood pressure than alfuzosin, and the only two alpha blockers with selectivity for the alpha 1a versus the alpha 1b receptor are tamsulosin (10:1) and silodosin (161:1).

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^1063d0ab]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We observed an increased rate ratio for severe hypotension requiring admission to hospital with tamsulosin treatment. The greatest increase in risk — varying in magnitude from 151% to 256% — was observed during the first eight weeks of new drug use and the first eight weeks after restarting drug treatment. A smaller increase in risk for hypotension, varying from 19% to 36%, persisted during maintenance tamsulosin treatment.

Antagonism of α1 adrenoreceptors by tamsulosin relaxes the smooth muscles in the bladder neck and prostate to improve urine flow rate and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although hypertension is not an approved indication for tamsulosin, α blockers are also known to decrease systemic vascular resistance and reduce blood pressure. Clinical trials observed a 12% incidence for orthostatic hypotension among patients taking 0.4 mg tamsulosin, and a 6% incidence among patients taking placebo between four to eight hours after dosing; however, no treatment emergent hypotensive events were observed. In these trials, patients were retained at the treating site for eight hours after the first dose and received counseling on the effects of orthostatic hypotension. This environment may not apply to treatment practice in the real world. Three currently approved selective α1 adrenergicantagonists (doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) have black boxed warnings for severe hypotension and syncope, particularly at the first dose. Tamsulosin has a warning for hypotension, but without a black box or information on a potential first dose phenomenon. Our data add to the current literature to better define and quantify the first dose phenomenon of tamsulosin on risk for hypotension.

### A broader role for 5ARIs in prostate disease? Existing evidence and emerging benefits [^1324e278]. The Prostate (2009). Low credibility.

5ARIs are recommended for men who have moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and benign prostatic enlargement (BPE) secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Studies have confirmed the utility of combining 5ARIs with alpha-blockers; the MTOPS study showed that risk of overall clinical progression was significantly reduced after 4.5 years with combination therapy (finasteride/doxazosin) in comparison with either monotherapy, while the ongoing CombAT trial (dutasteride/tamsulosin) has for the first time shown benefit in improving symptoms for combination therapy over monotherapies within 12 months of treatment. Data also suggest roles for 5ARIs in prostate cancer. Several studies indicate that treatment with a 5ARI improves the performance of PSA testing for identifying men with prostate cancer, while the PCPT showed a significant reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer with finasteride. However, widespread use of finasteride in this setting has been tempered by an apparent increase in high-grade disease observed in the study. The ongoing REDUCE study will provide further insight into prostate cancer prevention with 5ARIs. 5ARI-containing regimens may have utility as less aggressive treatment options for patients who only have rising PSA after definitive local therapy, and in patients with disease resistant to androgen deprivation therapy who have PSA progression. Current evidence therefore shows that 5ARIs are effective in treating LUTS/BPE and preventing disease progression, and may also have a role in the prevention of prostate cancer. The overlap between BPE and prostate cancer may allow a more unified approach to managing these conditions, with 5ARIs having a central role.

### WITHDRAWN: tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^17e8ae24]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a nonmalignant enlargement of the prostate which can result in bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms. The treatment goal for men with BPH is to relieve these bothersome symptoms.

Objectives

This systematic review assessed the effects of tamsulosin in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) compatible with BPH.

Search Strategy

Trials were searched in computerized general and specialized databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library), by checking bibliographies, and by contacting manufacturers and researchers.

Selection Criteria

Trials were eligible if they (1) randomized men with BPH to receive tamsulosin in comparison with placebo, other BPH medications or surgical interventions and (2) included clinical outcomes such as urologic symptom scales, symptoms, or urodynamic measurements, and (3) had a treatment duration of 30 days or longer. Eligibility was assessed by at least two independent observers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Information on patients, interventions, and outcomes were extracted by at least two independent reviewers using a standard form. The main outcome measure for comparing the effectiveness of tamsulosin with placebo, medical or surgical interventions was the change in urologic symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes in urinary flow measures (peak urine flow rate). The main outcome measure for adverse effects was the number of men reporting adverse effects.

Main Results

Fourteen studies involving 4122 subjects met inclusion criteria. Study duration ranged from 4 to 26 weeks, and no placebo-controlled study lasted longer than 13 weeks. The mean age of subjects was 64 years. Baseline symptom scores and urine flow rates demonstrated that men had moderate LUTS. Tamsulosin improved symptoms and peak urine flow relative to placebo. The weighted mean differences (WMD) for mean change from baseline for the Boyarsky symptom score for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg doses of tamsulosin relative to placebo were -1.1 points (95% CI = -1.49 to -0.72; 12% improvement) and -1.6 points (95% CI = -2.3 to -1.0; 16% improvement), respectively. The WMD for mean change from baseline in peak urine flow were 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.59 to 1.51) and 1.1 mL/sec (95% CI = 0.65 to 1.48) for 0.4 mg and 0.8 mg, respectively. Tamsulosin (0.2 mg to 0.4 mg) was as effective as other alpha antagonists and the phytotherapeutic agent Permixon® in improving symptoms and flow rates though the doses of all alpha-antagonists studied may not have been optimal. Discontinuations from treatment for any reason and discontinuations "due to adverse events" were similar in the low dose tamsulosin (0.2 mg) and placebo groups but increased to 16% in trials utilizing a 0.8 mg dose of tamsulosin. Low dose tamsulosin was generally well tolerated although not all the trials reported specific adverse events. The most frequently reported adverse events that were significantly greater than placebo included dizziness, rhinitis and abnormal ejaculation. Adverse effects increased markedly as tamsulosin dosing increased, and were reported in 75% of men receiving the 0.8 mg dose. Men receiving a 0.2 mg dose tamsulosin were less likely to discontinue treatment compared to men receiving terazosin.

Authors' Conclusions

Tamsulosin provided a small to moderate improvement in urinary symptoms and flow compared to men receiving placebo in men with BPH. Effectiveness was similar to other alpha antagonists and increased only slightly with higher doses. Long term effectiveness and ability to reduce complications due to BPH progression could not be determined. Adverse effects were generally mild but their frequency, including withdrawals, increased substantially with the higher doses that are generally available for treatment.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^b961a2d2]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an enlargement of the transition zone of the prostate that can cause lower urinary tract symptoms and could lead to bladder outlet obstruction in men. Lower urinary tract symptoms can include urinary frequency, urgency, hesitancy, or nocturia, and can result in a marked decrease in quality of life. It has been estimated that 50% of men in the United States over the age of 50 have this condition.

First line medical treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia consists of α1 adrenergic receptor antagonists (α blockers) and 5α reductase inhibitors (5ARI). α blockers relieve bladder outlet obstruction by relaxing the periurethral prostatic smooth muscle and allowing for improved urinary flow. 5ARIs have shown to reduce disease progression, prevent complications from benign prostatic hyperplasia (including acute urinary retention and prostate related surgery), and improve lower urinary tract symptoms starting after six months of treatment. Although effective, when initiated, α blockers can induce marked orthostatic hypotension and syncope. This effect was labeled the "first dose phenomenon" by Bendall and colleagues in men using prazosin in 1975, and subsequently has been reported in antagonists to the α1 adrenergic receptor, terazosin and doxazosin. This effect is a consequence of inadvertent vasodilation and a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. A recent study found an increased risk of hip fracture among men taking α blockers but not 5ARIs, suggesting that it may have resulted from an increased risk of hypotension induced falls. Tamsulosin is a uroselective α blocker owing to its selectivity as an α1a receptor antagonist, which is the predominant receptor that mediates prostate smooth muscle tension. Compared to non-selective α1 blockers such as terazosin and doxazosin, tamsulosin has a lower rate of asthenia, dizziness, and severe hypotension in clinical trials. As a result, it has a warning for hypotension and syncope, but not a black box warning similar to less selective α blockers in its class.

It is unknown whether tamsulosin treatment induces a first dose phenomenon in clinical practice and confers increased risk for hypotension, requiring admission to hospital immediately after initiating or restarting drug treatment. Our study aimed to characterize the risk of severe hypotension at time varying intervals during the course of tamsulosin treatment in middle aged and older men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^83a11981]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Alpha blockers and ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD) — EjD was significantly more prevalent with tamsulosin (OR: 8.57; P = 0.006) or silodosin (OR: 32.5; P < 0.0001) than placebo, whereas doxazosin (OR: 0.80; P = 0.14) and terazosin (OR: 1.78; P = 0.71) were associated with a low risk of EjD, similar to placebo. Data for about 1,400 patients from 4 RCTs compared silodosin and tamsulosin, and tamsulosin was associated with a significantly lower risk of EjD than silodosin (OR: 0.09; P < 0.00001). These findings are in line with the alpha 1 selectivity over the alpha 1b receptor of tamsulosin (10:1) and silodosin (161:1).

### Unresolved priapism secondary to tamsulosin [^a974e0ce]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2004). Low credibility.

Tamsulosin is the most potent adrenergic alpha-1 antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Priapism has been reported rarely in patients taking Prazosin, Doxazosin and Terazosin. We describe an otherwise healthy man with recurrent and then persistent unresolved priapism after the use of tamsulosin. Initial treatment consisted of aspiration and intracavernosal irrigation of iced saline and vasoconstrictive agent, but in vain. We then performed Winters procedure but that too failed and the priapism persisted. Health-care professionals should inform all patients taking such medications about rare but possible serious adverse effects.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^995aa5cf]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A study in the US Food and Drug Administration's adverse events reporting system used data mining strategies of spontaneous reports to assess potential safety signals with α adrenergic antagonists. Concern for dizziness or vertigo and orthostatic hypotension were raised for tamsulosin in addition to alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin. A recent Cochrane review also found higher rates of dizziness with larger tamsulosin dosages (0.8 mg, 17% dizziness; 0.4 mg, 9%; 0.2 mg, 3%), suggesting a dose dependent effect.

In a prospective cohort study of 5872 participants, Parsons and colleagues found a significantly increased risk of falls at one year in community dwelling men aged 65 years and older with moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms, based on the validated American Urological Association symptom index. But they did not find any difference when stratifying patients on the basis of use of urological drug treatments. However, all urological drugs were grouped together in the analysis (α blockers, 5ARIs, anticholinergics), and more importantly, drug use was only collected at baseline — therefore, a first dose phenomenon could not be assessed. The population based case-control study by Jacobsen and colleagues found an increased risk of hip fractures among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia taking α blockers but not 5ARIs. Notably, this risk was only observed in men initiating treatment with an α blocker within 30 days (odds ratio 2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 3.49). Our study suggests that this increased risk of hip fractures with α blockers use could be secondary to falls as a result of severe hypotensive events at initiation.

### Interaction between the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil and 2 α-blockers, doxazosin and tamsulosin in healthy normotensive men [^e1cd4d83]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

Tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor, is effective therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED). Men with ED have a high incidence of comorbid conditions including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors are safe when administered with most medications, sildenafil given with doxazosin and vardenafil given with terazosin evoke orthostatic hypotension in some patients. We examined the hemodynamic interactions of tadalafil with the alpha-blockers doxazosin and tamsulosin.

Materials and Methods

In separate double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized crossover studies (18 patients in each study) we evaluated the hemodynamic effects of doxazosin 8 mg with tadalafil 20 mg, and tamsulosin 0.4 mg with tadalafil 10 and 20 mg. Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate were recorded before dosing and for 24 hours after dosing.

Results

Tadalafil 20 mg augmented the hypotensive effect of doxazosin by producing a mean maximal decrease in standing systolic BP (SBP) that was significantly greater than placebo (a mean difference of 9.8 mm Hg). Analysis of BP outliers showed that the number of subjects with a standing SBP of less than 85 mm Hg was greater after doxazosin plus tadalafil (28%) versus doxazosin plus placebo (6%). In subjects on tamsulosin, tadalafil 10 and 20 mg produced mean maximal decreases in standing SBP that were similar to placebo (mean difference of 1.7 and 2.3 mm Hg, respectively). No subject taking tamsulosin had a decrease in standing SBP less than 85 mm Hg.

Conclusions

Tadalafil augmented the hypotensive effects of doxazosin but had little hemodynamic interaction with tamsulosin. In patients taking tadalafil for ED, tamsulosin 0.4 mg may be given for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Long-term, open-label, phase III multicenter study of tamsulosin in benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1766dea0]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of tamsulosin in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and to monitor the increases and decreases in therapeutic response over time. Tamsulosin, a uroselective alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia, targets alpha(1A)-adrenergic receptors of prostatic smooth muscle with greater affinity than the vascular alpha(1B) receptors. Since the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype mediates prostatic smooth muscle tension, alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonists may diminish toxicity, with few unwanted effects on blood pressure, while still providing efficacious treatment.

Methods

This study extended two 13-week trials and one 40-week extension trial for an additional 64 weeks. On study entry, all patients (n = 949) received 0.4 mg/day tamsulosin. Baseline values were taken from either those of the previous trials for patients who had been treated with tamsulosin or the first visit of this study for patients not previously exposed to the drug. The primary efficacy parameters were the changes in the total American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score, mean peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), and percentage of patients having 25% or greater improvement in the total AUA symptom score and 30% or more improvement in the Qmax. Safety was assessed primarily on the incidence and severity of adverse events and discontinuations due to adverse events.

Results

Improvements from baseline were seen in all primary efficacy parameters and were maintained throughout the study. The changes from baseline for the total AUA symptom score and Qmax were statistically significant (P < 0.001) at all 3-month intervals. Tamsulosin was well tolerated, and the incidence of adverse events did not increase over time. The mean sitting vital signs did not vary from baseline or relative to the treatment duration.

Conclusions

Tamsulosin was safe and effective in long-term treatment (longer than 1 year) of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in benign prostatic hyperplasia and its impact on sexual function [^12f41e8a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disorder in older men and may be associated with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and sexual dysfunction. Men who present with symptomatic BPH and LUTS are at increased risk for sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction (ED) and ejaculatory dysfunction (EjD).

Objective

This review describes treatment options recommended by the 2003 American Urological Association (AUA) guideline panel for the relief of LUTS associated with BPH, with a focus on the effects of each treatment on ED and EjD.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified via MEDLINE searches of all English-language articles published from January 1984 to January 2005 using the following search terms: benign prostatic hyperplasia and sexual dysfunction, lower urinary tract symptoms and sexual dysfunction, alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, dutasteride, finasteride, transurethral resection of prostate, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory dysfunction. Data on the effects of BPH treatments on sexual function were extracted from the articles and summarized. Because properly designed, adequately powered, direct-comparator studies have not yet been conducted, the AUA's report provides the most comprehensive analyses regarding the efficacy and safety of the current BPH treatment options.

Results

LUTS are an independent risk factor for sexual dysfunction in aging men, even after controlling for age and comorbidities. Although surgery, minimally invasive therapies, and pharmacologic therapies can all improve LUTS and the peak urinary flow rate, some can cause or exacerbate ED (incidence rates: surgery, 10%; minimally invasive therapies, 1%-3%; pharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy, 3%-10%) and EjD (incidence rates: surgery, 65%; minimally invasive therapies, 4%-16%; pharmacologic monotherapy or combination therapy, 0%-10%). Among pharmacologic therapies for BPH, the frequency of EjD appears to be greater with tamsulosin (10%) than with other alpha(1)-blockers (0%-1%) or the 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride (4%), based on data from a single-arm meta-analysis conducted by the AUA.

Conclusion

Sexual function should be assessed and discussed with the patient when contemplating the appropriate management strategy for LUTS associated with BPH, as well as when evaluating the patient's response to treatment.

### Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^7977cea9]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

In this article, we review the primary medical treatments of BPH-associated male LUTS, with a focus on physiology, indications, and side effects. We cover selective alpha-1 antagonists, anticholinergics, PDE5 inhibitors, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, and beta-3 agonists. Through a review of the literature, we provide our clinical pathway for the medical management of BPH, generally starting with tamsulosin in most men and progressing to combination therapy based on patient's response and symptoms.

### Apoptotic impact of alpha1-blockers on prostate cancer growth: a myth or an inviting reality? [^b0db08bd]. The Prostate (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Pharmacological manipulation or genetic targeting of the major apoptosis regulators, such as bcl-2, caspases, and inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), represent clinically attractive avenues towards effective therapeutic strategies for advanced prostate cancer. A wealth of evidence established the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists to be clinically effective in relieving the symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) by relaxing prostatic smooth muscle tone. This action alone however does not fully account for the long-term clinical response to these drugs in BPH patients.

Methods

Experimental and retrospective clinical studies provided new evidence supporting a differential growth-suppressing function of two alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists against prostate cancer, independent of an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor mechanism.

Results

The quinazoline-based antagonists, doxazosin and terazosin, induce apoptosis, inhibit cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (by activating anoikis), and prevent cell invasion and migration of prostate tumor epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. Tamsulosin, a sulphonamide-based, clinically effective alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist for BPH treatment, fails to exert a similar apoptotic action against prostate cells. Furthermore, at pharmacologically relevant doses, doxazosin suppresses benign and malignant prostate growth in in vivo experimental models. The effect is characterized by three intriguing features: (a) it is mediated by an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-independent action, (possibly related to the quinazoline nucleus); (b) it is targeted at the apoptotic process without affecting cell proliferation; and (c) the elevated apoptotic index correlated with symptom score improvement in BPH patients.

Conclusions

This evidence challenges conventional knowledge of the mechanism of action of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, and points to a new therapeutic value for these drugs by providing a differential molecular basis for their anti-tumor efficacy. The present review focuses on the characterization of the apoptotic/anti-angiogenic effect of quinazoline-based alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists against prostate cancer cells and discusses the clinical significance of this action in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

### Dutasteride and flex dose of tamsulosin on as needed basis, to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia… [^6907a6d4]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with Dutasteride, administered once daily for one year in combination with Tamsulosin, administered once daily for 3 months, followed by counseling on flexible dosing of Tamsulosin on an as needed basis, on the improvement of symptoms and clinical outcome in men with moderate to severe symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. At each scheduled visit, the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin.

A recently published, landmark study, co-sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, demonstrated that, in selected patients, combination therapy with Doxazosin and Finasteride provided additive symptomatic improvements, reduced the risk of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention, and was a more effective treatment for reduction in the overall risk of BPH clinical progression. The aim of this proposed combination study, in a population of patients at high risk of BPH clinical progression, is to investigate whether combination therapy with Dutasteride and Tamsulosin with the subsequent withdrawal of Tamsulosin can maintain superior symptom improvement. At each scheduled visit, the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin.

We hypothesize that patients may start with a combination of Dutasteride and Tamsulosin and eventually may be able to eliminate the use of Tamsulosin and maintain acceptable urinary symptoms on Dutasteride alone.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^e0d2a3a6]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist.

Search strategy

WE searched MEDLINE (1992 to Jul 2018), EMBASE (1995 to Jul 2018) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register to collect studies investigating the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride versus tamsulosin alone in treating BPH. The search formula was as follows: "tamsulosin, dutasteride, BPH and RCT". All articles were browsed and read independently by two authors, and if there was any objections, it was referred to the third person for examination. The study was limited to published research with no restrictions on language. If the study was a review or summary presented at the meeting, it would be excluded. Authors were contacted to offer further information from their research if necessary. Furthermore, the search was also performed to investigate relevant references from the retrieved studies.

Inclusion criteria and trial selection

RCTs that met the following criteria were included: (1) The combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride versus tamsulosin alone in treating BPH were evaluated; (2) Full-text content and related data can be obtained; (3) The study provided accurate data that could be analyzed, mainly including the total number of subjects and the valuable results of each indicator; (4) The article was a randomized controlled study; (5) Treatment duration is greater than or equal to 1 year. If the identical experiment was published in different journals or at different time, the latest study was included in the meta-analysis. If the same group of researchers studied a group of subjects with multiple experiments, then each study was included. The PRISMA flow diagram of study selection and elimination is shown in Fig. 1.

### Efficacy and tolerability of doxazosin and finasteride, alone or in combination, in treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: the prospective European doxazosin and combination therapy (PREDICT) trial [^971fcb6f]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the selective alpha(1)-adrenergic antagonist doxazosin and the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride, alone and in combination, for the symptomatic treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Methods

In a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 1095 men aged 50 to 80 years were randomized to treatment for 52 weeks with doxazosin, finasteride, the combination of doxazosin and finasteride, or placebo. The dose of finasteride (or its matched placebo) was 5 mg/day. Doxazosin (or its matched placebo) was initiated at 1 mg/day, and titrated up to a maximum of 8 mg/day over approximately 10 weeks according to the response of the maximal urinary flow rate (Qmax) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The IPSS and Qmax were assessed at baseline and at weeks 10, 14, 26, 39, and 52 or at the endpoint.

Results

An intent-to-treat analysis of 1007 men showed doxazosin and doxazosin plus finasteride combination therapy produced statistically significant improvements in total IPSS and Qmax compared with placebo and finasteride alone (P < 0.05). Finasteride alone was not significantly different statistically from placebo with respect to total IPSS and Qmax. All treatments were generally well tolerated.

Conclusions

Doxazosin was effective in improving urinary symptoms and urinary flow rate in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and was more effective than finasteride alone or placebo. The addition of finasteride did not provide further benefit to that achieved with doxazosin alone.

### Alpha1-adrenergic receptors and their inhibitors in lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia [^19f30e36]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide a comprehensive overview of the role of alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1ARs) as critical mediators of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and pathophysiology in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and we review the pharmacological antagonists of alpha1ARs.

Materials and Methods

A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of alpha1ARs, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors.

Results

Further characterization of the alpha1AR gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and alpha1aARs are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high alpha1aAR selectivity have attracted attention. Tamsulosin, which has high affinity for alpha1aAR and alpha1dAR subtypes but not for alpha1bAR, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents terazosin and doxazosin. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent alfuzosin also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the alpha1aAR subtype are under investigation.

Conclusions

Further advances in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH may depend not only on receptor subtype selectivity, but also on other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.

### How to read a research paper: an exercise in critical thinking in the context of an epidemiologic study on tamsulosin and the risk of dementia [^108d05af]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

A recent study of the relationship between tamsulosin and dementia found that, in propensity score-matched analyses that adjusted for measured risk factors for dementia, the use of tamsulosin to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was associated with a small but significant increase in the risk of incident dementia relative to untreated BPH, BPH treated with the 5α-reductase inhibitors dutasteride and finasteride, and BPH treated with the α adrenoceptor blockers doxazosin, terazosin, and alfuzosin. The choice of control groups addressed confounding by indication, confounding by disease severity, and confounding by pharmacologic drug class. The authors of the study provided a wealth of detail in their main paper and in supplementary materials, allowing an almost forensic examination of the findings. This article discusses the study from the perspective of whether the hypothesis relating tamsulosin to dementia was set a priori or emerged after an exploratory exercise; whether tamsulosin crosses the blood-brain barrier for dementia as the event of interest to be attributable to treatment; whether the action of tamsulosin is plausibly related to dementia as a possible outcome; whether confounding was adequately addressed in the analyses; whether the duration of follow-up was sufficient for the event of interest to be attributable to tamsulosin; whether the absolute increase in the rate of incident dementia was clinically significant; and what the curiosities in the dose-dependence and subgroup analysis findings could imply. These matters provide considerable food for thought. Thus, this article is intended to serve as an example of how to read a paper critically and how to think about what the findings might suggest.

### Doxazosin and terazosin suppress prostate growth by inducing apoptosis: clinical significance [^21e709a5]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Doxazosin and terazosin are known to relax prostate smooth muscle through blockade of alpha 1-adrenergic innervation to the prostate. This action alone however does not fully account for the long-term clinical responses exerted by these drugs in the treatment of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Materials and Methods

Experimental and clinical studies were done to establish the induction of prostate cell apoptosis by alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists as a molecular mechanism contributing to their long-term efficacy in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with BPH and to potential suppression of prostate cancer growth.

Results

The data indicate that both doxazosin and terazosin induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. The apoptotic effect of doxazosin and terazosin is mediated by a mechanism independent of the alpha1-adrenoceptor blockade, potentially under the direction of the quinazoline nucleus, since the nonquinazoline alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin does not elicit an apoptotic response. Recent experimental evidence points to deregulation of signal transduction pathways involving transforming growth factor-beta and disruption of cell attachment to the extracellular matrix (anoikis) as potential mechanisms underlying this apoptotic action of quinazoline based alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonists against prostate cells.

Conclusions

The correlation of induced prostate smooth muscle cell apoptosis with improvement of urinary symptoms in patients with BPH treated with doxazosin and terazosin, identifies apoptosis as an additional molecular mechanism for the long term therapeutic impact of these drugs in BPH. Moreover, the apoptotic effect elicited by quinazolines may have high clinical significance in the prevention and treatment of prostate cancer.

### Clinical ease of using doxazosin in BPH patients with and without hypertension [^824a7787]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that doxazosin therapy reduced blood pressure (BP) in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) who were hypertensive at baseline but not in patients who were physiologically or pharmacologically normotensive at baseline. In patients with BPH and uncontrolled hypertension, despite treatment with other antihypertensive drugs, the addition of doxazosin resulted in improved control with significant reductions in BP. The new formulation, doxazosin gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS), is initiated at a therapeutic dose, simplifying dose titration. Based on its efficacy and pharmacokinetic and tolerability profiles, doxazosin GITS is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for normotensive and hypertensive patients with BPH.

### The risk of fall and fracture with the initiation of a prostate-selective α antagonist: a population based cohort study [^7fab1889]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

As men age, many will develop bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and a weak urinary stream. These symptoms are often attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia and are treated because of their negative impact on quality of life. The introduction of several α antagonist medications in the 1990s fundamentally changed the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms. These medications relax the prostatic smooth muscle and improve urinary flow rates and symptoms.

Non-specific (first generation) α antagonists, such as doxazosin and terazosin, act on all α 1 receptor subtypes (α 1A, α 1B, α 1D) and are used for the treatment of both benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension. This non-selective α 1 receptor activity requires dose titration over 1–2 weeks to avoid symptomatic hypotension from α 1B antagonism. These non-specific α antagonists have generally fallen into disfavor as antihypertensives since the ALLHAT trial. In this randomized, double blind trial traditional antihypertensive medicines (including non-specific α antagonists) were compared with newer classes of antihypertensives; the doxazosin arm was stopped early because of a higher rate of cardiac dysfunction.

Similarly, among men with benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms, these non-specific α antagonists have largely been replaced by prostate-specific (second generation) α antagonists. These newer drugs do not need dose titration and are solely indicated for male urinary symptoms from benign prostatic hyperplasia. They include alfuzosin (which exhibits clinical uroselectivity), and tamsulosin and silodosin (which exhibit true α 1A receptor selectivity, which is the primary α receptor in the prostate). Their selectivity for the prostate hypothetically reduces the risk of hypotension due to reduced α 1B antagonism.

However, as a class, all α antagonists have been associated with side effects such as hypotension and dizziness. For this reason, α antagonists in general have been identified as a class of medication to discontinue in a patient who falls. However, this recommendation is primarily based on perceptions of the hypotension risk associated with non-specific α antagonists, and the potentially lower risk, prostate-specific drugs have not been widely studied. In addition, previous research has failed to demonstrate a consistent conclusion regarding the risk of falls and fractures with α antagonists used for benign prostatic hyperplasia symptoms. Studies have both demonstratedand failed to demonstratethis risk.

### Study details | NCT00701779 | Dutasteride and flex dose of tamsulosin on as needed basis, to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia… [^bdefea16]. ClinicalTrials (2008). Low credibility.

Study Overview This study will investigate the efficacy and safety of treatment with Dutasteride, administered once daily for one year in combination with Tamsulosin, administered once daily for 3 months, followed by counseling on flexible dosing of Tamsulosin on an as needed basis, on the improvement of symptoms and clinical outcome in men with moderate to severe symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia. At each scheduled visit, the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin.

A recently published, landmark study, co-sponsored by the National Institute of Health and the National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, demonstrated that, in selected patients, combination therapy with Doxazosin and Finasteride provided additive symptomatic improvements, reduced the risk of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention, and was a more effective treatment for reduction in the overall risk of BPH clinical progression. The aim of this proposed combination study, in a population of patients at high risk of BPH clinical progression, is to investigate whether combination therapy with Dutasteride and Tamsulosin with the subsequent withdrawal of Tamsulosin can maintain superior symptom improvement. At each scheduled visit, the subject will be counseled on withdrawal of Tamsulosin.

We hypothesize that patients may start with a combination of Dutasteride and Tamsulosin and eventually may be able to eliminate the use of Tamsulosin and maintain acceptable urinary symptoms on Dutasteride alone.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^41951338]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Applicability of results

Most findings of this systematic review confirm the important standing of alpha-1 antagnonists in the management of patients with LUTS suggestive of BPH and the minor role of doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension. Nevertheless, some issues must be addressed concerning the applicability of the results.

The short follow-up time limits the the ability to appraise the effects in long-term treatment with alpha-1 antagonists in LUTS suggestive of BPH. The applicability of the results is additionally impaired as the dose regime used for tamsulosin was 0.2 mg once daily in all three trials, which is lower than the recommended daily dose of tamsulosin 0.4 mg in Western countries. It also has to be considered that the trials were not placebo controlled. Whether alpha-1 antagonists can be recommended for long-term treatment remains doubtful as the results by Roehrborn et al. (2006) demonstrate similar progression event rates for treatment with alfuzosin as for placebo and results about a possible relationship between tamsulosin and the incidence of dementia remain doubtful. Other classes of drugs such as 5alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. dutasteride, finasteride) or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (e.g. tadalafil) are currently being used in the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH alone or in combination with alpha-1 antagonists. Only one study compared treatment satisfaction between management with tamsulosin 0.4 mg, tadalafil 5 mg and placebo but did not offer separate reporting for older adults. Therefore, no valuable additive information regarding the comparison or combination of treatments in older adults could be delivered by this systematic review.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^d89cb90f]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Drug exposure

Tamsulosin was our study drug of interest because it comprised the majority of total use of α blockers in our data. Other α blockers are approved for benign prostatic hyperplasia, including alfuzosin, doxazosin, silodosin, and terazosin. Silodosin (Rapaflo), alfuzosin (Uroxatral), and doxazosin extended release (Cardura XL) were ignored because their use in our study population was minimal. Furthermore, low use makes adverse events with these specific drugs less of a public health concern. We excluded terazosin (Hytrin, Zayasel) and doxazosin (Cardura) because they are also indicated for hypertension, the requirement for a diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia before initiating drug treatment resulted in too few exposed person years for analysis, and confounding by a coindication for benign prostatic hyperplasia and hypertension could impose bias. Exposure to 5ARIs including finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart) were also identified during longitudinal follow-up. Finasteride (Propecia) was ignored because this formulation is taken at a lower dose (1 mg daily), had low use, and is approved only for androgenic alopecia. Inclusion of men initiating 5ARIs formed a reference comparator of men initiating new, non-tamsulosin drug treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and it set time since initiation of treatment as the underlying time scale in our analysis.

### A prospective pilotstudy comparing the anesthetic effects of an α-2 agonist during holmium laser resection of the prostate and transurethral resection for prostate surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia patients using selective α-1 blockers [^eacaca5b]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Selective α1 blockers are commonly used for the medical treatment of lower urinary tract obstruction in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH); however, they may cause side effects such as asthenia, fatigue, postural hypotension, and dizziness. Long-acting α1 blockers commonly used for these patients with BPH include terazosin, doxazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, and naftofidil. The effectiveness of these drugs compared with placebo has been proven in several studies. These α blockers are selective α1 blockers and are different compared to nonspecificα blockers such as phenoxybenzamine, which has been used previously. Phenoxybenzamine has a high affinity for α2 adrenoceptors, which are found in the prostatic neuroeffector cleft. Tamsulosin is the first clinically available α1Aadrenoceptor blocker. It is selective for α1A adrenoceptors, which are predominantly present and functional in the human prostate, and it is more selective for α1 adrenoceptors in the human prostate than in the human aorta. In patients with BPH symptoms, tamsulosin has been shown to relieve symptoms and improve blood flow, andunlike terazosin and doxazosin, blood pressure is not significantly affected.

### The effects of dutasteride, tamsulosin and combination therapy on lower urinary tract symptoms in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic enlargement: 2-year results from the combAT study [^6676f2a5]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated whether combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin is more effective than either monotherapy alone for improving symptoms and long-term outcomes in men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic enlargement (30 cc or greater). We report preplanned 2-year analyses.

Materials and Methods

The CombAT study is an ongoing, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study. Men 50 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia, International Prostate Symptom Score 12 points or greater, prostate volume 30 cc or greater, total serum prostate specific antigen 1.5 ng/ml or greater to 10 ng/ml or less and peak urinary flow greater than 5 to 15 mL per second or less with a minimum voided volume of 125 mL or greater were randomized to 0.5 mg dutasteride, 0.4 mg tamsulosin or the combination once daily for 4 years. Symptoms were assessed every 3 months and peak urinary flow was assessed every 6 months. The primary end point at 2 years was the change in International Prostate Symptom Score from baseline.

Results

Combination therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in symptoms vs dutasteride from month 3 and tamsulosin from month 9, and in benign prostatic hyperplasia related health status from months 3 and 12, respectively. There was a significantly greater improvement from baseline in peak urinary flow for combination therapy vs dutasteride and tamsulosin monotherapies from month 6. There was a significant increase in drug related adverse events with combination therapy vs monotherapies, although most did not result in the cessation of therapy.

Conclusions

In men with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and prostate enlargement (30 cc or greater) combination therapy provides a significantly greater degree of benefit than tamsulosin or dutasteride monotherapy.

### Management of lower urinary tract symptoms attributed to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): AUA guideline amendment 2023 [^fe29b23f]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) combination therapy — In an Asian cohort using a 0.2 mg tamsulosin dose, men with characteristics of disease progression had better symptomatic benefit from combination therapy than tamsulosin monotherapy, with a 24-month study reporting more prominent improvements in maximum urinary flow rate (Qmax) and prostate volume reduction and reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention (AUR) and BPH related surgery; another study found that initial combination dutasteride and tamsulosin improved quality of life compared to later initiation of tamsulosin after disease progression; Providers may start combination therapy with the intention of later discontinuing the alpha blocker (sometimes called "Withdrawal Therapy"). While this is a reasonable strategy, the concept has not been studied rigorously, and there are insufficient data to gauge the utility of this approach or the duration at which combination therapy should be continued before cessation of the alpha blocker. As stated previously, providers do not need to obtain a PSA solely for determination of 5-ARI efficacy as part combination therapy, although knowledge of a pre-existing value may help guide treatment options.

### The long-term effect of doxazosin, finasteride, and combination therapy on the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia [^35950ef9]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia is commonly treated with alpha-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha-blockers) or 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. The long-term effect of these drugs, singly or combined, on the risk of clinical progression is unknown.

Methods

We conducted a long-term, double-blind trial (mean follow-up, 4.5 years) involving 3047 men to compare the effects of placebo, doxazosin, finasteride, and combination therapy on measures of the clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Results

The risk of overall clinical progression — defined as an increase above base line of at least 4 points in the American Urological Association symptom score, acute urinary retention, urinary incontinence, renal insufficiency, or recurrent urinary tract infection — was significantly reduced by doxazosin (39 percent risk reduction, P < 0.001) and finasteride (34 percent risk reduction, P = 0.002), as compared with placebo. The reduction in risk associated with combination therapy (66 percent for the comparison with placebo, P < 0.001) was significantly greater than that associated with doxazosin (P < 0.001) or finasteride (P < 0.001) alone. The risks of acute urinary retention and the need for invasive therapy were significantly reduced by combination therapy (P < 0.001) and finasteride (P < 0.001) but not by doxazosin. Doxazosin (P < 0.001), finasteride (P = 0.001), and combination therapy (P < 0.001) each resulted in significant improvement in symptom scores, with combination therapy being superior to both doxazosin (P = 0.006) and finasteride (P < 0.001) alone.

Conclusions

Long-term combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride was safe and reduced the risk of overall clinical progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia significantly more than did treatment with either drug alone. Combination therapy and finasteride alone reduced the long-term risk of acute urinary retention and the need for invasive therapy.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^46c1a2ed]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We performed a meta-analysis to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) during a treatment cycle of at least 1year.

Methods

Randomized controlled trials were searched by using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Systematic review was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. The data was evaluated and statistically analyzed by using RevMan version 5.3.0.

Results

Five studies including 4348 patients were studied. The analysis found that the combination group was significantly greater effect in international prostate symptom score (mean difference [MD], -1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.20 to -0.66; P = 0.0003), prostate volume (MD, -10.13; 95% CI, -12.38 to -7.88; P < 0.00001), transitional zone volume (MD, -3.18; 95% CI, -3.57 to -2.79; P < 0.0001), maximum urine flow rate (MD, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.29; P < 0.00001), prostate specific antigen (MD, -0.54; 95% CI, -0.80 to -0.29; P < 0.0001) and post-void residual volume (MD, -3.85; 95% CI, -4.95 to -2.76; P < 0.00001) compared with the tamsulosin group. In terms of safety, including adverse events (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95% CI, 1.34 to 3.17; P = 0.001), erectile dysfunction (OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.73 to 2.92; P < 0.00001), ejaculation disorder (OR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.97 to 5.79; P < 0.0001), retrograde ejaculation (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.08 to 4.93; P = 0.03), decreased libido (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.53 to 3.31; P < 0.0001) and loss of libido (OR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.94 to 5.88; P < 0.0001), the combination group showed poor tolerance than the tamsulosin group with the exception of dizziness (OR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.80; P = 0.50). The combination group significantly reduced the risk of clinical progression than the tamsulosin group especially in incidence of BPH-related symptom progression (OR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.67; P < 0.00001) and acute urinary retention (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.98; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

The combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride provides a preferable therapeutic effect for BPH with a higher incidence of sexual side effects, but combination-therapy can markedly reduce risk of BPH-related symptom progression and acute urinary retention relative to tamsulosin monotherapy.

### Terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin: current clinical experience [^3843be09]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic obstruction are common in aging men. Nearly 25% of men > 40 years of age have LUTS. Medical therapy with alpha-blockade is the most common method of medical therapy for benign prostatic obstruction. Multiple methods of minimally invasive surgical therapies have been introduced in the last decade. These methods include balloon dilatation, temporary and permanent urethral stents, various laser techniques, microwave thermotherapy, transurethral needle ablation, electrovaporization, and high-intensity focused ultrasound. alpha-Receptor blockers to reduce the sympathetic tone of the prostate are considered as first-line therapy to relieve the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers relax prostatic smooth muscle, relieve bladder outlet obstruction, and enhance urine flow with fewer side effects. In addition, it was determined that treating patients with alpha-blockers increases prostatic apoptosis. Pharmacokinetic activity, mode of action, clinical efficacy, and side effects of the selective alpha(1)-receptor blockers terazosin, doxazosin, and prazosin are reviewed.

### Clinical question… [^dd19fcbe]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical Question How effectively do alpha blockers increase ureteral stone passage. Evidence-Based Answer The alpha blocker tamsulosin can be used to improve clearance of stones larger than 5 mm, shorten expulsion times, and reduce hospitalization. Alfuzosin, doxazosin, and silodosin are also effective but have significantly more adverse effects. Summary A 2018 Cochrane review compared alpha blockers with placebo or standard therapy for urinary stone expulsion. The studies that evaluated tamsulosin did not find any increase in adverse effects. Three other alpha blockers had statistically increased rates of adverse effects.

Major adverse effects were not significantly increased in the 18 studies reporting them. However, among the placebo-controlled studies, adverse effects were increased. A high-quality, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published after the Cochrane review found no improvement in stone passage rates when alpha blockers were used. 2 The passage rate for tamsulosin was 50% compared with 47% for the placebo group. This study included 512 patients with a mean age of 40. 6 years;
27. 1% were female. It evaluated symptomatic patients who presented to the emergency department with urinary stones of 9 mm or less identified by computed tomography. Patients were randomized to a 28-day regimen of 0. 4-mg tamsulosin or a placebo.

The passage of a ureteral stone was determined by the patient's visualization or physical capture of the stone.

Quality of the individual studies

All studies included in the analysis were the random control study, and two studies specified a random protocol. Four studies had a appropriate calculation of sample size and one study did not calculate the sample size. Two studies showed an intention-to-treat analysis. However, in all studies, the specific methods of blind did not explicitly explaining with their Jadad scores rating B. All studies were included in the analysis regardless of the grade of quality (Table 3). The plot was highly symmetrical and five squares were contained in the large triangle, and no evidence of bias was found (Fig. 2).

### Cardiomyocyte alpha-1A adrenergic receptors mitigate postinfarct remodeling and mortality by constraining necroptosis [^fec29589]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Our study is also the first to report on enhanced risk of mortality in patients taking α-blockers, although other studies have identified an association between α-blockers and incident HF. In the landmark ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial), subjects receiving doxazosin had a 2-fold higher risk of developing HF than patients taking chlorthalidone. Partly as a result of this finding, nonselective α-blockers no longer are considered first-line therapy for hypertension. However, α-blockers remain the most prescribed medication for managing symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which affects more than 70% of U.S. males 60 years of age or older. In fact, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (Agency for Health Care Research and Quality) estimates that more than 5 million patients were prescribed the α1A-AR selective antagonist tamsulosin in the United States in 2019. A recent population-based study from Canada found that men receiving α-blockers for BPH had an increased risk of developing HF (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.18–1.26) when compared to men with BPH who were not on medical therapy. Neither of the previous studies reported increased mortality related to α-blockers as we do, although we studied a particularly high-risk population in post-MI patients.

Over the last 2 decades the evolution of alpha-blockers for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)/benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has been to preserve effectiveness, improve tolerability, and eliminate dose titration. Today, alpha-blockers represent the first-line treatment of most men with BPH whereby the primary objective is relief from bothersome LUTS.

### The effects of combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin on clinical outcomes in men with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia: 4-year results from the combAT study [^0f69b183]. European Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin provides significantly greater benefit than either monotherapy for various patient-reported outcomes in men with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic enlargement.

Objective

To investigate whether combination therapy is more effective than either monotherapy in reducing the relative risk for acute urinary retention (AUR), BPH-related surgery, and BPH clinical progression over 4 yr in men at increased risk of progression.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) study was a 4-yr, multicenter, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study in 4844 men ≥ 50 yr of age with a clinical diagnosis of BPH, International Prostate Symptom Score ≥ 12, prostate volume ≥ 30 cm(3), prostate-specific antigen 1.5–10 ng/ml, and maximum urinary flow rate (Q(max)) > 5 and ≤ 15 ml/s with minimum voided volume ≥ 125 ml.

Intervention

Oral daily tamsulosin, 0.4 mg; dutasteride, 0.5 mg; or a combination of both.

Measurements

The 4-yr primary end point was time to first AUR or BPH-related surgery. Secondary end points included BPH clinical progression, symptoms, Q(max), prostate volume, safety, and tolerability.

Results and Limitations

Combination therapy was significantly superior to tamsulosin monotherapy but not dutasteride monotherapy at reducing the relative risk of AUR or BPH-related surgery. Combination therapy was also significantly superior to both monotherapies at reducing the relative risk of BPH clinical progression. Combination therapy provided significantly greater symptom benefit than either monotherapy at 4 yr. Safety and tolerability of combination therapy was consistent with previous experience with dutasteride and tamsulosin monotherapies, with the exception of an imbalance in the composite term of cardiac failure among the three study arms. The lack of placebo control is a study limitation.

Conclusions

The 4-yr CombAT data provide support for the long-term use of dutasteride and tamsulosin combination therapy in men with moderate-to-severe LUTS due to BPH and prostatic enlargement. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT00090103 (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00090103).

### Benign prostatic hyperplasia progression and its impact on treatment [^14a8af4c]. Current Opinion in Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Management of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia should reduce the lifetime risk of acute urinary retention and the need for benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery. A number of recent studies demonstrate that 5alpha-reductase inhibitors are unique in providing a long-term combination of improvements in symptoms and flow, and reductions in the risks of acute urinary retention and surgical intervention.

Recent Findings

The 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride was shown to reduce the risk of retention and surgery in men with large prostate volumes and/or high PSA. Recent studies have examined the role of adding an alpha1-blocker to 5alpha-reductase inhibitor in short- or long-term combination. The Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms study randomised 3,047 men with benign prostatic hyperplasia to treatment with a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride), an alpha1 blocker (doxazosin), a combination of both, or placebo. Only treatment arms containing 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy were associated with longer-term significant reductions in the risk of acute urinary retention and invasive therapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Three randomised, two-year, placebo-controlled studies have assessed the clinical relevance of the > 93% DHT suppression provided by dutasteride. Dutasteride was also associated with a reduction in the risk of acute urinary retention of 57%, and a reduction of 48% in the risk of surgical intervention compared with placebo after 2 years.

Summary

Short-term combination of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor and alpha-blockade are optimal in providing symptomatic improvement among patients who require symptom relief, while enabling the initiation of 5alpha-reductase inhibitor therapy to reduce the risk of subsequent acute urinary retention or benign prostatic hyperplasia-related surgery in men who are at greater risk of disease progression.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^4cc5a7d7]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is a progressive disease that causes lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) which substantially affect quality of life for many patients. Men with BPH can result in more severe LUTS, as well as other symptoms and episodes such as reduction of urinary flow rate, increased incidence of urinary infection, acute urinary retention and increased incidence of surgery for BPH, which have a greater unpleasant impact on the patient's quality of life.

Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is the primary androgen responsible for the excessive growth of the prostate that is characteristic of BPH, which is converted from testosterone by the catalysis of 5α-reductase (5AR) in the prostate gland. Besides, 5AR can take part in steroid metabolism and have a tight interaction with the androgen receptor than testosterone. The excessive expression of DHT would trigger the proliferation of prostate epithelial and mesenchymal cells and lead to the development of BPH.

5AR inhibitors (5ARI) can lower the serum concentration of DHT and control the development of prostate and the progression of BPH by inhibiting this enzyme. Dutasteride, a selective inhibitor of the type 1 and type 2 5ARI, is the most frequently prescribed 5ARI. However, the latest clinical trials have found that the effectiveness of dutasteride was limited by its side effects, mainly involving erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder and decreased libido. Tamsulosin, as an efficient α1-blockers, improves dysuria and other BPH symptoms by selectively blocking α 1 A-adrenergic receptor in the prostate to relax the smooth muscles of the prostate. In view of the unique mechanism of tamsulosin and dutasteride, the combination of these two drugs was feasible and have already been examined in some clinical studies. At present, there is no evidence of evidence-based medicine to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy.

We performed a meta-analysis to confirm the efficacy and safety of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating BPH during a treatment cycle of at least 1 year.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Hypertension — alpha-1 blockers include doxazosin 1–16 with daily frequency 1, prazosin 2–20 with daily frequency 2 or 3, and terazosin 1–20 with daily frequency 1 or 2; these are associated with orthostatic hypotension, especially in older adults with a greater BP drop with first dose effect, and these may be considered a second-line agent in patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hypertrophy.

### Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and a baseline total prostate volume of 25 mL or greater [^43d3da12]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We examined data from the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial to determine the relationship between baseline TPV and the effect of medical therapy in men with LUTS secondary to BPH.

Materials and Methods

A total of 3,047 patients with LUTS were randomized to placebo, 4 to 8 mg doxazosin, 5 mg finasteride or the combination of doxazosin and finasteride. Average treatment duration was 4.5 years The primary outcome was time to overall clinical progression of BPH, defined as a confirmed 4 point or greater increase in AUA SS, acute urinary retention, incontinence, renal insufficiency or recurrent urinary tract infection. Secondary outcomes were the need for invasive therapy for BPH, and changes in AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate with time. TPV was measured by transrectal ultrasound at baseline and study end.

Results

In patients with a small prostate (baseline TPV less than 25 ml) combination therapy was no better than doxazosin alone for decreasing the risk of clinical progression of BPH and need for invasive therapy as well as improving AUA SS and the maximum urinary flow rate. However, in patients with moderate size (25 to less than 40 ml) or enlarged (40 mL or greater) glands combination therapy led to a clinical benefit in these outcomes that was superior to that of doxazosin or finasteride.

Conclusions

Combination therapy with doxazosin and finasteride led to a greater decrease in the risk of clinical progression of BPH than either drug alone in patients with LUTS with a baseline TPV of 25 mL or greater.

### Tamsulosin treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia and risk of severe hypotension in men aged 40–85 years in the United States: risk window analyses using between and within patient methodology [^32ba62e8]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

A comparison of hypotension risk with tamsulosin to other α blockers would be of clinical interest, but low use of other α blockers for benign prostatic hyperplasia and confounding by a coindication for hypertension would decrease interpretability of this comparison. In our study, we used two analytical techniques to increase robustness of our study results. The magnitude of the point estimates were not completely synonymous using the cohort and self controlled case series approaches, particularly with regards to weeks 9–12 of new tamsulosin use. These differences are probably attributable to differences in the underlying number of person years in each risk window of exposure among all patients (cohort analysis) versus only those who experienced outcomes (self controlled case series analysis), and to differences in the reference comparator for these techniques. However, both analyses agreed on time varying risks of larger magnitude at new use and restarting tamsulosin treatment than observed with maintenance treatment. Future work is needed to determine whether genetic characteristics or other non-measured risk factors may modify susceptibility to hypotension with tamsulosin.

### OTC tamsulosin for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^3f5dc48c]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Earlier this year, tamsulosin, an alpha blocker previously only available on prescription, became available for sale by pharmacists as a treatment for functional symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men aged 45–75 years (Flomax Relief MR - Boehringer Ingelheim). A television advert for the over-the-counter (OTC) product claims that it is a "simple and effective" treatment that can relieve symptoms within 1 week, allowing the user to "take control of your annoying pee problems".¹ Here we review the evidence on tamsulosin and assess whether its availability as an OTC product confers worthwhile advantages.

### Alpha blockers to speed ureteral stone passage… [^4eccd516]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

The authors identified 32 randomized controlled trials and quasi-RCTs with 5, 864 participants. Participants were symptomatic adults with radiologically confirmed ureteral stones 10 mm or smaller. Exclusion criteria included urinary tract infection, hydronephrosis, or other underlying abnormalities of the kidney or ureters. Alpha blockers used included tamsulosin, alfuzosin, doxazosin, and terazosin; most studies used tamsulosin in a dosage of 0. 4 mg once daily. The majority of studies ran two to four weeks and compared alpha-blocker therapy plus standard therapy with standard therapy plus placebo. Others compared alpha blockers with calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine or the antimuscarinic tolterodine.

The overall stone expulsion time was three days shorter with alpha blockers than with standard therapy, with a mean expulsion time of seven rather than 10 days. A Chinese RCT of 3, 189 patients accounted for most of the latter findings; the study was appropriately masked and considered at low risk of bias. 2 The benefits of alpha blockers were robust, irrespective of whether the stone was smaller than 5 mm or was 5 to 10 mm in diameter. Alpha blockers greatly reduced the need to hospitalize and, to a more modest degree, reduced the number of pain episodes and amount of pain medication used. Only five studies reported adverse effects. In these studies, about 10% of participants experienced dizziness, palpitations, headache, rhinitis, retrograde ejaculation, fatigue and weakness, cutaneous reaction, or postural hypotension. Most adverse effects were mild and did not lead to cessation of therapy.

### Investigating contamination of phytotherapy products for benign prostatic hyperplasia with α-blockers and 5 α-reductase inhibitors [^8e8a6b1f]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Complementary and alternative medicine, including phytotherapeutic agents, or those derived from plant or herb extracts to treat symptoms, is widely accepted in the community. Men with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia increasingly use such preparations. Phytotherapeutic agent quality is unregulated and in most instances the contents are unknown while erectile dysfunction and prostate cancer treatments have shown contamination with standard pharmaceuticals. Since trial results for benign prostatic hyperplasia phytotherapeutic agents are inconsistent, they may also be contaminated. Thus, we determined whether pharmacological doses of alpha-blockers and/or 5alpha-reductase inhibitors were present in a sample of phytotherapeutic agents for benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed 15 phytotherapeutic products marketed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Only oral tablets or capsules were considered with teas, tonics and foods excluded from study. We made random purchases from shop front health stores and Internet retailers. All batches of commercial phytotherapy were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Analysis was semiquantitative using extracts from alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, dutasteride and finasteride.

Results

In the 15 batches of different phytotherapeutic agents tested no interference secondary to contamination with alpha-blockers or 5alpha-reductase inhibitors was observed.

Conclusions

All phytotherapeutic agents for benign prostatic hyperplasia in this study tested negative for alpha-blockers and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors. Inconsistent results in trials using phytotherapeutic agents are probably not explained by the presence of standard pharmaceuticals.

### Α-blocker and risk of dementia in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia: a nationwide population based study using the national health insurance service database [^4b94f0bf]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A recent study demonstrated that tamsulosin increased the risk of dementia in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. However, this study had a number of limitations. We evaluated the association between α-blockers and dementia in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

From the National Health Insurance Service database we collected and analyzed data on α-blockers and dementia in the entire Korean adult population with benign prostatic hyperplasia between January 2011 and December 2011. These patients were followed until September 2017. We tested the effect of α-blockers on the risk of dementia using propensity score matched Cox proportional hazard regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

Results

During a mean ± SD followup of 1,580 ± 674.3 days all study inclusion and exclusion criteria were met by 59,263 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. In the unadjusted cohort the incidence of dementia in the tamsulosin, doxazosin, terazosin, alfuzosin and no medication cohorts were 17.97%, 18.55%, 20.64%, 17.62% and 22.60%, respectively. After propensity score matching the risk of dementia did not significantly differ in the tamsulosin cohort vs the doxazosin and alfuzosin cohorts (HR 1.038, 95% CI 0.960–1.121 and HR 1.008, 95% CI 0.925–1.098), respectively. Compared to the tamsulosin cohort the terazosin cohort had a higher risk of dementia (HR 1.112, 95% CI 1.052–1.196). However, the risk of dementia was significantly lower in the terazosin cohort than in the no medication cohort.

Conclusions

The study findings indicate that benign prostatic hyperplasia medication is not associated with a risk of dementia by duration of use or by type.

### Evaluating use patterns of and adherence to medications for benign prostatic hyperplasia [^8f73cff7]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

We investigated adherence to benign prostatic hyperplasia medications in a California Medicaid population.

Materials and Methods

Using California Medicaid data on 1995 to 2004 we identified adult males 40 years old or older with 1 or more diagnosis and 2 or more prescription fills for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Patients with 2 fills on the same day were assigned to the multiple medication cohort. Adherence was measured using the medication possession ratio for the index medication and the proportion of days covered for any benign prostatic hyperplasia medication. Patients with a medication possession ratio or proportion of days covered of 0.8 or greater were considered adherent. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the relative hazards associated with discontinuation. Multiple logistic regression was used to investigate factors associated with nonadherence or a benign prostatic hyperplasia related procedure.

Results

Of the total population of 2,640 men 40% were adherent with any benign prostatic hyperplasia medication. A significantly greater proportion of patients using multiple medications and finasteride were adherent with any benign prostatic hyperplasia medication (62% and 55%, respectively, p < 0.0001). Doxazosin, terazosin and tamsulosin use was associated with nonadherence (p = 0.008, 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Younger patients and those changing medications were more likely to discontinue (p = 0.01 and < 0.0001), while patients using multiple medications and those experiencing a gap were at lower risk for discontinuation (p = 0.01 and < 0.0001, respectively). Predictors of a procedure included an index prescription in 1999 or later, a urologist visit and nonadherence to any benign prostatic hyperplasia medication (p = 0.01, < 0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions

Adherence to alpha-blockers was less than adherence to finasteride or multiple medications and nonadherence was significantly associated with a procedure. Interventions focused on improving adherence to benign prostatic hyperplasia medications are clearly needed.

### Induction of prostate apoptosis by alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists: mechanistic significance of the quinazoline component [^28bb4619]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor antagonists, have been documented to induce apoptosis and reduce prostate tumor vascularity in benign and malignant prostate cells. The quinazoline based alpha(1)-antagonists, doxazosin and terazosin but not tamsulosin (a sulphonamide derivative) suppress prostate growth without affecting cell proliferation. These quinazoline-mediated apoptotic effects occur via an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor independent mechanism potentially involving activation of the TGF-beta signal transduction pathway. This review discusses the current knowledge of the action of quinazoline-derived alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists in the benign and malignant prostate and their potential therapeutic use in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. Finally, a molecular pathway is proposed for their observed apoptotic function against prostate cells. Increased understanding of the action of these established and clinically accepted agents would provide a basis for the design of safe, effective therapeutic regimens in the treatment of prostatic diseases.

### Do patients on α-blockers for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia have better results after shockwave lithotripsy of urinary stones? [^c173b621]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate whether patients who are on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (alpha 1-AR) antagonists for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) had better results after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (SWL).

Patients and Method

We retrospectively reviewed the records of male patients older than 50 years who underwent SWL. Clinical characteristics, including the use of alpha 1-AR antagonists for BPH were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U test was used for data not normally distributed and student's t test for data normally distributed. The categorical variables were analyzed by the Chi-square test. A multiple logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the associations of variables on successful treatment.

Results

A total of 264 renal units were treated. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 167 RUs (63.3%) and 28 RUs (10.6%) had clinically insignificant residual fragments. In 69 RUs (26.1%), SWL failed. More patients were on alpha 1-AR antagonists for BPH in the successfully treated group (p = 0.028). The multivariate analysis revealed that the use of alpha 1-AR antagonists had significant effects on the success of SWL (p = 0.047). SWL was performed to 34 RUs of 33 patients who were on alpha 1-AR antagonists and it was successful in 30 RUs (88.2%). In the remaining 230 RUs, stone-free state was achieved in 165 RUs (71.7%) (p = 0.028). Stone-free rates were similar for patients on alfuzosine, tamsulosine, and doxazosine (p = 0.310).

Conclusion

Patients who are being treated with alpha 1-AR antagonist agents for BPH have better results after SWL treatment, compared to patients not receiving alpha 1-AR antagonist. The improved results are independent of the type of alpha 1-AR antagonist.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^204d7cf9]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews

To the best of our knowledge, the findings of the ALLHAT study have never been reproduced since. The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) trial examined the effect of doxazosin as third-line antihypertensive therapy in resistant hypertension and found no excess of heart failure over a median follow-up of 12 months. Wolak et al. (2014) found a significant increase in the composite of cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in patients being treated with doxazosin for hypertension (as opposed to treatment for LUTS) with a moderate-to-severe ischemia on myocardial perfusion imaging. There was no focus on heart failure. Neither of the studies published subgroup analyses for patients ≥ 65 years. Siemens et al. (2021) found an increased incidence of heart failure in patients treated with alpha-1 antagonists for LUTS due to BPH in their retrospective cohort study.

Three randomised controlled trials approved of the efficacy of tamsulosin and other alpha-1 antagonists in the reduction of urinary symptoms in older adults and improvement of QoL, which had previously been shown in several trials without focus on the specific age subgroup. As regards the agents' risk profiles comparable results were reported for tamsulosin, silodosin and naftopidil with a higher occurrence of sexual adverse events for silodosin.

Nickel et al. (2008) show significantly increased vasodilation related adverse events (i.e. dizziness, hypotension, syncope) for alfuzosin, terazosin, doxazosin and almost significant for tamsulosin. Similar results were calculated by Yuan et al. (2015) in their network meta-analysis. This corresponds to the findings on a rise in hypotension related adverse events and fractures and falls upon treatment initiation with doxazosin/terazosin/prazosin and tamsulosin/silodosin/alfuzosin, respectively. These results, however, could not be reproduced by Hall and McMahon (2007), Hiremath et al. (2019) and Hundemer et al. (2021) and our meta-analyses. As opposed to the results of most of the literature reporting significant improvement in symptom scores and QoL scores, Oelke et al. (2014) could not show considerably better treatment satisfaction scores in older adults for tamsulosin than for placebo.

### Dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules (dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride) [^5aa52350]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The trial supporting the efficacy of dutasteride and tamsulosin hydrochloride capsules was a 4-year multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial (CombAT trial) investigating the efficacy of the coadministration of dutasteride 0.5 mg/day and tamsulosin hydrochloride 0.4 mg/day (n = 1,610) compared with dutasteride alone (n = 1,623) or tamsulosin alone (n = 1,611). Subjects were aged at least 50 years with a serum PSA ≥ 1.5 ng/mL and < 10 ng/mL and BPH diagnosed by medical history and physical examination, including enlarged prostate (≥ 30 cc) and BPH symptoms that were moderate to severe according to the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Eighty-eight percent (88%) of the enrolled trial population was white. Approximately 52% of subjects had previous exposure to 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor or alpha-adrenergic antagonist treatment. Of the 4,844 subjects randomly assigned to receive treatment, 69% of subjects in the coadministration group, 67% in the dutasteride group, and 61% in the tamsulosin group completed 4 years of double-blind treatment.

Effect on Symptom Score

Symptoms were quantified using the first 7 questions of the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). The baseline score was approximately 16.4 units for each treatment group. Coadministration therapy was statistically superior to each of the monotherapy treatments in decreasing symptom score at Month 24, the primary time point for this endpoint. At Month 24, the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.2 (± 7.14) for the coadministration group, -4.9 (± 6.81) for dutasteride, and -4.3 (± 7.01) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -1.3 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.69, -0.86]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -1.8 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.23, -1.40]). A significant difference was seen by Month 9 and continued through Month 48. At Month 48 the mean changes from baseline (± SD) in IPSS total symptom scores were -6.3 (± 7.40) for coadministration, -5.3 (± 7.14) for dutasteride, and -3.8 (± 7.74) for tamsulosin, with a mean difference between coadministration and dutasteride of -0.96 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -1.40, -0.52]), and between coadministration and tamsulosin of -2.5 units (P < 0.001; [95% CI: -2.96, -2.07]).

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^67ba693b]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Adrenergic alpha-1 receptor antagonists (alpha-1 antagonists) are frequently used medications in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and in the management of therapy-resistant arterial hypertension, two conditions frequently found in older adults. This systematic review aims at presenting a complete overview of evidence over the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in people ≥ 65 years, and at deriving recommendations for a safe application of alpha-1 antagonists in older adults from the evidence found.

Methods

A comprehensive literature search was performed (last update March 25 th 2022) including multiple databases (Medline/Pubmed, Embase, the Cochrane Library) and using the PICOS framework to define search terms. The selection of the studies was done by two independent reviewers in a two-step approach, followed by a systematic data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed for each study included using standardised appraisal tools. The studies retrieved and additional literature were used for the development of recommendations, which were rated for strength and quality according to the GRADE methodology.

Results

Eighteen studies were included: 3 meta-analyses, 6 randomised controlled trials and 9 observational trials. Doxazosin in the management of arterial hypertension was associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, particularly heart failure, than chlorthalidone. Regarding treatment of LUTS suggestive of BPH, alpha-1 antagonists appeared to be effective in the relief of urinary symptoms and improvement of quality of life. They seemed to be less effective in preventing disease progression. Analyses of the risk profile indicated an increase in vasodilation related adverse events and sexual adverse events for some agents. The risk of falls and fractures as well as the effects of long-term treatment remained unclear. All meta-analyses and 5 out of 6 interventional studies were downgraded in the quality appraisal. 7 out of 9 observational studies were of good quality.

Conclusions

It cannot be recommended to use doxazosin as first-line antihypertensive agent neither in older adults nor in younger patients. In the management of BPH alpha-1 antagonists promise to effectively relieve urinary symptoms with uncertainty regarding their efficacy in preventing long-term progression events.

### The effect of doxazosin, finasteride and combination therapy on nocturia in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^72f1b8c4]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the effectiveness of single or combination drug therapy on nocturia in men with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

A total of 3,047 men with lower urinary tract symptoms/benign prostatic hyperplasia enrolled in the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms trial were randomly assigned to receive doxazosin alone, finasteride alone, combination therapy or placebo. Treatment effectiveness was assessed according to intent to treat by mean reduction in self-reported nightly nocturia at 1 and 4 years. A subgroup analysis by age (younger than 70 vs 70 years old or older) was also performed.

Results

Of the men 2,583 reported 1 or more episodes of nocturia and finished 12 or more months of the trial. Mean nocturia was similar in all groups at baseline. Mean nocturia was reduced at 1 year by 0.35, 0.40, 0.54 and 0.58 in the placebo, finasteride, doxazosin and combination groups, respectively. Reductions with doxazosin and combination therapy were statistically greater than with placebo (p < 0.05). At 4 years nocturia was also significantly reduced in patients treated with doxazosin and combination therapy (p < 0.05 vs placebo). In men older than 70 years (495) all drugs significantly reduced nocturia at 1 year (finasteride 0.29, doxazosin 0.46 and combination 0.42) compared to placebo (0.11, p < 0.05).

Conclusions

Doxazosin and combination therapy reduced nocturia more than placebo, but the net benefit of active drug compared to placebo was often modest with a net difference of less than 0.20 fewer nightly nocturia episodes at 1 and 4 years. Findings in men 70 years old or older were similar, with an even smaller effect observed for finasteride.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Types of studies

The following types of studies were included: systematic reviews, meta-analyses, interventional studies and observational studies. Other study types were excluded, e.g. narrative reviews, expert opinions, case reports or letters.

Types of participants

Studies were only eligible if they reported results for older adults. The term older adults was defined as people with the age of 65 years or older. We included studies if the mean age minus 1.8 times the standard deviation was 65 years or older or if there was separate reporting for age subgroups equal to or greater than 65 years. In addition to the age criterion, we also defined patient conditions of interest for this systematic review (e.g. LUTS suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia and resistant arterial hypertension).

Types of interventions

Studies were only included if the intervention lasted for at least 4 weeks. Analyses on acute care and short-term treatment were thus excluded. In addition, the intervention had to include an alpha-1 antagonist (e.g. tamsulosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin) and a comparator. Such comparator could be no treatment, placebo, other drug (also different alpha-1 antagonists), phytotherapy or other non-pharmacological interventions. Studies without a comparator were excluded.

Types of outcomes

Studies were deemed eligible if they investigated direct patient relevant outcomes such as efficacy or effectiveness (e.g. change in the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]) and/or ADEs (e.g. dizziness, asthenia, falls) and/or long-term drug safety (e.g. cognitive decline, cardiovascular events) as well as QoL, mortality, and/or hospitalisations. It was irrelevant for the inclusion of a study whether these outcomes were defined as primary or secondary outcomes. Studies only investigating surrogate parameters (e.g. asymptomatic changes in blood pressure as a proxy for orthostatic hypotension) were excluded.

Publication dates

No limit was set regarding publication dates.

Language

Studies were only included if they were written in English or German.

### Managing benign prostatic hyperplasia [^18bca6dc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Medical and surgical options for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia have expanded in recent years. Saw palmetto, the most widely used complementary medication, is less effective than standard medical therapy but has fewer side effects. Although non-selective alpha blockers provide rapid relief of symptoms and are relatively inexpensive, they can cause dizziness and orthostatic hypotension. These effects occur less often with tamsulosin, a more selective alpha blocker. Finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, slowly reduces prostatic volume but is not as effective as alpha blockers, especially in men with a smaller prostate. Dutasteride, a new 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, has recently been labeled for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Surgery may be appropriate initial treatment in patients with severe symptoms who are not at high risk for complications. Surgery may also be indicated in patients who have failed medical therapy or have recurrent infection, hematuria, or renal insufficiency. Transurethral resection of the prostate is effective in most patients, but it carries some risk of sexual dysfunction, incontinence, and bleeding. Surgical procedures that use thermal microwave or laser energy to reduce hyperplastic prostate tissue have recently become available. In general, the newer procedures are less expensive than transurethral resection of the prostate and have fewer complications; however, the need for retreatment is somewhat greater with these less invasive techniques.

### Efficacy and safety of adrenergic α-1 receptor antagonists in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis supporting the development of recommendations to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing [^f3a67efc]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Implications for practice

The use of doxazosin should not be considered as first-line medication for the management of arterial hypertension. The use of alpha-1 antagonists in the management of LUTS suggestive of BPH, however, appears to be promising in reducing urinary symptoms. Thereby, the safety profile of different agents has to be carefully assessed in a patient-oriented manner. Long-term safety and efficacy remain questionable and an assessment of efficacy and safety profile in comparison with other classes of drugs could not be performed.

Implications for research

Even though many older adults suffer from hypertension and the majority of older men experience LUTS from BPH, only eighteen eligible studies could be identified, primarily due to the age restriction, only two of which are placebo controlled randomized trials. This highlights the lack of evidence for older adults although the largest part of medical interventions is performed in this age class. Additionally, randomised controlled trials with extended follow-up periods are needed to assess the benefits and risks of alpha-1 antagonist treatment in long-term use, providing an enhanced understanding of the real-world use of these medications. To complete the picture of management of LUTS suggestive of BPH in people ≥ 65 years it would be also desirable if future research would focus on comparisons and combinations of different classes of drugs.

Given that most included studies revealed considerable methodological limitations a stronger emphasis should be laid on the application of appropriate methodology. This would produce higher quality results yielding more reliable evidence helping us all to provide the best possible patient care.

Any alpha-1 antagonist

Six observational studies included several alpha-1 antagonists in their analysis partly without differentiating between single agents. Chrischilles et al. (2001) and Hiremath et al. (2019) examined the effect of treatment initiation with terazosin, doxazosin or prazosin on hypotension related adverse events. Hundemer et al. (2021) examined the association of alpha-1 antagonist use and adverse kindey or cardiac events, mortality and safety-related outcomes. Testa et al. (2018) analysed the role of antihypertensive drugs including alpha-1 antagonists in the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension related syncopes in people with dementia. Welk et al. (2015) elaborated on the effect of treatment initiation with tamsulosin, alfuzosin or silodosin on the risk for fractures and falls, and Siemens et al. (2021) investigated the association of alpha-1 antagonist treatment and cardiac failure.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of tamsulosin for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia [^1114d8dd]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated the long-term (up to 6 years) safety and efficacy of the selective alpha 1A-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Materials and Methods

A total of 609 patients were enrolled in a 4-year multicenter open label extension study. Subjects entered the study after completion of a 1-year open label trial that included patients who previously completed up to 57 weeks of double-blind, placebo controlled studies. Maintenance doses (0.4 or 2 x 0.4 mg daily) established in the 1-year study were continued. Efficacy and safety were assessed every 3 months. Primary efficacy evaluations were changes from baseline maximum urine flow rate and total American Urological Association symptom index, and the responder rates for those 2 end points. Secondary end points were changes in American Urological Association subset scores, Boyarsky symptom scores, average urine flow rate, post-void residual urine volume, quality of life index and investigator global assessment.

Results

Of the 609 patients who entered the 4-year extension study 159 had a 2-year or greater prior experience with tamsulosin, yielding a potential 6-year experience on the medication. Of this 159 patient subset 109 completed the whole 6 years. Initial rapid improvements from baseline in primary and secondary end points were maintained each year throughout the duration of the study. Tamsulosin was well tolerated, confirming the safety profile demonstrated in earlier studies. Orthostatic hypotension was observed in 1.3% of the patients.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the sustained efficacy, safety and excellent long-term tolerability of tamsulosin for up to 6 years in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

### Doxazosin mesylate (doxazosin) [^2aa11d93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

Administration of doxazosin mesylate to patients with symptomatic BPH resulted in a statistically significant improvement in maximum urinary flow rate [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Effect on Normotensive Patients with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)

Although blockade of alpha1adrenoceptors also lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients with increased peripheral vascular resistance, doxazosin mesylate treatment of normotensive men with BPH did not result in a clinically significant blood pressure lowering effect (Table 4). The proportion of normotensive patients with a sitting systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg at any time during treatment with doxazosin mesylate 1 to 8 mg once daily was 6.7% with doxazosin and not significantly different (statistically) from that with placebo (5%).

Hypertension

Administration of doxazosin mesylate results in a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. In patients with hypertension, there is little change in cardiac output. Maximum reductions in blood pressure usually occur 2 to 6 hours after dosing and are associated with a small increase in standing heart rate. Like other alpha1-adrenergic blocking agents, doxazosin has a greater effect on blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position.

### Effects of α-blocker' add on' treatment on blood pressure in symptomatic BPH with or without concomitant hypertension [^8fffa7ee]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

BPH is often encountered in aging men, and it is the most common urological disorder. The prevalence of BPH and hypertension increases with age, hence both are common diseases in elderly males. An estimated 25% of men aged > 60 years have concomitant BPH and hypertension. Although BPH and hypertension seem to involve separate disease processes, it has been postulated that age-related increases in sympathetic tone may have a role in their pathophysiologies.

Treatments for BPH include surgical or medical therapy. The number of patients treated for BPH is rapidly increasing in Korea, and noninvasive medical therapy is being increasingly chosen as the primary treatment option. Of the medications for BPH, selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonists have been considered as an effective, noninvasive treatment option for men with BPH. However, the administration of α-blockers (ABs) to patients with BPH raises the concern that patients who are taking other antihypertensive drugs and those with a normal blood pressure (BP) level could experience excessive reductions in BP that would cause hypotensive symptoms. One agent that is shown to provide rapid relief is doxazosin, a selective α1-adrenoceptor antagonist that is also used to treat hypertension. Doxazosin has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in the treatment of symptomatic BPH in hypertensive patients. However, a previous placebo-controlled study of doxazosin in normotensive BPH patients showed a decrease in BP compared with placebo. Although other ABs, such as tamsulosin and alfuzosin, are effective for treating patients with BPH and as part of combined therapy in patients with hypertension, there are few reports comparing their effects on BP in BPH patients depending on antihypertensive medication. Therefore, we aimed to retrospectively evaluate the effects of ABs on BP in BPH patients with or without concomitant hypertension. We also evaluated the efficacy and safety of ABs in these patients.

### Association of glycolysis-enhancing α-1 blockers with risk of developing parkinson disease [^e28b9ba5]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease. A treatment that prevents or delays development of PD is a critical unmet need. Terazosin and closely related drugs were recently discovered to enhance glycolysis and reduce PD progression in animal models and human clinical databases.

Objective

To determine whether use of terazosin, doxazosin, and alfuzosin is associated with a decreased risk of developing PD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study used active comparator control and propensity score-matched data from Danish nationwide health registries, including the Danish National Prescription Registry, the Danish National Patient Registry, and the Danish Civil Registration System, from January 1996 to December 2017 and data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from January 2001 to December 2017. Men without PD who newly initiated terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin therapy or tamsulosin therapy, which is used for a similar indication (benign prostatic hyperplasia or unspecified urinary problems) but does not enhance glycolysis, and had at least 1 year of follow-up after medication start were included. In Denmark, the database included all residents, while the Truven database is a compilation of insurance claims across the US. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to July 2020.

Exposures

Patients who used terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin vs tamsulosin. Additional dose-response analyses were carried out.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Differences in the hazard of developing PD identified by diagnoses or use of PD-specific medications between patients who ever used terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin or tamsulosin.

Results

A cohort of 52 365 propensity score-matched pairs of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin and tamsulosin users were identified in the Danish registries, of which all were male and the mean (SD) age was 67.9 (10.4) years, and 94 883 propensity score-matched pairs were identified in the Truven database, of which all were male and the mean (SD) age was 63.8 (11.1) years. Patients in the Danish cohort who used terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin had a hazard ratio (HR) for developing PD of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81–0.98), and patients in the Truven cohort had an HR of 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58–0.69). There was a dose-response association with short-duration, medium-duration, and long-duration use of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin users having a decreasing HR in both the Danish cohort (short: HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.84–1.07; medium: HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77–1.01; long: HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66–0.95) and Truven cohort (short: HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.64–0.76; medium: HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.52–0.64; long: HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36–0.57).

Conclusions and Relevance

These data suggest that users of terazosin/doxazosin/alfuzosin are at lower hazard of developing PD compared with users of tamsulosin. Future work is needed to further assess this association.

BPH clinical progression after drug administration

Two RCTs with a enough sample size of 3963 participants accessed the extent of BPH clinical progression after drug administration. In view of BPH-related symptom progression, which was the most common progression event in each group, the study found the tamsulosin group had a larger number (OR 0.56, 95%CI 0.46 to 0.67, P < 0.00001) (Fig. 8 a) compared with the combination group.

In terms of BPH-related acute urinary retention, the tamsulosin group had a higher incidence than the combination group (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.98, P = 0.04) (Fig. 8 b). In other aspects of BPH-related clinical progression, mainly containing urinary incontinence, urinary tract infection and renal insufficiency, no significant differences were found between the two treatment groups (Fig. 8 c, d, e).

### 5-alpha reductase inhibition provides superior benefits to alpha blockade by preventing AUR and BPH-related surgery [^6cc06a2a]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

This analysis examines the relative effectiveness of current medical therapies for BPH in preventing AUR, AUR-related catheterisation and surgery in real-life clinical practice.

Methods

This is a retrospective analysis of observational data from the General Practice Research Database (UK) (GPRD). The cohort contains 4500 patients experiencing BPH or lower urinary tract symptoms strongly suggestive of BPH, aged over 50 years, who were prescribed a 5ARI (finasteride) or an alpha-blocker (alfuzosin, doxazosin, indoramin, prazosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) as their first BPH treatment between 1996 and 1999 inclusive. Cox regression and competing risks analyses, adjusted for age and year of first treatment, followed patients from the start of their first BPH treatment to AUR, catheterisation or surgery, or censoring.

Results

Patients prescribed an alpha-blocker were significantly more likely to experience AUR (hazard ratio 2.32, 95%CI 1.37, 3.94) or surgery (hazard ratio 1.78, 95%CI 1.30, 2.44) than patients prescribed a 5ARI. These differences were sustained with sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

Real-life clinical practice shows that significantly fewer BPH patients prescribed a 5ARI experienced serious complications associated with the progression of BPH compared with those prescribed an alpha-blocker.

### Meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia [^80611b9f]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

BPH is a progressive condition characterized by prostate growth accompanying LUTS and sexual dysfunction. Clinical treatment of BPH with 5ARIs and/or α1-blockers has been front-line treatment, and the two drugs showed different mechanisms of action to influence the progression of prostate. Currently, European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend to offer combination treatment with an α1-blocker and a 5ARI to men with moderate-to-severe LUTS and an increased risk of disease progression (e.g. prostate volume > 40 mL). The latest prospective study found that the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride was more efficient than placebo in treating LUTS and may contribute to ejaculation disorders especially in sexually active men with BPH.

We performed this meta-analysis for five studies including 4348 participants to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination of tamsulosin plus dutasteride compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in treating BPH during a treatment cycle of at least 1 year. The analysis demonstrated that the combination-therapy had greater decrease than the monotherapy in aspects of IPSS, PV, TZV and PVRV. Three RCTs containing data on Qmax showed a marked improvement in the combination therapy relative to the tamsulosin group. Overall, the results suggested that combination therapy of tamsulosin plus dutasteride was more effective than tamsulosin monotherapy in patients seeking improvement in symptoms.

Deslypere et al. found that the progress of BPH were inseparable from the vary of DHT which has a high affinity for androgen receptor and an inhibitory effect on testosterone. Previous studies have suggested that the most popular combination therapy which was found to offer a statistically significant improvement than monotherapy was finasteride plus tamsulosin. Currently, dutasteride inhibits two subtypes of 5AR, and has a 45 times greater affinity for type I and a 2.5 times greater affinity for type II than finasteride. As a result of this higher affinity, dutasteride effectively inhibits DHT much more rapidly than finasteride. Our study found that dutasteride can also be used as an effective ingredient in combination medication, which may be even superior to past management. Further clinical studies are needed to explain the effect of different combination of drug on treating BPH.

### Role of the newer alpha,-adrenergic-receptor antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary tract symptoms [^0511c3f5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although initially introduced for the management of hypertension, alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor antagonists (alpha1-blockers) have become the standard of care for the medical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, these agents have the potential to produce orthostatic hypotension and other blood pressure-related adverse effects in normotensive patients and in those receiving concurrent treatment with other antihypertensive agents. As a result, more "uroselective", less vasoactive alpha(1)-blockers have been developed.

Objective

This article reviews current information on the role of alpha(1)-blockers in the treatment of BPH-related LUTS. The focus is on tamsulosin and alfuzosin, newer "uroselective" agents in this class that have a decreased potential for cardiovascular adverse effects.

Methods

Relevant articles were identified through a search of the English-language literature indexed on MEDLINE and the proceedings of scientific meetings from 1976 to 2003. The search terms were benign prostatic hyperplasia treatment, alpha(1)-adrenergic-receptor blocker, uroselectivity, lower urinary tract symptoms, complications, and cardiovascular.

Results

Tamsulosin has selectivity for the a alpha(1) and alpha(1d) receptor subtypes. Alfuzosin, although not receptor subtype selective, is clinically "uroselective" and does not significantly affect vascular alpha-adrenergic receptors. Both agents are efficacious in relieving LUTS and have a decreased potential for such cardiovascular adverse effects as postural hypotension. Common adverse events with these agents include dizziness and asthenia.

Conclusion

Based on the available data, "uroselective" alpha(1)-blockers should be considered over older, more vasoactive agents for the medical management of LUTS, particularly in patients with BPH and hypertension.

### Dutasteride plus tamsulosin fixed-dose combination first-line therapy versus tamsulosin monotherapy in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia: a budget impact analysis in the Greek healthcare setting [^26af99f5]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), a common benign neoplasm in men, is a chronic condition with an age dependent epidemiology. It is associated with progressive lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and affects 75% of men older than 70. Although many epidemiological clinical studies have been conducted worldwide over the last 20 years, the prevalence of clinical BPH remains difficult to determine. A broadly accepted clinical definition of BPH is lacking, and thus performance of adequate epidemiological studies is hampered. A commonly occurring condition in men with underlying BPH is acute urinary retention (AUR). AUR is an uncomfortable and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by a sudden inability to urinate associated with intense suprapubic discomfort. Medical intervention is often required in order to relieve the severe discomfort experienced by patients with AUR. Overall, the common clinical manifestations attributed to BPH include LUTS, urinary tract infection, incomplete bladder emptying, acute and chronic urinary retention, chronic renal insufficiency, urosepsis, and hematuria.

Therapeutic interventions for LUTS, due to BPH, provide sustained improvement in clinical symptoms and quality of life (QoL), while inhibiting progression of the condition. The two main pharmacological agents for the management of BPH/LUTS are 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs) and alpha-blockers. Dutasteride is a 5-ARI and works by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, thus reducing cellular growth and in turn reducing the size of the prostate. Tamsulosin is an uroselective alpha-blocker and exerts its activity by relaxing bladder neck muscles and prostate muscle fibres that in turn improve in urine flow rate. Combination therapy was significantly superior to both monotherapies at reducing the relative risk of BPH clinical progression, as concluded by the Combination of Avodart TM (dutasteride) and Tamsulosin (CombAT) study. CombAT was a randomised, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study in 4,844 men of 50 years or older with a clinical diagnosis of BPH for the treatment of moderate to severe BPH that spanned over 4 years.
