## Question

Subdural hematoma is related with pitting edema

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether subdural hematoma is related to pitting edema. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of subdural hematoma versus pitting edema. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of each to see if there is a mechanistic link. Next, I will review the literature for any direct or indirect associations. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically grounded conclusion and clarify any confounders that could cause confusion between the two entities.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Subdural hematoma is an extra-axial collection of blood in the subdural space, typically from bridging vein rupture, and it behaves as an intracranial mass lesion that can compress brain tissue and raise intracranial pressure, which is a different compartment and mechanism than peripheral edema. Pitting edema refers to dependent, soft tissue swelling from interstitial fluid accumulation in the skin and subcutaneous tissues, classically indenting with pressure and reflecting systemic or local fluid overload or vascular permeability changes, not intracranial processes.

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before drawing conclusions. Subdural hematoma increases intracranial pressure via mass effect and can precipitate cerebral edema, but that cerebral edema is either vasogenic from blood–brain barrier disruption or cytotoxic from ischemia; neither mechanism translates to pitting edema in the periphery, which arises from Starling forces and interstitial fluid dynamics in soft tissues rather than brain parenchyma or meninges. Hold on, I should also note that while SDH can drive secondary brain swelling, this is distinct from systemic peripheral edema and would not be expected to produce pitting edema in the legs or other dependent areas.

> I will now examine the literature for any direct linkage. I need to check whether any of the provided sources connect SDH to pitting edema; scanning the references, I see extensive discussion of cerebral edema in the context of SDH, TBI, and ICH, but I do not find reports describing pitting edema as a manifestation of SDH, which supports the conceptual separation between intracranial mass effect/edema and peripheral pitting edema. Hmm, wait a minute, could I be missing a case report linking SDH to peripheral edema? I should double-check the case-based and review articles; again, the edema discussed is cerebral, not pitting, reinforcing that there is no established relationship in this dataset.

> But wait, what if there are indirect associations via systemic illness that could confuse the picture? Let me consider confounders. Patients with SDH are often older adults with comorbidities such as heart failure, renal disease, or liver disease, all of which can cause pitting edema independent of the SDH; in such cases, pitting edema would be attributable to the systemic condition rather than the intracranial hematoma itself, so I should be cautious not to ascribe causality where there is only co-occurrence. Hold on, I should verify that none of the SDH studies claim a direct causal link to pitting edema; I find none, which aligns with the pathophysiologic reasoning above.

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overlooking anything. Subdural hematoma and pitting edema are anatomically and mechanistically distinct: SDH is an intracranial mass lesion that can cause cerebral edema and raised ICP, whereas pitting edema reflects peripheral interstitial fluid accumulation; there is no direct causal relationship between SDH and pitting edema in the literature provided, and any coexistence would typically reflect independent systemic disease rather than a neurogenic mechanism from the SDH itself. I should confirm the bottom line: no, subdural hematoma is not related to pitting edema in a direct pathophysiologic sense, though both may coexist in a patient with multiple comorbidities.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is not associated with pitting edema. Pitting edema is a **systemic manifestation** of fluid overload or vascular leak, whereas SDH is a **localized intracranial bleed** that causes mass effect and cerebral edema, not peripheral edema. If pitting edema is present in a patient with SDH, it reflects **coexisting systemic conditions** (e.g. heart failure, renal failure, liver disease, or medication effects) rather than the SDH itself.

---

## Pathophysiology of subdural hematoma

SDH arises from **bridging vein rupture** between the dura and arachnoid, allowing blood to accumulate in the subdural space [^1113guFe]. This creates a **mass effect** that compresses the brain, increases intracranial pressure (ICP), and can cause cerebral edema and herniation [^113vWnLW]. The key mechanisms are **mechanical compression** and secondary cerebral edema, not systemic fluid overload [^114rMPjA].

---

## Pathophysiology of pitting edema

Pitting edema reflects **interstitial fluid accumulation** in soft tissues, most often due to:

- **Increased hydrostatic pressure**: heart failure, venous insufficiency.
- **Increased capillary permeability**: inflammation, sepsis.
- **Decreased oncotic pressure**: hypoalbuminemia (liver disease, nephrotic syndrome).
- **Sodium and water retention**: renal failure, cirrhosis, medications (e.g. calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs).

These mechanisms are **systemic** and do not involve intracranial compartments.

---

## Relationship between subdural hematoma and pitting edema

There is **no direct pathophysiological link** between SDH and pitting edema. SDH does not cause systemic fluid overload or peripheral capillary leak, and pitting edema does not cause SDH. When both coexist, they are **independent processes** arising from separate causes.

---

## Clinical evidence and expert consensus

There is **no evidence** that SDH causes pitting edema, and no guideline or review describes such a relationship. SDH literature focuses on intracranial effects (mass effect, cerebral edema, herniation) [^113vWnLW], while pitting edema is discussed in systemic disease contexts (heart, renal, liver, medications) [^notfound]. Their coexistence is **coincidental** rather than causal.

---

## Clinical scenarios of coexistence

Both may coexist in patients with **multisystem disease** or complex presentations, such as:

- **Trauma patients**: SDH from head injury plus systemic injuries causing fluid shifts or organ dysfunction.
- **Elderly patients**: SDH from falls plus chronic heart, renal, or liver disease causing pitting edema.
- **Medication effects**: anticoagulants increasing SDH risk and drugs causing fluid retention (e.g. NSAIDs, calcium channel blockers).

In these cases, **each condition should be managed independently** according to its own pathophysiology.

---

## Clinical implications and management

Recognizing that SDH and pitting edema are unrelated ensures **appropriate management**:

- **SDH management**: neurosurgical evaluation, ICP control, and treatment of cerebral edema [^113vWnLW].
- **Pitting edema management**: address the underlying systemic cause (e.g. diuretics for heart failure, albumin for hypoalbuminemia, discontinuation of offending drugs).

Conflating the two can delay care; **distinct, targeted therapy** is essential.

---

## Conclusion

SDH and pitting edema are **pathophysiologically distinct** and not causally related. SDH causes localized intracranial mass effect and cerebral edema, while pitting edema reflects systemic fluid overload or vascular leak. Coexistence indicates separate, concurrent disease processes and should be managed independently.

Conclusion

DKA induced cerebral edema on the CSDH/subdural hematoma/ can have a role in altering any of the parameters (except the thickness) for surgical indication of patients with a diagnosis of both CSDH +DM with DKA. Hence, the treating physicians should be vigilant of this and should not be deceived of the thickness of the CSDH/subdural hygroma/alone especially when there is a disproportionately tight brain for the degree of collection. Whether DKA induced cerebral edema causes a subdural hygroma is unknown and needs study.

To best of authors' knowledge, this is the first article which presents a case of cerebral edema in a patient who presented with a diagnosis of both DKA + CSDH. This paper tries to show whether or not the severity of brain tightness (edema) seen in our patient is from the direct mass effect of CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ or from DKA related cerebral alteration due to the presence of DKA. It also highlights if there is any difference in the management of patients having CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ alone from those having CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ with DKA.

Abusive head trauma (AHT) neuroimaging — head CT is the initial imaging study that can identify skull fractures, intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, and mass effect/intracranial shift, while magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) better demonstrates brain tissue changes and distinguishes extra-axial fluid collections and the age and extent of subdural hematoma. Neuroimaging findings for AHT-related subdural hematoma (SDH) include SDH without an associated skull fracture, more chronic appearing hematoma, areas with blood of multiple apparent ages, and hypoxic-ischemic changes with cerebral edema associated with AHT.

### Mismatch between midline shift and hematoma thickness as a prognostic factor of mortality in patients sustaining acute subdural hematoma [^113vWnLW]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) is a traumatic lesion commonly found secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). The acceleration–deceleration resulting from trauma results in the rupture of the bridged veins, which causes the formation of hematoma. Damage to brain tissue cannot be attributed only to ASDH, as this hematoma is commonly associated with cerebral edema, brain concussions, and diffuse axonal lesions, which can worsen patient prognosis. Despite advances in prehospital and hospital support, this entity still has high mortality rates. The mortality rate in the literature ranges from 40% to 70%.

Several factors are associated with the prognosis of these patients, such as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at admission, age, pupillary response, and associated traumatic injuries. Radiological findings on CT, such as hematoma thickness (HT) and structures midline shift (MLS), have an important prognostic role and can be a determining factor for surgical management.

MLS is caused by the hematoma itself and concomitant brain swelling. The effect of brain swelling can be shown on the initial head CT scan by the relationship of the MLS and the HT. Disproportionately increased MLS compared with HT would raise concerns of brain tissue injury and edema, and hence a higher intracranial pressure (ICP) and a worse prognosis could be anticipated. HT, MLS, ICP, and other factors including the severity of brain atrophy are interrelated.

The concept of brain swelling is not new. However, complex scoring systems that assess radiological findings as prognostic factors for TBI include MLS and hematoma data in isolation and not associated, such as the Rotterdamand Helsinkiscores.

The relationship between HT and MLS has been little studied in the literature. Zumkeller et al were the first to evaluate the difference between them as prognostic factors for survival in a cohort of patients. Recently, Bartels et al, in a retrospective cohort of 59 patients, determined that a difference between MLS and HT greater than 3 mm was associated with fatality. However, this parameter was not evaluated in a large sample and in low-income or middle-income countries (LMICs), a context of scarcity of resources that can benefit from simplified predictive models, thus requiring additional studies for external validation of its real predictive value. Thus, this study aimed to assess the prognostic value of the difference between MLS and HT for acute outcomes in patients with ASDH in an LMIC.

### Effect of irrigation fluid temperature on recurrence in the evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma: a randomized clinical trial [^115pRP2R]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

A chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) consists of a collection of old blood and degraded blood products located in the subdural space. A process driven by inflammatory and angiogenetic factors may cause the subdural collection of blood to progress to a significant volume causing symptoms due to compression of the brain. Common symptoms of cSDH are focal neurologic deficits, an altered mental state, and symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, decreased consciousness, and in severe cases, even death. Older adults (> 65 years) are especially susceptible to cSDH due to a higher frequency of anticoagulant therapy, brain atrophy, and an increased risk of head trauma due to falls. The increased cSDH incidence is largely attributed to an aging population in combination with increased use of antithrombotic therapy. Data from the Nordic countries indicate that the incidence has almost tripled, and the number of surgeries doubled, in the last 20 to 30 years. These findings are consistent with an increasing incidence of cSDH in the US, where the annual case load is predicted to be 60 000 cases by 2030.

### Rapid spontaneously resolving acute subdural hematoma [^11376TKP]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The evaluation of images from CT scans that were performed during different phases of our patient clearly demonstrated the rapid transition of hematoma density from a high density to a mixed density. This finding indicated that CSF dilution probably occurred during this phenomenon. Some authors agreed that the potential sign in early CT of a rapid resolution was the presence of a low-density band.– In our patient's second CT scan (Fig. 1 B), it was observed that remarkable cerebral edema could squeeze, in some way, the diluted hematoma. Kuroiwa et alsuggested that diffuse cerebral edema was necessary for the spontaneous resolution of a hematoma. We speculate that cerebral edema leads to resolution via both mechanisms, but it may not be the prerequisite for hematoma rapid resolution. Indeed, in most patients, the diffuse edema was not even observed (Table 1). We propose that the slice or middle thickness hematoma (< 1.5 cm) would be suitable in the consideration of rapid resolution. Lee et alreported a patient with a hematoma thickness that was larger than 2.5 cm, yet it finally converted to a chronic subdural hematoma. The presence of simple ASDH without contusion appears to be associated with rapid resolution. We suspect that this effect is due to the mass effect of the contusion, which impeded the flow of CSF in the limited space.

### Diffusion-weighted imaging reveals distinct patterns of cytotoxic edema in patients with subdural hematomas [^1173oV6G]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Subdural hematomas (SDHs) are increasingly common and can cause ischemic brain injury. Previous work has suggested that this is driven largely by vascular compression from herniation, although this work was done before the era of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We thus sought to study SDH-related ischemic brain injury by looking at patterns of cytotoxic edema on diffusion-weighted MRI. To do so, we identified all SDH patients at a single institution from 2015 to 2019 who received an MRI within 2 weeks of presentation. We reviewed all MRIs for evidence of restricted diffusion consistent with cytotoxic edema. Cases were excluded if the restricted diffusion could have occurred as a result of alternative etiologies (e.g., cardioembolic stroke or diffuse axonal injury). We identified 450 SDH patients who received an MRI within 2 weeks of presentation. Twenty-nine patients (∼6.5% of all MRIs) had SDH-related cytotoxic edema, which occurred in two distinct patterns. In one pattern (N = 9), patients presented as comatose with severe midline shift and were found to have cytotoxic edema in the vascular territories of the anterior and posterior cerebral artery, consistent with herniation-related vascular compression. In the other pattern (N = 19), patients often presented as awake with less midline shift and developed cytotoxic edema in the cortex adjacent to the SDH outside of typical vascular territories (peri-SDH cytotoxic edema). Both patterns occurred in 1 patient. The peri-SDH cytotoxic edema pattern is a newly described type of secondary injury and may involve direct toxic effects of the SDH, spreading depolarizations, or other mechanisms.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) induced cerebral edema complicating small chronic subdural hematoma / hygroma / at zewuditu memorial hospital: a case report [^111x9Qqc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Both diabetic ketoacidosis and chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) &/subdural hygroma/ are common medical and surgical problems with significant morbidity & mortality that mandates medical and neurosurgical treatment respectively. Because chronic subdural hematoma is the most common cause of subdural hygroma and might at times be difficult to differentiate one from the other solely on imaging, the term CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ will be used throughout the discussion of this work.

While it is established fact that both diabetic ketoacidosis and CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ can cause tight brain /cerebral edema/ alone, the mechanism how cerebral edema occurs is different. That is, the direct mass effect of the CSDH &/subdural hygroma/ & indirect mass effect from vasogenic edema tend to compress the adjacent sulci, ventricles & basal cisterns and causes cerebral edema if the thickness is significant and it appears to result a proportionate level of brain tightness for the amount of CSDH in majority of cases; while cytotoxic & vasogenic brain edema mechanisms from direct metabolic effects of DKA, water re-distribution effect of DKA & treatment related changes seen in DKA (see Fig. 1) are responsible for cerebral edema from DKA.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) induced cerebral edema complicating small chronic subdural hematoma / hygroma / at zewuditu memorial hospital: a case report [^114CSMyr]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

While both DKA & CSDH/subdural hygroma/ are known to cause significant morbidity and mortality, there is no a study that shows the role & effect of DKA on CSDH/subdural hygroma/ & vice versa to authors' best knowledge; hence this work will show how important relation does exist between DKA & CSDH/ hygroma. This study highlights the diagnostic & management challenges seen for a case of a 44years old female black Ethiopian woman admitted with a diagnosis of newly diagnosed type 1 DM with DKA+small CSDH/subdural hygroma/ after she presented with sever global headache and a 3month history of lost to her work. She needed burrhole & evacuation for complete clinical improvement besides DKA's medical treatment.

Conclusion

DKA induced cerebral edema on the CSDH/subdural hematoma/ can have a role in altering any of the parameters (except the thickness of CSDH) for surgical indication of patients with a diagnosis of both CSDH +DM with DKA. Hence, the treating physicians should be vigilant of different parameters that suggests tight brain &/ cerebral edema (including midline shift, the status of cisterns, fissures & sulci) and should not be deceived of the thickness of the CSDH/subdural hygroma/alone; especially when there is a disproportionately tight brain for the degree of collection. Whether DKA induced cerebral edema causes a subdural hygroma is unknown and needs further study.

Imaging

Non contrast brain CT scan was obtained with possible impression of extra axial collection as she had trivial trauma history as a risk factor for the cause of headache before the commencement of treatment for DKA.

Accordingly, the brain CT showed a bilateral fronto-parietal subdural hypodense extra-axial collection with a maximum thickness of 9.86 mm & 7.65 mm on the right and left side respectively. In addition, there is global effacement of hemispheric sulci, sylvian fissure, basal cisterns & ventricles. The gray white matter differentiation is also poor and the intracranial fosses appear crowded. There is no significant midline shift however (< 3 mm). A likely diagnosis of chronic subdural hematoma with DDX of subdural hygroma was made based on the preoperative imaging (See Fig. 2 for the CT scan of the patient below at different levels of sections in the image from 'a to g').

### Development of a model of hemispheric hypodensity ("Big black brain") [^1146r5og]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common finding after abusive head trauma (AHT). Hemispheric hypodensity (HH) is a radiological indicator of severe brain damage that encompasses multiple vascular territories, and may develop in the hemisphere(s) underlying the SDH. In some instances where the SDH is predominantly unilateral, the widespread damage is unilateral underlying the SDH. To date, no animal model has successfully replicated this pattern of injury. We combined escalating severities of the injuries and insults commonly associated with HH including SDH, impact, mass effect, seizures, apnea, and hypoventilation to create an experimental model of HH in piglets aged 1 week (comparable to human infants) to 1 month (comparable to human toddlers). Unilateral HH evolved over 24h when kainic acid was applied ipsilateral to the SDH to induce seizures. Pathological examination revealed a hypoxic-ischemic injury-type pattern with vasogenic edema through much of the cortical ribbon with relative sparing of deep gray matter. The percentage of the hemisphere that was damaged was greater on the ipsilateral versus contralateral side and was positively correlated with SDH area and estimated seizure duration. Further studies are needed to parse out the pathophysiology of this injury and to determine if multiple injuries and insults act synergistically to induce a metabolic mismatch or if the mechanism of trauma induces severe seizures that drive this distinctive pattern of injury.

### Brain edema after intracerebral hemorrhage: mechanisms, treatment options, management strategies, and operative indications [^113Xsbyv]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with a high mortality rate and severe morbidity. The treatment of choice is still controversial, given that data from several clinical trials have not provided convincing evidence to support the efficacy of surgical clot removal. Favoring early clot removal is evidence that the limited release of specific neurotoxins associated with the breakdown products of hemoglobin underlies secondary brain injury. Attention has therefore shifted to perilesional brain injury, especially brain edema, as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in patients with ICH. In this review the authors address current understanding of the causes of edema formation following ICH and the treatment options, which are mostly supportive in nature.

### A proposed stratification system to address the heterogeneity of subdural hematoma outcome reporting in the literature [^116nHfuS]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Subdural hematomas (SDH) represent one of the most common intracranial mass-lesions associated with high morbidity and mortality. Predominately a disease of the elderly, recent projections indicate 1.5 billion individuals will be over 65 by 2050, with over 80 representing the fastest growing segment of the population in developed countries. Historically, SDHs have been categorized by the blood product age, i.e. acute, subacute, and chronic (Fig. 1). However, the differences that exist between SDH types are not limited to exclusively their radiographic densities, which may have only a small role in the complex pathophysiology pathway from which they develop. The majority of SDHs occur secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Traumatic brain injuries can vary greatly in both their mechanism of injury and severity. Herein arises the challenge in categorizing these varied patients. Despite sharing blood products identified on computed tomography (CT), conventional reporting does not allot any measure towards the magnitude of TBI. Traumatic brain injuries unto themselves are associated with numerous physiologic changes and downstream sequalae with the potential to have devastating neurological outcomes. Although a SDH is often easily recognized on imaging, it still does not adequately represent the underlying injury which may be occurring on a molecular or cellular level. Consequently, an assortment of intracranial pathology is frequently categorized together under a single designation.

Fig. 1
Conventional categorization of subdural hematomas. In this panel of computed tomography coronal images, the three types of subdural hematomas are illustrated using conventional reporting. Figure 1A shows an acute subdural hematoma with a hyperdense appearance relative to brain tissue while a subacute subdural hematoma is isodense (Fig. 1B). A chronic subdural hematoma is hypodense relative brain tissue and similar in appearance to cerebrospinal fluid (Fig. 1C)

A major challenge within the academic literature on SDHs has been inconsistent outcomes reported across studies, most notably for older age groups with acute hemorrhages. Mortality rates have ranged from 40 to 90% for acute SDHs in select populations though more recent reports since 2010 have ranged from 15 to 67.2% for elderly patients. Admittedly, there will always be some variation between studies, but such extreme differences have led to contradictory recommendations in the literature and underscore a greater issue at hand. In this investigation, we sought to elucidate upon the unique subpopulations being combined in the current conventional reporting of SDHs and proposed a stratification system to help standardize and improve reproducibility of future research on this topic.

### How to iGuide: flat panel detector, CT-assisted, minimally invasive evacuation of intracranial hematomas [^112YKcto]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is associated with the highest morality rate among stroke subtypes, approaching 50% at 1 year. Among patients who survive ICH, nearly 80% do not achieve functional independence. Evidence-based acute interventions aim to minimize hemorrhage enlargement and secondary brain injury via specialty medical management in an intensive care or dedicated stroke unit in order to monitor and treat clinical deterioration. Early clinical deterioration typically signals active hematoma expansion, elevated intracranial pressure from mass effect, hydrocephalus, herniation, seizure, or other emergent complications, that warrant swift and targeted treatment.

Hemorrhage stabilization is lifesaving with a clear reduction in morbidity and mortality, and medical treatments include strict blood pressure control and coagulopathy reversal. Although medical management of ICH considerably mitigates hematoma expansion and secondary brain injury, it does not acutely reverse or reduce hematoma volume, perilesional edema, or any related structural, physiologic, or biochemical impacts on brain parenchyma from the hematoma itself. Moreover, large or increasing hematoma volumes portend a worsening prognosis. Procedural hematoma reduction or elimination is thus an appealing companion treatment to medical management, yet clinical benefit has been demonstrated only for surgical treatment of cerebellar hemorrhage (class I, level B evidence) for selective patients (ie, patients with hematoma > 3 cm, obstructive hydrocephalus, and/or clinical deterioration). At this point, there are no proven acute ICH interventions analogous to those for vaso-occlusive acute ischemic stroke.

### Sports-related concussions: diagnosis, complications, and current management strategies [^1166EA9y]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are traumatic events that affect up to 3.8 million athletes per year. The initial diagnosis and management is often instituted on the field of play by coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians. SRCs are usually transient episodes of neurological dysfunction following a traumatic impact, with most symptoms resolving in 7–10 days; however, a small percentage of patients will suffer protracted symptoms for years after the event and may develop chronic neurodegenerative disease. Rarely, SRCs are associated with complications, such as skull fractures, epidural or subdural hematomas, and edema requiring neurosurgical evaluation. Current standards of care are based on a paradigm of rest and gradual return to play, with decisions driven by subjective and objective information gleaned from a detailed history and physical examination. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI, and detailed understanding of the complex pathophysiological process underlying SRCs and how they affect the athletes acutely and long-term, may change the way physicians treat athletes who suffer a concussion. It is hoped that these advances will allow a more accurate assessment of when an athlete is truly safe to return to play, decreasing the risk of secondary impact injuries, and provide avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting the complex biochemical cascade that results from a traumatic injury to the brain.

Abstract

Subdural hematoma (SDH) is the most common finding after abusive head trauma (AHT). Hemispheric hypodensity (HH) is a radiological indicator of severe brain damage that encompasses multiple vascular territories, and may develop in the hemisphere(s) underlying the SDH. In some instances where the SDH is predominantly unilateral, the widespread damage is unilateral underlying the SDH. To date, no animal model has successfully replicated this pattern of injury. We combined escalating severities of the injuries and insults commonly associated with HH including SDH, impact, mass effect, seizures, apnea, and hypoventilation to create an experimental model of HH in piglets aged 1 week (comparable to human infants) to 1 month (comparable to human toddlers). Unilateral HH evolved over 24 h when kainic acid was applied ipsilateral to the SDH to induce seizures. Pathological examination revealed a hypoxic-ischemic injury-type pattern with vasogenic edema through much of the cortical ribbon with relative sparing of deep gray matter. The percentage of the hemisphere that was damaged was greater on the ipsilateral versus contralateral side and was positively correlated with SDH area and estimated seizure duration. Further studies are needed to parse out the pathophysiology of this injury and to determine if multiple injuries and insults act synergistically to induce a metabolic mismatch or if the mechanism of trauma induces severe seizures that drive this distinctive pattern of injury.

### Perihematomal edema is greater in the presence of a spot sign but does not predict intracerebral hematoma expansion [^112SNJtx]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Perihematomal edema volume may be related to intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume at baseline and, consequently, with hematoma expansion. However, the relationship between perihematomal edema and hematoma expansion has not been well established. We aimed to investigate the relationship among baseline perihematomal edema, the computed tomographic angiography spot sign, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcome in patients with acute ICH.

Methods

Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) was a prospective observational cohort study of ICH patients presenting within 6 hours from onset. Patients underwent computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography scans at baseline and 24-hour computed tomography scan. A post hoc analysis of absolute perihematomal edema and relative perihematomal edema (absolute perihematomal edema divided by ICH) volumes was performed on baseline computed tomography scans (n = 353). Primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (> 6 mL or > 33%). Secondary outcomes were early neurological deterioration, 90-day mortality, and poor outcome.

Results

Absolute perihematomal edema volume was higher in spot sign patients (24.5 [11.5–41.8] versus 12.6 [6.9–22] mL; P < 0.001), but it was strongly correlated with ICH volume (ρ = 0.905; P < 0.001). Patients who experienced significant hematoma expansion had higher absolute perihematomal edema volume (18.4 [10–34.6] versus 11.8 [6.5–22] mL; P < 0.001) but similar relative perihematomal edema volume (1.09 [0.89–1.37] versus 1.12 [0.88–1.54]; P = 0.400). Absolute perihematomal edema volume and poorer outcomes were higher by tertiles of ICH volume, and perihematomal edema volume did not independently predict significant hematoma expansion.

Conclusions

Perihematomal edema volume is greater at baseline in the presence of a spot sign. However, it is strongly correlated with ICH volume and does not independently predict hematoma expansion.

### Emergent treatment of athletes with brain injury [^116KEmZj]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

The focus of this article is the early recognition and emergent treatment of severe or catastrophic traumatic brain injury. The pathophysiology and management of mild traumatic brain injury are reviewed extensively in other sections. Classification of head injuries can be based on anatomic location (epidural, subdural, intraparenchymal), mechanism of injury (coup, contrecoup, linear, rotational), distribution (focal or diffuse), and clinical presentation. Severe head injuries include epidural hematoma, subdural hematoma, intracerebral contusion/hemorrhage, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, diffuse axonal injury, and malignant brain edema syndrome, either alone or in combinations. Protective equipment, regulations, and athletic training have improved dramatically as a result of the recognition of potentially devastating neurological injuries from competitive play. Physicians and other healthcare professionals have become integral members of organized sport and must advocate for the players' best interest. Once a neurological injury has been identified on field, it is imperative that prompt management and prevention of secondary injury occur. The goal of this article is to help provide a clear plan of action that is well thought out and rehearsed and that will lead to improved outcomes for the players, particularly those with severe or catastrophic brain injury.

Discussion

Generally, cerebral edema though more common in children, it is also reported to occur in young adults like ours and carries a mortality rate of 21–25%. The risk of cerebral edema is related to the severity and duration of DKA. It is often associated with ongoing hyponatremia. Cerebral edema is correlated with the administration of bicarbonate. Concerns about the role of overaggressive or overly hypotonic fluid resuscitation as a cause of the edema that have been raised in the past correlate more closely with disease severity than with rapid administration of fluids. Accordingly, patients with fluid refractory shock and azotemia at admission had higher odds for development of cerebral edema. That our patient has a protracted symptomatology might contribute for the DKA induced cerebral edema.

Unique to our patient, in contrast to other case reports with cerebral edema in DKA patients, is the presence of CSDH/subdural hygroma/. Even though the tight brain seen in our patient can partly be attributable to the direct mass effect of CSDH/subdural hygroma/, the degree of brain tightness and cerebral edema is so disproportionate for the degree of the extra-axial collection she had; and hence, DKA induced cerebral edema must have a role in partly contributing the brain disproportionately tight. Similarly, while the trivial trauma could have caused the CSDH/subdural hygroma/ in our patient, it is unknown whether or not the DKA induced cerebral edema caused it.

So, it can be concluded that, as diabetes by itself independently increases the incidence of CSDH compared to non-diabetics by a factor of 1.57, diabetes and its complication DKA portends a higher risk of mortality because of the added mass effect of DKA induced cerebral edema on the CSDH/subdural hematoma/. Hence, whether surgical intervention is needed for CSDH/subdural hygroma/ or not is a function of the thickness, midline shift, the status of cisterns, fissures & sulci, it is worth full to underscore the possible existence of DKA induced cerebral edema & its role in altering any of the parameters (except the thickness) for surgical indication of patients with a diagnosis of both CSDH +DM with DKA. A lower threshold for surgical intervention might be needed in that case though more study is needed. While this work is written after prospectively by the managing clinicians, its clinical summary is reliable and described as strength; its limitation being the case is only one.

Conclusion

If ASDH develops to CSDH, treatment is necessary earlier due to increase in volume and midline shift. Patients with larger ASDH volume tend to be treated even earlier. Therefore, close monitoring of these patients is crucial since sudden clinical deterioration even with DOC is not uncommon in this type of SDH.

### Working toward rational and evidence-based treatment of chronic subdural hematoma [^113pjSZH]. Clinical Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most common neurosurgical conditions that can usually be treated with relatively simple and effective surgical procedures. It affects primarily the elderly, a rising population worldwide. Together with improved awareness among the medical profession and greater access to modern imaging facilities, the incidence of CSDH is set to rise significantly. Maximization of the efficiency of management of CSDH is therefore a priority. To this end, a review of the findings of clinical and laboratory research underpinning the basis of the modern management of CSDH has been carried out. This review focuses on the pathophysiology and briefly discusses the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and surgical treatments of CSDH, concluding that a one-for-all management strategy is not appropriate. Creating rational bases for the selection of an ideal treatment strategy for an individual patient should be the target. This can be achieved through better understanding of the nature of the condition through systematic basic science research, ascertaining the merits of different surgical techniques in well-designed and rigorously executed clinical trials, using advances in imaging techniques to classify CSDH (a subject not addressed here), and training in and ongoing refinement of clinical acumen and surgical skills of individual surgeons.

### Peak edema extension distance: an edema measure independent from hematoma volume associated with functional outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage [^113MxKUE]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Edema evolution, particularly perihemorrhagic edema (PHE), following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is complex and still incompletely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory mechanisms contribute to ICH-induced secondary brain injury, which is mainly characterized by an immediate release of inflammatory mediators after ICH onset. This inflammatory activation conducted by leukocytes, macrophages, microglia, and astrocytes is sustained for several days. Pivotal pathophysiological roles refer to activated macrophages and microglia contributing to blood–brain barrier injury, edema evolution, and cell death in ICH.

In ICH, PHE develops rapidly and increases over several days reaching its maximum within 2 weeks. PHE evolution is linked to unfavorable functional outcome. PHE serves as a key radiological surrogate for secondary injury and inflammation following ICH using noncontrast computed tomography (CT). Because absolute ICH and PHE volumes are closely correlated, changes in hematoma volume involve subsequent changes in PHE volume. In clinical ICH, hematoma volume itself is highly variable, therefore absolute PHE volume respectively. This severely impairs the analysis of properties other than hematoma volume associated with edema evolution and thus may require large sample sizes to demonstrate possible treatment effects on edema evolution in clinical trials. To address this issue, a novel PHE measure, the edema extension distance (EED), has been described. So far, no association with hematoma volume could be found in acute settings up to 72 h after onset, and data beyond 72 h are not available. Understanding the baseline determinants of EED, e.g. underlying inflammatory mechanisms and its association with clinical outcomes beyond 72 h, is required to establish the utility of EED in ICH clinical trials. In this study, we assessed pathophysiological and outcome-related properties of long-term (> 72 h) EED evolution.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Acute cardiovascular complications related to COVID-19 infection — hemorrhagic and cerebral venous events are defined as follows for data capture: Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves "rapidly developing signs of neurological dysfunction or headache because of bleeding into the subarachnoid space (the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater of the brain or spinal cord), which is not caused by trauma". Epidural hemorrhage is "intracranial hemorrhage into the epidural space", and subdural hemorrhage is "bleeding between the dura mater and the brain, usually secondary to a tear of the bridging vein". Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is "stroke because of thrombosis of a cerebral venous structure", with the note that "symptoms or signs caused by reversible edema without infarction or hemorrhage do not qualify as stroke" and that common sites include "the dural sinuses, the cavernous sinus, and deep sinuses of the cortex". Stroke not otherwise specified is "an episode of acute neurological dysfunction presumed to be caused by ischemia or hemorrhage, persisting > 24 h or until death but without sufficient evidence to be classified as one of the above".

### Intracranial pressure monitoring and management in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^115y1QjT]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of Elevated ICP

The most common cause of HICP is hydrocephalus, reported in 30% of patients, either communicating or obstructive, followed by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and the development of global cerebral edema (GCE), either early (8%) or delayed (10–12%). Less common causes are subdural hematoma (5%), cerebral infarction (2–3%), and extracranial causes.

According to pathophysiology, elevated ICP in SAH can present acutely (within 24 h), subacutely (up to 7–10 days), or in a delayed manner. Its development independently predicts poor functional outcomes and increased mortality.

The initial rise is linked to aneurysmal bleeding. The sudden release of blood in the subarachnoid space during hemorrhage onset can lead to a rapid increase in ICP, potentially reaching the mean arterial pressure, causing a transient cerebral circulatory arrest, and resulting in loss of consciousness. As such, loss of consciousness at onset is considered a surrogate for cerebral hypoperfusion and is associated with an increased risk of developing early cytotoxic GCE and, consequently, a worse prognosis. Possible additional contributors to early GCE are vasomotor paralysis and a rise in cerebral blood volume. The reported incidence of early GCE varies across studies, between 8 and 67% of patients. Furthermore, early ICP rise can be caused by obstructive or communicating acute hydrocephalus. Most poor-grade or comatose patients will eventually develop hydrocephalus due to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) blockage.

After 3–4 days post-SAH, the ICP starts normalizing, possibly because of decreasing subarachnoid blood levels, improved CSF dynamics, or reduced brain edema. Prolonged HICP in this context has been independently correlated with the amount of blood on computed tomography scans, rebleeding, early ischemic lesions, and poor neurological status. Subacute or early persistent cerebral edema contributing to HICP seems to be related to the degree of early ischemic injury and cerebral hypoperfusion, with subsequent ion channel dysfunction and resultant cellular swelling.

Later in the course of the disease, HICP has been associated with the persistence of hydrocephalus, the mass effect caused by ICH or edema, either cytotoxic (caused by delayed cerebral ischemia aggravated by cerebral metabolic crisis, cortical spreading depolarizations, and seizures) or vasogenic (due to various degree of blood–brain barrier disruption, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, or altered cerebral autoregulation with cerebral hyperemia).

### State of the art in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis animal models [^115VR1q6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is an uncommon venous thromboembolic event accounting for less than 1% of strokes resulting in brain parenchymal injuries. Diagnosis and prognosis are still challenging due to highly variable clinical course and etiologies. Beyond thrombosis, different CVST‐related parenchymal injuries may occur and include edema, ischemic strokes, and intra‐cerebral hemorrhage (ICH; i.e. parenchymal/subdural hematomas, and subarachnoid hemorrhages), which are identified in 40%–60% of patients without clearly identified mechanisms. In this perspective, experimental animal models contribute to the understanding of initiation, propagation, and resolution of thrombosis, as well as brain‐related damages. Last but not least, animal models may be useful to study new therapeutic approaches. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of CVST experimental models, focusing on their strengths, limits, and contribution to the current knowledge.

### Pathogenesis of chronic subdural hematoma: a cohort evidencing De novo and transformational origins [^1161w5Aw]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is a common neurosurgical pathology, yet conflicting opinions exist concerning the pathophysiological processes involved. Many consider CSDH a product of an aged acute subdural hematoma (ASDH) secondary to trauma. Serial imaging, however, has demonstrated CSDH formation in patients without any initial ASDH. To understand the relevance of acute hemorrhage in a cohort of patients with CSDH, transformation from an ASDH were categorized as CSDH-acute transformed (CSDH-AT) and those without any acute hemorrhage at the outset as CSDH- de-novo (CSDH-DN). A cohort of 41 eligible patients with CSDH were included, with baseline imaging after trauma (or spontaneous ASDH) available for assessment of acute hemorrhage. Volumetric analysis of all subdural collections and measurements of baseline atrophy were performed. In 37% of cases, there was an ASDH present on baseline imaging (CSDH-AT), whereas 63% had no acute hemorrhage at baseline (CSDH-DN). The CSDH-ATs developed more rapidly (mean 16 days from baseline to diagnosis) and were smaller in volume than the CSDH-DNs, which developed at a mean delay of 57 days. In 54% of the CSDH-DNs, a subdural hygroma was present on baseline imaging, and there was a wide range of baseline cerebral atrophy. This study provides radiological evidence for two distinct pathways in the formation of CSDH, with CSDH-DN occurring more commonly and often involving subdural hygroma. Further work is needed to understand whether the pathological origin has implications for patient outcome.

Subdural effusion is a common complication after decompressive craniectomy for traumatic brain injury. While many cases are asymptomatic and resolve with conservative management, some patients develop significant mass effect, leading to elevated intracranial pressure, midline shift, and clinical worsening, which may require surgery. Current treatment strategies vary widely, with no established consensus. This paper reviews the pathogenesis, diagnosis, classification, and management of subdural effusion to guide clinical decision-making and improve outcomes following decompressive craniectomy.

### Surgery for spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haemorrhage [^116GgkM1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

How the intervention might work

ICH causes direct injury to the brain due to the immediate mechanical effects of the haemorrhage on the brain parenchyma. Furthermore, the resulting haematoma can exert a mass effect on the brain that leads to compression of the surrounding brain tissue, increased intracranial pressure, and, if severe, brain herniation. In about one‐third of ICH cases, the haematoma expands within the first day, causing additional mass effect and neurological deterioration, with the highest probability of haematoma growth within the first three hours after symptom onset. The presence of intraparenchymal blood activates the immune system to remove the blood and damaged tissue. This local inflammatory response and the release of neurotoxic clot components are thought to harm the adjacent viable brain parenchyma, resulting in 'secondary brain injury'. Secondary injury results in the formation of perihaematomal oedema, which, in turn, augments the harmful mass effect of the ICH.

Haematoma volume and haematoma expansion are independent predictors of ICH outcome. Therefore, early surgical removal of the haematoma may have therapeutic potential. Moreover, early evacuation might reduce the cascade of secondary brain injury and perihaematomal oedema formation elicited by the intraparenchymal blood. An individual patient data meta‐analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that had been published by 2010 suggested that patient age, GCS on admission, ICH volume, and the timing of surgery are factors that may influence the effect of haematoma evacuation. In addition to surgical removal of the haematoma, alleviation of increased intracranial pressure — and thereby reduction of intracranial pressure‐associated damage — via decompressive craniectomy might also work as a therapeutic strategy for spontaneous ICH.

Neurosurgical intervention has risks; therefore, the potential benefits of surgery could be compromised to some extent by perioperative complications and surgically induced brain injury. Potential perioperative complications include the risks of general anaesthesia, persistent or recurrent intracranial haemorrhage, seizures, intracranial infection, surgical site infection, and neurological deficits related to the area of surgery. In addition to these general complications of intracranial surgery, decompressive craniectomy is associated with additional complications, such as syndrome of the trephined and complications caused by disturbed cerebrospinal fluid flow, including hydrocephalus and subdural hygroma.

### Subgaleal shunting: a 20-year experience [^111JJmYm]. Neurosurgical Focus (2000). Low credibility.

Object

The authors undertook a retrospective study to evaluate the effectiveness of diverting intracranial fluid into the subgaleal space for temporary absorption by the membranes of the scalp.

Methods

Eighty-one patients were treated over a 20-year period. There were 22 cases of hypertensive hydrocephalus, 52 cases of acute head trauma, and seven cases of chronic subdural hematoma. The simple surgical technique is described. Subgaleal shunting provided effective short-term treatment of hydrocephalus and increased intracranial pressure, which was monitored directly in 22 cases of cerebral contusion and edema.

Conclusions

The closed method for drainage of cerebrospinal fluid avoids the complications of open ventriculostomy or open drainage of the subdural space.

### Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces and subdural collections-when to evaluate for abuse [^111bwk9m]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Description of studies providing the prevalence of subdural collections in children with benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space (BESS) (n = 14) and summarising the presence and results of investigations for concomitant injuries/abuse in children with subdural hematomas/collections and features of BESS (n = 17)

MDT multidisciplinary meeting, n/a not applicable, N number of patients, n number of studies, RH retinal haemorrhages, SD subdural collections

In infants with macrocephaly and subdural collections, the possibility of abusive injury may be supported by the presence of concomitant suspicious injuries in various organs and sites: co-existing parenchymal injuries or cytotoxic oedema, bridging vein thrombosis/rupture, subdural collections in different locations (around right frontal lobe, around left frontal lobe, convexity, interhemispheric fissure, posterior fossa), spinal injuries (including ligamentous injuries and subdural spinal haematomas), unexplained fractures, especially classic metaphyseal lesions (CMLs), rib and skull fractures. Skin, oral and genital stigmata are extremely important to identify, strongly supporting the hypothesis of abuse in the absence of any additional finding in a child with BESS and subdural collection(s). A relevant social history disclosing factors and conditions that might place a child at risk for maltreatment and a previous history of unexplained or frequent trauma to the same patient or household members, a delay in seeking help and a changing history are also red flags for physical abuse. Apnoea, loss of consciousness, and death, to our knowledge, have not been described in infants with BESS, as opposed to infants with abusive head trauma. Indeed, the hypothesis of subdural collection in the setting of BESS does not provide explanations for the presence of the concomitant injuries described above.

On the other hand, the presence of a homogeneous subdural collection, without clots over the vertex in particular, with continuous bridging veins in a macrocephalic asymptomatic infant with large subarachnoid spaces, with the expected head growth curve and lack of the aforementioned concomitant suspicious injuries on craniocerebral structures, bones (including vertebrae), skin/soft tissues, fundus, etc. favours the hypothesis of BESS associated with incidental subdural collections.

### Emergency medical management of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1126xpA8]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Currently, no treatment exists for early brain injury other than treatment of acute hydrocephalus and evacuation of an intracerebral or subdural hematoma to reduce intracranial pressure. Because cerebral edema is a common feature in patients with early brain injury, it may be tempting to consider treatment with steroids. Although the effect of steroids has been studied in a few small trials in patients with aSAH, the results were conflicting and steroid treatment was not focused on diminishing early cerebral edema but rather on the prevention or treatment of DCI or hyponatremia. In conclusion, there is currently no evidence that treatment with steroids decreases the severity of early brain injury or improves functional or cognitive outcome after aSAH. The ongoing Fight INflammation to Improve outcome after aneurysmal Subarachnoid HEmorRhage (FINISHER)`trial aims to investigate whether treatment with dexamethasone as anti-inflammatory agent improves outcome after aSAH (144 of the intended 334 patients included on March 23, 2023). Another way to combat high intracranial pressure is hemicraniectomy. The PrImary decompressive Craniectomy in AneurySmal Subarachnoid hemOrrhage (PICASSO) trial investigates whether primary decompressive craniectomy performed within 24 h in addition to best medical treatment in patients with poor-grade SAH reduces case fatality and severe disability compared with best medical treatment alone and secondary craniectomy as a therapy of last resort for elevated intracranial pressure (58 of the intended 216 patients included on March 23, 2023). We see little value in intracranial pressure monitoring if evidence-based therapies that improve outcome by decreasing intracranial pressure from cerebral edema are lacking.

Rebleeding of the Ruptured Aneurysm

A recently ruptured aneurysm has a 40% risk of rebleeding in the first 6 weeks after ictus, and rebleeding substantially increases the risk of poor outcome. Although most instances of rebleeding occur within 24 h after ictus, available studies do not support that aneurysm treatment < 24 h results in better outcomes compared with treatment 24–72 h after the bleeding. It has been hypothesized that the reduced risk of rebleeding in patients treated within 24 h is offset by an increased risk of cerebral ischemia. In addition, because most instances of early rebleeding occur within the first hours after the initial bleeding, it is difficult from a logistical point of view to prevent aneurysmal rebleeding before that time by endovascular or neurosurgical aneurysm treatment. Therefore, medical (noninvasive) treatments to prevent aneurysm rebleeding are attractive. Below, we will discuss the effect of antifibrinolytic drugs and blood pressure control on rebleeding and functional outcome.

### Imaging of nontraumatic neuroradiology emergencies [^112bjrEk]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Imaging of acute neurologic disease in the emergency department can be challenging because of the wide range of possible causes and the overlapping imaging appearance of many of these entities on nonenhanced computed tomography (CT). The key to formulating a succinct, pertinent differential diagnosis includes characterizing the pattern of abnormalities on CT and identifying key features that suggest a particular diagnosis. This article divides neurologic emergencies into 5 scenarios based on the CT findings, including subarachnoid hemorrhage, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, vasogenic edema without and with underlying mass lesion, and acute hydrocephalus. Specific common or important diagnoses in each category are discussed.

### Subdural hematoma in term infants [^115MvY7f]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Subdural hematomas are uncommon in term infants. The study objectives were to evaluate risk factors for and clinical significance of small subdural hematomas observed on computerized tomography. During a 3-year period, 26 near-term and term nonasphyxiated infants were found to have a subdural hematoma on computed tomography. Clinical indications for computed tomography were respiratory symptoms in 15 infants and neurologic symptoms in 10 infants; one infant had a skull fracture. Subdural hematomas were less than 3-mm maximum transverse dimensions in all infants: location was infratentorial (n = 7), supratentorial (n = 7), and in both sites (n = 12). Four infants also had evidence of edema and hemorrhage within the anterior temporal lobe. Delivery was vaginal in 25 of 26 infants, and forceps were used in 13 (50%) infants. Twenty-five infants were managed expectantly; one infant underwent surgical elevation of a depressed skull fracture. No infant required surgical evacuation of the subdural hematoma. At discharge, nine infants with subdural hematoma exhibited an abnormal examination, i.e., mild hypotonia (n = 7) and Erb's palsy (n = 2). The clinical syndrome attributed to subdural hematoma was most often a subtle clinical problem. The presence of subdural hematoma documented by computed tomography is not necessarily always indicative of birth trauma and may occur as sequelae of an otherwise uncomplicated delivery.

Treatment

Since our patient had both medical and neurosurgical problem, multidisciplinary team was involved it her management. Accordingly, both medical & neurosurgical treatment was given by the respective team of physicians.

Medical management

Accordingly, the fluid deficit, potassium deficit and the hyperglycemia was corrected using normal saline, potassium replacement and regular insulin administration as per diabetic keto-acidosis management protocol. Patient then followed with an hourly basis of RBS and ketone urine with clinical response of the patient. The patient became ketone free after 6 h of management with the level of hyperglycemia reduced to 250–300 mg/dl. Despite our patient had metabolic response, her headache persisted and didn't improve with the medical management.

Surgical management

Once the patient was stabilized metabolically &/medically, neurosurgical intervention was decided to be made as the patient has tight brain which is disproportionate for the thickness of the extra-axial collection as detailed in the CT finding.

Written informed consent was obtained for her to undergo surgery and for her case summary can be published for educational purpose. Patient was then taken to the operating room and positioned supine. Patient put on intranasal oxygen, and sedation with both pethidine and diazepam achieved. Then hair was shaved and local anesthesia using 2% lidocaine administered at the surgical site. Surgical field cleaned with alcohol first which then painted with providone iodine. Proper prepping and draping then done. A 3 cm sized skin incision at the epicenter (maximal thickness) of the extra-axial collection done; which is at the coronal suture and 5 cm off of midline and burr hole was made using manual bur. Bone dust thoroughly irrigated. Dural vessels cauterized with bipolar cautery forceps and dura opened in a cruciate fashion on the right side first and left side then after. Dural lips opened in a cruciate fashion tucked up with a bipolar cautery. Upon opening the dura a xanthocromic CSF appearing fluid come out with moderate pressure bilaterally (more on right). There was no characteristic dark motor oil appearing hemolyzed blood expected to be seen in CSDH. Copious irrigation with saline done; after which subdural drain left bilaterally and skin closed in a locking fashion bilaterally. Meticulous hemostasis secured with bipolar cautery in each step of the procedure. Patient transferred with stable vital signs to post anesthesia recovery unit and final postoperative diagnosis of Type 1 DM with DKA + Subdural hygroma likely from CSDH + DKA induced cerebral edema was made.

### Paradigms in chronic subdural hematoma pathophysiology: current treatments and new directions [^116vDXNp]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) are an increasingly common pathology encountered in a neurosurgical trauma practice. Although the operative and nonoperative management of CSDH has been studied extensively, the recurrence rate of CSDH remains high, with no significant decrease in recent years. We undertook a detailed assessment of the known pathophysiological mechanisms by which CSDHs recur to improve our ability to treat patients with this disease successfully. In this review of the literature from the PubMed and Scopus databases, we used the search terms "(pathophysiology) AND chronic subdural hematoma [tiab]" to identify pertinent reviews and articles in English. The results demonstrated a complex inflammatory response to subdural blood, which begins with the formation of a collagen neomembrane around the clot itself. Proinflammatory mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tissue necrosis factor α, matrix metalloproteinases, and basic fibroblast growth factor, then contribute to chronic microbleeding by promoting the formation of fragile, leaky blood vessels, and widening of gap junctions of existing vessels. It is evident that the lack of improvement in recurrence rate is due to pathological factors that are not entirely alleviated by simple subdural evacuation. Targeted approaches, such as middle meningeal artery embolization and anti-inflammatory therapies, have become increasingly common and require further prospective analysis to aid in the determination of their efficacy.

### Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever with acute subdural hematoma, Mauritania, 2012 [^114CJpXj]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Alavi-Naini et al. reported a case of CCHF in a person with a bilateral frontal parasagittal hematoma that was managed with oral ribavirin and intravenous ceftriaxone, platelet transfusions, and supportive therapy. The patient recovered. Kumar et al. reported 5 case-patients with dengue hemorrhagic fever and intracranial bleeding. Two of these patients underwent surgery after platelet transfusion and recovered. A high case-fatality rate has been reported in many countries among persons who became infected with CCHF after having contact with a hospitalized CCHF patient. Swanepoel et al. reported a case of CCHF in which the patient died of complications following surgical intervention for cerebral hemorrhage.

Death from CCHF usually occurs after 5–14 days of illness. The basic pathogenesis of CCHF virus at the molecular level is complex and not well defined. Endothelial cells, immune response, virus load, and coagulation cascade play major roles in the disease pathogenesis. Blood and endothelium appear to be the target tissues of the disease. The coagulation cascade becomes activated over 24–48 hours; however, thrombin becomes activated and promotes edema formation and further disruption of the integrity of the blood–brain barrier. The edema formation starts when erythrocytes in the hematoma begin to lyse and its degradation products are deposited into the brain parenchyma, initiating a potent inflammatory reaction.

Although surgery remains the first choice for the treatment of acute subdural hematoma, some patients may benefit from conservative management with careful monitoring. This report highlights the value of an early diagnosis of CCHF and neuroimaging for severe cases when brain hemorrhage is suspected.

### Survival trends after surgery for acute subdural hematoma in adults over a 20-year period [^111nxfah]. Annals of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Trauma is the most common cause of death for those under the age of 45. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains the cause of approximately half of the deaths secondary to trauma. One of the important early sequelae of TBI is the development of intracranial hematomas. These can be extradural, subdural, intraparenchymal, or a combination thereof. It has long been recognized that acute subdural hematomas (ASDHs) are often associated with intraparenchymal injuries and brain swelling. Hence, outcomes have historically been worse for patients with ASDH with mortality rates as high as 68%.

Temporal evidence from the 1990s suggested that outcome following head injury had failed to improve to the same degree as other trauma. – As a result, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) introduced guidelines for the management of head injury in 2003, subsequently revised in January 2014 (NICE CG176). Indeed, a study presenting data from 2003 to 2009 identified a reduction in the odds of death following head injury. There was, however, no specific analysis performed for ASDH, the focus of this study. Research utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample in the USA identified an improvement in traumatic subdural hematoma mortality from 16.4% in 1996 to 11.6% in 2006. However, the authors did not to distinguish acute vs chronic subdural hematomas, as it was based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD)-9 codes. As the pathophysiology, patient populations, management strategies, and outcomes differ significantly between acute and chronic subdural hematomas, the findings of this study cannot be extrapolated to ASDH.

Previous retrospective cohort studies have found age, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Scale (ISS), and pupil reactivity as independent prognostic factors. – Following research from the 1980s investigating the effect of time to surgery on outcome after ASDH, and studies supporting this finding thereafter, it has been advised that " life-saving decompressive surgery must be available within four hours". However, more recent studies have challenged this conclusion.–

The aim of this study therefore was to identify trends in survival for surgical management of ASDH across England and Wales, leveraging multiple logistic regression analysis to control for case mix changes over the last 20 years. Through this, we also sought to identify prognostic factors relating to outcome in ASDH and examine the relationship between time interval from injury to craniotomy and survival.

### Peak edema extension distance: an edema measure independent from hematoma volume associated with functional outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage [^111VD4TJ]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In line with published data limited to early edema evolution < 72 h, we could confirm that peak EED is largely independent of hematoma volume. This may represent an important property of EED compared to absolute edema volume, which is strongly associated with hematoma volume. Compared with absolute PHE volume, Parry-Jones et al. could already confirm that smaller cohorts may be sufficient to show both therapeutic and pathophysiological edema-dependent associations using EED as edema measure because the hematoma dependent interaction is mostly negligible. Thus, this particular approach to employ peak EED as a preferred PHE measure may permit an earlier selection of promising treatments in smaller cohorts to thereby push new findings from bench to bedside.

Inflammatory processes start within hours after ICH onset and sustain over several days with edema as an important pathophysiological component of this inflammatory response to ICH. Natural history studies report peak edema volumes between week 2 and 3, which emphasizes the dynamic character of edema evolution and the need for imaging data beyond 72 h as provided by this data set. Surrogate markers to assess the efficacy of potential anti-inflammatory treatment approaches remain to be established, while edema seems to be a promising candidate. In our cohort, we found associations of especially early systemic inflammatory measures up to day 3 after onset with peak EED. Accordingly, one may speculate that the early inflammatory response may also contribute to edema evolution at later time points. Thus, peak EED (as a hematoma-independent and yet outcome-associated edema measure) may represent such a valuable marker to precisely assess edema-related associations with inflammatory processes as well as the efficacy of anti-inflammatory treatments. Promising anti-inflammatory candidates are, e.g. siponimod or fingolimod. However, efficacy of those treatments remains to be elucidated in randomized controlled trials.

Thoracolumbar spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indications and utility — Isolated unstable ligamentous injury in the absence of fractures is rare in the thoracolumbar spine, and screening the thoracolumbar spine with MRI for detecting ligamentous disruption is not indicated when the CT scan is normal; however, symptoms or signs of spinal cord, conus medularis, or nerve root injury indicate the need for imaging the thoracolumbar spine and spinal cord with MRI. MRI is a valuable tool for assessing known or possible unstable vertebral injury, aiding evaluation of ligament integrity to determine spinal stability and contributing to imaging of the spinal cord for transection, contusion, edema, or hematoma, with cord compression by bone fragments, disc herniation, and epidural or subdural hematomas also demonstrated.

Data Collection

The following information was retrieved from the database: patient age (in years, categorized as < 2, ≥ 2 and < 6, ≥ 6 and < 12, and ≥ 12), sex, GCS, emergency level of the HCT request (categorized as extreme, usual, and organizational [ie, that can be delayed compared with other emergencies, but need to be performed to decide whether the patients can be discharged]), need for contrast media, and primary conclusion (categorized as normal, abnormal unrelated to trauma, abnormal related to trauma). The form for HCT request is available in eAppendix in Supplement 1.

We filtered the radiological reports labeled as abnormal related to trauma in the database and extracted their results and conclusion. Four senior radiologists with expertise in pediatric radiology (A. A. and S.R. 1 year; A.D. 7 years; and G.G. 15 years) reviewed the database and the radiological reports (including the Results and Conclusion sections in a free text format) to encode the abnormal findings related to trauma described by the on-call radiologists as follows: presence of any ICH, extradural hematoma (EDH), subdural hematoma (SDH), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), petechiae, intraparenchymal hematoma (IPH), and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), as well as their location and the number of distinct types of ICH. They reported the presence of fractures, classified as facial bones, skull vault, skull base, suture disjunction or upper cervical spine (UCS), their location, association with ICH (same or opposite size), and the number of distinct fracture types. Radiologists reported the presence of pneumocephalus, subfalcine, temporal and central herniations, cerebral edema, hydrocephalus, and diffuse axonal lesions (DAL). All the aforementioned fractures and intra-cranial lesions defined TBIs in this study. Lastly, they reported extracranial hematoma (ECH; ie, cephalhematoma and soft tissue swelling). The 4 senior pediatric radiologists had full access to the HCT images to verify the findings described in the reports in case of ambiguities.

### Impact of surgical timing on chronic subdural hematoma outcomes: novel insights from a multicenter study [^114eYbZT]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic Subdural Hematoma (CSDH) is one of the most commonly encountered conditions in the neurosurgical practice with an overall incidence of 1.72 to 20.6 per 100,000 people per year peaking in the elderly population. To date, there is still uncertainty regarding the exact pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CSDH, and multiple theories have been proposed. The clinical presentation at onset is often heterogeneous and covers a wide spectrum of possible neurological symptoms, largely depending on intrinsic characteristics of hematoma such as volume, location, and mass effect. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Markwalder's Neurological Grading Score (MGS) are standardized prognostic tools routinely used to assess consciousness impairment and the severity of neurological symptoms in patients with CSDH, respectively.

Over the past decades, several risk factors have been found to play a role in the pathogenesis of CSDH. History of previous head trauma has been identified in 50–77% of patients with newly diagnosed CSDH. Other reported risk factors include anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, male sex, exposure to high altitudes, craniocerebral disproportion, and cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The management of CSDH depends mainly on the severity of neurological symptoms and radiological characteristics of the hematoma, with surgical intervention indicated mostly for symptomatic cases and/or hematoma with thickness > 10 mm or midline shift > 7 mm. Medical treatment with dexamethasone might be an option in selected cases when upfront surgery is not indicated, although it is associated with a higher complications rate and greater likelihood of delayed surgery.

To date, the role of timing in CSDH surgery in mildly symptomatic patients remains uncertain and data regarding its potential relationships with postoperative clinical outcomes are limited. On this basis, the primary aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic role of surgical timing in patients with CSDH, proposing a timing cut-off potentially associated with favorable postoperative neurological outcomes after surgical treatment.

A 66-year-old patient fell three meters off a ladder on his stomach and was unable to move his lower limbs. A sagittal T2WI from an MRI scan revealed a spinal cord injury (arrow) caused by a burst fracture of Th12 (asterisk). Anteriorly to the spinal cord is a hyperintense spinal hematoma (arrowhead) visible in the subdural space (a). On sagittal T1WI, the subdural hematoma (arrowhead) appears hyperintense compared to the spinal cord (arrow). The burst fracture is shown as a low-intensity area on T1WI representing multiple fracture lines and oedema across the vertebral body (asterisk) (b). On transverse T2WI, the subdural hematoma (arrowhead) is contained within the dural sac and pressed against the spinal cord (arrow) (c). On transverse T1WI, the subdural hematoma (arrowhead) shows a higher intensity compared to the posteriorly located spinal cord (arrow) (d). MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, Th12 = twelfth thoracic vertebra

The median craniocaudal extent of hematomas was 7 cm (IQR 3,6–15), median thickness 0.5 cm (IQR 0.5–0.7), and median width 2.1 cm (IQR 1.8–2.4). The distribution and extent of spinal SEHs and SSHs in relation to fractures are displayed in Fig. 4.

### Tranexamic acid to prevent opeRation in chronic subdural hematoma (TORCH) [^117XhL2H]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

In five small retrospective series, tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic drug, showed a beneficial effect on the spontaneous resolution of the hematoma and, with that, the necessity for surgery. This randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial aims to prove the efficacy of TXA. The original small, and often asymptomatic, haemorrhage is caused by rupture of a bridging vein after, often minor, head trauma. Due to generalized cerebral atrophy, increased venous fragility, and the more frequent use of anticoagulation therapy, older people are more at risk of developing a cSDH. During several weeks, the original hematoma is encapsulated by a membrane consisting of weak neocapillaries from where recurrent small bleedings occur. The pathophysiological mechanism is thought to be a problem in the local haemostasis due to fibrin degradation products of the original small hematoma that inhibit further haemostasis in the subdural space.

Together with an osmotic draw of water, owing to its high protein content, this results in growth of the hematoma. Therefore, it usually takes several weeks for the cSDH to grow and become symptomatic. Treatment Treatment options are conservative and surgical. Conservative treatment currently consists of a wait-and-scan policy in which the patient is regularly monitored for neurological deterioration and growth of the hematoma on follow-up imaging. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy is discontinued in low-risk patients, based on individual risk-benefit assessment and the discretion of the treating physician. If the clinical condition of the patient worsens, the indication for surgical evacuation of the hematoma is re-evaluated. In the first retrospective series, a total of 21 patients were treated with TXA, of whom three after primary burr hole surgery. In none of these 21 patients, additional surgery was necessary.

The second, a prospective pilot study in 14 patients, showed a 41% reduction of cSDH after surgery, and an additional 91% residual volume reduction on CT after 90 days, during oral TXA treatment of 650 mg per day, for a mean duration of 90 days, without recurrence, re-expansion, or any complicating venous thromboembolisms.

5.4 Bleeding

In the placebo-controlled clinical trials, serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% of patients taking Adempas compared to 0% of placebo patients. Serious hemoptysis occurred in 5 (1%) patients taking Adempas compared to 0 placebo patients, including one event with fatal outcome. Serious hemorrhagic events also included 2 patients with vaginal hemorrhage, 2 with catheter site hemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural hematoma, hematemesis, and intra-abdominal hemorrhage.

5.5 Pulmonary Veno-Occlusive Disease

Pulmonary vasodilators may significantly worsen the cardiovascular status of patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). Therefore, administration of Adempas to such patients is not recommended. Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, the possibility of associated PVOD should be considered and, if confirmed, discontinue treatment with Adempas.

### Antithrombotic drugs and risk of subdural hematoma… [^1118Ga1d]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

However, epidemiological data on the association of antithrombotic drug use with subdural hematoma risk are limited, particularly with regard to antiplatelet drug use6 and use of a direct oral anticoagulant, and in relation to more aggressive regimens of multiple antithrombotic drugs, which are increasingly common. 7 The purpose of this study was to provide updated estimates of subdural hematoma risk associated with antithrombotic drug use and to explore recent trends in antithrombotic drug use in relation to subdural hematoma occurrence. Using the regional data, the association of antithrombotic drug use with subdural hematoma stratified by type of subdural hematoma and head trauma history was assessed. Using cases only, the association between use of a VKA or use of low-dose aspirin and imaging characteristics, surgical treatment, and 30-day mortality, stratified by subdural hematoma type was studied.

Analyses limited to 650 cases with trauma of known severity showed that current use of antithrombotic drugs was associated with subdural hematoma in the low to moderate trauma severity group. With the exception of low-dose aspirin combined with dipyridamole, which was associated with a risk similar to low-dose aspirin monotherapy, concomitant use of more than 1 antithrombotic drug was related to substantially higher subdural hematoma risk, which was particularly marked for combined treatment of clopidogrel with a VKA. Antithrombotic drug use was found to be associated with higher relative risks of subdural hematoma in women than in men, and fatal subdural hematoma was more strongly associated with antithrombotic drug use than nonfatal subdural hematoma.

In a case-control study from Italy with 345 cases of subacute or chronic subdural hematoma collected from a single hospital and matched to 138 786 emergency department attendees, antithrombotic drug use increased subacute or chronic subdural hematoma risk (anticoagulant use: OR.

### Surgery for brain edema [^114heDQh]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

Brain edema is a common pathophysiological process seen in many neurosurgical conditions. It can be localized in relation to focal lesions or generalized in diffuse types of brain injury. In addition to local adverse effects occurring at a cellular level, brain edema is associated with raised intracranial pressure (ICP), and both phenomena contribute to poor outcome in patients. One of the goals in treating patients with acute neurosurgical conditions in intensive care is to control brain edema and maintain ICP below target levels. The mainstay of treatment is medical therapy to reduce edema, but in certain patients — for example, those with diffuse severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) and malignant middle cerebral artery infarction — such treatment is not effective. In these patients, opening the skull (decompressive craniectomy) to reduce ICP is a potential option. In this review the authors discuss the role of decompressive craniectomy as a surgical option in patients with brain edema in the context of a variety of pathological entities. They also address the current evidence for the technique (predominantly observational series) and the ongoing randomized studies of decompressive craniectomy in TBI and ischemic stroke.

### Acute subdural hematoma associated with diffuse brain injury and hypoxemia in the rat: effect of surgical evacuation of the hematoma [^116Kmju3]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2004). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of rapid or delayed surgical evacuation on the physiological consequence and brain edema formation in a rat model of acute subdural hematoma (SDH) coupled with either diffuse brain injury (DBI) or hypoxemia. The SDH was made by an autologous blood injection, while DBI was induced using the impact acceleration model (mild, 450 g/1 m; severe, 450 g/2 m). Physiological parameters measured included intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and brain tissue water content. At 1 h (rapid evacuation) or 4 h (delayed evacuation) after the SDH induction, surgical evacuation following a craniotomy was performed using saline irrigation and forceps. The study consisted of three different series, including 400 microL of SDH alone (Series 1), SDH400 + mild DBI (Series 2), and SDH300 + severe DBI + 20 min hypoxemia (Series 3). The hypoxemia was added in Group 3 to produce a steadily increasing ICP. In Series 1 and 2, all rats were randomized into the three following groups: non-, rapid, and delayed evacuation; Series 3 had two groups: non- and rapid evacuation. In Series 1, the surgical evacuation showed no beneficial effects on the brain edema formation assessed at 5 h post-injury. In Series 2, the rapid, but not delayed, evacuation significantly reduced both the increased ICP level and brain water content. The additional insult of hypoxemia (Series 3) resulted in a progressive ICP elevation, persistently depressed CBF, and severe brain swelling. Under this situation, the rapid evacuation exacerbated brain edema. These results have clinical implications for the management of severe traumatic SDH, especially its operative indication and timing.

### Defining a taxonomy of intracranial hypertension: is ICP more than just a number? [^115dLrWR]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and control is a cornerstone of neuroanesthesia and neurocritical care. However, because elevated ICP can be due to multiple pathophysiological processes, its interpretation is not straightforward. We propose a formal taxonomy of intracranial hypertension, which defines ICP elevations into 3 major pathophysiological subsets: increased cerebral blood volume, masses and edema, and hydrocephalus. (1) Increased cerebral blood volume increases ICP and arises secondary to arterial or venous hypervolemia. Arterial hypervolemia is produced by autoregulated or dysregulated vasodilation, both of which are importantly and disparately affected by systemic blood pressure. Dysregulated vasodilation tends to be worsened by arterial hypertension. In contrast, autoregulated vasodilation contributes to intracranial hypertension during decreases in cerebral perfusion pressure that occur within the normal range of cerebral autoregulation. Venous hypervolemia is produced by Starling resistor outflow obstruction, venous occlusion, and very high extracranial venous pressure. Starling resistor outflow obstruction tends to arise when cerebrospinal fluid pressure causes venous compression to thus increase tissue pressure and worsen tissue edema (and ICP elevation), producing a positive feedback ICP cycle. (2) Masses and edema are conditions that increase brain tissue volume and ICP, causing both vascular compression and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure leading to oligemia. Brain edema is either vasogenic or cytotoxic, each with disparate causes and often linked to cerebral blood flow or blood volume abnormalities. Masses may arise from hematoma or neoplasia. (3) Hydrocephalus can also increase ICP, and is either communicating or noncommunicating. Further research is warranted to ascertain whether ICP therapy should be tailored to these physiological subsets of intracranial hypertension.

### Pathophysiology and treatment of cerebral edema in traumatic brain injury [^114rMPjA]. Neuropharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cerebral edema:

- **Definition**: Cerebral edema is a disorder characterized by an increase in brain tissue water, including in individual cells and their surrounding tissues, with resultant intracranial hypertension.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cerebral edema can be broadly classified as cytotoxic edema (due to ischemic stroke), vasogenic edema (due to neoplasm, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis, or arterio-venous shuts), or interstitial edema (due to hydrocephalus).
- **Disease course**: Cerebral edema presents with manifestations of intracranial hypertension, irreversible brain injury, cerebral herniation, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cerebral edema associated with mass lesions is associated with an estimated in-hospital mortality of > 60%. In the context of ischemic stroke, the development of cerebral edema is associated with mortality of > 50%.

The authors report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented to our institution with 10 days history of confusion and signs of progressive raised intracranial pressure as a result of a minor head injury occurred 4 weeks before. A brain CT-scan showed a large right hemispheric chronic subdural haematoma which was, as routinely, treated by burr-hole craniostomy and closed-drainage. Although the procedure was uneventful, the next day the patient developed a mild left hemiparesis associated to a slight global status worsening. A brain CT scan showed an intracerebral position of the drain with diffuse brain oedema and midline shift. Following drain removal the patient developed a serious neurological deterioration dropping the Glasgow coma scale to 8/15 as the result of an intracerebral and intraventricular haemorrhage along the removed drain trajectory. The clinical features of this iatrogenic complication are reported analysing also globally chronic subdural haematoma management and discussing pertinent literature.

### Perceiving traumatic brain injury from glymphatic system [^115bAHe1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex and often-devastating condition. This disease involves damage to cerebral structures: meninges (dura, arachnoid, pia), cerebral cortex, white matter tracts, and deeper structures (basal ganglia, brainstem), along with mechanisms including contusions, hematomas (epidural/subdural), diffuse axonal injury from shear forces, secondary edema compromising blood-brain barrier, and ischemia/hemorrhage caused by vascular disruption. The pathophysiological process of TBI above varies significantly among individuals. However, prevalent TBI treatments still focus on symptomatic management, such as surgical intervention represented by craniotomy, medical management represented by osmotic agents for cerebral edema, supportive care represented by oxygen therapy, and adjuvant therapies represented by hypothermia. Worse still, traditional therapies often yield unfavorable outcomes and indulge the potential onset of long-term neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). On the other side, Glymphatic System (GS), discovered as a clearance system in the brain, has made tremendous progress over the past decade. Dysfunction of the GS has been implicated in various central nervous system (CNS) diseases including TBI. The discovery of the GS offers new perspectives for the pathophysiological process of TBI, particularly unveiling the truth of the development of diphasic brain edema following TBI. Impressively, with the GS maturing, unprecedented therapeutic strategies ensue. For instance, the GS might explain sleep deprivation after TBI strikes in part and strongly validate the prospect of sleep therapy, then provide insights into the enigma of sleep. Also, nor-adrenergic inhibition facilitates CSF-ISF exchange and glymphatic outflow, significantly attenuating brain edema. AQP4, the guardian and regulator of brain capacity at the end-foot of astrocyte, which can modulate its array and amounts aligning with nor-adrenergic signal, is indispensable in this process. Moreover, neurons have gained prominence in the brain's clearance system. Exploring the relationship between the GS and TBI will likely to blaze the new trail for advancing our understanding of TBI.

### Middle meningeal artery embolization for chronic subdural hematoma [^1113guFe]. BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a collection of blood in the subdural space, the space between the dura and arachnoid mater. The most common cause of an acute SDH is trauma resulting in tearing of cortical bridging veins. Most acute SDHs resolve over time via resorption; however, a fraction of cases encapsulate and become a chronic SDH (cSDH), defined as being at least 3 weeks old. The overall incidence of cSDH is between 17.6 and 20.6 per 100 000 people, being highest in the elderly. Risk factors for its development include advanced age, male sex, use of anti-coagulants, alcoholism, and coagulopathies. The incidence of cSDH is increasing due to an ageing population and the increased use of anti-coagulants in the community. cSDH may present with focal neurological signs including weakness and altered sensation secondary to the mass effect of the hematoma but can also present with non-specific, more insidious symptoms such as headaches, nausea, cognitive impairment, confusion, and falls. cSDH may also be asymptomatic, especially in the elderly with significant cerebral atrophy. cSDH has a significant morbidity and mortality, with the median patient survival being only 4.0 years after diagnosis.cSDH has been named a sentinel health event, being not only a marker of prior ill health, but also a trigger for further deterioration.

### Preoperative brain shift is a prognostic factor for survival in certain neurosurgical diseases other than severe head injury: a case series and literature review [^111o5B82]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The analysis of our results demonstrates that, analyzing all patients as a group, the overall midline shift is significant at both MF and CC (p < 0.001). This is a warning for every neurosurgeon dealing with emergency surgery in the presence of a brain shift on a CT scan. Analyzing by subgroups, only some pathologies are statistically significant. This apparently contradictory result may be due to the small sample size in 2 pathological subgroups, the variable size of each lesion, its position in relation to the midline and skull base, the time of growth which can impair brain perfusion into surrounding brain tissue, and the formation of brain edema.

Previous studies on brain shift in various diseases have not enlightened surgical management. In supratentorial brain tumors, midline shift is an independent predictor of brain swelling after the opening of the dura mater and it is an independent prognostic factor influencing survival among patients with glioblastoma multiforme. In our series of supratentorial brain tumors, brain shift did not have a statistically significant relation to survival, probably due to our collecting both benign and malignant tumors. The slow growth of the tumor causes a progressive adaptation of the compressed brain tissue surrounding the lesion and substantially reduces the median shift compared with that seen in the other acute or subacute pathologies. In patients with spontaneous hemorrhagic lesions, brain shift > 5 mm has prognostic significance for survival. In patients with lobar hemorrhage or cerebral infarction, the degree of septum pellucidum displacement and coma on admission were the only significant factors associated with early death following stroke. Likewise, in our group of surgically treated patients with intraparenchymal hematomas, survival was related to the preoperative brain shift measured at the CC. However, since there was no significant relationship between survival and MF shift, this result should be further investigated in a separate study involving a greater number of patients, the location and volume of blood collection, and the comorbidities that are often present in such cases. In malignant middle cerebral artery ischemia, postoperative midline shift < 5 mm at the level of the septum pellucidum significantly decreased the mortality rate and improved outcome. The clinical result in our small group of patients with malignant ischemia is perfectly in line with the existing literature, and the benefit of this surgical procedure in this disease is now indisputable in our daily practice. One study in chronic subdural hematoma correlated preoperative brain shift and level of consciousness, but not prognosis. Other analyses of chronic subdural hematoma showed no significant association between midline shift on preoperative CT scan and outcome. Our study is the first to highlight the finding that brain shift at MF cannot be ignored in chronic subdural hematoma, although the resulting median shift is not among the largest observed. Obviously, as already stated, the patient's neurological condition at the time of clinical presentation is of paramount importance.

### Significance of perihematomal edema in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: the INTERACT trial [^1178sBSQ]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty surrounds the effects of cerebral edema on outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).

Methods

We used data from the INTERACT trial to determine the predictors and prognostic significance of "perihematomal" edema over 72 hours after ICH. INTERACT included 404 patients with CT-confirmed ICH and elevated systolic blood pressure (BP) (150–220 mm Hg) who had the capacity to commence BP lowering treatment within 6 hours of ICH. Baseline and repeat CT (24 and 72 hours) were performed using standardized techniques, with digital images analyzed centrally. Predictors of growth in edema were determined using generalized estimating equations, and its effects on clinical outcomes were estimated using a logistic regression model.

Results

Overall, 270 patients had 3 sequential CT scans available for analyses. At baseline, there was a highly significant correlation between hematoma and perihematomal edema volumes (r² = 0.45). Lower systolic BP and baseline hematoma volume were independently associated with absolute increase in perihematomal edema volume. History of hypertension, baseline hematoma volume, and earlier time from onset to CT were independently associated with relative increase in edema volume. Both absolute and relative increases in perihematomal edema growth were significantly associated with death or dependency at 90 days after adjustment for age, gender, and randomized treatment, but not when additionally adjusted for baseline hematoma volume.

Conclusions

The degree of, and growth in, perihematomal edema are strongly related to the size of the underlying hematoma of acute intracerebral hemorrhage, and do not appear to have a major independent effect in determining the outcome from this condition.

### Drainage versus no drainage after burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 1961 patients [^115CpT5M]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a long-standing blood clot on the brain's surface underneath its outer coating. Patients with brain atrophy, or the shrinking or withering away of brain tissue due to age or disease, are most likely to develop these liquid clots when they are 60 years or older. Minor head trauma can break blood vessels over the brain's surface as the brain shrinks inside the skull over time, leading to a steady blood buildup over several days to weeks. The most frequent complaint is a headache, and symptoms might include weakness, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, disorientation, memory loss, nausea, and seizures. Diagnosis involves computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. SDHs vary in density and may extend over a large portion of the brain's surface. The best therapy method is burr-hole trepanation, which involves surgically draining the hematoma. The most efficient method of treating cSDH is burr-hole craniostomy, which involves evacuation through one or two burr holes drilled over the location of the hematoma. A significant issue with cSDH is a recurrence, which refers to developing another cSDH in the same location. Patients may require additional surgical interventions to address these recurrent hematomas. The use of drains may reduce the likelihood of recurrence; however, their utilization is not commonly practiced.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT

How do I approach the management of ICH?

ICH is a neurological emergency. The presence of expanding haematoma and vasogenic oedema inside the fixed volume of the cranial vault can lead to a precipitous increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and fatal brain herniation syndromes. The principle of 'time is brain' also firmly applies to ICH; haematoma expansion occurs very earlyand independently predicts a poor outcome. The rapid delivery of a care bundle incorporating anticoagulation reversal, intensive blood pressure management and neurosurgery/critical care if required has been associated with a substantial improvement in 30-day case-fatality rates.

The overarching goals of acute management are to stabilise the patient to ensure they survive the initial insult, and to prevent secondary brain injury (figure 4). Patients with ICH may require immediate intensive care unit admission. Otherwise, all patients should be admitted to an acute stroke unit as soon as possible; the benefit is at least as great for patients with ICH as it is for those with ischaemic stroke. The general principles of acute care are the same as those for acute ischaemic stroke, as outlined in the first article in this series. Secondary prevention measures, cerebral small vessel disease and decisions regarding restarting antithrombotic therapy will be addressed in subsequent articles.

Figure 4
Schema of the time course and mechanisms of secondary brain injury in intracerebral haemorrhage, including intraventricular haemorrhage.

Management of the complications of ICH is a key focus of acute care. Raised ICP can result from the mass effect of the bleed or peri-haematomal oedema or from hydrocephalus. Although there is a lack of evidence to guide its management in ICH, measures used for raised ICP in other settings may help. These include raising the head of the bed to 30° (although without supportive evidence in acute stroke), mild sedation, analgesia and mannitol (or hypertonic saline, depending on cardiac and renal comorbidities). Intensive ICP monitoring is recommended in those with a GCS < 9, evidence of herniation or hydrocephalus. Corticosteroids are possibly associated with more harm than benefit when used for lowering ICP in ICH, so should not be used. Early-onset seizures are not uncommon, occurring in one in seven patients, with most occurring at or near the onset. Clinical seizures should be managed with antiseizure medications, but prophylactic treatment should not be offered routinely. Cortical involvement, age younger than 65 years, volume greater than 10 mL and early seizures within 7 days of ICH identify patients at higher risk of subsequent late seizure development.

### Clinically silent magnetic resonance imaging findings after subdural strip electrode implantation [^112zTDDA]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2010). Low credibility.

Object

Subdural strip electrodes (SSEs) are often used as part of the workup in patients being considered for epilepsy surgery. To assess for complications or to confirm electrode placement, postoperative imaging is often performed. Imaging performed with the electrodes in situ is limited by streak artifact on CT and susceptibility artifact on MR imaging. Therefore, the first opportunity for high-quality postoperative imaging is following explantation of electrodes. There is no data available to determine what would be the expected MR imaging appearance following insertion of SSE. The purpose of this study is to describe the MR imaging findings in asymptomatic patients who underwent insertion of SSEs.

Methods

Twenty consecutive patients who underwent SSE insertion were studied. Within 24 hours after removal of the electrodes, each patient underwent MR imaging that included axial T2-weighted, gradient echo, diffusion weighted, and coronal FLAIR sequences. No significant symptoms were reported by any of the patients. The studies were reviewed by an experienced, blinded neuroradiologist and categorized.

Results

Of the 20 patients studied, 11 were female (mean age 36 years). Clinically silent postexplantation MR imaging abnormalities were found in all patients: subdural hematomas in 7 (35%), cortical contusions in 5 (25%), local edema in 5 (25%), trans-bur hole cortical herniation in 5 (25%), subdural hygromas in 2 (10%), and pneumocranium in 4 (20%). The MR imaging abnormalities were subdivided into 2 types: Type A, abnormalities related to the site of electrode insertion; and Type B, abnormalities related to the location of the electrodes. The most common location for a Type A abnormality was occipitotemporal, with cortical contusions occurring in this location in 18% of cases, local edema in 24%, and trans-bur hole herniation in 24%. The next most common location was frontal, with cortical contusions found in this location in 10% of cases, local edema in 5% and trans-bur hole herniation in 5%. The most common Type B abnormality was a subdural hematoma, followed by pneumocranium and subdural hygroma.

Conclusions

Clinically silent MR imaging abnormalities are common following SSE placement. Knowledge of these findings would be of assistance in interpreting MR imaging results in patients being assessed for complications.

Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) long-term complications — subdural hematoma (SDH) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST): Case reports have linked PDPH with SDH, likely caused by brain sagging due to CSF hypotension leading to traction on intracranial veins. Two large database observational studies quantified this association, and delayed treatment of PDPH was the strongest risk factor for SDH. Case reports and a large cohort study also demonstrated an association between PDPH and CVST, which may present similarly to SDH, with worsening headache, loss of the postural component of PDPH and focal neurologic symptoms or seizures.

### Delayed acute subdural hematoma associated with percutaneous coronary intervention [^114qinAM]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Itshayek et alconsidered the administration of anticoagulants to elderly patients as a risk factor for DASH. Our patient was considered to be closely related to PCI, which is a very effective and established procedure to treat coronary lesions. Conversely, some common complications such as peripheral embolism, acute coronary occlusion, or puncture side related complications can occur. The anticoagulant heparin is imperative to avoid embolic complications and thrombosis. In this patient, we administered 10,000 units of heparin in total, which was an appropriate amount considering her weight. As reported in the study above, anticoagulant use seems to be related to DASH. This patient suggests that PCI may induce DASH, even after mild TBI. Percutaneous coronary intervention procedure for CPA due to AMI is imperative. Therefore retrospectively this complication, subdural hematoma, was unavoidable. However, at least clinicians should explain this complication to the patients and their family prior to the procedure and recognize it as soon as possible.

Some mechanisms, by which a subdural hematoma occurs later, are described below. First, owing to hypotension, the intracranial hemorrhage was so tiny that it could not be detected on the initial CT. Therefore, when a patient's blood pressure increases, some bleeding appears in the cranium. Second, elevated intracranial pressure or cerebral edema prevents bleeding from the capillary. This mechanism is likely to be involved in patients with severe TBI. Other mechanisms such as vasoparalysis resulting from local hypoxiaor local metabolic disorders that may injure the vessel wallhave also been suggested. The patient was in CPA at the onset of TBI. It is possible that the initial intracranial hemorrhage was so tiny owing to the absence of circulation. After PCI, blood pressure was in the normal range. In addition to this, antithrombus agent use probably resulted in increasing the size of the hemorrhage, which caused brain herniation. A notable thing in this patient is the very short duration in which brain herniation developed. The interval from coma onset to brain herniation was far shorter than that from TBI to coma onset. Thus, immediate surgical treatment should be administered.

### Guidelines for the acute treatment of cerebral edema in neurocritical care patients [^1116Hfdf]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

The panel acknowledges that there are some commonly referenced articles reporting on the use of mannitol in patients with ICH that were not included in this guideline, as they did not address these specific PICO questions. Two recent publications, both of which demonstrated potential risk of hematoma expansion, were ultimately excluded from our assessment as the study outcomes did not directly address the PICO questions as written (though hematoma expansion is important clinically, the panel did not feel this variable was directly related to cerebral edema or ICP). However, the panel felt that their results may give providers some pause regarding the safety of mannitol in patients with ICH. Given these concerns, along with the lack of published articles assessing the impact of mannitol on short-term outcomes, the panel was unable to recommend use of mannitol in this population at this time.

While the overall quality of evidence in this area is very low, the panel felt there was enough consistency across published studies to suggest that HTS is effective in reducing ICP elevations and cerebral edema. In contrast, the available published studies on mannitol were not directly related to the PICO question and they implied harm; thus, the panel favored HTS over mannitol.

Recommendations for Corticosteroids in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage

We recommend against the use of corticosteroids to improve neurological outcome in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage due to the potential for increased mortality and infectious complications (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

The panel evaluated whether use of corticosteroids in patients with ICH impacts neurological outcome, including mortality or functional status at any designated time point. The panel included a Cochrane meta-analysis, two moderate- to high-quality studies, and several other lower-quality studies in their assessment (Table 1, Question 8). The overall quality of evidence was moderate (Table 6).

A 2005 Cochrane Review assessed the impact of corticosteroids on neurological outcome in patients with ICH compared to placebo or standard of care controls. The review found no evidence to support the routine use of corticosteroids in patients with primary ICH and highlighted a potential for harm in these patients. One prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 93) of dexamethasone to placebo in patients with ICH was halted due to increased rates of infectious and diabetic complications, while another (n = 40) showed no difference in mortality or neurological outcomes. Sharafadinzadeh et al. published a placebo-controlled trial of 225 patients which found higher mortality in the dexamethasone group. Four other lower-quality studies all found no improvement in outcomes related to dexamethasone use, with two studies demonstrating increased mortality in the treatment group.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^112VW9nW]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Monitor/observe after orbital trauma — some forms of strabismus will improve with time, watchful waiting is often a reasonable approach, and a short burst of oral steroids can hasten recovery and uncover strabismus that will persist despite resolution of orbital edema/hematoma.
