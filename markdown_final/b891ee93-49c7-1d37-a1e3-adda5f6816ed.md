## Question

Dvt prophylaxis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about DVT prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical context and scope of prophylaxis versus treatment. Then, I should verify risk stratification frameworks and how to apply them. Next, I will examine pharmacologic options and their comparative efficacy and safety. After that, I need to review mechanical prophylaxis and when to combine modalities. I will then consider special populations, including critically ill, stroke, cancer, trauma, and COVID-19. Finally, I should confirm duration, implementation strategies, and summarize a practical decision algorithm with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and scope so I don't conflate primary prevention with treatment of established DVT. Prophylaxis refers to preventing initial VTE events in at-risk patients, whereas treatment addresses confirmed DVT or PE with therapeutic anticoagulation; this distinction drives different agents, durations, and monitoring, so I need to keep them separate in my reasoning and recommendations.

> Next, I should review risk stratification because prophylaxis decisions hinge on it. For medical inpatients, I need to check for immobility, active cancer, prior VTE, obesity, age, heart failure, COPD, infection, and inflammatory disease; for surgical patients, I should confirm use of validated tools like Caprini or Rogers and align with specialty-specific guidance, recognizing that many hospitalized patients have multiple risk factors and that underuse of prophylaxis remains common despite strong evidence of benefit [^115vfecb] [^114QU27F] [^112SNedU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pharmacologic choices without comparing efficacy. I should double-check that LMWH consistently reduces DVT and PE in medical patients, with meta-analytic data showing roughly a 40–60% relative risk reduction in DVT and about a 30% reduction in PE, and that UFH achieves similar benefits versus placebo but LMWH is probably more effective than UFH in some settings, including critically ill adults, where LMWH reduces DVT more than UFH or control in network meta-analyses [^114PxRzP].

> Wait, let me verify bleeding tradeoffs because that determines who gets pharmacologic prophylaxis. Pharmacologic prophylaxis increases any bleeding and, in some contexts, major bleeding, though absolute increases are modest; in surgical cohorts, combined prophylaxis can increase major bleeding, so I need to balance thrombotic and bleeding risks carefully and avoid blanket approaches that ignore individual risk profiles [^114PxRzP] [^1111CsTv] [^114x9fRs].

> I will now examine mechanical prophylaxis, since it is pivotal when bleeding risk is high or as an adjunct. Intermittent pneumatic compression reduces DVT in surgical and some medical populations, and graduated compression stockings can be considered in select contexts, though routine use for PTS prevention after acute DVT is not recommended; importantly, in critically ill adults, adding IPC to pharmacologic prophylaxis did not reduce proximal DVT in the PREVENT trial, so I should be cautious about assuming additive benefit in that group [^114x9fRs] [^115NsNPJ] [^116UveC1].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with critically ill patients. I should confirm that standard-intensity pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH is recommended, with LMWH favored over UFH when renal function allows, and that intensified regimens have not shown net benefit in COVID-19 ICU populations; combined prophylaxis may not add benefit in this group, so I need to individualize and avoid escalation without evidence [^notfound] [^111tAEoa] [^116UveC1].

> For acute ischemic stroke, I need to check dosing nuances because high-dose anticoagulation increases intracranial hemorrhage. Low-dose LMWH appears to have the best benefit–risk balance, reducing DVT and PE without a clear increase in intracranial bleeding, whereas high-dose UFH or LMWH increases hemorrhagic complications; thus, I should prefer low-dose LMWH when pharmacologic prophylaxis is indicated after weighing hemorrhagic risk [^113HYK4N].

> In cancer, I should confirm that hospitalized medical oncology patients at high risk benefit from pharmacologic prophylaxis, and that routine pharmacologic prophylaxis for catheter-related thrombosis is not recommended; decisions should be individualized based on active therapy, immobility, and bleeding risk, with attention to extended prophylaxis in select surgical oncology contexts [^116ACt3W] [^112uzUxi].

> For trauma, let me reconsider the strength of evidence. Although older systematic reviews suggested benefit without mortality reduction, more recent guidance supports pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH or UFH in major trauma, with LMWH reasonable when feasible; combined modalities may further reduce DVT, but I should confirm bleeding risk and timing of initiation after stabilization [^1125djK5] [^111sqkJF].

> Regarding COVID-19, I should double-check that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is not routinely indicated for critically ill patients, and that standard prophylaxis is appropriate; for moderately ill inpatients with low bleeding risk, therapeutic heparin may be considered, but intermediate-dose regimens are not recommended, and post-discharge prophylaxis is generally not advised outside trials or exceptional risk profiles [^111tAEoa] [^112xYiat].

> Next, I should review duration and transitions. Standard inpatient prophylaxis is typically 6–14 days, but VTE risk extends up to 90 days after discharge; extended-duration prophylaxis with rivaroxaban or apixaban reduces symptomatic VTE at the cost of more major bleeding, so I need to reserve extended prophylaxis for carefully selected high-risk, low-bleeding-risk patients and discuss tradeoffs explicitly [^1148Jfis].

> I need to ensure implementation details are addressed because underuse persists. Mandatory risk assessment, computerized alerts, order sets, and audit-feedback loops improve prophylaxis rates; education alone is insufficient, and multidisciplinary approaches with IT-enabled workflows are most effective at closing the gap between evidence and practice [^116pJKpW] [^111Ewc3n].

> But wait, what if the patient already has DVT — does this change prophylaxis to treatment? Yes, I should confirm that established DVT requires therapeutic anticoagulation rather than prophylactic dosing, with DOACs generally preferred absent contraindications, and that distal DVT management depends on symptoms and risk of extension; this is a different pathway than primary prophylaxis and should not be conflated [^1131tRSp] [^116FvLFV] [^1143bX3g].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, assess VTE and bleeding risk using validated tools and clinical judgment; second, if bleeding risk is high, prioritize mechanical prophylaxis and early mobilization; third, if bleeding risk is acceptable, use pharmacologic prophylaxis with LMWH preferred when renal function allows, UFH when renal impairment or bleeding risk is a concern, and consider combined modalities in very high-risk surgical patients; fourth, reassess daily for changes in risk and contraindications; fifth, consider extended prophylaxis only in select high-risk, low-bleeding-risk medical or surgical patients after shared decision-making [^114QU27F] [^1111CsTv] [^1148Jfis].

> Finally, I should confirm key caveats and monitoring. Avoid routine IVC filters for primary prophylaxis, monitor for bleeding and thrombocytopenia with heparins, and remember that many events occur post-discharge, so discharge planning should include risk reassessment and patient education; if I overlooked any population-specific nuances, I will correct course as new evidence or patient-specific factors emerge [^113vkE2P] [^112SNedU].

DVT prophylaxis should be **individualized** based on patient risk and clinical context, using **pharmacologic prophylaxis** (LMWH, UFH, or DOACs) for moderate-to-high VTE risk when bleeding risk is acceptable, and **mechanical prophylaxis** (IPC or GCS) when pharmacologic therapy is contraindicated or as adjuncts in high-risk patients [^111mH5BQ] [^1111CsTv] [^114x9fRs]. LMWH is preferred in most settings due to once-daily dosing and lower bleeding risk, while UFH is used in renal impairment or when rapid reversal is needed [^116264NM]. DOACs are options in some orthopedic and medical patients, but not in pregnancy or severe renal failure [^1148Jfis] [^115ggomq]. Prophylaxis should continue for 6–14 days in medical patients and 10–35 days after major orthopedic surgery, with extended prophylaxis considered for high-risk medical patients if bleeding risk is low [^1148Jfis]. Regular reassessment of VTE and bleeding risk is essential to guide ongoing management [^111mH5BQ].

## Risk assessment and stratification

Effective DVT prophylaxis begins with **risk assessment and stratification** to tailor interventions to individual patient risk profiles. Commonly used tools include the Caprini score for surgical patients and the Padua score for medical patients [^114QU27F]. Risk factors include:

- **Age**: Advanced age significantly increases VTE risk [^115vfecb].
- **Obesity**: BMI ≥ 30 kg/m² is a recognized risk factor [^notfound].
- **Malignancy**: Active cancer substantially elevates VTE risk [^115vfecb].
- **Previous VTE**: History of DVT or PE is a major risk factor [^115vfecb].
- **Immobility**: Prolonged bed rest or recent surgery increases risk [^115vfecb].
- **Thrombophilia**: Inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states [^115vfecb].

---

## Pharmacological prophylaxis

Pharmacological prophylaxis is the cornerstone of DVT prevention in moderate-to-high risk patients, provided **bleeding risk is acceptable** [^111mH5BQ]. The main classes of agents include:

| **Agent** | **Indications** | **Dosing** | **Considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| LMWH (enoxaparin, dalteparin) | - Medical patients <br/> - Orthopedic surgery <br/> - Trauma <br/> - Cancer | Enoxaparin 40 mg SC once daily or 30 mg SC twice daily | - Once-daily dosing <br/> - Lower bleeding risk than UFH <br/> - Contraindicated in severe renal impairment |
| UFH | - Renal impairment <br/> - Need for rapid reversal | 5,000 units SC every 8–12 hours | Requires platelet monitoring (HIT risk) |
| DOACs (rivaroxaban, apixaban) | - Orthopedic surgery <br/> - Select medical patients | Rivaroxaban 10 mg PO once daily; Apixaban 2.5 mg PO twice daily | - No routine lab monitoring <br/> - Contraindicated in pregnancy <br/> - Severe renal impairment |

---

LMWH is generally preferred due to its **once-daily dosing**, predictable pharmacokinetics, and lower bleeding risk compared to UFH [^116264NM]. UFH is preferred in patients with severe renal impairment or when rapid reversal is required [^notfound]. DOACs are increasingly used in orthopedic and select medical patients but are contraindicated in pregnancy and severe renal failure [^notfound].

---

## Mechanical prophylaxis

Mechanical prophylaxis is recommended for patients with **contraindications to pharmacological therapy** or as an adjunct in high-risk patients [^1111CsTv]. Methods include:

- **Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC)**: Reduces DVT risk by enhancing venous return and reducing stasis [^114x9fRs].
- **Graduated compression stockings (GCS)**: Useful in low-risk patients or as adjuncts to pharmacological prophylaxis [^1143GKDr].
- **Early ambulation**: Encouraged whenever feasible to reduce stasis and promote circulation [^1143GKDr].

---

## Duration of prophylaxis

The **duration of prophylaxis** varies by clinical scenario:

- **Medical patients**: Typically 6–14 days, aligning with the period of highest VTE risk during hospitalization [^notfound].
- **Orthopedic surgery**: 10–35 days, depending on procedure type and patient risk factors [^notfound].
- **Extended prophylaxis**: Considered for high-risk medical patients (e.g. cancer, previous VTE) if bleeding risk is low, extending up to 30 days post-discharge [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

Certain populations require **tailored approaches**:

- **Pregnancy**: LMWH is preferred due to safety for the fetus; UFH is an alternative if LMWH is contraindicated [^115ggomq].
- **Renal impairment**: UFH is preferred due to renal clearance considerations [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Weight-based dosing of LMWH may be necessary to ensure efficacy [^notfound].
- **Cancer**: LMWH is preferred for both prophylaxis and treatment of established VTE due to its efficacy and safety profile [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and reassessment

Regular reassessment of VTE and bleeding risk is essential throughout hospitalization and at discharge. Adjust prophylaxis based on changes in clinical status, **bleeding risk**, or **renal function** [^111mH5BQ].

---

## Implementation strategies

Despite strong evidence, **underutilization of DVT prophylaxis remains common** [^112SNedU]. Effective implementation strategies include:

- **Electronic alerts**: Remind clinicians to assess VTE risk and prescribe prophylaxis [^111Ewc3n].
- **Education**: Ongoing training for healthcare providers on risk assessment and prophylaxis guidelines [^116pJKpW].
- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involvement of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and quality improvement teams to optimize prophylaxis use [^114uBJxa].

---

DVT prophylaxis is a **critical component of patient safety**, reducing morbidity and mortality associated with VTE. Individualized risk assessment, appropriate selection of pharmacological or mechanical prophylaxis, and adherence to recommended durations are essential for effective prevention.

### How complete is the evidence for thromboembolism prophylaxis in general medicine patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114PxRzP]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Guidelines recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis for hospitalized medical patients at increased risk of thromboembolism. Despite recommendations, multiple studies demonstrate underutilization. Factors contributing to underutilization include uncertainty that prophylaxis reduces clinically relevant events, as well as questions about the best form of prophylaxis. We sought to determine whether prophylaxis decreases clinically significant events and to answer whether unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is either more effective or safer.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched through June 2008. Relevant bibliographies and conference proceedings were reviewed and LMWH manufacturers were contacted.

Study Selection

Randomized trials comparing UFH or LMWH to control, as well as head-to-head comparisons of UFH to LMWH in general medicine patients.

Data Extraction and Analysis

End points of deep venous thrombosis (DVT), proximal or symptomatic DVT, pulmonary embolism, mortality, bleeding, and thrombocytopenia were extracted from individual trials. Pooled relative risks were calculated using random effects modeling.

Results

We identified 8 trials comparing prophylaxis to control, and 6 trials comparing UFH to LMWH. Prophylaxis reduced DVT (relative risk [RR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.36–0.92), proximal DVT (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.31–0.69), and pulmonary embolism (RR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.53–0.93). Prophylaxis increased the risk of any bleeding (RR = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.15–2.06) but not major bleeding. Across trials comparing LMWH to UFH, there were no differences for any outcome.

Conclusions

Among medical patients, pharmacologic prophylaxis reduced the risk of thromboembolism without increasing risk of major bleeding. The current literature does not demonstrate superior efficacy of UFH or LMWH.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: a brief review [^112SNedU]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprised of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), is estimated to account for 5–10% of all deaths among hospitalised patients. In addition, non-fatal VTE events are associated with significant morbidities. In 2008, the US Surgeon General issued a Call to Action to Prevent DVT and PE. The report brings to light the huge numbers of patients afflicted by DVT (350 000–600 000) and killed by PE (> 100 000) every year in the USA.

Both pharmacological and mechanical prophylactic interventions have been demonstrated to be highly effective in preventing many, but not all, VTE. It has been estimated that best practice prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of DVT by up to 70%. The underlying pharmacological mechanism of all prophylaxis medications is to decrease clotting, and therefore they may increase the risk of bleeding. The balance between bleeding and clotting must be considered, and the harms and benefits must be weighed before administering these drugs. Blanket approaches that give the same medication at the same dose and frequency to all patients may not be beneficial and may even cause more harm than benefit. Therefore, individual patient risk assessment is paramount to ensure that all patients receive optimal prophylaxis.

Most hospitalised patients have one or more risk factors for VTE. Evidence based, best practice prophylaxis varies by individual patient risk factors (ie, cancer, advanced age, immobility, history of VTE) and primary clinical service (eg, medicine, surgery, trauma, orthopaedics). Specialty specific guidelines are often available in addition to general VTE prevention guidelines.

Despite high quality, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) showing the clinical effectiveness of prophylactic medications and mechanical devices to reduce the risk of VTE, numerous studies continue to show that many hospitalised patients are not prescribed risk appropriate VTE prophylaxis. One USA registry study found that only 42% of patients diagnosed with DVT during hospitalisation had received prophylaxis. These findings are not localised; another recent study across 32 countries found that only 59% of at risk surgical and 40% of at risk medical patients received guideline recommended VTE prophylaxis. Even as recently as Coagulation Day 2010, guideline adherence was reported to be 40% across Austrian intensive care units.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^116fSSds]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs in ∼1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, corresponding to ∼300000 to 600000 events in the United States annually.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) intend to support patients, clinicians, and others in decisions about treatment of VTE.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and adult patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 28 recommendations for the initial management of VTE, primary treatment, secondary prevention, and treatment of recurrent VTE events.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations include the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise, use of an international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.0 to 3.0 over a lower INR range for patients with VTE who use a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for secondary prevention, and use of indefinite anticoagulation for patients with recurrent unprovoked VTE. Conditional recommendations include the preference for home treatment over hospital-based treatment for uncomplicated DVT and PE at low risk for complications and a preference for direct oral anticoagulants over VKA for primary treatment of VTE.

### Deep-vein thrombosis in malignancy: how long should patients be treated, and with what? [^116ACt3W]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Cancer patients are at high-risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the optimal VTE prophylaxis and treatment options for this population are currently unclear. Surgical cancer patients have been shown to benefit from pharmacological VTE prophylaxis, with a number of trials suggesting that prophylaxis duration should extend beyond the traditional 7 day period. Medical (nonsurgical) cancer patients are also at high-risk of VTE, and evidence-based guidelines recommend pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in hospitalized cancer patients who are bedridden. In cancer patients with confirmed VTE, questions remain over the most effective long-term treatment regimen. Further trials are required to help physicians to make evidence-based choices for the management of VTE in these patients.

### Managing selected chronic conditions in hospitalized patients [^111EwY4R]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to administer prophylaxis for VTE in hospitalized patients, except for those classified as low risk by a clinical prediction score, to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolic disease.

---

### Thrombosis and coagulation: deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism prophylaxis [^116d5aJu]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, VTE) is a common complication in surgical patients and is the primary cause of preventable deaths in hospitalized patients. Despite well-known risk factors, VTE prophylaxis is frequently not practiced according to recommended guidelines. Patients can readily be stratified according to their risk of perioperative VTE, and mechanical and pharmacologic prophylactic regimens can be tailored to their individual risk. Pharmacologic VTEprophylaxis should be the standard of care in most clinical settings given its ease of administration, low risk, and cost-effectiveness.

### American Society of Hematology 2020 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism [^1152fLf5]. Blood Advances (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, extended therapy, ASH 2020 guidelines recommend to consider using a standard- or a lower-dose DOAC in patients with DVT and/or PE completed primary treatment and continuing DOAC for secondary prevention.

### Deep vein thrombosis and its prevention in critically ill adults… [^115rbtPW]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Use of unfractionated heparin appears to decrease the incidence of DVT by only 20%, whereas low-molecular-weight heparin decreases the incidence by a further 30%. The estimated prevalence of DVT in neurosurgical patients not given prophylaxis is 22% to 35%. Mechanical prophylaxis is efficacious, with a pooled odds ratio in 5 randomized trials of 0.
28. Venography was performed between days 10 and 14 and was interpretable in 265 patients. Sixty of 136 patients who received unfractionated heparin experienced DVT. Knudson et al32 reported a DVT rate of 3% in patients who received heparin compared with 7% in those who did not receive prophylaxis. However, this study assigned patients to heparin therapy at the discretion of the attending physician.

The majority of studies that evaluated mechanical prophylaxis devices included GCS and/or PCDs. Turpie et al48 reported a reduction in DVT during 5 days of postoperative screening from 12 of 63 among controls to 1 of 65 in the patients who received PCD. In this study, noncompliance was greater with the combined regimen than with GCS alone. A smaller study55 also failed to observe any difference between GCS and PCD for DVT prevention.

1. The incidence of DVT without prophylaxis in this population has been estimated at about 30%. This is based on limited screening with imperfect diagnostic tests and no reference standard. The true incidence is likely higher.
2. Low-dose heparin prophylaxis is effective, reducing the DVT rate by approximately 50%. This is based on 1 double-blind randomized clinical trial. Observational studies generally support the effectiveness of heparin.
3.

Based mainly on nonrandomized studies, unfractionated heparin prophylaxis appears to decrease the incidence of DVT by approximately 20% compared with placebo.
4. Low-molecular-weight heparin decreases the incidence of DVT by a further 30% over unfractionated heparin.
5. Pooling all heparin tri.

### What is the optimal pharmacological prophylaxis for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients with acute ischemic stroke? [^113HYK4N]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pulmonary embolism after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is associated with a high in-hospital mortality. The benefit from pharmacological prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) is uncertain probably due to doubts about the optimal agent and dose. We evaluated the benefit/risk ratio of different anticoagulant regimens in the prevention of VTE in patients with AIS.

Methods

The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 2005. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing early administration of either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) with control were included. Endpoints were objectively diagnosed deep-vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and extracranial hemorrhage (ECH). Low-dose UFH was arbitrarily defined as ≤ 15,000 IU/day, low-dose LMWH as ≤ 6000 IU/day or weight-adjusted dose of ≤ 86 IU/kg/day.

Results

Sixteen trials involving 23,043 patients with AIS met the inclusion criteria. The number of events was small and different doses of anticoagulant treatment were used. Compared to control, high-dose UFH was associated with a reduction in pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.29–0.83), but also with an increased risk of ICH (OR = 3.86, 95% CI = 2.41–6.19) and ECH (OR = 4.74, 95% CI = 2.88–7.78). Low-dose UFH decreased the thrombosis risk (OR = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.11–0.26), but had no influence on pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.53–1.31); the risk of ICH or ECH was not statistically significant increased (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 0.97–2.87 for ICH; and OR = 1.58, 95% CI = 0.89–2.81 for ECH, respectively). High-dose LMWH decreased both DVT (OR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02–0.29) and pulmonary embolism (0.44, 95% CI = 0.18–1.11), but this benefit was offset by an increased risk for ICH (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.02–3.96) and ECH (OR = 1.78, 95% CI = 0.99–3.17). Low-dose LMWH reduced the incidence of both DVT (OR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.19–0.59) and pulmonary embolism (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.15–0.87), without an increased risk of ICH (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 0.53–3.67) or ECH (OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 0.13–16). For low-dose LMWH, the numbers needed to treat were 7 and 38 for DVT and pulmonary embolism, respectively.

Conclusions

Indirect comparison of low and high doses of UFH and LMWH suggests that low-dose LMWH have the best benefit/risk ratio in patients with acute ischemic stroke by decreasing the risk of both DVT and pulmonary embolism, without a clear increase in ICH or ECH.

### Standard-versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients [^1148Jfis]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes two interrelated conditions, deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Risk factors include dehydration, prolonged immobilization, acute medical illness, trauma, clotting disorders, previous thrombosis, varicose veins with superficial vein thrombosis, exogenous hormones, malignancy, chemotherapy, infection, inflammation, pregnancy, obesity, smoking, and advancing age. It is estimated that hospitalized patients are 100 times more likely to develop VTE and, compared with surgical patients, medical patients often have more severe forms of VTE. VTE carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Prophylactic strategies, including mechanical and pharmacological methods, are recommended for patients at risk of VTE. Pharmacological prophylaxis is considered the standard practice for acutely ill medical patients at risk of developing VTE in the absence of contraindications. For hospitalized patients, the risk of VTE extends beyond hospital stay and up to 90 days, with most events occurring within 45 days of discharge. Despite that, it remains unclear whether extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis would provide benefits without added risks or harm.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and risks of standard- versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Web of Science databases, as well as the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers up to 27 March 2023. We also searched reference lists of all included studies for additional references and searched the last five years of the American Society of Hematology conference proceedings.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing standard-duration versus extended-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients (adults being treated in a medical inpatient setting).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures set by Cochrane. At least two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and performed data extraction. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias (RoB) using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We analyzed outcomes data using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome. Our outcomes of interest were assessed in the short term (during the treatment period and within 45 days of hospitalization) and long term (assessed beyond 45 days of hospitalization). Primary outcomes were symptomatic VTE, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were total VTE, a composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (including myocardial infarction, non-fatal PE, cardiopulmonary death, stroke), fatal bleeding, and VTE-related mortality.

Main Results

A total of seven RCTs fulfilled our inclusion criteria, comprising 40,846 participants. All studies contributing data to our outcomes were at low risk of bias in all domains. Most studies reported the outcomes in the short term. Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration anticoagulation, for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of short-term symptomatic VTE (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78; standard-duration 12 per 1000, extended-duration 7 per 1000, 95% CI 6 to 10; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome [NNTB] 204, 95% CI 136 to 409; 4 studies, 24,773 participants; high-certainty evidence). This benefit, however, was offset by an increased risk of short-term major bleeding (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.51 to 2.79; standard-duration 3 per 1000, extended duration 6 per 1000, 95% CI 5 to 8; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome [NNTH] 314, 95% CI 538 to 222; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation, compared with standard-duration, results in little to no difference in short-term all-cause mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.08; standard-duration 34 per 1000, extended-duration 33 per 1000, 95% CI 30 to 37; 5 studies, 38,080 participants; high-certainty evidence), reduced short-term total VTE (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85; standard-duration 37 per 1000, extended duration 28 per 1000, 95% CI 25 to 32; NNTB 107, 95% CI 76 to 178; 5 studies, 33,819 participants; high-certainty evidence), and short-term composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.91; standard-duration 41 per 1000, extended-duration 29 per 1000, 95% CI 23 to 37; NNTB 85, 95% CI 50 to 288; 1 study, 7513 participants; high-certainty evidence). Extended-duration anticoagulation may result in little to no difference in short-term fatal bleeding (RR 2.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 6.22; standard-duration 0 per 1000, extended-duration 0 per 1000, 95% CI 0 to 1; 7 studies, 40,374 participants; low-certainty evidence), and likely results in little to no difference in short-term VTE-related mortality (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.05; standard-duration 5 per 1000, extended-duration 4 per 1000 95% CI 3 to 6; 6 studies, 36,170 participants; moderate-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, extended- versus standard-duration anticoagulation for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients reduced the risk of symptomatic VTE at the expense of an increased risk of major bleeding. Extended-duration anticoagulation resulted in little to no difference in all-cause mortality. Extended-duration anticoagulation reduced the risk of total VTE and the composite of fatal and irreversible vascular events, but may show little to no difference in fatal bleeding and VTE-related mortality. Further data, with longer follow-up, are needed to determine the optimal agent and duration for primary VTE prophylaxis in acutely ill medical patients.

### Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis: state of the art [^11489wBc]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2018). Low credibility.

The selection of a prophylaxis regimen to prevent symptomatic pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis is a balance between efficacy and safety. The latest American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guideline recommended that either chemoprophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis be used after total joint arthroplasty but did not recommend specific agents. However, the latest evidence-based American College of Chest Physicians guideline recommended a variety of chemoprophylaxis and mechanical agents for a minimum of 10 to 14 days after total joint arthroplasty. Risk stratification is the key to the selection of the appropriate prophylaxis regimen for the individual patient, but the optimal risk stratification protocol still needs to be developed.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JJ3QZ]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a pulmonary embolism (PE) are 2 manifestations of a venous thromboembolism (VTE), which may cause considerable morbidity and mortality. It occurs in 1 to 2 individuals per 1000 each year, which translates to 300 000 to 600 000 events in the United States annually. Following a primary VTE event, recurrent events may occur in patients with an unprovoked VTE, a VTE associated with transient risk factors, or a VTE associated with chronic risk factors.,

Anticoagulation remains the cornerstone of treatment for patients with a VTE based on proven efficacy in reducing the risk for recurrent events. However, it is also associated with an increased risk for bleeding. Therefore, when determining the duration of anticoagulation therapy, it is crucial to balance the benefits (namely, the prevention of recurrent VTE) against the harms, primarily major bleeding and all-cause mortality. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for the management of VTEdescribe the treatment decisions for VTE in the following 3 phases (Figure 1): (1) initial management, which occurs from the time of diagnosis through the first 3 weeks of therapy; (2) primary treatment, which is a time-limited phase that typically runs for a minimum of 3 months; and (3) secondary prevention, which begins after completion of the primary treatment phase and extends for a prolonged, usually indefinite, period of time.

### Treatment of distal deep vein thrombosis [^1143bX3g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The treatment of distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is not clearly established. Distal DVT can either be treated with anticoagulation, or monitored with close follow-up to detect progression to the proximal veins (above the knee), which requires anticoagulation. Proponents of this monitoring strategy base their decision to withhold anticoagulation on the fact that progression is rare and most people can be spared from potential bleeding and other adverse effects of anticoagulation.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different treatment interventions for people with distal (below the knee) deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 12 February 2019. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for the treatment of distal DVT.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Primary outcomes of interest were recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), DVT and major bleeding and follow up ranged from three months to two years. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with risk ratio (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified eight RCTs reporting on 1239 participants. Five trials randomised participants to anticoagulation for up to three months versus no anticoagulation. Three trials compared anticoagulation treatment for different time periods. Anticoagulant compared to no intervention or placebo for distal DVT treatment Anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) reduced the risk of recurrent VTE during follow-up compared with participants receiving no anticoagulation (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.77; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 3%; high-certainty evidence), and reduced the risk of recurrence of DVT (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.67; 5 studies, 496 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was no clear effect on risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.59; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was little to no difference in major bleeding with anticoagulation compared to placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.13 to 4.62; 4 studies, 480 participants; I² = 26%; low-certainty evidence). There was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding events in the group treated with anticoagulants (RR 3.34, 95% CI 1.07 to 10.46; 2 studies, 322 participants; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). There was one death, not related to PE or major bleeding, in the anticoagulation group. Anticoagulation for three months or more compared to anticoagulation for six weeks for distal DVT treatment Three RCTs of 736 participants compared three or more months of anticoagulation with six weeks of anticoagulation. Anticoagulation with a VKA for three months or more reduced the incidence of recurrent VTE to 5.8% compared with 13.9% in participants treated for six weeks (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.68; 3 studies, 736 participants; I² = 50%; high-certainty evidence). The risk for recurrence of DVT was also reduced (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.64; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 48%; high-certainty evidence), but there was probably little or no difference in PE (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.19 to 5.88; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence). There was no clear difference in major bleeding events (RR 3.42, 95% CI 0.36 to 32.35; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 0%; low-certainty evidence) or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events (RR 1.76, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.42; 2 studies, 389 participants; I² = 1%; low-certainty evidence) between three months or more of treatment and six weeks of treatment. There were no reports for overall mortality or PE and major bleeding-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Our review found a benefit for people with distal DVT treated with anticoagulation therapy using VKA with little or no difference in major bleeding events although there was an increase in clinically relevant non-major bleeding when compared to no intervention or placebo. The small number of participants in this meta-analysis and strength of evidence prompts a call for more research regarding the treatment of distal DVT. RCTs comparing different treatments and different treatment periods with placebo or compression therapy, are required.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^113PaYQ1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a frequently encountered condition that is often diagnosed and treated in the outpatient setting. Risk stratification is helpful and recommended in the evaluation of DVT. An evidence-based diagnostic approach is discussed here. Once diagnosed, the mainstay of DVT treatment is anticoagulation. The specific type and duration of anticoagulation depend upon the suspected etiology of the venous thromboembolism, as well as risks of bleeding and other patient comorbidities. Both specific details and a standardized approach to this vast treatment landscape are presented.

### Barriers and potential solutions toward optimal prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis for hospitalized medical patients: a survey of healthcare professionals [^116FAeGD]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis remains underused in hospitalized medical patients despite strong recommendations that at-risk patients should receive prophylaxis. To understand this gap between knowledge and practice, we surveyed clinicians' perceptions about the importance of DVT prophylaxis, barriers to guideline implementation, and interventions to optimize prophylaxis.

Methods

Paper- and electronic mail-based surveys were sent to 1553 internists, nurses, pharmacists, and physiotherapists in Ontario, Canada. Responses were scored on 7-point Likert scales. An important barrier to optimal DVT prophylaxis was 1 with a mean score ≥ 5, and interventions with high potential success or feasibility were those with mean scores ≥ 5.

Results

DVT prophylaxis was perceived as important by all clinician groups but this did not appear to translate into knowledge about underutilization of current DVT prophylaxis strategies. Physicians and pharmacists recognized the underuse of DVT prophylaxis in medical patients, while nurses and physiotherapists tended to perceive prophylaxis strategies as appropriate. Lack of clear indications and contraindications for prophylaxis and concerns about bleeding risks were perceived as important barriers. Preprinted orders were considered the most potentially successful and feasible way to optimize prophylaxis.

Conclusions

A considerable barrier to optimal DVT prophylaxis utilization may be that those healthcare providers best able to conduct a daily assessment of patients' need for prophylaxis underrecognize the problem that prophylaxis is underutilized in this population. Interventions to bridge the gap between knowledge and practice should consider preprinted orders outlining DVT risk factors, and educating front-line care providers prior to implementation of a top-down approach.

### Routine pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in frail older hospitalised patients: where is the evidence? [^116cPeaK]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

It has been claimed that there are over 25,000 preventable in-hospital deaths from venous thromboembolism annually in the UK. NICE and SIGN guidelines therefore recommend that all hospitalised patients are risk assessed for venous thromboembolism. The guidelines would recommend using pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for all patients aged 60 and above with reduced mobility and acute medical illness unless obvious contra-indications exist. Meta-analysis data regarding pharmacological thromboprophylaxis for medical patients demonstrate reductions in asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) rather than fatal pulmonary embolism and mortality. There is also the potential for increased bleeding risk with this approach. Evidence for older medical in-patients, particularly those aged over 75, is more limited being derived from subgroup analyses of larger clinical trials. In addition, based on exclusion criteria such as increased bleeding risk, frailer older adults were unlikely to have been included within such trials. This commentary will (i) critically appraise available data on the incidence of DVT and PE in older hospitalised patients; (ii) review the evidence available from meta-analyses and subgroup analyses in older medical in-patients for the use of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis; (iii) discuss those situations out-with the guidelines where venous thromboprophylaxis may not be appropriate and even potentially harmful in this patient group and (iv) suggest future research directions.

### Deep venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis [^113MpvSj]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant risk for all surgical patients, despite validated guidelines. Development of VTE remains a high risk in hospitalized surgical patients, leading to complications in up to 30%. The stratification of patient risk factors and subsequent utilization of a validated prophylaxis and treatment regimen is, therefore, of utmost importance. Familiarity with the current guidelines and recommendations ultimately results in decreased morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. This article discusses the risk factors for developing VTE and management strategies based on the currently available guidelines".

### Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism… [^1143GKDr]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventive measures Graduated compression stockings and pharmacologic prophylaxis Graduated compression stockings appear to reduce asymptomatic DVT in travelers and are generally well tolerated. Decisions regarding use of pharmacologic prophylaxis for long-distance travelers at high risk should be made on an individual basis. When the potential benefits of pharmacologic prophylaxis outweigh the possible adverse effects, anticoagulants rather than antiplatelet drugs are recommended. There is no formally recommended dose for LMWH, but enoxaparin 40 mg or 1 mg/kg SC about 4 hours before the flight has been suggested. Direct oral anticoagulants are much more convenient than LMWH injections, but currently there is no evidence base for their use for the prevention of travel-associated VTE, so any use of DOACs for the prevention of travel-associated VTE would be off-label.

In-flight mobility and seat assignment Immobility while flying is a risk for VTE. Indirect evidence suggests that maintaining mobility could prevent VTE. In view of the role that venous stasis plays in the pathogenesis of travel-associated VTE, recommending frequent ambulation and calf muscle exercises for long-distance travelers is reasonable. American College of Chest Physicians guidelines For long-distance travelers at increased risk of VTE, the ACCP recommends frequent ambulation, calf muscle exercise, sitting in an aisle seat, and using properly fitted below-the-knee GCS that provide 15–30 mmHg of pressure at the ankle during travel. For long-distance travelers not at increased risk of VTE, use of GCS is not recommended. ACCP advises against the use of aspirin or anticoagulants to prevent VTE in long-distance travelers.

American Society of Hematology guidelines For long-distance travelers at substantially increased VTE risk, the ASH guidelines suggest GCS or prophylactic LMWH. If GCS or LMWH is not feasible, ASH suggests using aspirin rather than no VTE prophylaxis. For travelers without risk factors, ASH advises against using GCS, LMWH, or aspirin for VTE prophylaxis.

### Evidence-based therapies for pharmacologic prevention and treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and Pulmonary embolism [^115AssJa]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a significant mortal and morbid disease. The major risks have not changed and many patients present with unprovoked VTE disease. Prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients depends on comprehensive risk factor assessment, with an individual risk score. Proper and timely prophylaxis with mechanical, pharmacologic, or both is then effective. Treatment of VTE with parenteral anticoagulation followed by either a direct oral anticoagulant or warfarin is standard to reduce risk of VTE recurrence and death. Selected cases of iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis may be treated by pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, but more data are needed before this is standard of care.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis: The panel states, 'We suggest against routine deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis (mechanical or pharmacologic) in critically ill children with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, but potential benefits may outweigh risks and costs in specific populations (weak recommendation, low quality of evidence)'. Evidence cited includes an open-label RCT in the PICU where 'Eleven of 78 patients (14.1%) randomized to reviparin had DVT proven on venogram versus 10 of 80 controls (12.5%) (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.42–3.23)'. The document further notes that 'A subsequent systematic review found the quality of evidence to be low and that the efficacy of low molecular weight heparin in preventing CVC-associated thrombosis is unknown (503)', outlines risk factors by stating 'CVCs represent the principal risk factor for DVT in infants' and that 'the risk of DVT increases in adolescence, obesity, cancer, and in those with multiple medical conditions, especially renal and cardiac disease', and concludes that 'At present, it is unknown whether certain high-risk populations of children with sepsis may benefit from DVT prophylaxis'.

### VTE prophylaxis in critically ill adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116264NM]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Critically ill adults are at increased risk of VTE, including DVT, and pulmonary embolism. Various agents exist for venous thromboprophylaxis in this population.

Research Question

What is the comparative efficacy and safety of prophylaxis agents for prevention of VTE in critically ill adults?

Study Design and Methods

Systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating efficacy of thromboprophylaxis agents among critically ill patients. We searched six databases (including PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline) from inception through January 2021 for RCTs of patients in the ICU receiving pharmacologic, mechanical, or combination therapy (pharmacologic agents and mechanical devices) for thromboprophylaxis. Two reviewers performed screening, full-text review, and extraction. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation to rate certainty of effect estimates.

Results

We included 13 RCTs (9,619 patients). Compared with control treatment (a composite of no prophylaxis, placebo, or compression stockings only), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) reduced the incidence of DVT (OR, 0.59 [95% credible interval [CrI], 0.33–0.90]; high certainty) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) may reduce the incidence of DVT (OR, 0.82 [95% CrI, 0.47–1.37]; low certainty). LMWH probably reduces DVT compared with UFH (OR, 0.72 [95% CrI, 0.46–0.98]; moderate certainty). Compressive devices may reduce risk of DVT compared with control treatments; however, this is based on low-certainty evidence (OR, 0.85 [95% CrI, 0.50–1.50]). Combination therapy showed unclear effect on DVT compared with either therapy alone (very low certainty).

Interpretation

Among critically ill adults, compared with control treatment, LMWH reduces incidence of DVT, whereas UFH and mechanical compressive devices may reduce the risk of DVT. LMWH is probably more effective than UFH in reducing incidence of DVT and should be considered the primary pharmacologic agent for thromboprophylaxis. The efficacy and safety of combination pharmacologic therapy and mechanical compressive devices were unclear.

### Venous thromboembolism in the ICU: main characteristics, diagnosis and thromboprophylaxis [^113TDfKC]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Is there a rationale to use thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients?

Thromboprophylaxis is recommended in the general surgical and medical populations. In the ICU, three randomized controlled trials (RCTs), comparing thromboprophylaxis with placebo using objective screening for DVT (Table 4), found that the rate of DVT was significantly lower in the thromboprophylaxis group regardless of the thromboprophylaxis used, UFH or LMWH. The American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends thromboprophylaxis for prevention of VTE in critical care patients (grade Ia: strong recommendation with high quality of evidence). Moreover, omission of thromboprophylaxis within the first 24 hours of ICU admission without obvious reasons is associated with a higher risk of mortality in the ICU.

Table 4
Thromboprophylaxis in ICU (blinded randomized controlled trials)

COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CUS, compression ultrasonography; DVT deep vein thrombosis; MV mechanical ventilation; NR not reported; PE pulmonary embolism; SC subcutaneous; UFH unfractionated heparin

In the ICU, up to 80% of patients under thromboprophylaxis have at least one episode of bleeding, more often minor. Major bleeding is described in 5.6% of critically ill patients with or without preventive anticoagulation, and up to 7.2% when dalteparin is used in severe renal insufficiency patients.

### Treatment and prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy [^112SiWuc]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

The treatment and prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) in pregnant patients is challenging for several reasons. Coumarins can cause embryopathy and other adverse effects in the fetus. Although unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins, the cornerstones of initial therapy, are safe for the fetus, they can have significant maternal side effects, including osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia. Because they must be given parenterally, long-term administration is inconvenient. Further, although low-molecular-weight heparins probably cause less maternal osteoporosis and thrombocytopenia than unfractionated heparin, the appropriate dosing regimens for prevention and treatment of thrombosis during pregnancy have not been established. In addition, there is a paucity of reliable information on the incidence of venous thromboembolism and the risk of recurrent thrombosis during pregnancy. This paper briefly reviews the areas of controversy and provides recommendations for the treatment and prophylaxis of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnant patients.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^116V1zff]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.

Objective

A committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.

Methods

Evidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).

Results

On the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term "proximal venous thrombosis" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of < 14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.

### Combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression and pharmacological prophylaxis for prevention of venous thromboembolism [^114x9fRs]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

It is generally assumed by practitioners and guideline authors that combined modalities (methods of treatment) are more effective than single modalities in preventing venous thromboembolism (VTE), defined as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), or both. This is the second update of the review first published in 2008.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of combined intermittent pneumatic leg compression (IPC) and pharmacological prophylaxis compared to single modalities in preventing VTE.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and AMED databases, and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 18 January 2021. We searched the reference lists of relevant articles for additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of combined IPC and pharmacological interventions used to prevent VTE compared to either intervention individually.

Data Collection and Analysis

We independently selected studies, applied Cochrane's risk of bias tool, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. We performed fixed-effect model meta-analyses with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model when there was heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE. The outcomes of interest were PE, DVT, bleeding and major bleeding.

Main Results

We included a total of 34 studies involving 14,931 participants, mainly undergoing surgery or admitted with trauma. Twenty-five studies were RCTs (12,672 participants) and nine were CCTs (2259 participants). Overall, the risk of bias was mostly unclear or high. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence and this was downgraded due to the risk of bias, imprecision or indirectness. The addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC compared with IPC alone reduced the incidence of symptomatic PE from 1.34% (34/2530) in the IPC group to 0.65% (19/2932) in the combined group (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.91; 19 studies, 5462 participants, low-certainty evidence). The incidence of DVT was 3.81% in the IPC group and 2.03% in the combined group showing a reduced incidence of DVT in favour of the combined group (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.72; 18 studies, 5394 participants, low-certainty evidence). The addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC, however, increased the risk of any bleeding compared to IPC alone: 0.95% (22/2304) in the IPC group and 5.88% (137/2330) in the combined group (OR 6.02, 95% CI 3.88 to 9.35; 13 studies, 4634 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Major bleeding followed a similar pattern: 0.34% (7/2054) in the IPC group compared to 2.21% (46/2079) in the combined group (OR 5.77, 95% CI 2.81 to 11.83; 12 studies, 4133 participants, very low-certainty evidence). Tests for subgroup differences between orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic surgery participants were not possible for PE incidence as no PE events were reported in the orthopaedic subgroup. No difference was detected between orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic surgery participants for DVT incidence (test for subgroup difference P = 0.19). The use of combined IPC and pharmacological prophylaxis modalities compared with pharmacological prophylaxis alone reduced the incidence of PE from 1.84% (61/3318) in the pharmacological prophylaxis group to 0.91% (31/3419) in the combined group (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.71; 15 studies, 6737 participants, low-certainty evidence). The incidence of DVT was 9.28% (288/3105) in the pharmacological prophylaxis group and 5.48% (167/3046) in the combined group (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.70; 17 studies; 6151 participants, high-certainty evidence). Increased bleeding side effects were not observed for IPC when it was added to anticoagulation (any bleeding: OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.35, 6 studies, 1314 participants, very low-certainty evidence; major bleeding: OR 1.21, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.18, 5 studies, 908 participants, very low-certainty evidence). No difference was detected between the orthopaedic and non-orthopaedic surgery participants for PE incidence (test for subgroup difference P = 0.82) or for DVT incidence (test for subgroup difference P = 0.69).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that combining IPC with pharmacological prophylaxis, compared to IPC alone reduces the incidence of both PE and DVT (low-certainty evidence). Combining IPC with pharmacological prophylaxis, compared to pharmacological prophylaxis alone, reduces the incidence of both PE (low-certainty evidence) and DVT (high-certainty evidence). We downgraded due to risk of bias in study methodology and imprecision. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the addition of pharmacological prophylaxis to IPC increased the risk of bleeding compared to IPC alone, a side effect not observed when IPC is added to pharmacological prophylaxis (very low-certainty evidence), as expected for a physical method of thromboprophylaxis. The certainty of the evidence for bleeding was downgraded to very low due to risk of bias in study methodology, imprecision and indirectness. The results of this update agree with current guideline recommendations, which support the use of combined modalities in hospitalised people (limited to those with trauma or undergoing surgery) at risk of developing VTE. More studies on the role of combined modalities in VTE prevention are needed to provide evidence for specific patient groups and to increase our certainty in the evidence.

Background

There is a high incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19.VTE is the most common thrombotic complication and has been reported in up to 23% of critically ill patients with COVID-19. Consequently, there has been intense clinical and research interest in establishing whether intensified thromboprophylaxis regimens are needed in this population. However, critically ill patients may be at increased risk for bleeding complications, which may also occur in patients with COVID-19–related critical illness. The optimal strategy for thromboprophylaxis that balances these thrombosis and bleeding risks remains uncertain.

These guidelines are based on updated and original systematic reviews of evidence conducted under the direction of the McMaster University Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre with international collaborators. This is an update of the previous ASH guideline published in February 2021, and it focuses on intermediate-intensity vs prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. The panel followed best practices for guideline development recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network. The panel used the GRADE approachto assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate recommendations. The recommendation is listed in Table 1.

### Duration of primary / secondary treatment to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ke753]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Antithrombotic therapy can prevent recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). It is, however, associated with an increased risk for major bleeding. This meta-analysis systematically reviewed the evidence regarding the duration of antithrombotic therapy to assess benefits and harms. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared shorter (3–6 months) with longer (> 6 months) courses of anticoagulation for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or that compared discontinued with indefinite antithrombotic therapy for the secondary prevention of VTE. Pairs of reviewers screened the eligible trials and collected data. This study included 22 RCTs (11 617 participants). Pooled estimates showed that, for the primary treatment of unprovoked VTE, VTE provoked by chronic risk factors or transient risk factors, treating patients with a longer course (> 6 months) of anticoagulation, as opposed to a shorter course (3–6 months), probably reduced recurrent PE (risk ratio [RR], 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–1.02) and DVT (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63–1.14), but it was associated with increased mortality (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.85–2.41) (moderate certainty) and a higher risk for major bleeding (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02–3.98; high certainty). For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE and VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, when compared with discontinuing treatment, indefinite anticoagulation therapy was associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.36–0.81), a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.16–0.41) and DVT (RR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10–0.21), and an increase in the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.18–3.30), all supported by high certainty. Indefinite antiplatelet therapy may be associated with decreased mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.53–1.68; low certainty), probably a reduction in recurrent PE (RR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.41–1.03) and DVT (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.17–1.13) (moderate certainty), and may increase the risk for bleeding (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.48–3.41; low certainty). In summary, for the primary treatment of all types of VTE, shorter (3–6 months) duration of anticoagulation is more beneficial. For the secondary prevention of unprovoked VTE or VTE provoked by chronic risk factors, indefinite antithrombotic treatment is more beneficial.

ASH 2019 venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention in surgical patients — scope, risk context, and methods are outlined as follows: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are recognized postoperative complications, with surgery accounting for ∼25% of VTEs in communities and high-risk procedures including hip and knee arthroplasty, invasive neurosurgical procedures, and major vascular procedures; postoperative VTE often occurs in the days to weeks following hospital discharge, and risk assessment tools such as the Caprini score have been developed. The primary target population is patients hospitalized for major surgical procedures at risk for postoperative VTE, with target populations including surgery for cancer or noncancer-related procedures and patients hospitalized for major trauma included whether they underwent surgery or not. For prevention in the postoperative period, the panel recognized 2 major modalities — pharmacological anticoagulant prophylaxis and mechanical prophylaxis — and the panel developed and graded recommendations and assessed certainty using the GRADE approach, with patient engagement noted as Eight patient representatives participating in question prioritization and 1 participating in all remaining steps.

### Antithrombotic therapy for VTE disease: second update of the CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^113Xpz9Z]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the 2nd update to the 9th edition of these guidelines. We provide recommendations on 17 PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) questions, four of which have not been addressed previously.

Methods

We generate strong and weak recommendations based on high-, moderate-, and low-certainty evidence, using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

Results

The panel generated 29 guidance statements, 13 of which are graded as strong recommendations, covering aspects of antithrombotic management of VTE from initial management through secondary prevention and risk reduction of postthrombotic syndrome. Four new guidance statements have been added that did not appear in the 9th edition (2012) or 1st update (2016). Eight statements have been substantially modified from the 1st update.

Conclusion

New evidence has emerged since 2016 that further informs the standard of care for patients with VTE. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding important management questions, particularly in limited disease and special patient populations.

ASH 2019 surgical VTE prophylaxis — combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis versus mechanical prophylaxis alone: For patients undergoing major surgery, the ASH guideline panel suggests using combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis or mechanical prophylaxis alone, depending on the risk of VTE and bleeding based on the individual patient and the type of surgical procedure (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯). Remark: For patients considered at high risk for VTE, combined prophylaxis is particularly favored over mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis alone. Mortality is likely no different between strategies (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.67–2.30), corresponding to 3 more (4 fewer to 17 more) deaths per 1000 patients. Symptomatic pulmonary embolism is likely reduced with combined prophylaxis (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13–0.90), which likely corresponds to 5 fewer (1–7 fewer) per 1000 at a baseline risk assumed to be 0.8% or 1.1% and to 7 fewer (1–10 fewer) per 1000 in a higher-risk population. Symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.07–6.75) and symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.06–2.42) may be similar between interventions. Combined prophylaxis likely increases major bleeding (RR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.09–4.57), corresponding to 14 more (1–42 more) per 1000 patients, and major reoperation rates may be similar (RR, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.73–12.05), corresponding to 4 more (1 fewer to 21 more) per 1000 patients. The overall certainty in the evidence of effects was rated as low, and the panel concluded that for patients at high risk for VTE and major bleeding risk low, combined mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis should be considered, whereas for patients at high bleeding risk, mechanical prophylaxis methods alone may be preferred.

Additionally, the insertion of a vena cava filter may be offered as an adjunct to anticoagulation in patients with progression of thrombosis despite optimal anticoagulant therapy, based on expert opinion noting the absence of a survival improvement, a limited short-term benefit, and mounting evidence of the long-term increased risk for VTE; type is Informal consensus with Evidence quality Low to Intermediate and Strength of recommendation Weak.

Summary of recommendations

Recommendation 3

The ASH guideline panel suggests that outpatient anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis not be used for patients with COVID-19 who are being discharged from the hospital and do not have suspected or confirmed venous thromboembolism (VTE) or another indication for anticoagulation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕◯◯◯).

Remarks:

An individualized assessment of the patient's risk of thrombosis and bleeding and shared decision making are important when deciding on whether to use postdischarge thromboprophylaxis. Prospectively validated risk assessment models to estimate thrombotic and bleeding risk in COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge are not available.
The panel acknowledged that postdischarge thromboprophylaxis may be reasonable for patients judged to be at high risk of thrombosis and low risk of bleeding.

Background

Hospitalization for acute medical illness is a common risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE), with most such events occurring after hospital discharge. Meanwhile, there is a high incidence of thrombotic complications in patients hospitalized for COVID-19–related acute illness or critical illness. However, there are limited reports regarding rates of VTE after discharge for patients who have been hospitalized for COVID-19. Thus, there has been much interest in establishing whether postdischarge pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in this population is warranted.

These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of evidence conducted under the direction of the McMaster University GRADE (grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluations) Centre with international collaborators. This is an update of the previous American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline published in February 2021and focuses on the role of thromboprophylaxis for patients discharged from the hospital after COVID-19. The panel followed best practice for guideline development recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network (GIN).

ASH 2019 VTE prevention in surgical patients — pharmacological versus mechanical prophylaxis: In patients undergoing major surgery, there may be no difference in mortality between pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis (relative risk [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46–1.84; low certainty in the evidence of effects) and there may be no difference for symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.36–2.96; low certainty in the evidence of effects), with likely little or no difference in symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.41–1.32; moderate certainty in the evidence of effects). Pharmacological prophylaxis likely reduces symptomatic distal DVT risk (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05–0.58; moderate certainty in the evidence of effects) but probably results in a small absolute increase of major bleeding (RR, 2.01; 95% CI, 0.29–14.05; low certainty in the evidence of effects). The panel determined that, on balance, neither approach was favored over the other for patients at low or moderate bleeding risk, and for patients at high baseline risk for major bleeding, mechanical prophylaxis would more clearly be favored because of the incremental risk of bleeding with pharmacological prophylaxis.

Major trauma venous thromboembolism prophylaxis — For patients experiencing major trauma in whom pharmacological prophylaxis is used, the ASH guideline panel suggests using low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) (conditional recommendation based on low certainty). LMWH vs UFH appears to result in little or no difference in mortality (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.14–12.39), corresponding to 2 more (4 fewer to 54 more) deaths per 1000; similarly, LMWH may result in little or no difference in symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.11–9.92), corresponding to 0 fewer (6 fewer to 6 more) symptomatic PEs per 1000 based on a baseline risk of 0.7% from observational data. LMWH vs UFH likely results in no important effect on proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.25–1.31), corresponding to 5 fewer (5 fewer to 2 more) symptomatic proximal DVTs per 1000 based on a baseline risk of 0.7%. LMWH probably results in little or no difference in symptomatic distal DVTs (RR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.46–1.20), corresponding to 0 fewer per 1000 based on a 0.1% baseline risk. LMWH may result in a small increase in major bleeding (RR, 2.4; 95% CI, 0.53–10.78), corresponding to 20 more (7 fewer to 138 more) major bleeding events per 1000 patients receiving LMWH vs UFH, and the overall certainty in the evidence for the effects was rated as low.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114xN52e]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis — estimating absolute benefits using combined asymptomatic and symptomatic event data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrates how relative effects translate into absolute risk reductions: assuming the combined end point relative risk (RR) was 0.6 (a 40% reduction), with control risks of 1% symptomatic pulmonary embolus and 4% symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT), absolute reductions would be 0.4% for pulmonary embolus (one in 250 patients) and 1.6% for DVT (one in ≈63 patients). In an orthopaedic surgical patient example, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) trials were used to derive a control risk and, to estimate the absolute reduction in symptomatic DVT with unfractionated heparin (UFH), investigators applied the RR from RCTs of the combined end point; the reported RR was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.36–0.5), the control group risk over the first 14 days after surgery was 1.5%, and the absolute benefit was 10 fewer events per 1,000 (95% CI, from nine fewer to 12 fewer). This approach provides a more precise estimate of relative risk than relying only on fewer symptomatic events but requires assuming the relative effect is the same for symptomatic and asymptomatic events and, because of limitations and uncertainty, "can yield, at best, moderate confidence in estimates".

### Provider preferences for DVT prophylaxis [^112LEJm4]. Thrombosis Research (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Patients admitted to medicine wards are typically elderly with multiple co-morbidities, placing them at significant risk for venous thromboembolic (VTE) disease. Standard guidelines to help physicians assess risk and institute prophylaxis do not currently exist for this patient population. Our purpose was to assess how clinicians would rate a patient's risk for VTE and what recommendations they would make for prophylaxis.

Methods

Internal medicine residents and staff at a tertiary care medical center were asked to identify risk factors, evaluate VTE risk, and recommend a method of prophylaxis for patients described in eight clinical vignettes created by the authors. Each vignette was designed to represent a patient at a specific level of risk.

Results

35 physicians returned the survey. Responders were able to identify some risk factors and weigh them appropriately when assigning an overall risk level. There was good agreement on risk level among responders (k = 0.62) and moderate agreement comparing responders with our pre-defined gold standard (GS) (k = 0.42). Compared to the GS they underestimated the level of risk almost 50% of the time. The risk level they assigned affected the type of prophylaxis recommended, with fewer low risk patients receiving any type of heparin and more high risk patients receiving low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

Conclusions

Although internal medicine physicians are able to identify some risk factors for in-hospital VTE, they consistently underestimate the overall risk, leading to less aggressive preventative measures. Continuing education is essential to combating this preventable inpatient complication.

Venous Thromboprophylaxis

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a complication after TKA that is associated with notable patient morbidity, mortality, and economic cost. Thromboprophylaxis has been a topic of ongoing debate with literature and guidelines providing a variety of recommendations.

Thromboprophylaxis can be divided into mechanical and pharmacological prevention. Mechanical methods include mobilization, graduated compression stockings, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices (IPCDs). IPCDs can have a relative risk reduction for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) of greater than 50%, without the risk of bleeding, or any other notable complication. However, compliance remains a major challenge limiting their use. Given the possible effectiveness combined with the low-risk profile, the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommends dual prophylaxis with an antithrombotic agent and an IPCD during the hospital stay (grade 2C).

Regarding medical management for deep vein thrombosis, more specifically with respect to choice of anticoagulation, initial management, provoked thrombosis, AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend to administer a direct-acting OAC as the preferred therapy for VTE for initial management and primary treatment, rather than a VKA or LMWH, in the absence of disease or patient-related contraindications.

### Deep venous thrombosis [^112dRik8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the third most common cardiovascular disorder, affecting up to 5% of the population. VTE commonly manifests as lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism. Half of these events are associated with a transient risk factor and may be preventable with prophylaxis. Direct oral anticoagulants are effective and safe and carry a lower risk for bleeding than vitamin K antagonists. Many patients with VTE will have a chronic disease requiring long-term anticoagulation. Postthrombotic syndrome affects 25% to 40% of patients with DVT and significantly impacts function and quality of life.

### American Society of Hematology living guidelines on the use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: March 2022 update on the use of anticoagulation in critically ill patients [^1116ixCS]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a high incidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Earlier in the pandemic, VTE was reported in up to 22.7% of such patients despite the use of standard thromboprophylaxis. Thrombosis of the microvasculature contributes to other complications of COVID-19 including respiratory failure and death. At the same time, higher-intensity anticoagulation is associated with an increased risk of bleeding among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Consequently, there has been strong interest in establishing whether intensified anticoagulant regimens improve outcomes.

These guidelines are based on systematic reviews of evidence conducted under the direction of the McMaster University Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Centre with international collaborators. This is an update on the previous American Society of Hematology (ASH) guideline published in May 2021, and focuses on the role of anticoagulation for patients with COVID-19–related critical illness. The panel followed best practice for guideline development recommended by the Institute of Medicine and the Guidelines International Network. The panel used the GRADE approachto assess the certainty of the evidence and formulate recommendations. The recommendation is listed in Table 1.

Table 1.
Recommendations

Values and preferences

- The guideline panel identified all-cause mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), major bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, multiple organ failure, limb amputation, invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and length of hospitalization as critical outcomes and placed a high value on reducing these outcomes with the interventions assessed.
- Panel members noted that there was possible uncertainty and variability in the relative value that patients place on avoiding major bleeding events compared with reducing thrombotic events.

### Practices to prevent venous thromboembolism: a brief review [^116pJKpW]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2014). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Strong evidence from numerous high quality trials supports the effectiveness of VTE prophylaxis for specific populations. However, there are significant potential harms and risk stratification is necessary to ensure that prophylaxis is targeted to appropriate patients. Unfortunately, rates of VTE prophylaxis remain suboptimal, and VTE continues to be a difficult and elusive crisis in patient safety. Relatively little evidence exists on which specific interventions are effective for increasing rates of VTE prophylaxis in appropriate populations. As with other patient safety interventions, educating providers on the benefits of appropriate VTE prophylaxis alone is not an effective strategy to improve use of appropriate VTE prophylaxis. Evidence, although mostly low quality (non-randomised studies without concurrent controls), supports that education combined with other quality improvement strategies and information technology approaches such as alerts and mandatory computerised clinical decision support, appear to offer the most effective approaches to promote best practice prophylaxis use and prevent patient harm resulting from VTE.

### Risk factors for venous thromboembolism [^115vfecb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE) are often modifiable and overlap with risk factors for coronary artery disease. Encouraging our patients to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle by abstaining from cigarettes, maintaining lean weight, limiting red meat intake, and controlling hypertension might lower the risk of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), although a cause-effect relationship has not been firmly established. For hospitalized patients, guidelines have provided evidence-based strategies to identify patients at risk, such as elderly persons and those with cancer, congestive heart failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or undergoing major surgery. Most should receive pharmacological prophylaxis, which will minimize the risk of VTE. Because approximately 3 of every 4 pulmonary embolism and DVT events occur outside the hospital setting, patients should also be assessed for persistent high-risk of VTE at the time of hospital discharge.

Major general surgery — pharmacological prophylaxis versus no pharmacological prophylaxis: The ASH guideline panel suggests using pharmacological prophylaxis over no pharmacological prophylaxis (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects). Pharmacological prophylaxis probably reduces mortality (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.61–0.93), corresponding to 4 fewer deaths (1–7 fewer) per 1000 patients undergoing major general surgery, and probably reduces symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23–0.88), corresponding to 4 fewer (1–6 fewer) pulmonary embolic events per 1000. It may also reduce symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.14–1.00), corresponding to 10 fewer (0–14 fewer) symptomatic proximal DVTs per 1000 based on a baseline risk of 1.6%, and may reduce symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.36–0.90), corresponding to 1 fewer (0–1 fewer) per 1000. Pharmacological prophylaxis probably increases major bleeding (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.89–2.13), corresponding to 10 more (3 fewer to 29 more) major bleeding events per 1000, and results in little or no difference in reoperation (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.21–2.77). The panel judged that the overall balance of effects favored pharmacological prophylaxis over no pharmacological prophylaxis in patients undergoing major general surgery based on low certainty in the evidence of effects.

ASH 2019 VTE prevention — combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis in major surgery: For patients undergoing major surgery who receive pharmacologic prophylaxis, the panel suggests using combined prophylaxis with mechanical and pharmacological methods over pharmacological prophylaxis alone (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects). Mortality may show no difference between combined and pharmacological prophylaxis alone (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.06–1.38), corresponding to 5 fewer (7 fewer to 3 more) deaths per 1000 patients. There may be a reduction in symptomatic pulmonary emboli (PEs) with combined prophylaxis (RR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.25–0.65). The risks of symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.01–2.63) and symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 1.99; 95% CI, 0.35–11.33) are very uncertain. Rates of major bleeding may be similar (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.32–3.40), corresponding to 0 fewer (5 fewer to 17 more) events per 1000 patients, and the RR of major reoperation could not be estimated because there were no events in either group in 2 included trials. The panel judged that combined pharmacological and mechanical prophylaxis would be most beneficial for patients considered at very high risk for VTE following major surgery, and noted in a remark that for patients considered at high risk for VTE, combined prophylaxis is particularly favored over mechanical or pharmacological prophylaxis alone.

### Thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized and nonhospitalized medical patients: what's new? [^116UveC1]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Mechanical thromboprophylaxis in patients who are hospitalized and critically ill (recommendation 9)

The PREVENT Trial randomized 2003 adult patients who were critically ill to pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone (unfractionated or low molecular weight heparin) vs pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis plus intermittent pneumatic compressionThe latter did not result in a significantly lower incidence of proximal lower limb, deep vein thrombosis than pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis alone (relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60–1.44). Although this study was published after the "2018 ASH VTE guideline on thromboprophylaxis for hospitalized and nonhospitalized medical patients", the results of trial did not change the recommendation, which suggests "pharmacological VTE prophylaxis alone over mechanical VTE prophylaxis combined with pharmacological VTE prophylaxis (conditional recommendation, very low certainty in the evidence of effects)".

### Meta-analysis of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medically ill patients [^111xcJBR]. Clinical Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in medically ill patients has received a level 1A recommendation in previously published clinical guidelines. Pharmacologic prophylaxis for VTE includes unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), and fondaparinux. Few direct comparisons between anticoagulants exist in medically ill patients.

Objective

This meta-analysis was conducted to assess UFH and LMWH (including the selective factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux) in the reduction of in-hospital VTE in unselected medically ill patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry databases from January 1981 through September 2007 (English language) for randomized controlled trials using the following terms: dalteparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, nadroparin, and heparin. References of included articles and key review papers for additional studies were also searched. Data from studies were included in the analysis if the studies included medically ill patients with risk factors for VTE who had been followed up for 7 to 21 days.

Results

A total of 12,391 patients (of whom 8357 were in placebo-controlled trials) from 9 studies were included. Mean age for the entire cohort was 72.8 years; mean (SD) body mass index, 25.6 kg/m2; and mean (SD) actual body weight, 68.2 kg. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was significantly reduced with the addition of an LMWH compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47–0.75; P ≤ 0.001), but rates of DVT were similar when comparing LMWH with UFH (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56–1.52). No significant differences in pulmonary embolism (PE) or death were found among the UFH, LMWH, and placebo groups. LMWH was associated with a significant increased risk for minor bleeding compared with placebo (OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.18–2.29; P = 0.003). However, no significant difference was found between LMWH and UFH (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.27–1.70). Major bleeding events were similar among all groups: LMWH/fondaparinux versus placebo, OR, 1.65 (95% CI, 0.8–3.4); LMWH/fondaparinux versus UFH, OR, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.29–1.68); LMWH/fondaparinux versus UFH or placebo, OR, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.66–2.04).

Conclusions

This analysis suggests that VTE prophylaxis with an LMWH (including fondaparinux) or UFH is effective in reducing the rate of DVT, but this benefit did not extend to enhanced protection against PE. Additionally, LMWH and UFH had similar bleeding outcomes.

Reevaluation of evidence — patient-important vs surrogate outcomes: Applying the ACCP-GRADE approach requires distinguishing patient-important from surrogate outcomes; for example, an intervention that increases serious bleeding by 20 events in 1,000 patients but reduces asymptomatic thrombosis by 100 in 1,000 leaves net benefit unclear without knowing the symptomatic DVT and pulmonary embolism reductions. The authors highlight the need for studies that directly measure symptomatic thrombosis without venographic or ultrasound surveillance.

Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) after aneurysm repair: Early mobilization and shorter length of stay have reduced venous thromboembolism after aortic surgery, with NSQIP data showing the 30-day incidence after open aneurysm repair and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) was < 2% and 1%, respectively. Although most patients were asymptomatic, 21% had acute DVT in one postoperative venography series. Using the Caprini scheme, most patients are moderate (Caprini risk score of 3 or 4) or high (Caprini risk score ≥ 5) risk; for example, 61 years of age or older and surgery > 45 minutes yield a Caprini risk score of 4. For prevention, "We recommend thromboprophylaxis that includes intermittent pneumatic compression and early ambulation for all patients undergoing OSR or EVAR" (Level of recommendation 1 [Strong]; Quality of evidence A [High]), and "We suggest thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin for patients undergoing aneurysm repair at moderate to high risk for venous thromboembolism and low risk for bleeding" (Level of recommendation 2 [Weak]; Quality of evidence C [Low]).

### A systematic review of strategies to improve prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in hospitals [^111Ewc3n]. Annals of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effectiveness of different strategies for increasing the uptake of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in hospitalized patients through a systematic review of the literature.

Methods

Literature databases and the Internet were searched from 1996 to May 2003. Studies of strategies to improve VTE prophylaxis practice were included. Studies where no policy or guideline was implemented or where the focus of the study was not VTE prevention were excluded.

Results

Thirty studies were included. The quality of the available evidence was average with the majority of studies being uncontrolled before and after design and thus limited by the historical nature of much of the available data. Adherence to guidelines and the provision of adequate prophylaxis were poor in studies which relied on passive dissemination of guidelines. In general, the use of multiple strategies was more effective than a single strategy used in isolation. The most effective strategies incorporated a system for reminding clinicians to assess patients for VTE risk, either electronic decision-support systems or paper-based reminders, and used audit and feedback to facilitate the iterative refinement of the intervention. There were no studies adequately powered to demonstrate a reduction in rates of VTE. Insufficient evidence was available to make useful comparisons of strategies in terms of costs and resource utilization.

Conclusions

Passive dissemination of guidelines is unlikely to improve VTE prophylaxis practice. A number of active strategies used together, which incorporate some method for reminding clinicians to assess patients for DVT risk and assisting the selection of appropriate prophylaxis, are likely to result in the achievement of optimal outcomes.

### Multidisciplinary, patient-centred approach to improving compliance with venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in a district general hospital [^114uBJxa]. BMJ Open Quality (2020). High credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired VTE comprises all occurrences of VTE that develop while an in-patient or in the 90 days following discharge from hospital. Hospital-acquired VTE is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, currently estimated to account for 5%–10% of all deaths among hospitalised patients. As a potentially preventable problem, strategies to improve rates of VTE prophylaxis prescription in patients admitted to secondary care have been demonstrated to reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.

In 2005, a report issued by the House of Commons Health Committee highlighted that an estimated 25 000 people die from preventable HAT each year in the UK. In addition, the cost to the National Health Service (NHS) of treating non-fatal symptomatic VTE and the long-term complications is calculated at £640 million per year, demonstrating that this is an expensive, nationwide problem.

NICE published guidelines on the prevention of VTE in hospitalised patients in 2010, which was subsequently updated in 2018. This highlights clinical and cost-effective measures for VTE prophylaxis and in addition taking patients' preferences and risks of treatment into consideration. The Commissioning for Quality and Innovation framework endorsed these guidelines and suggested there ought to be a 95% compliance rate with VTE risk assessment using a national tool.VTE prophylaxis via mechanical and pharmacological measures has been shown to reduce the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and subsequent VTE.

The NICE guidelines focus on all patients over the age of 16 years admitted to hospital presenting to a variety of different specialties. In the context of patients admitted under general medicine, the guidelines stipulate that all medical patients should be risk assessed for VTE as soon as possible after admission using a tool published by a national UK body, most commonly the Department of Health VTE risk assessment tool will be used.

The benefits of MDT working are well established. For healthcare professionals, MDTs assist in increased rates of care provision in accordance with clinical guidelines, the development of streamlined treatment pathways, improved interdisciplinary coordination, communication and improved education of staff. For the patient, the benefits of MDT collaboration also include the increased access to treatment in accordance with evidence-based medicine, which will be of benefit to the patient, as well as improved access to information and consequently greater levels of patient satisfaction. Multidisciplinary quality improvement initiatives have previously been shown to be effective in different clinical environments.

CHEST guideline update — COVID-19 thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized patients provides separate guidance statements for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention for hospitalized patients with acute (moderate) illness and critically ill patients in the ICU, and divides each original question and resulting recommendation into two questions: standard prophylaxis vs therapeutic (or escalated dose) prophylaxis and standard prophylaxis vs intermediate dose prophylaxis. Critically ill patients should receive standard thromboprophylaxis for VTE, moderately ill patients with a low bleeding risk might benefit from therapeutic heparin, and "We see no role for intermediate dose thromboprophylaxis in either setting". This update led to a change in one recommendation and an upgrading of three additional recommendations based upon higher quality evidence.

### Ensuring timely thromboprophylaxis on a medical assessment unit [^111BVfmL]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous Thromboembolism or VTE is a collective name for clots in veins. Usually these develop in the large veins of the legs or pelvis (Deep Vein Thrombosis-DVT) or lungs (Pulmonary Embolism-PE). Evidence suggests that the risk for VTE extends for at least three months following discharge from hospital (million Women study), subsequently termed Hospital Acquired Thrombosis (HAT).

A Cochrane study in 2009 estimated that two thirds of PE is hospital-acquired and that 70% of deaths occur in medical inpatients. The risk of VTE in medical admissions vary from 15% in general medical patients to 50% in stroke patients, while clinically recognised PE occurs in 1%. It has been recognised in medical patients, that the key risk factors for thrombosis, include personal risk factors such as previous VTE, malignancy, obesity, age over 60, immobility/inactivity. Also acute ill health causing hospitalisation such as sepsis, exacerbation of inflammatory illness and significant medical co-morbidities including heart disease, metabolic, respiratory and endocrine pathologies are all contributory factors. Therefore, the majority of medical patients admitted to hospital have an increased risk for VTE.

Since the House of Commons Health Committee report, a significant number of measures have been introduced to support the prevention of VTE as a priority for the NHS, through the implementation of the National VTE Prevention Programme which provides a comprehensive, integrated and financially incentivised approach to prevent VTE. The Programme includes publication of the key documents: The NICE Clinical Guideline 92, updated January 2010 on venous thromboembolism, The NICE VTE prevention Quality Standard (QS3), The NICE pathway for VTE prevention, the national CQUIN (commissioning for quality and innovation) goal for VTE prevention and a national tool for VTE risk assessment.

The effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis in medical patients has been reviewed by Cochrane [6] and NICE [2]. There are 5 RCT's comparing low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) to placebo in the prevention of PE in medical patients, and 4 comparing LMWH to unfractionated heparin (UFH). These trials administered prophylactic anticoagulation for up to 10 days. LMWH treatment reduced the incidence of DVT by 60%, and symptomatic PE by 39% compared to placebo (RR 0.61, 95%CI 0.25, 1.5).

### Prevention of VTE in orthopedic surgery patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^111d1Dg9]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

American College of Chest Physicians guideline — deriving baseline symptomatic VTE risk without prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery notes considerable effort to estimate baseline risk in the absence of prophylaxis, with randomized controlled trial data typically showing a symptomatic VTE event rate of 15% to 30% without prophylaxis prior to 1980. Because in recent years there have been no large placebo controlled trials, baseline risk was estimated by applying the observed risk of symptomatic VTE in patients treated with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and adjusting it by the relative risk reduction from prior randomized trials of LMWH vs placebo. Contemporary LMWH event rates were averaged from trials enrolling > 16,000 patients since 2003, and were compared with an observational cohort in which investigators identified 103 of 13,956 (0.7%) VTE events during the initial hospitalization for patients receiving prophylaxis (estimated prophylaxis compliance, 86%). Assuming similar LMWH effects for asymptomatic and symptomatic disease, the best evidence suggests LMWH reduces the risk for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by 50% to 60% and pulmonary embolism (PE) by about two-thirds, yielding contemporary off-prophylaxis rates of ∼1.5% for symptomatic DVT and 1% for PE for the first 7 to 14 days.

### Venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment and prophylaxis in acute orthopaedic admissions: improving compliance with national guidelines [^115PDYgz]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thrombosis is when a blood clot forms within a vein. These blood clots can occur in either the deep or the superficial veins of the body. However, it is clots within the deep venous system (deep venous thrombosis-DVTs) which are most concerning due to the risk of pulmonary embolus (PE), where part of the clot breaks off and travels to the lungs, restricting gas exchange within that area. DVTs frequently occur in the deep veins of the legs, where they may be asymptomatic or may cause pain and swelling of the affected leg. Long term they can lead to post-thrombotic syndrome, which results in considerable morbidity from chronic pain and swelling of the leg. Risk factors for VTE are well recognised and include surgery (especially pelvic or orthopaedic), immobility, malignancy, hormone replacement therapy or the oral contraceptive pill, inherited thrombophilias and, obesity.

Orthopaedic patients have a particularly high risk of DVT. Without appropriate prophylaxis, 45–51% of orthopaedic patients will develop a DVT and 10–20% will develop a proximal DVT, which carries a higher risk of PE. 4–10% will develop a clinically recognised PE and in 0.2–5% of patients this will be fatal. Evidence of DVT has also been found in up to 58% of major trauma patients. Importantly, effective methods for preventing many of these DVTs and PEs do exist. These methods exist in the form of mechanical means (anti-thromboembolism stockings-TEDs and foot pumps) or pharmacological methods, (low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is most common). Both the House of Commons report into VTE and the NICE guidance makes it clear that all hospital patients need to have their VTE risk assessed and appropriate prophylaxis prescribed.

### Thromboprophylaxis for trauma patients [^1125djK5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Trauma is a leading causes of death and disability in young people. Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a principal cause of death. Trauma patients are at high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The incidence varies according to the method used to measure the DVT and the location of the thrombosis. Due to prolonged rest and coagulation abnormalities, trauma patients are at increased risk of thrombus formation. Thromboprohylaxis, either mechanical or pharmacological, may decrease mortality and morbidity in trauma patients who survive beyond the first day in hospital, by decreasing the risk of VTE in this population. A previous systematic review did not find evidence of effectiveness for either pharmacological or mechanical interventions. However, this systematic review was conducted 10 years ago and most of the included studies were of poor quality. Since then new trials have been conducted. Although current guidelines recommend the use of thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients, there has not been a comprehensive and updated systematic review since the one published.

Objectives

To assess the effects of thromboprophylaxis in trauma patients on mortality and incidence of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. To compare the effects of different thromboprophylaxis interventions and their effects according to the type of trauma.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched April 30 2009), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials 2009, issue 2 (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1950 to April (week 3) 2009, EMBASE (Ovid) 1980 to (week 17) April 2009, PubMed (searched 29 April 2009), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to April 2009), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to April 2009).

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled clinical trials involving people of any age with major trauma defined by one or more of the following criteria: physiological: penetrating or blunt trauma with more than two organs and unstable vital signs, anatomical: people with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) higher than 9, mechanism: people who are involved in a 'high energy' event with a risk for severe injury despite stable or normal vital signs. We excluded trials that only recruited outpatients, trials that recruited people with hip fractures only, or people with acute spinal injuries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Four authors, in pairs (LB and CM, EF and RC), independently examined the titles and the abstracts, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias of the trials and analysed the data. PP resolved any disagreement between the authors.

Main Results

Sixteen studies were included (n = 3005). Four trials compared the effect of any type (mechanical and/or pharmacological) of prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis. Prophylaxis reduced the risk of DVT in people with trauma (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.84). Mechanical prophylaxis reduced the risk of DVT (RR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.73). Pharmacological prophylaxis was more effective than mechanical methods at reducing the risk of DVT (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25 to 0.95). LMWH appeared to reduce the risk of DVT compared to UH (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.94). People who received both mechanical and pharmacological prophylaxis had a lower risk of DVT (RR 0.34; 95% CI 0.19 to 0.60)

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find evidence that thromboprophylaxis reduces mortality or PE in any of the comparisons assessed. However, we found some evidence that thromboprophylaxis prevents DVT. Although the strength of the evidence was not high, taking into account existing information from other related conditions such as surgery, we recommend the use of any DVT prophylactic method for people with severe trauma.

### Approach to outcome measurement in the prevention of thrombosis in surgical and medical patients: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112R4Nh2]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Nonorthopedic surgery thromboprophylaxis — baseline risk source and IPC/LMWH effect estimates: In nonorthopedic surgery, the control risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) was taken from an observational cohort of 8,216 patients, with an estimated 26 of 1,000 moderate-risk patients experiencing VTE without prophylaxis; intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) lowered asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) risk with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.22–0.74), yielding an estimate of 13 fewer VTE per 1,000 patients (95% CI, 7–20), but because of indirectness from asymptomatic events and high risk of bias, overall confidence was low. A variant approach for low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) used the same observational baseline and drew relative effects from three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that reported symptomatic events, yet these studies had high risk of bias and the overall confidence in estimates was only moderate.

### Lenalidomide [^117MbrUh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous and Arterial Thromboembolism

Lenalidomide has demonstrated a significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with lenalidomide and dexamethasone therapy. Monitor for and advise patients about signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. Advise patients to seek immediate medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or leg swelling. Thromboprophylaxis is recommended and the choice of regimen should be based on an assessment of the patient's underlying risks [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY, and VENOUS and ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY

Lenalidomide, a thalidomide analogue, caused limb abnormalities in a developmental monkey study similar to birth defects caused by thalidomide in humans. If lenalidomide is used during pregnancy, it may cause birth defects or embryo-fetal death.
Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment. Prevent pregnancy during treatment by the use of two reliable methods of contraception (5.1).

Lenalidomide capsules are available only through a restricted distribution program called the Lenalidomide REMS program (5.2, 17).

HEMATOLOGIC TOXICITY.

Lenalidomide can cause significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (5.3).

VENOUS AND ARTERIAL THROMBOEMBOLISM

Significantly increased risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with multiple myeloma receiving lenalidomide with dexamethasone. Anti-thrombotic prophylaxis is recommended (5.4).

Inferior vena cava (IVC) filters — prophylaxis after major surgery or trauma: The panel suggests against using IVC filters for prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing major surgery or trauma based upon very low certainty in the evidence. IVC filter use may increase mortality slightly (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.81–2.37), corresponding to 4 more deaths (2 fewer to 10 more) per 1000 based on a 1.6% control risk; may reduce symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) (RR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.11–0.80), corresponding to 6 fewer (2 fewer to 9 fewer) symptomatic PEs or 8 fewer PEs (2–16 fewer) per 1000 at a 1.1% baseline risk; and may increase symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (RR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.07–4.50), corresponding to 20 more (1–58 more) or 31 more (2–92 more) per 1000 based on baseline risks of 1.6% and 2.6%, with uncertain effects on symptomatic distal DVT (RR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.41–5.21), corresponding to 2 more (1–6 more) to 4 more (1–9 more) per 1000 based on baseline risks of 0.1% and 0.2%.
