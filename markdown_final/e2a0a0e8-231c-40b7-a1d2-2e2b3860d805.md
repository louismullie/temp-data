## Question

shold i taper prednisone 5 mg/day use?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prednisone 5 mg/day should be tapered and, if so, how to taper it safely and effectively. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context and whether the underlying disease is controlled. Then, I should verify the duration of glucocorticoid exposure and the risk of HPA axis suppression. Next, I will review disease-specific guidance, especially for SLE and RA, and consider the physiologic dose threshold. After that, I need to outline a practical taper strategy, monitoring for withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency, and decide when to test the HPA axis. Finally, I will address special scenarios like long-acting steroids, stress dosing, and when to escalate steroid-sparing therapy if tapering fails.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because tapering should only be attempted if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required. Otherwise, tapering risks relapse and may be unsafe, so I need to check disease activity and stability before proceeding [^112xM1E2] [^117Cq7fW].

> Next, I should review duration of therapy and HPA axis risk. Wait, let me verify the thresholds. For courses shorter than about 3–4 weeks, abrupt cessation is generally acceptable because suppression risk is low, whereas for longer courses at or above physiologic doses, suppression is expected and a taper is warranted. The physiologic prednisone equivalent is roughly 4–6 mg/day, so 5 mg/day sits at the physiologic threshold, which means tapering should be slow and cautious from this point [^113QLgrN] [^1171fF7m] [^114DSdhQ].

> I will now examine disease-specific guidance. Hold on, I should verify SLE recommendations first. The 2025 ACR SLE guideline strongly recommends tapering to 5 mg/day or less within 6 months for stable controlled disease and conditionally recommends a slow taper toward discontinuation if remission is sustained on 5 mg/day or less; if tapering to 5 mg/day is not feasible, it advises initiating or escalating immunosuppressive therapy, which I should keep in mind if tapering stalls [^113z24Ry] [^115594Tb] [^111ewkiM].

> For rheumatoid arthritis, let me consider the SEMIRA trial. Continuing 5 mg/day prednisone for 24 weeks provided better disease control than tapering to zero in patients on tocilizumab, suggesting that at 5 mg/day, continuation may be reasonable in select RA patients to preserve control, though tapering should still be attempted when feasible and individualized to flare risk and comorbidities [^1138zgSy].

> Now, I need to ensure the taper strategy matches the physiologic context. At 5 mg/day, I should slow the pace and use small decrements. A practical approach is to reduce by 1 mg every 4 weeks, with longer holds if symptoms emerge, and to extend the taper over months; this aligns with endocrine guidance for slow tapers near physiologic doses and with rheumatology algorithms that taper by 1 mg every 4 weeks once remission is achieved [^114DSdhQ] [^116BYTxr] [^114vQBFm].

> But wait, what if withdrawal symptoms appear during the taper? I should double-check how to distinguish withdrawal from adrenal insufficiency and disease flare. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is common during taper and can overlap with adrenal insufficiency and inflammatory symptoms; if severe, temporarily increasing to the last tolerated dose and prolonging the taper is reasonable, while educating the patient about expected symptoms to avoid unnecessary dose escalations [^113REYhV] [^111XXZCf] [^1159BDJJ].

> Next, I should review whether to test the HPA axis. Hold on, I should verify the timing. Routine testing is not recommended while on supraphysiologic doses, but once at or near physiologic doses and aiming for discontinuation, a morning serum cortisol can guide whether the axis has recovered. A value above about 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) suggests recovery and supports safe discontinuation, whereas values 150–300 nmol/L warrant caution and repeat testing, and values below 150 nmol/L suggest persistent suppression and continued physiologic replacement with close follow-up [^1119HRB1] [^117JUADt] [^113uLZzA].

> I need to ensure stress coverage is addressed. Patients who are tapering or have uncertain HPA recovery should receive stress-dose steroids for intercurrent illness, surgery, or significant trauma to prevent adrenal crisis, with oral coverage for minor stress and parenteral coverage for major stress or inability to take oral medications [^115NiiPm].

> Let me consider special scenarios. If the patient is on a long-acting glucocorticoid like dexamethasone, I should switch to a shorter-acting agent such as prednisone or hydrocortisone before tapering to facilitate HPA recovery, and I should avoid nighttime dosing when possible to minimize suppression of the early-morning ACTH surge [^111Ve9bU] [^1117Dpyy].

> If tapering stalls at or above 5 mg/day, I should confirm whether steroid-sparing immunosuppression has been optimized. In SLE, guidelines conditionally recommend initiating or escalating immunosuppressants if prednisone cannot be reduced to 5 mg/day, which can enable further tapering and reduce cumulative steroid toxicity [^113z24Ry] [^115594Tb].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is yes, prednisone 5 mg/day should generally be tapered if the underlying disease is controlled, using a slow, 1 mg decrement every 4 weeks with close monitoring for withdrawal and disease flare, extending the timeline over months. If discontinuation is the goal, assess HPA recovery with a morning cortisol once at physiologic doses, provide stress-dose coverage when indicated, and escalate steroid-sparing therapy if tapering stalls, tailoring the plan to disease-specific guidance and patient-specific risk [^114DSdhQ] [^1119HRB1] [^115NiiPm] [^113z24Ry].

In most cases, **prednisone 5 mg/day should be tapered** if therapy has continued beyond 3–4 weeks, to reduce the risks of adrenal suppression and glucocorticoid-related adverse effects [^1119HRB1] [^114xQxfh]. Tapering is **especially important** in long-term users because even low doses can suppress the HPA axis [^117MR557]. The taper should be individualized: reduce by 1 mg every 2–4 weeks while monitoring for withdrawal, adrenal insufficiency, or disease flare [^114DSdhQ] [^111ewkiM]. If the underlying disease is active or relapse risk is high, consider slower tapering or maintaining 5 mg until stable [^1119HRB1]. Routine HPA axis testing is not required, but if attempted discontinuation fails, assess recovery with morning cortisol or ACTH stimulation [^1119HRB1] [^117JUADt].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the Endocrine Society (ES) provide clear recommendations on glucocorticoid tapering:

- **Taper indication**: Tapering is recommended when glucocorticoids have been used for more than 3–4 weeks, especially at doses above physiologic replacement (approximately 4–6 mg prednisone equivalent per day) [^1171fF7m] [^115NiiPm].

- **Physiologic threshold**: Doses at or below 4–6 mg prednisone equivalent per day are considered physiologic replacement doses, where tapering can proceed cautiously with monitoring for adrenal insufficiency [^1171fF7m] [^113G6wSi].

- **Tapering strategy**: Gradual dose reductions of 1 mg every 2–4 weeks are suggested, with slower tapering as the dose approaches physiologic levels [^114DSdhQ] [^112zPiSU].

---

## Risks associated with long-term prednisone use at 5 mg/day

Even at low doses, long-term prednisone use carries significant risks, including:

- **Adrenal suppression**: Chronic glucocorticoid use suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, potentially causing adrenal insufficiency upon abrupt discontinuation [^1171fF7m] [^117MR557].

- **Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**: Symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and mood disturbances can occur during tapering, overlapping with adrenal insufficiency and disease flare [^113REYhV] [^1159BDJJ].

- **Metabolic and cardiovascular risks**: Increased risk of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease has been documented even at low doses [^114xQxfh].

---

## Risks associated with abrupt discontinuation

Abrupt discontinuation of prednisone, particularly after long-term use, can precipitate **acute adrenal insufficiency**, a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by fatigue, hypotension, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and shock [^1142FRtj] [^1169c14X]. It can also trigger **disease flare or relapse**, as abrupt withdrawal may exacerbate the underlying inflammatory condition, causing significant morbidity [^116j4gaH] [^113MvbML].

---

## Recommended tapering strategies

Several tapering strategies are recommended by clinical guidelines:

| **Tapering strategy** | **Description** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Gradual dose reduction | Reduce by 1 mg every 2–4 weeks | Long-term glucocorticoid therapy (> 3–4 weeks) [^1119HRB1] |
| Alternate-day therapy | Transition to alternate-day dosing to minimize HPA suppression | Patients on prolonged daily glucocorticoid therapy [^1176ye1G] |
| Switch to hydrocortisone | Transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic doses (15–25 mg/day) | Patients requiring prolonged low-dose glucocorticoid therapy [^1171fF7m] [^114YTyrW] |

---

## Monitoring during tapering

During tapering, **close clinical monitoring** is essential to detect withdrawal symptoms, adrenal insufficiency, or disease flare. Morning serum cortisol can assess HPA axis recovery; levels > 300 nmol/L (10 µg/dL) suggest recovery, while levels < 150 nmol/L (5 µg/dL) indicate persistent suppression [^117JUADt] [^113uLZzA]. The ACTH stimulation test may be used when adrenal insufficiency is suspected or to confirm HPA recovery before complete discontinuation [^114YTyrW] [^117JUADt].

---

## Clinical scenarios where tapering may not be necessary

In select scenarios, tapering may not be necessary or may be contraindicated:

- **Short-term use**: Courses shorter than 3–4 weeks generally do not require tapering due to minimal HPA suppression risk [^113QLgrN] [^112yXkR9].

- **Active disease**: In patients with active inflammatory disease, abrupt tapering or discontinuation may precipitate relapse; tapering should proceed only once disease control is achieved [^112xM1E2] [^116j4gaH].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Individual patient factors, such as prior HPA suppression, significant comorbidities, or previous withdrawal symptoms, may necessitate individualized tapering strategies [^1117Dpyy] [^112zPiSU].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendation

Prednisone 5 mg/day should generally be **tapered** if therapy has continued beyond 3–4 weeks, to mitigate risks of adrenal suppression, withdrawal syndrome, and glucocorticoid-related adverse effects. Tapering should be individualized, with gradual dose reductions and close monitoring for withdrawal symptoms, adrenal insufficiency, and disease flare. Abrupt discontinuation is **not recommended** except in specific short-term use scenarios or when contraindicated by active disease.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

Adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy include higher event rates in exposed rheumatoid arthritis cohorts and risks even at low doses; a British cohort study involving 9387 patients with rheumatoid arthritis observed over a median of 8 years with an average prednisolone dose of 5.8 mg/day for approximately 9.5 months exhibited elevated rates of diabetes, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, thrombotic events, gastrointestinal complications, and increased mortality compared to those not treated with glucocorticoids, and studies have linked even low dose use (prednisone 2.5–7.5 mg/day) to increased risks.

### Impact of low disease activity, remission, and complete remission on flares following tapering of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematous: a multinational cohort study [^116j4gaH]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Targets of treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS), remission, and complete remission. Whether treatment can be tapered after attaining these targets and whether tapering is safer in patients in complete remission compared with LLDAS are unknown. We aimed to assess the odds of disease flares after treatment tapering in stable disease, versus continuing the same therapy. We also aimed to examine whether tapering in complete remission resulted in fewer flares or longer time to flare compared with tapering in LLDAS or remission.

Methods

This multinational cohort study was conducted at 25 sites across 13 Asia-Pacific countries. We included adult patients aged 18 years or older with stable SLE who were receiving routine clinical care, had two or more visits and had attained stable disease at one or more visits. We categorised stable disease into: LLDAS (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 [SLEDAI-2K] score ≤ 4, Physician Global Assessment [PGA] ≤ 1, and prednisolone ≤ 7·5 mg/day); Definitions of Remission in SLE (DORIS) remission (clinical SLEDAI-2K score 0, PGA < 0·5, and prednisolone ≤ 5 mg/day); or complete remission on therapy (SLEDAI-2K score 0, PGA < 0·5, and prednisolone ≤ 5 mg/day). Stable disease categories were mutually exclusive. Tapering was defined as any decrease in dose of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy (mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, azathioprine, leflunomide, or methotrexate). Using multivariable generalised estimating equations, we compared flares (SELENA-SLEDAI Flare Index) at the subsequent visit after drug tapering. We used generalised estimating equations and Cox proportional hazard models to compare tapering attempts that had begun in LLDAS, remission, and complete remission.

Findings

Between May 1, 2013, and Dec 31, 2020, 4106 patients were recruited to the cohort, 3002 (73·1%) of whom were included in our analysis. 2769 (92·2%) participants were female, 233 (7·8%) were male, and 2636 (88·1%) of 2993 with ethnicity data available were Asian. The median age was 39·5 years (IQR 29·0–50·0). There were 14808 patient visits for patients in LLDAS, or remission or complete remission, of which 13140 (88·7%) entered the final multivariable model after excluding missing data. Among the 9863 visits at which patients continued the same therapy, 1121 (11·4%) flared at the next visit, of which 221 (19·7%) were severe flares. Of the 3277 visits at which a patient received a tapering of therapy, 557 (17·0%) flared at the next visit, of which 120 (21·5%) were severe flares. Tapering was associated with higher odds of flare compared with continuing the same therapy (odds ratio [OR] 1·24 [95% CI 1·10–1·39]; p = 0·0005). Of 2095 continuous tapering attempts, 860 (41·1%) were initiated in LLDAS, 596 (28·4%) in remission, and 639 (30·5%) in complete remission. Tapering initiated in LLDAS (OR 1·37 [95% CI 1·03–1·81]; p = 0·029) or remission (1·45 [1·08–1·94]; p = 0·013) had higher odds of flare in 1 year compared with complete remission. Tapering in LLDAS (hazard ratio 1·24 [95% CI 1·04–1·48]; p = 0·016) or remission (1·30 [1·08–1·56]; p = 0·0054) had a significantly shorter time to first flare than tapering initiated in complete remission. Attaining sustained LLDAS, remission, or complete remission for at least 6 months just before the time of taper was associated with lower odds of flare at next visit, flares in 1 year, and longer time to flare.

Interpretation

Tapering of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy in patients with stable SLE was associated with excess flares. Our findings suggest that drug tapering should be carefully considered, weighing the risks and benefits, and is best exercised in complete (clinical and serological) remission and after maintaining stable disease for at least 6 months.

HPA axis recovery following exogenous corticosteroid exposure

Recovery of HPA axis function is unpredictable, and there are little data that accurately describe an expected time course for the recovery of adrenal function. Following discontinuation of exogenous corticosteroids, HPA axis suppression may resolve quickly (within hours or days) or persist, in some cases for up to 1 year or longer. Moreover, in some patients, endogenous cortisol secretion remains permanently suppressed. Although even a single dose of corticosteroid can cause HPA axis suppression (this is the basis for the overnight dexamethasone suppression test used to screen for Cushing syndrome), recovery is usually rapid with no adverse clinical sequelae.

Longer courses (e.g. 4 weeks or more) have been linked with longer recovery times, and, as a general rule, slow tapering after long‐term OCS usage is almost always necessary to support the recovery of normal HPA axis function. In this context, complete HPA axis recovery is unlikely to be observed until at least 4 weeks after cessation of corticosteroids. In a systematic review of systemic glucocorticoid therapy and AI in adults, 75% of patients had persistent AI 10 weeks after discontinuation of OCS (≥ 4 weeks of use), whereas 15% still had AI 3 years beyond discontinuation. Glucocorticoid exposure varied significantly across studies, but no obvious correlations were noted when AI cases were stratified by dosage or duration of corticosteroid use. Across all groups, 14% of patients who received a medium cumulative dosage (0.5–5.0 g) and 50% of those who received a high cumulative dosage (> 5.0 g) developed AI.

Currently, there is little consensus as to the optimum approach for safely tapering corticosteroids. The decision of when and how to taper corticosteroids, and when and how to monitor for AI, is usually at the clinician's discretion and based on signs and symptoms of disease control. The fear of underlying AI may actually hinder a clinician's confidence in tapering OCS. Ideally, tapering should be individualized, with continuous monitoring of the disease and AEs.

Pulmonary toxicity panel recommendations — evaluation and management of suspected immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pneumonitis should include high-resolution CT of the chest, with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) considered if the CT is negative and including spirometry and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Patients with pre-existing autoimmune interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be referred to a specialist before ICI initiation for consideration of PFTs and risk assessment. Patients experiencing grade 2 pneumonitis should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day prednisone (or equivalent), tapering over 4–6 weeks, and for pneumonitis of grade ≥ 3, patients should receive 1–2 mg/kg/day methylprednisolone IV or equivalent, tapering over 4–6 weeks. If high-dose corticosteroid therapy does not improve symptoms within 72 hours (or if symptoms are life-threatening), options include mycophenolate mofetil 1–1.5 g two times per day, hdIVIG 2 g/kg in divided doses over 2–5 days, infliximab 5 mg/kg one dose with optional repeat 14 days later, cyclophosphamide, or tocilizumab. If patients have experienced grade 2 pneumonitis, they may be re-challenged with ICIs upon complete resolution of symptoms and should be monitored through more frequent consultations with their physician.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) — systemic glucocorticoid guidance and evidence: Summary Statement 26 states "Consider a short course of oral steroids for treatment of CRSwNP (C)", and Summary Statement 27 states "Use short-term treatment with oral steroids in CRSwNP because it decreases polyp size and alleviates symptoms. (StrRec, A)". For CRS without nasal polyps, a retrospective pediatric series noted that "oral glucocorticosteroids alone, but not antibiotics alone, led to significant radiologic improvement", and a systematic review "reported symptom resolution in 54% of patients with CRSsNP vs 51% of patients with CRS in general". In CRSwNP, one randomized trial in "60 adult patients with severe nasal polyps" used a prednisone taper "starting at 30 mg/d for 4 days with a 5-mg decrease every 2 days" versus "no steroid treatment for 2 weeks". Another randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial had "20 subjects per group", with prednisolone "50 mg/d for 14 days", and was "associated with improvement in rhinosinusitis outcome measurement scores, a decrease in polyp size". Other reports describe prednisone given "over a 2-week period (30 mg/d for 4 days followed by a 2-day decrease of 5 mg) followed by INSs for 10 weeks".

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to avoid tapering corticosteroids in patients on short-term corticosteroid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, regardless of the dose. Consider discontinuing corticosteroids in these cases without testing due to low concern for hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression.

### Flare rates and factors determining flare occurrence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who achieved low disease activity or remission: results from a prospective cohort study [^11447zhi]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Kaplan-Meier curves showed no significant differences in flare-free survival among patients who achieved LLDAS/remission, however, with three different maintenance regimens of prednisone (5–7.5 mg/day, 2.5–5 mg/day and 0–2.5 mg/day) (log-rank p = 0.200; figure 3A). Notably, cumulative flare-free survival was significantly lower in patients with prednisone withdrawal than those maintained on low-dose prednisone (≤ 7.5 mg/day and > 0 mg/day) (log-rank p = 0.002; figure 3B) in the subsequent follow-up period. Multivariate Cox regression analyses confirmed the impact of prednisone withdrawal on subsequent occurrence of flare (HR = 6.94, 95% CI 1.86 to 25.86, p = 0.004) after adjustment for age at disease onset, gender, C3 level, SLEDAI and IS treatment status (online supplemental table 3).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111Ve9bU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically (Table 1).

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalent, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, eg, inhaled steroids, in whom there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids or no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements, thus potentially enabling HPA axis to recover. For replacement of adrenal insufficiency, prednisone is usually provided as single morning dose, whereas due to shorter half-life hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate are divided into 2–3 doses with higher doses given in the morning and subsequent doses given at lunch and late afternoon if applicable.

### Is it safe to withdraw low-dose glucocorticoids in SLE patients in remission? [^112T8ZKY]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a cornerstone of the treatment of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Numerous studies have emphasized the risk of damage accrual in SLE patient treated with GC, but currently, it is not possible to dissociate favorable and undesirable effects of GCs because their underlying mechanisms are entangled at the molecular level. Here, we review whether available data suggest that it is possible, feasible and desirable to taper and discontinue GC treatment in SLE. The main potential concern with GC withdrawal is the risk of SLE flare, which is strongly associated with increased organ damage, mortality, healthcare costs, decreased quality of life and work productivity. While most studies have assumed the cut off point for low doses (e.g. 7.5/mg/d) as the limit for safety, it is still controversial whether lower doses may influence damage accrual long-term. Also, a recent randomized trial has shown that a daily dose of 5 mg of prednisone in SLE patients in short-term remission can prevent up to 50–75% of flares, with an acceptable safety profile. However, this treatment is not mandatory for all patients. Yet, several observational studies highlight that discontinuation of GC is associated with lower damage accrual. Currently, we do not have a reliable method to identify patients who may require long-term low-dose GC. Therefore, further research is needed to identify a subgroup at high risk of relapse who would benefit from continuing prednisone. In the meantime, when considering the discontinuation of very low-dose prednisone, the decision must be individualized, as HCQ and conventional immunosuppressive agents are not without risk of side effects.

### Diagnosing and treating diamond blackfan anaemia: results of an international clinical consensus conference [^111dxzGD]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

There are little data to support a specific steroid tapering schedule. Based on consensus, once the patient responds, the steroids should be weaned to an average daily dose of 1 mg/kg per day over 8–12 weeks. Reducing to an alternate day dosing schedule, often increasing the first day's dose while decreasing the second day's dose, can accomplish this. The dose should then be further tapered slowly to find the minimal maintenance dose necessary to keep the hemoglobin in the range of 80–100 g/l, the target level being determined by the individual patient's requirement to sustain growth and activity. The recommended maximum maintenance dose is ≤ 1 mg/kg every other day or ≤ 0·5 mg/kg daily. Steroids should be tapered more slowly, and with great care, below this level to reduce the risk of overshooting the minimal effective dose for that individual. If this occurs, the dose should be immediately increased to the previous level at which the hemoglobin was within target range. The hemoglobin should be monitored closely during this phase because a too rapid taper often necessitates the reinstitution of the initial 2 mg/kg per day dose to re-achieve response. If an acceptable hemoglobin cannot be sustained at the recommended dose, steroids should be tapered and discontinued. Some patients require very small doses for continued response.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Due to the ease/convenience of testing, experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine for recovery of HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy (see also results of Clinical Question III). The test should be done only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (eg, prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose, see Definitions). Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test, overnight metyrapone test and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited; importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes (see section 3). Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids (excluding dexamethasone). It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive, but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency, yet even amongst those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low. Due to the low prevalence of clinically relevant adrenal insufficiency despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency following a glucocorticoid taper, testing can provide a safeguard in identifying those less at risk but is not a prerequisite for continued tapering.

Although proposing a serum cortisol cut-off of 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) as a guide, the panel suggests that the value of serum cortisol is considered as a continuum, rather than an arbitrary cut-off, with higher values more likely to indicate HPA axis recovery. Patients with very low morning cortisol levels (as a guide: < 150 nmol/L (5 μg/dL)) are very likely to have persistent adrenal insufficiency. In such cases, dynamic testing is unlikely to be useful. We recommend that these patients continue with physiologic daily dose equivalent glucocorticoid replacement aiming for the lowest safe dose and undergo repeat morning cortisol testing until recovery occurs. As a general guide, the glucocorticoid dose should provide sufficient replacement, but also a sufficient stimulus for recovery (meaning avoiding any over-replacement). Frequency of repeat measuring may range between 1 to 6 months, depending on the dose and length of glucocorticoid therapy and the prior trajectory of cortisol values.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

GC taper

There is no evidence to support a specific approach to GC taper for the prevention of AS. It has been demonstrated that a gradual GC taper does not prevent AS.GCs should be tapered or discontinued at a rate dictated by the underlying condition in order to maintain disease remission; if not indicated for prevention of disease relapse, a prolonged taper should be avoided to prevent unnecessary GC exposure. Physiological GC replacement should prevent symptoms of AS, so testing of the HPA axis prior to discontinuing or tapering GCs below a physiological dose (< 8 mg/m 2 /day hydrocortisone equivalent) should be considered in children who have received prolonged courses of GCs (table 2, GC dose equivalencies). Symptoms of GC withdrawal can occur during a rapid taper and may mimic symptoms of AS despite biochemical evidence of HPA system integrity or adequate GC replacement. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility, evaluate for possible AS and modify their taper accordingly.

Key action statement 3E — systemic corticosteroids for infantile hemangiomas (IHs): Clinicians may prescribe oral prednisolone or prednisone to treat IHs if there are contraindications or an inadequate response to oral propranolol (grade B, moderate recommendation). In the AHRQ review, oral steroids had a mean estimate of expected clearance of 43%. Dose ranges of prednisone or prednisolone reported most frequently are between 2 and 5 mg/kg per day, and most consider optimal dosing to be 2 to 3 mg/kg per day; typical protocols include treating at full dose for 4 to 12 weeks followed by a gradual taper and completion of therapy by 9 to 12 months of age, with some advocating shorter treatment durations (1–6 weeks) with intermittent courses as needed. In the AHRQ review, steroids were consistently associated with clinically important harms, including Cushingoid appearance, infection, growth retardation, hypertension, and mood changes, and the authors considered the SOE to be moderate for the association of steroids with clinically important harms.

### International multicentre observational study to assess the efficacy and safety of a 0. 5 mg kgper day starting dose of oral corticosteroids to treat bullous pemphigoid [^11743rV7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

European guidelines propose a 0·5 mg kg -1 per day dose of oral prednisone as initial treatment for bullous pemphigoid (BP). We assessed the safety and efficacy of this regimen depending on BP extent and general condition of the patients.

Methods

In a prospective international study, we consecutively included all patients diagnosed with BP. Patients received a 0·5 mg kg -1 per day dose of prednisone, which was then gradually tapered 15 days after disease control, with the aim of stopping prednisone or maintaining minimal treatment (0·1 mg kg -1 per day) within 6 months after the start of treatment. The two coprimary endpoints were control of disease activity at day 21 and 1-year overall survival. Disease severity was assessed according to the Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI) score.

Results

In total, 198 patients were included between 2015 and 2017. The final analysis comprised 190 patients with a mean age of 80·9 (SD 9·1) years. Control of disease activity was achieved at day 21 in 119 patients [62·6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 55·3–69.5]; 18 of 24 patients (75%, 95% CI 53·3–90·2), 75 of 110 patients (68·8%, 95% CI 59·2–77·3) and 26 of 56 patients (46.4%, 95% CI 33·0–60·3) had mild, moderate and severe BP, respectively (P = 0·0218). A total of 30 patients died during the study. The overall Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival was 82·6% (95% CI 76·3–87·4) corresponding to 90·9%, 83·0% and 80·0% rates in patients with mild, moderate and severe BP, respectively (P = 0·5). Thresholds of 49 points for BPDAI score and 70 points for Karnofsky score yielded maximal Youden index values with respect to disease control at day 21 and 1-year survival, respectively.

Conclusions

A 0·5 mg kg -1 per day dose of prednisone is a valuable therapeutic option in patients with mild or moderate BP whose general condition allows them to be autonomous.

### The clinical efficacy of 3 mg / day prednisone in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: evidence from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal clinical trial [^115hs4AF]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal clinical trial was conducted of prednisone < 5 mg/ day versus placebo in 31 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). These patients had been treated with long-term 1–4 mg/day of prednisone, 22 with 3 mg/day, in usual clinical care at a single academic clinical setting. Stable clinical status over 12 weeks prior to screening for the trial was documented quantitatively by patient questionnaire scores. The protocol involved three phases: a) 'equivalence' - 1–4 study prednisone 1-mg tablets taken for 12 weeks, to ascertain their efficacy versus the patient's usual prednisone tablets prior to randomisation; b) 'transfer' - substitution of a 1-mg prednisone or identical placebo tablet at a rate of a single 1-mg tablet every 4 weeks (over 0–12 weeks) to the same number as baseline prednisone; c) 'comparison' - observation over 24 subsequent weeks taking the same number of either placebo or prednisone tablets as at baseline. The primary outcome was withdrawal due to patient-reported lack of efficacy versus continuation in the trial for 24 weeks. Thirty-one patients were randomised, 15 to prednisone and 16 to placebo, with 3 administrative discontinuations. In 'intent-to-treat' analyses, 3/15 prednisone and 11/16 placebo participants withdrew (p = 0.03). Among participants eligible for the primary outcome of withdrawal for lack of efficacy, 3/13 prednisone versus 11/15 placebo participants withdrew (p = 0.02). No meaningful adverse events were reported, as anticipated. These data document statistically significant differences between the efficacy of 1–4 mg prednisone vs. placebo in only 31 patients, which may suggest a robust treatment effect.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy–immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (PML-IRIS) after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation can differ from classical PML with lesions showing contrast enhancement, edema and mass effect, and a more rapid clinical course, and the use of corticosteroids to treat PML-IRIS appears justified when there is contrast enhancement, edema or mass effect, and clinical deterioration (BIII). The dosage and duration of corticosteroids have not been established and therapy should be tailored; one approach is a 3- to 5 day course of IV methylprednisolone dosed at 1 g per day, followed by an oral prednisone taper that may begin at 60 mg per day in a single dose and be tapered over 1 to 6 weeks. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2 to 6 weeks may be helpful, and ART should be continued at the standard therapeutic doses during this period (AIII). Several case reports suggest that maraviroc might be beneficial for PML-IRIS, but no comparative studies in HIV-associated PML have confirmed benefit. Adjuvant corticosteroid therapy to treat all PML cases without evidence of IRIS is not justified and should be discouraged (CIII), and if a patient's condition worsens, imaging can be repeated to monitor for development of IRIS before initiating corticosteroids.

### Tapering glucocorticoids and risk of flare in rheumatoid arthritis on biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) [^114Rz8as]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucocorticoids are still a mainstream of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. Reducing glucocorticoids should be attempted in all patients. However, choosing the right tapering strategy is challenging. The primary aim of our study is to determine the dose-response association between glucocorticoid tapering and risk of flare in RA.

Methods

We conducted a case-crossover study to determine the factors associated to higher risk of flare in patients with RA. In case-crossover studies time-varying factors are assessed before events (hazard periods) and before control periods. We defined hazard periods as the 6 months immediately preceding flares of RA. Control periods were the 6 months prior to visits without flare. Exposure of interest was the tapering of glucocorticoids to various doses.

Results

508 patients with RA were included in the study and 267 (52.5%) had at least a flare and served as the case-crossover study population. 1545 visits were available for analysis and 345 (22.3%) flares were recorded. Discontinuation of glucocorticoids (ie, tapering to doses of 0mg/day) and tapering to 0–2.5mg/day was associated with higher risk of flare (adjusted OR (aOR) of 1.45, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.24 and aOR of 1.37; 95% CI: 1.06 to 2.01, respectively). Tapering to doses > 2.5mg/day was not associated with significantly higher risk of flare.

Conclusions

We found that tapering to doses of > 2.5mg/day was generally effective in terms of risk of flare. Flare risk was higher when glucocorticoids were tapered to doses ≤ 2.5mg/day. Our study might help design new tapering strategies in patients with RA on biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs.

### Flare rates and factors determining flare occurrence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who achieved low disease activity or remission: results from a prospective cohort study [^113MvbML]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of GC is a key factor for disease management in SLE. Considering the potential side effects, efforts are needed to minimise the cumulative GC dose. In the present study, we found that patients with flare had a significantly higher cumulative prednisone dose during the whole follow-up duration compared with patients without flare, which might be explained as the consequence of flare. This also hinted at the burden of more GC exposure due to flare.

To date, very limited data are available on GC tapering or withdrawal in patients who have achieved low disease activity or remission. In practice, a goal of prednisone 7.5 mg/day is often set, but a significant proportion of treating physicians are reluctant to continue to further reduce the dose. In the present study, we found that the flare proportion after tapering prednisone to ≤ 5 mg/day was not significantly higher than those with 7.5–5 mg/day, indicating the feasibility of tapering prednisone to a lower dose than 7.5 mg/day. Zahr et al found that 55% of patients in the Hopkins lupus cohort were successfully tapered and maintained on ≤ 5 mg/day of prednisone for a year which also supported the possibility and attainability of reducing prednisone to a lower dose. In addition, the present study showed the superiority of maintenance with low-dose prednisone to prednisone withdrawal in terms of time to first flare, which reminds clinicians of being vigilant after GC withdrawal even in patients with remission. However, this result, obtained from very limited patients experiencing prednisone withdrawal, needs to be confirmed by further studies. A previous randomised clinical trial from France showed that withdrawal of low-dose prednisone in patients with SLE with a clinically quiescent disease for more than 1 year significantly increased flare compared with those with low-dose prednisone maintenance (27% vs 7%; Risk Ratio = 0.2, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.7, p = 0.003). Conversely, another Italian study revealed that 84.6% patients who attempted discontinuing GC successfully withdrew, accompanied by 23% of subsequent flare rate during a median follow-up of 2 years, which was even lower than those who did not attempt to stop GC. Overall, data on GC withdrawal and flare occurrence were limited and hence more prospective randomised control studies are needed in the future to validate these findings.

The use of supraphysiologic glucocorticoids (prednisone equivalent dose > 5 mg daily) has been associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio of 1.97 (95% CI 1.81–2.15) in rheumatoid arthritis patients, with increasing risk with higher current daily and cumulative doses. This association was not observed with daily glucocorticoid doses below 5 mg prednisone equivalent. Estimates from these studies have to be interpreted cautiously because of potential underlying confounding factors such as underlying disease and disease severity.

Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) in children — treatment of the initial episode — We recommend that corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone)* be given for at least 12 weeks, We recommend that oral prednisone be administered as a single daily dose starting at 60 mg/ m2/d or 2 mg/kg/d to a maximum 60 mg/d, and We recommend that daily oral prednisone be given for 4–6 weeks followed by alternate-day medication as a single daily dose starting at 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg on alternate days) and continued for 2–5 months with tapering of the dose. Prednisone and prednisolone are equivalent, used in the same dosage, and have both been used in RCTs depending on the country of origin. Patients and parents should be counseled regarding treatment adherence and that steroid therapy extended beyond the child's initial response may decrease the long-term risk of frequent relapses, and because more than 80% of children with new-onset NS relapse, altering the timing and frequency of future relapses is of broad impact.

### Combination of clinical factors predicts successful glucocorticoid withdrawal in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): results from a multicentre, retrospective cohort study [^112Ja3sz]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

According to a recently proposed conceptual framework, therapeutic agents with putative disease-modifying effects in SLE should be able to minimise disease activity and prevent flares, especially severe ones. However, a literature reviewrevealed definitive evidence only for belimumab and anifrolumab in reducing severe lupus flares. We found a significant impact of hydroxychloroquine coadministration on reducing overall and severe flares following GC withdrawal. This agrees with Ji et al and Fasano et al, who showed a flare-protective effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients with prolonged clinical remission who stopped GC. Accordingly, a non-inferiority RCT in patients with SLE with sustained clinical and serological quiescence on ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent for > 6 months showed that GC withdrawal while maintaining hydroxychloroquine was non-inferior to continuing both drugs in terms of relapses. Our data align with observational studiesand RCTssupporting the protection of hydroxychloroquine/antimalarials against SLE flares, including renal flares. Moreover, they are consistent with the EULAR recommendationsadvocating for the timely introduction of immunomodulating/immunosuppressive agents when GC cannot be tapered to ≤ 5 mg/day.

In the CORTICOLUP trial, abrupt cessation of prednisone from 5 mg/day to 0 mg/day precipitated flares. Still, there is limited evidence to guide the optimal tapering speed, particularly at low doses (≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent) approaching complete withdrawal. In serologically active clinically quiescent patients with SLE receiving ≤ 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent, Katsumata et al showed that a 1 mg/day dose reduction was safe, however no specific time frame was provided. For patients who are in sustained clinical remission on 5 mg/day, previous studies have suggested a slow tapering over approximately 9 monthsor 12–24 monthsuntil complete withdrawal. Our analysis used the LLDAS criterion of 7.5 mg/day prednisone-equivalent as a starting point for subsequent tapering and it was not confined to patients in a specific disease state at the time of GC discontinuation. Therefore, our finding derived through unbiased threshold detection, that a minimum duration of 6 months independently facilitates the safer GC dose reduction and withdrawal, may apply to a range of clinical conditions, pending confirmation in further studies.

### Comparison of corticosteroid tapering regimens in myasthenia gravis: a randomized clinical trial [^112nvAo6]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

The tapering of prednisone therapy in generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) presents a therapeutic dilemma; however, the recommended regimen has not yet been validated.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of the standard slow-tapering regimen of prednisone therapy with a rapid-tapering regimen.

Design

From June 1, 2009, to July 31, 2013, a multicenter, parallel, single-blind randomized trial was conducted to compare 2 regimens of prednisone tapering. Data analysis was conducted from February 18, 2019, to January 23, 2020. A total of 2291 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of moderate to severe generalized MG at 7 specialized centers in France were assessed for eligibility.

Interventions

The slow-tapering arm included a gradual increase of the prednisone dose to 1.5 mg/kg every other day and a slow decrease once minimal manifestation status of MG was attained. The rapid-tapering arm consisted of immediate high-dose daily administration of prednisone, 0.75 mg/kg, followed by an earlier and rapid decrease once improved MG status was attained. Azathioprine, up to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg/d, was prescribed for all participants.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was attainment of minimal manifestation status of MG without prednisone at 12 months and without clinical relapse at 15 months. Intention-to-treat analysis was conducted.

Results

Of the 2291 patients assessed, 2086 did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, 87 declined to participate, and 1 patient registered after trial closure. A total of 117 patients (58 in the slow-tapering arm and 59 in the rapid-tapering arm) were selected for inclusion by MG specialists and were randomized. The population included 62 men (53%); median age was 65 years (interquartile range, 35–69 years). The proportion of patients having met the primary outcome was higher in the rapid- vs slow-tapering arm (23 [39%] vs 5 [9%]), with a risk ratio of 3.61 (95% CI, 1.64–7.97; P < .001) after adjusting for center and thymectomy. The rapid-tapering regimen allowed sparing of a mean of 1898 mg (95% CI, -3121 to -461 mg) of prednisone over 1 year (ie, 5.3 mg/d per patient, P = .03). The number of serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the slow- vs rapid-tapering group (13 [22%] vs 21 [36%], P = .15).

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with moderate to severe generalized MG who require high-dose prednisone with azathioprine therapy, rapid tapering of prednisone appears to be feasible, well tolerated, and associated with a good outcome.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112de5Ha]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

### Internet-based tapering of oral corticosteroids in severe asthma: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial [^117BKRRi]. Thorax (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with prednisone-dependent asthma the dose of oral corticosteroids should be adjusted to the lowest possible level to reduce long-term adverse effects. However, the optimal strategy for tapering oral corticosteroids is unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether an internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FE(NO)) facilitates tapering of oral corticosteroids and leads to reduction of corticosteroid consumption without worsening asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

Methods

In a 6-month pragmatic randomised prospective multicentre study, 95 adults with prednisone-dependent asthma from six pulmonary outpatient clinics were allocated to two tapering strategies: according to conventional treatment (n = 43) or guided by a novel internet-based monitoring system (internet strategy) (n = 52). Primary outcomes were cumulative sparing of prednisone, asthma control and asthma-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), exacerbations, hospitalisations and patient's satisfaction with the tapering strategy.

Results

Median cumulative sparing of prednisone was 205 (25–75th percentile -221 to 777) mg in the internet strategy group compared with 0 (-497 to 282) mg in the conventional treatment group (p = 0.02). Changes in prednisone dose (mixed effect regression model) from baseline were -4.79 mg/day and +1.59 mg/day, respectively (p < 0.001). Asthma control, asthma-related quality of life, FEV1, exacerbations, hospitalisations and satisfaction with the strategy were not different between groups.

Conclusions

An internet-based management tool including home monitoring of symptoms, lung function and FE(NO) in severe asthma is superior to conventional treatment in reducing total corticosteroid consumption without compromising asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112Bs4iG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

According to Axelrod et al. for patients who used corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 7 days, medication withdrawal can be done abruptly, without risk of adrenal suppression. More recent references suggest that, when used for less than 14 days, there would be a low risk of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis suppression. We suggest that the time for abrupt suspension should be assessed individually, and can be considered for patients who used low doses of corticosteroids for a period of less than or equal to 14 days. For those who used higher doses (greater than or equal to the equivalent of 40 mg of prednisone per day) for more than 7 days, we suggest a gradual dose reduction. When treatment is carried out for a longer period than 14 days, a gradual reduction according to the total dose administered is usually recommended. We suggest, for patients using a daily dose greater than 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), to start with a reduction of 5 to 10 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 20 and 40 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is between 10 and 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest a reduction of 2.5 mg every 1 or 2 weeks. When the daily dose is less than 10 mg of prednisone (or equivalent), we suggest reducing 2.5 mg every 2 to 4 weeks and then administer 2.5 mg of prednisone on alternate days during 2 to 4 weeks until complete suspension. It is important to remember that, for patients using insulin, dose adjustment should be performed during the corticosteroid removal. Wallace et al. recommends reducing insulin dose by 0.1 units/kg for every 10-mg reduction in the prednisone dose. A summary of the suggested approach is shown in Fig. 2.

Response to steroids

Acute GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is most often referred to as either (1) progression in any organ within 3, 4, or 5 days of therapy onset with ≥ 2 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent, (2) failure to improve within 5 to 7 days of treatment initiation or (3) incomplete response after more than 28 days of immunosuppressive treatment including steroids. For the determination of eligibility in prospective clinical trials, alternative definitions for aGvHD steroid refractoriness may include other aspects such as: incomplete response after 14 days of therapy or use of an additional immunosuppressive agent. Chronic GvHD steroid refractoriness or resistance is typically referred to as either: (1) progression of GvHD while on prednisone at ≥ 1 mg/kg/day for 1 to 2 weeks; or (2) stable GvHD on ≥ 0.5 mg/kg/day (or 1 mg/kg every other day) of prednisone for 1 to 2 months.

Steroid dependence has been defined for aGvHD as the inability to taper prednisone under 2 mg/kg/day after an initially successful treatment of at least 7 days or as the recurrence of aGvHD activity during steroid taper. The relevance of this term was shown by Martin and colleagues who demonstrated that the highest CR rates with secondary therapy were seen when aGvHD recurred during the taper phase of the primary glucocorticoid treatment, thereby distinguishing it from steroid refractory aGvHD. In cGvHD, steroid dependence refers to the inability to control GvHD symptoms while tapering prednisone below 0.25 mg/kg/day (or 0.5 mg/kg every other day) in at least two individual attempts, separated by at least 8 weeks.

Finally, the term "steroid intolerance" has not been formally validated but refers to the emergence of unacceptable toxicity (e.g. uncontrolled infections, avascular necrosis, arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, myopathy, osteoporosis, etc.) attributed to corticosteroids, as evaluated by a healthcare professional.

Table 5.
Clinical features of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and common underlying conditions

The overall duration, type, and daily dose of glucocorticoid used should be considered when designing a glucocorticoid taper. Patients treated with higher glucocorticoid doses, long-acting glucocorticoids, and for a longer duration of time are likely to have more glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. Patients with features of exogenous Cushing syndrome are more likely to have a challenging glucocorticoid taper course because of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome (Table 5).

Slow decrease in glucocorticoid dose is the only known intervention that may help prevent severe glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms. In patients following a curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism baseline clinical severity score was associated with the severity of glucocorticoid withdrawal, and symptoms worsened once total daily glucocorticoid dose reached below 30 to 35 mg of hydrocortisone equivalent (eg, 7.5 prednisone). Clinical severity was calculated based on the presence of physical features and comorbidities potentially related to glucocorticoid excess, and may also be applied in patients treated with supraphysiologic glucocorticoids when deciding on the rapidity of glucocorticoid taper, with slower taper in patients with high clinical severity score, and a more rapid taper in patients with lower clinical severity score. In a patient with severe glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome despite a slower glucocorticoid taper, increasing the glucocorticoid dose temporarily to the most recent dose prior to onset of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome will usually alleviate the symptoms.

R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice)

Rationale

If the glucocorticoid dose is in the supraphysiologic range, suppression of the HPA axis is expected and it is unnecessary to test adrenal function. Similarly, testing is unnecessary in patients unable to stop glucocorticoid treatment, for example patients with organ transplants and in cases of polymyalgia rheumatica. These patients should be educated on management of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency (see section R.3).

R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○)

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

US recommendations

The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for early and established RA recommend adding GCs to DMARDs during disease flares, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period possible. In contrast to the European recommendations, adding GCs when a csDMARD is initiated depends on disease activity.

Taken together, these international recommendations agree on the use of GCs for disease flare and possibly at the start of a new csDMARD. Specific advice concerning dosage, duration, route of administration and strategies is limited and less consensual, because reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. For US recommendations, a dose < 10 mg/day is considered a low dose, and GCs should be tapered in less than 3 months, whereas for European recommendations, the threshold is 7.5 mg/day, and GCs could be prescribed in combination with csDMARDs for up to 6 months maximum, knowing that this duration is mainly expert-driven. Despite these differences, international guidelines underline the importance of GCs but also advocate the use of GCs at the lowest cumulative dose possible because of the high awareness of potentially associated adverse effects.

In these sets of recommendations as well as in this review, GCs dosages are expressed in prednisone equivalent.

### Prednisone (predniSONE tablets, USP, 20 mg) [^1176ye1G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

An intramuscular option has been studied: In one randomized controlled trial, 120 mg methylprednisolone intramuscular (i.m.) injection was used every 3 weeks as a starting dose. As an adjunct, Methotrexate (MTX) has been used at doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials, and the algorithm advises, Consider MTX if at high risk for side effects/ relapse and/or prolonged therapy. Following improvement, the algorithm specifies Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids and ultimately to Taper prednisone until discontinuation. Baseline factors associated with higher risk of relapse/prolonged therapy include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour) and peripheral inflammatory arthritis.

The suggested optimal dose and duration at onset that our results recommend accumulates to a total dose that resides below this limit. Moreover, the reduction in future relapses evident in our study also would be expected to have a corticosteroid-sparing effect, by avoiding high cumulative doses associated with treatment of relapses.

Our study is retrospective, with inherent limitations such as the potential for selection bias, treatment indication bias, informative censoring and unmeasured confounding factors. Our statistical models were refined to adjust for known confounders. Neurological and visual assessments were not standardised across centres due to the retrospective nature of this study. It is likely that among patients with a documented monophasic disease course, some will develop a relapsing course given sufficient time. This, however, does not affect our primary finding of TTFR, or treatment recommendations within the first 12 months after onset. In order to analyse paediatric and adult patients concurrently, we weight-adjusted doses of oral prednisone. While this is considered a reasonable conversion method, and weight-based dosing is an established convention in paediatric medicine, we acknowledge that adult body weight data for all patients in this retrospective study were not available for inclusion in this analysis. Addressing immortal time bias presented an analytical challenge, especially when assessing a time-based outcome (TTFR), with the exposure stratified by a time based criterion (time above threshold dosing). In our approach, we accounted for all above-threshold dosing durations, even when this extended past the point of the first relapse, to reflect the intention to treat with a certain oral prednisone course. Finally, documentation of adverse events following prednisone exposure, while likely accurate for severe short-term adverse events, could underestimate more minor adverse events and the long-term consequences of corticosteroid use for the onset episode.

This study provides evidence supporting the use of oral corticosteroids at the onset of MOGAD. We propose evidence-based recommendations highlighting that patients at disease onset should be treated with a minimum effective dose of 12.5 mg daily of oral prednisone (0.16 mg/kg/day for children) for a minimum duration of 3 months in order to delay TTFR and minimise cumulative corticosteroid exposure.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117HQ6VG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^113yCpwb]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) — systemic corticosteroids: Summary Statement 83 notes systemic corticosteroids are "frequently used in patients with refractory CU, but no controlled studies have demonstrated efficacy", and that "short-term use (eg, 1–3 weeks' duration) might be required" until other therapies control symptoms, whereas "long-term use for treatment of patients with CU should be avoided as much as possible". Short-term use guidance specifies that "Dose adjustment tapering is not necessary in patients receiving 40 mg or equivalent doses of prednisone daily for 3 weeks or less", and long-term risks include "osteoporosis with increased risk of fracture, avascular necrosis, cataracts, hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression, risk of infection, and thinning of the skin". Evidence cited includes a study of "40 patients with DPUA" using a "7-week taper of prednisone" in which "Thirty percent of subjects withdrew from the prednisone treatment group because of adverse effects", and a prospective series of "17 patients… (3–30 days per month)" where "47% had a short relapse or worsening of their urticaria on withdrawal of corticosteroids".

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115Sbbz7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — timing and dosing: Spontaneous and steroid-related recovery is greatest in the first 2 weeks, with little benefit after 4 to 6 weeks, and more recent studies encourage treatment within 7 days of onset. For optimal treatment outcomes, the recommended oral prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg/d as a single dose (usual maximum 60 mg daily) for 10 to 14 days; representative regimens include 4 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a 10-mg taper every 2 days, 7 to 10 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper over the next week, or 4 weeks at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper. Dose equivalence is prednisone 60 mg = methylprednisolone 48 mg = dexamethasone 10 mg, and methylprednisolone/prednisone dose packs should be avoided for underdosing and delay.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112yXkR9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is commonly used for conditions such as exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic skin reactions, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a United States insurance database study of 1.5 million adults, 21% had received at least one course of oral glucocorticoids during the last three years, with a median dose of 20 mg prednisone equivalent and a median duration of 6 days. A starting dose of 50 mg of prednisone tapering to zero within 5–7 or 10–14 days are typical treatment regimens for exacerbation of asthma (Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention.).

There is no evidence that such short treatment periods lead to clinically relevant suppression of HPA axis, although there is lack of large high-quality studies. Suppression as evaluated by a 1 µg ACTH (1–24)-test has been reported. However, this test is less validated than a 250 µg ACTH (1–24)-test and should be interpreted with caution. While adrenal insufficiency is unlikely after short-term glucocorticoid therapy, clinicians should be aware that even short-term glucocorticoid treatment can lead to complications such as increased incidence of sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding, thromboembolism, and fractures.

R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice)

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^113oKEDG]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of GIAI were recently published for the first time by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the Endocrine Society (ES). The experts recommend that the risk for adrenal insufficiency should be considered for GC treatment durations exceeding 3–4 weeks and doses greater than the physiological levels (ie, equivalent of 15–25 mg/day hydrocortisone or 4–6 mg/day prednisone). Figure 1 summarises the two proposed approaches for managing the risk of adrenal insufficiency during the discontinuation of GC therapy. The initial step in both approaches involves tapering GC doses to physiological replacement levels, following a switch from long-acting GCs (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to short-acting GCs (eg, prednisone or hydrocortisone) when applicable. Interestingly, the recent STAR study demonstrated that tapering prednisone by 1 mg/day each month or replacing prednisone with 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone for 3 months, followed by a reduction to 10 mg/day for an additional 3 months, resulted in comparable rates of successful GC withdrawal at 1 year in patients with RA. Once tapering of GC doses to physiological levels has been achieved, the ESE/ES experts propose two options: either gradually tapering GCs while monitoring for clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency (option 1), or, more cautiously, assessing morning serum cortisol levels at least 24 hours after the last GC dose (option 2). To date, no studies have shown the superiority of either approach. Physicians must keep in mind that, in addition to implementing an appropriate GC discontinuation scheme, preventing adrenal crises necessitates patient education on sick-day rules, emphasising the importance of temporarily increasing GC doses during periods of physiological stress or surgical procedures.

### Continuing versus tapering glucocorticoids after achievement of low disease activity or remission in rheumatoid arthritis (SEMIRA): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^1138zgSy]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, often receive glucocorticoids, but long-term use can produce adverse effects. Evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide tapering of oral glucocorticoids is scarce. We investigated a scheme for tapering oral glucocorticoids compared with continuing low-dose oral glucocorticoids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

The Steroid EliMination In Rheumatoid Arthritis (SEMIRA) trial was a double-blind, multicentre, two parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial done at 39 centres from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Serbia, and Tunisia). Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tocilizumab and glucocorticoids 5–15 mg per day for 24 weeks or more were eligible for inclusion if they had received prednisone 5 mg per day for 4 weeks or more and had stable low disease activaity, confirmed by a Disease Activity Score for 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of 3·2 or less 4–6 weeks before and on the day of randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to either continue masked prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks or to taper masked prednisone reaching 0 mg per day at week 16. All patients received tocilizumab (162 mg subcutaneously every week or 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks) with or without csDMARDs maintained at stable doses during the entire 24-week study. The primary outcome was the difference in mean DAS28-ESR change from baseline to week 24, with a difference of more than 0·6 defined as clinically relevant between the continued-prednisone group and the tapered-prednisone group. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02573012.

Findings

Between Oct 21, 2015, and June 9, 2017, 421 patients were screened and 259 (200 [77%] women and 59 [23%] men) were recruited onto the trial. In all 128 patients assigned to the continued-prednisone regimen, disease activity control was superior to that in all 131 patients assigned to the tapered-prednisone regimen; the estimated mean change in DAS28-ESR from baseline to week 24 was 0·54 (95% CI 0·35–0·73) with tapered prednisone and -0·08 (-0·27 to 0·12) with continued prednisone (difference 0·61 [0·35–0·88]; p < 0·0001), favouring continuing prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks. Treatment was regarded as successful (defined as low disease activity at week 24, plus absence of rheumatoid arthritis flare for 24 weeks and no confirmed adrenal insufficiency) in 99 (77%) patients in the continued-prednisone group versus 85 (65%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group (relative risk 0·83; 95% CI 0·71–0·97). Serious adverse events occurred in seven (5%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group and four (3%) patients in the continued-prednisone group; no patients had symptomatic adrenal insufficiency.

Interpretation

In patients who achieved low disease activity with tocilizumab and at least 24 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment, continuing glucocorticoids at 5 mg per day for 24 weeks provided safe and better disease control than tapering glucocorticoids, although two-thirds of patients were able to safely taper their glucocorticoid dose.

Rationale

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome occurs due to dependence on supraphysiologic glucocorticoids while decreasing the dose of glucocorticoids. Patients should be informed that glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms are expected to occur during the glucocorticoid dose reduction and what the differences are between glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, adrenal insufficiency, and underlying disease flare. It should be emphasized that an insufficient glucocorticoid supply is not expected to occur when the glucocorticoid dose is greater than the physiologic daily dose equivalent. As exceptions, it should be noted that the glucocorticoid requirement may be significantly higher in the case of critical illness or that glucocorticoid absorption is not guaranteed in gastroenteritis. Many of the symptoms of the withdrawal syndrome are nonspecific and overlap with symptoms of the underlying disease, especially in inflammatory musculoskeletal disorders. Managing glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and glucocorticoid taper in these patients may be especially challenging. Patients should be educated on symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal to avoid anxiety related to unexpected symptoms or reactive, unnecessary, or excessive increase in glucocorticoids.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome. Duration of exogenous glucocorticoid use, glucocorticoid dose and type, and individual susceptibility likely impact the severity and duration of glucocorticoid withdrawal, but systematic studies are lacking. In a recent study investigating glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome in patients following curative surgery for endogenous hypercortisolism, symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. Symptoms are thought to occur due to an abrupt decrease in glucocorticoid exposure leading to an increase in inflammatory cytokines. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome overlap with those seen in patients with untreated or not optimally treated adrenal insufficiency (Table 5), and most patients with glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome do have concomitant adrenal insufficiency. Since symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and glucocorticoid withdrawal significantly overlap, good clinical guidance to differentiate between those is to consider the total daily dose of glucocorticoids with high doses making adrenal insufficiency less likely. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Fig. 2
The pattern of steroid prescription during the disease course

The types of steroids used are dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone, prednisolone and prednisone. The vast majority of respondents (91%) prescribe dexamethasone (supplementary material). The most common route of administration is oral, which is rarely combined or interspersed with intravenous administration (supplementary material). Heterogeneous dosing was observed, both in dose as in duration. Converted doses varied from 1.5 to 52.5 mg/m 2 /day with a median of 8.5 mg/m 2 /day (Fig. 3). Steroid prescription was slightly less heterogeneous in European countries and in larger volume centers, ranging from 2.25 to 22.5 mg/m 2 /day (median 8 mg/m 2 /day) and 2.25–30 mg/m 2 /day (median 8.5 mg/m 2 /day), respectively. The duration varied from 3 to 75 days with a median of 15 days (Fig. 4). Stopping or tapering regimens also varied; most respondents (75%) always taper, whereas 9% of respondents do not taper steroid therapy but stop instantly and 16% taper if the steroids were prescribed over a 'longer period of time' (i.e. prescription ranging from > 5 to > 14 days). The tapering regimen duration varied from 1 to 35 days and the dose reduction per step varied from 10 to 50% per day, or 0.1–4.0 mg/m 2 /day. For tapering and duration there was no difference observed between larger or smaller volume centers.

3.6.2 Beclomethasone dipropionate

Oral beclomethasone dipropionate is a second-generation corticosteroid and may also be an alternative to conventional corticosteroids. In a randomised controlled trial in 282 patients, oral beclomethasone dipropionate 5 mg daily for 4 weeks, then alternate weekly for a further 4 weeks was shown to be non-inferior to prednisolone in efficacy, but there was also no difference in the co-primary end-point of steroid-related adverse events and reduction in morning cortisol below 150 nmol/L. In patients with active left-sided or extensive UC, oral beclomethasone dipropionate 5 mg/day has been demonstrated as equivalent to 2.4 g 5-ASA, and has been shown as more effective when added to 5-ASA compared with 5-ASA alone.

Although more expensive, topically-acting oral corticosteroids are an alternative to prednisolone in UC patients with mild to moderate disease and 5-ASA failure.

3.7 Corticosteroids in moderate to severe UC

Statement 7. We recommend that moderate to severe ulcerative colitis should be treated with oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone 40 mg daily weaning over 6–8 weeks (GRADE: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Oral corticosteroids are effective for the induction of remission in patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis refractory to sulfasalazine or 5-ASA, and in patients who have responded to initial treatment with intravenous corticosteroids following hospitalisation for acute severe disease.

In a meta-analysis of five randomised controlled trials, corticosteroids were superior to placebo for induction of remission in UC (RR of no remission, 0.65; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.93). Although the optimal dose and regimen for systemic corticosteroids in UC is uncertain, the current 40 mg dose recommendation is based on Baron's studies where 40 mg was more effective than 20 mg/day. There is no evidence of benefit with doses higher than 40–60 mg/day, and doses above 40 mg may be associated with increased adverse effects. Approximately 50% of patients experience short-term corticosteroid-related adverse events such as acne, oedema, sleep and mood disturbance, glucose intolerance and dyspepsia. Single daily dosing is as effective as split-dosing and causes less adrenal suppression. The dose should be tapered over 6–8 weeks.

### New role for an old friend: prednisone is a disease-modifying agent in early rheumatoid arthritis [^112JaMPQ]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

There has been a renewed interest in the use of low doses of prednisone in the treatment of early rheumatoid arthritis. This is because it has been conclusively shown that low doses of prednisone retard bone damage, and physicians use prednisone because it helps control tender and swollen joints. Two studies appeared in 2002, one by van Everdingen et al. and one by Landewe et al. demonstrating the reduction of bone damage in early RA with the use of prednisone. Van Everdingen used 10 mg/day of prednisone and Landewe used an initial high dose of 60 mg/day of prednisone for a week, tapering off by 6 months. The bone sparing effect was still evident at 5 years. Low doses of prednisone are well tolerated, with documented side effects including weight gain, ecchymosis, and osteopenia.

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose tapering schedules and suggests initial tapering to 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks, relapse therapy by increasing to the pre-relapse dose then decreasing gradually within 4–8 weeks, and once remission is achieved tapering daily oral prednisolone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg alternate days) until discontinuation. The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs, noting one clinical trial used a starting dose of 120 mg methylprednisolone i.m. every 3 weeks, and conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs, with exceptions for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.)

### Short courses of oral corticosteroids: lack of benefit and… [^115htuN9]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The best evidence comes from several well-designed and adequately powered randomized trials. In the first, 565 children in the United Kingdom with mild to moderate sore throat were randomized to oral dexamethasone, 10 mg, or placebo. 5 The only benefit was a small reduction in symptoms at two days, but no improvements at other times or for other outcomes. The authors' overall assessment was that this small benefit was not worth the potential harm. Regarding cough, a recent trial identified 401 adults with acute cough but no history of asthma, and randomized them to prednisolone, 40 mg once daily, or placebo. 6 The researchers found no clinically significant difference between groups in cough severity or duration, antibiotic use, peak flow rates, or patient satisfaction. This was true even for patients with wheezing on initial presentation.

Regarding back pain, a study randomized 269 adults with sciatica to a 15-day course of prednisone, 60 mg once daily tapering to 20 mg once daily, or placebo, and found no reduction in pain, function, or other outcomes. 7 However, adverse effects such as insomnia, nervousness, and increased appetite were more common in the prednisone group. Thus, the best evidence to date does not support a significant benefit for corticosteroids in patients with cough, sore throat, or back pain. However, there may be harms. A recent study identified 1. 5 million U. S. adults who had been continuously enrolled in a health insurance plan for two years. 2 Linking pharmacy records with new diagnoses, the authors found that 21% of patients received a short course of a systemic corticosteroid during the study period, and one-half received a six-day course of methylprednisolone.

The median dose was 20 mg of prednisone, and the most common indications were respiratory infection, back or neck pain, and allergies. A short course of oral corticosteroids is appropriate for many patients with acute exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and for selected patients with peritonsillar abscess, 8 severe pharyngitis, 9 and community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 10, 11 However, widespread use of corticosteroids in patients with non-pneumonia lower respiratory tract infection, nonsevere sore throat, or low back pain is inappropriate and not worth the risk of rare but potentially serious harms.

### Oral corticosteroid dosage and taper duration at onset in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease influences time to first relapse [^114jEhtp]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

There is accumulating evidence of increased relapse-associated disability in MOGAD, particularly with visual and sphincter dysfunction, reinforcing relapse prevention remains a critical therapeutic goal. While relapse rates are reported as 30%–60% in MOGAD, this may be in the order of 70% when patients are followed up for over 5 years, as in our cohort. This brings to question whether there is a role for introducing corticosteroid-sparing maintenance immunosuppression at disease onset in order to minimise relapse-associated deficits as well as corticosteroid exposure. However, while treatment of MS and NMOSD highlights the need for ongoing immunotherapy from diagnosis, in MOGAD there remains a proportion of patients who have a monophasic illness who may be unnecessarily exposed to long-term immunosuppression if this approach was uniformly adopted at disease onset.

The most salient finding of this study is the 79% reduction in the hazard of relapse at or above a dose threshold of prednisone 12.5 mg/day (0.16 mg/kg/day for children), compared to those below this dose threshold. The other key finding was strong evidence of an 88% reduced hazard of relapse for those spending at least 3 months at or above this threshold compared to those that never received this dosing. Furthermore, the annualised relapse rate reduction was not as striking when the prednisone regimens extended beyond 3 months. While many patients are commenced initially on intravenous methylprednisolone or high doses of prednisone in the range of 1 mg/kg/day, our findings suggest that this high dose may be rapidly reduced to our recommended dose of 12.5 mg/day in adults (0.16 mg/kg/day in children) for 3 months, in order to minimise total oral corticosteroid exposure while still maintaining relapse freedom. Given there were 16 patients in the ≥ 3 months treatment group, further prospective studies, with larger cohorts following the proposed dosing and duration protocol, will be essential to corroborate our findings.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — clinical scope and tapering principles: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy results in "at least 1% of the population" using it and "being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency", and this risk "is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility". Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients". Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency", and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing". The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals".

### Six-week oral prednisolone therapy for immune-related pneumonitis: a single-arm phase II study [^113vntFt]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

In clinical practice, the treatment approach of irP depends on each physician, and thus, the dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy can vary widely among patients. For example, a retrospective cohort study in the USA and Australia reported that patients with irP received a median prednisone dose of 50 mg (range, 20–80 mg) for a median duration of 68 days (range, 20–154 days). Our retrospective cohort study in Japan reported a median prednisolone dose of 30 mg (range, 20–60 mg) and a median duration of 91 days (IQR, 49.5–180.5 days) for treating irP. Insufficient corticosteroid therapy has potential risk of treatment failure. Conversely, an overlong duration of corticosteroid therapy is potentially harmful by increasing adverse events and interruption of subsequent cancer treatment. Elucidation of optimal corticosteroid therapy for irP in a prospective clinical trial is needed.

We hypothesized that high-dose corticosteroid therapy, tapered over fixed duration, would be efficacious of irP. The aim of this single-arm phase 2 study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a 6-week tapering schedule of prednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for patients with cancer with irP.

Regarding medical management for histoplasmosis, more specifically with respect to management of rheumatologic syndromes, IDSA 2007 guidelines recommend to administer prednisone (0.5–1.0 mg/kg/day, maximum 80 mg/day, in tapering doses over 1–2 weeks) in patients with severe symptoms.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1145nqem]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1178EJPP]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

### Predictors of a successful glucocorticoid tapering and withdrawal in an inception cohort of patients with lupus nephritis and associations with long-term outcomes and damage accrual [^112im18a]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

The median time to first CR was 6 (IQR 9) months after LN diagnosis; at 12 months, 70.2% of the patients had achieved CR and 75.6% had an SLEDAI-2K ≤ 4.

The median time from LN diagnosis to a GC dose of 7.5, 5 and 0 mg/day (GC D/C) was 9 (IQR 6), 12 (IQR 12) and 29 (IQR 22) months, respectively.

Achievement of GC ≤ 5 mg/day (prednisone equivalent)

75 (55%) patients achieved a GC dose of ≤ 5 mg/day before 12 months (59/75 before month 12), 28% between months 12 and 24 and 17% after 24 months. Patients diagnosed after 2010 achieved a more rapid reduction in GC dose, with a higher proportion reaching ≤ 5 mg/day by month 12 (84% vs 55%, p < 0.001) compared with those diagnosed before 2010.

Patients on GC doses ≤ 5 mg/day compared with those on > 5 mg/day (n = 61) at month 12 had received CYC less frequently as initial treatment (46.4% vs 82.5%, p < 0.001) and had at the baseline lower SLEDAI-2K scores (median 11.5 vs 13, p = 0.002), lower proteinuria levels (median 2.1 vs 3.5 g/day, p = 0.013) and better kidney function (median eGFR 103 vs 95 mL/min/1.73 m², p = 0.08). The median initial GC dose was comparable between the two groups (36 vs 32 mg/day, p = 0.78) (table 1). Patients on doses ≤ 5 mg/day at month 12 achieved CR earlier after diagnosis (6 (IQR 9) vs 10 (IQR 12), p = 0.001) and the majority of them had CR (82% vs 55%, p < 0.001) and SLEDAI-2K ≤ 4 (86.4% vs 60%, p = 0.001) by month 12. Among patients with PLN, those with class IV LN were significantly less likely to taper GC to ≤ 5 mg/day at 12 months (34.5% vs 61.9%, p = 0.025) than those with class III or mixed classes.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1117Dpyy]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

### Tapering long-term opioid therapy… [^115HKX1G]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

RISK–BENEFIT CALCULATION The risk–benefit calculation helps determine whether the relative benefits of opioid therapy outweigh the risks and whether a dose decrease or full taper is indicated. 3 This calculation is not about any specific dose of opioids but about weighing the risks and benefits in a given patient and tapering to a place where benefits exceed risks, including the risks of a taper. An opioid taper should be considered when any of the following situations occur: Failure to provide significant analgesia despite incremental dose increases, Lack of functional improvement over time, Prescription of high dosages of opioids, Significant physical risk factors are present, Adverse effects of medication interfere with quality of life, Dangerous coprescribing, Patient request.

VELOCITY MATTERS Velocity. The standard recommendation to decrease opioid doses by 5% to 10% of the starting dose every one to two weeks 8 is intolerable for many patients using long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain. Many patients need to decrease by less than 5% every month, with even smaller decrements toward the end of the taper. 9 Some patients require many months to wean off chronic opioid therapy, especially those who have taken opioids daily for decades. It may be helpful to keep the same dosing cadence, especially in the beginning of the taper. The brain is habituated to having the medication at set times. If the patient is on a regimen of taking doses two times or three times a day, keep that schedule during the taper for as long as possible. Breaks in the taper are appropriate. Patients can maintain a given dose for some period before continuing.

For example, if the patient has an important event scheduled and does not want to risk being in low-grade withdrawal, including subtle psychological symptoms of withdrawal such as anxiety, irritability, and dysphoria, it is reasonable to defer the next decrement in dose. It is imperative never to go backward during the taper. Going back up on the dose risks losing the hard work already invested. Nonaddictive medications can help relieve symptoms of withdrawal.

Regarding medical management for immune thrombocytopenia, more specifically with respect to first-line therapy (pediatric patients), ASH 2019 guidelines recommend to consider using prednisone (2–4 mg/kg per day; maximum, 120 mg daily, for 5–7 days) rather than dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg per day; maximum, 40 mg/kg per day, for 4 days) as the first-line corticosteroid agent.

### No evidence found for an association between prednisone dose and FVC change in newly-treated pulmonary sarcoidosis [^113jrtkh]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Prednisone is used as first-line therapy for pulmonary sarcoidosis. What dosing strategy has the best balance between effect and side-effects is largely unknown. We analyzed change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and weight during different prednisone doses used in daily practice for treatment naïve pulmonary sarcoidosis patients.

Methods

Multilevel models were used to describe FVC and weight change over time. Correlations were calculated using linear regression models.

Results

Fifty-four patients were included. FVC changed over time (p < 0.001), with an average increase of 9.6% predicted (95% CI: 7.2 to 12.1) at 12 months. Weight changed significantly over time (p < 0.001), with an average increase of 4.3 kg (95% CI: 3.0 to 5.6) at 12 months. Although FVC and weight changed significantly over time, there was little correlation between prednisone dose and FVC change, while weight increase correlated significantly with cumulative prednisone dose at 24 months. In patients treated with a high cumulative prednisone dose, baseline FVC was on average lower (p = 0.001) compared to low dose treated patients, while no significant differences were observed in need for second/third-line therapy or number of exacerbations. A strategy leading to a low cumulative dose at 12 months was defined by rapid dose tapering to 10 mg/day within 3.5 months.

Conclusions

These results suggest that prednisone therapy aimed at improving or preserving FVC in newly- treated pulmonary sarcoidosis can often be reduced in dose, using a treatment regimen that is characterized by early dose tapering.

### Expert consensus on the tapering of oral corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma. A Delphi study [^115xr92v]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: There is a need to minimize oral corticosteroid (OCS) use in patients with asthma to prevent their costly and burdensome adverse effects. Current guidelines do not provide recommendations for OCS tapering in patients with asthma. Objectives: To develop expert consensus on OCS tapering among international experts. Methods: A modified Delphi method was used to develop expert consensus statements relating to OCS use, tapering, adverse effects, adrenal insufficiency, and patient-physician shared decision-making. Initial statements proposed by experts were categorized, filtered for repetition, and presented back to experts over three ranking rounds to obtain consensus (≥ 70% agreement). Measurements and Main Results: One hundred thirty-one international experts participated in the study, and 296 statements were ranked. Numerous recommendations and guidance regarding appropriate OCS use were established. Experts agreed that OCS tapering should be attempted in all patients with asthma receiving maintenance OCS therapy, with personalization of tapering rhythm and speed. The importance of recognizing individual adverse effects was also established; however, a unified approach to the assessment of adrenal insufficiency was not reached. Shared decision-making was considered an important goal during the tapering process. Conclusions: In this Delphi study, expert consensus statements were generated on OCS use, tapering, adverse-effect screening, and shared decision-making, which may be used to inform clinical practice. Areas of nonconsensus were identified, highlighting uncertainty among the experts around some aspects of OCS use in asthma, such as adrenal insufficiency, which underscores the need for further research in these domains.
