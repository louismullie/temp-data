## Question

When to stop cardiac massage after sudden cardiac arrest without any sign of recovery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to stop cardiac massage (chest compressions) after sudden cardiac arrest when there is no sign of recovery. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core principle that compressions continue until ROSC or a decision to terminate. Then, I should verify the general time thresholds for stopping in the absence of ROSC, distinguishing shockable from non-shockable rhythms. Next, I will examine validated decision rules and objective markers that inform termination. After that, I need to consider special circumstances that modify duration, such as hypothermia, cardiac surgery, and toxicologic causes. Finally, I should review team process, documentation, and post-arrest neuroprognostication to ensure decisions are ethically and clinically sound.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: chest compressions should continue uninterrupted until there is return of spontaneous circulation or a senior clinician determines that further efforts are futile, with ROSC defined as a sustained pulse and adequate blood pressure for at least 20 minutes, which is the standard outcome definition used in resuscitation registries and studies [^111nho4R] [^113BcBCo].

> Now, I should review general duration guidance for non-shockable rhythms. In asystole or pulseless electrical activity without ROSC, the probability of favorable outcome drops sharply over time; contemporary data suggest that after about 20 minutes of high-quality ALS, the likelihood of survival with good neurologic function approaches zero in normothermic adults, and many systems use a 20–30 minute window before declaring futility, provided all reversible causes have been addressed and there is no response [^117WZv1q] [^113aNAhQ].

> Wait, let me verify the shockable rhythm side, because I initially thought "continue at least 30 minutes" as a blanket rule; that sounds too rigid. Hold on, I should verify against the data. For VF/VT, prolonged resuscitation can still be reasonable, and some guidance suggests extending efforts toward 40–60 minutes in select cases, especially if there is intermittent VF/VT activity or a reversible cause is suspected; importantly, 99% of survivors with favorable functional outcome in one model achieved ROSC within about 40 minutes, though this does not mean all resuscitations should go that long, and decisions should be individualized [^117BcENk] [^117WZv1q].

> Next, I should review validated decision tools. The UN10 rule for in-hospital cardiac arrest predicts very low likelihood of survival when the arrest is unwitnessed, the rhythm is non-shockable, and there is no ROSC within 10 minutes; however, I need to double-check its performance in real-world cohorts, which show that a small but meaningful fraction of patients meeting UN10 do survive, so it should not be used as an absolute stop rule but rather as a risk stratifier for shared decision-making and consideration of termination [^115sz8fU].

> I will now examine objective markers that support termination. An end-tidal CO2 persistently below 20 mmHg after 20 minutes of high-quality CPR, in the absence of hypothermia or airway/ventilation issues, correlates with low likelihood of ROSC and can support a decision to stop; similarly, invasive arterial monitoring showing inadequate perfusion pressures despite optimized compressions reinforces futility, though these are adjuncts to, not substitutes for, clinical judgment [^117WZv1q].

> But wait, what if the patient is hypothermic? I need to ensure I do not apply normothermic termination rules to hypothermia. In accidental hypothermia, CPR should generally not be terminated based on duration alone; instead, resuscitation should continue until the patient is rewarmed to at least 30–32°C, with termination considered only if hyperkalemia exceeds 12 mmol/L or if all reversible causes are excluded and there remains no response after appropriate rewarming and interventions [^1142AxnY].

> Let me consider post–cardiac surgery patients. After sternotomy, external compressions are often ineffective for tamponade or hypovolemia; early resternotomy and internal cardiac massage are prioritized, and the decision to stop is typically deferred until internal maneuvers and correction of reversible surgical causes have been attempted, reflecting the unique pathophysiology in this population [^116haptG].

> I should also review toxicologic cardiac arrest. In poisoning or drug overdose, prolonged resuscitation — often beyond standard durations — is frequently warranted because of the potential for reversibility with antidotes and extracorporeal support; termination decisions should incorporate toxicology consultation and consideration of extracorporeal CPR in appropriate settings [^11296P2V].

> Next, I should review the team process and documentation. Termination should be a senior clinician decision made with team consensus, ideally after addressing reversible causes, ensuring high-quality CPR with minimal interruptions, and communicating with medical control when appropriate; documenting time stamps, rhythm evolution, interventions, and the rationale for termination supports quality review and family counseling [^113aNAhQ] [^111K3sz9].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of post-arrest neuroprognostication, because stopping compressions is not the end of decision-making. After ROSC, if the patient remains comatose, prognostication should be deferred until at least 72 hours after normothermia and off sedatives, using a multimodal approach and avoiding premature withdrawal of life support; recent data highlight that many patients deemed to have poor prognosis early were judged by expert reviewers to have had recovery potential, underscoring the need for caution and standardized multimodal assessment [^114N9xqx] [^1121hA6E] [^117ULbvh].

> Putting this together, my practical synthesis is as follows: continue compressions until ROSC or until a senior clinician determines futility; in normothermic adults, consider termination after about 20–30 minutes of high-quality ALS without ROSC for non-shockable rhythms, and extend toward 40–60 minutes for refractory VF/VT when there is ongoing electrical activity or a suspected reversible cause; use EtCO2 less than 20 mmHg, invasive hemodynamics, and validated tools like UN10 as supportive — not absolute — guides; and always adapt for special circumstances such as hypothermia, post–cardiac surgery, and toxicologic arrest, with transparent team communication and meticulous documentation [^117WZv1q] [^117BcENk] [^115sz8fU] [^115JCuRb] [^116haptG] [^11296P2V].

Stop cardiac massage when there is **ROSC** or a valid DNR order [^111nho4R]. If there is no ROSC, stop after **20–30 minutes** of high-quality ALS [^117WZv1q] when there is no reversible cause identified, no shockable rhythm, and no signs of life [^117WZv1q]. In hypothermia, continue until the core temperature is **≥ 30°C** [^1142AxnY]. For trauma, stop after **15–30 minutes** if there is no ROSC and no reversible cause is found [^111fXYBN]. Always base the decision on clinical judgment, patient factors, and team consensus [^113aNAhQ], and document the rationale [^111K3sz9].

## Indications to stop cardiac massage

### Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)

- **Definition**: ROSC is the restoration of a palpable pulse and measurable blood pressure [^notfound].
- **Action**: Stop chest compressions immediately when ROSC is confirmed [^115NvYBu].
- **Post-ROSC care**: Place the patient in the recovery position if unconscious but breathing normally [^113aNAhQ].

---

### Valid do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order

A valid DNR order means the patient has documented wishes to forgo resuscitation. Stop chest compressions immediately when a valid DNR is presented [^111nho4R].

---

### Clinical judgment of futility

- **Definition**: The arrest is unresponsive to treatment after adequate ALS [^113aNAhQ].
- **Factors**: Consider time to CPR, duration of compressions, initial rhythm, age, comorbidities, and reversible causes [^113aNAhQ].
- **General guideline**: Prolonged compressions (> 30 min) without ROSC have low success, especially in non-shockable rhythms [^114zFFXj].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and guidelines

### Non-traumatic cardiac arrest

- **Asystole or PEA**: Consider termination after 20 minutes of ALS if no ROSC and no reversible cause [^notfound].
- **Shockable rhythms (VF/VT)**: Continue until rhythm is no longer shockable or ROSC is achieved [^113aNAhQ].
- **EtCO2 < 20 mmHg**: Consider termination if persistent after 20 minutes of ALS [^117WZv1q].

---

### Traumatic cardiac arrest

Blunt trauma warrants termination after **15–30 minutes** if there is no ROSC and no reversible cause is identified [^111fXYBN]. Penetrating trauma warrants termination after **15–30 minutes** if there is no ROSC and no reversible cause is identified [^111fXYBN].

---

### Hypothermia

In hypothermia, **continue CPR** until the core temperature is **≥ 30°C** [^notfound]. Terminate only if **hyperkalemia > 12 mmol/L** is present [^1142AxnY].

---

## Ethical considerations and documentation

Ethical considerations include **team consensus** — the decision to stop should involve the team and consider patient factors [^113aNAhQ] — and **family communication** — explain the rationale and provide support [^111K3sz9]. Documentation should record the **rationale, duration, and team consensus** [^111K3sz9].

## When to stop cardiac massage

| **Scenario** | **Indication to stop** |
|-|-|
| ROSC | Confirmed pulse and blood pressure [^115NvYBu] |
| Valid DNR | Documented order presented [^111nho4R] |
| Non-traumatic arrest | - No ROSC after 20–30 min <br/> - No reversible cause <br/> - No shockable rhythm [^117WZv1q] |
| Traumatic arrest | - No ROSC after 15–30 min <br/> - No reversible cause [^111fXYBN] |
| Hypothermia | Core temperature ≥ 30°C or hyperkalemia > 12 mmol/L [^1142AxnY] |

---

Stop cardiac massage when **ROSC is achieved**, a valid DNR is presented, or when continued resuscitation is deemed futile by clinical judgment. The decision should be individualized, considering patient factors, arrest characteristics, and team consensus, and must be clearly documented [^113aNAhQ].

### Technique for chest compressions in adult CPR [^116Kn3Kw]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Chest compressions have saved the lives of countless patients in cardiac arrest as they generate a small but critical amount of blood flow to the heart and brain. This is achieved by direct cardiac massage as well as a thoracic pump mechanism. In order to optimize blood flow excellent chest compression technique is critical. Thus, the quality of the delivered chest compressions is a pivotal determinant of successful resuscitation. If a patient is found unresponsive without a definite pulse or normal breathing then the responder should assume that this patient is in cardiac arrest, activate the emergency response system and immediately start chest compressions. Contra-indications to starting chest compressions include a valid Do Not Attempt Resuscitation Order. Optimal technique for adult chest compressions includes positioning the patient supine, and pushing hard and fast over the center of the chest with the outstretched arms perpendicular to the patient's chest. The rate should be at least 100 compressions per minute and any interruptions should be minimized to achieve a minimum of 60 actually delivered compressions per minute. Aggressive rotation of compressors prevents decline of chest compression quality due to fatigue. Chest compressions are terminated following return of spontaneous circulation. Unconscious patients with normal breathing are placed in the recovery position. If there is no return of spontaneous circulation, then the decision to terminate chest compressions is based on the clinical judgment that the patient's cardiac arrest is unresponsive to treatment. Finally, it is important that family and patients' loved ones who witness chest compressions be treated with consideration and sensitivity.

Executive Summary

The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Task Force on Resuscitation After Cardiac Surgery provides this professional society perspective on resuscitation in patients who arrest after cardiac surgery. This document was created using a multimodal methodology for evidence generation and includes information from existing guidelines, from the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, from our own structured literature reviews on issues particular to cardiac surgery, and from an international survey on resuscitation hosted by CTSNet. In gathering evidence for this consensus paper, searches were conducted using the MEDLINE keywords "cardiac surgery", "resuscitation", "guideline", "thoracic surgery", "cardiac arrest", and "cardiac massage". Weight was given to clinical studies in humans, although some case studies, mannequin simulations of potential protocols, and animal models were also considered. Consensus was reached using a modified Delphi method consisting of two rounds of voting until 75% agreement on appropriate wording and strength of the opinions was reached. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Workforce on Critical Care was enlisted in this process to provide a wider variety of experiences and backgrounds in an effort to reinforce the opinions provided. We start with the premise that external massage is ineffective for an arrest due to tamponade or hypovolemia (bleeding), and therefore these subsets of patients will receive inadequate cerebral perfusion during cardiac arrest in the absence of resternotomy. Because these two situations are common causes for an arrest after cardiac surgery, the inability to provide effective external cardiopulmonary resuscitation highlights the importance of early emergency resternotomy within 5 minutes. In addition, because internal massage is more effective than external massage, it should be used preferentially if other quickly reversible causes are not found. We present a protocol for the cardiac arrest situation that includes the following recommendations: (1) successful treatment of a patient who arrests after cardiac surgery is a multidisciplinary activity with at least six key roles that should be allocated and rehearsed as a team on a regular basis; (2) patients who arrest with ventricular fibrillation should immediately receive three sequential attempts at defibrillation before external cardiac massage, and if this fails, emergency resternotomy should be performed; (3) patients with asystole or extreme bradycardia should undergo an attempt to pace if wires are available before external cardiac massage, then optionally external pacing followed by emergency resternotomy; and (4) pulseless electrical activity should receive prompt resternotomy after quickly reversible causes are excluded. Finally, we recommend that full doses of epinephrine should not be routinely given owing to the danger of extreme hypertension if a reversible cause is rapidly resolved. Protocols are given for excluding reversible airway and breathing complications, for left ventricular assist device emergencies, for the nonsternotomy patient, and for safe emergency resternotomy. We believe that all cardiac units should have accredited policies and protocols in place to specifically address the resuscitation of patients who arrest after cardiac surgery.

### Unnecessary interruptions of cardiac massage during simulated cardiac arrests [^113EmjkA]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should not be interrupted until the return of spontaneous circulation or the decision to withhold further treatment. There are no data on how consistent in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation is performed. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to identify length and type of unnecessary interruptions in simulated cardiac arrests.

Methods

The study was carried out in a patient simulator. A scenario of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation was used. Resuscitation teams consisted of three nurses, a resident and a staff physician. Using videotapes recorded during simulations, the activities of the teams were coded in 5-s intervals. Unnecessary interruptions were defined as any interruptions in cardiac massage of 10 s or more that were not caused by defibrillation or endotracheal intubation.

Results

Twelve teams were studied. The total time of possible cardiac massage was 414 ± 125 s. In each team at least one unnecessary interruption occurred (range 1–5). Interruptions mounted up to 65 ± 40 s (range 20–155) or 16 ± 10% (range 5–41) of the total time of possible cardiac massage. Failure to swiftly resume cardiac massage after an unsuccessful defibrillation accounted for 14 of 39 episodes and for 44 ± 40% of the time of unnecessary interruptions. The debriefings revealed that participants had generally not noticed the unnecessary interruptions during the simulation.

Conclusions

The present study identified a significant amount of unnecessary interruptions in cardiac massage. These interruptions were not noticed by the health-care workers involved.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) definition states it is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation, and if corrective measures are not taken rapidly, this condition progresses to sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to neuroprognostication, general principles, AHA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider consolidating the interpretation of multimodal prognostic assessments at a minimum of 72 hours after normothermia and discontinuation of sedatives in adult patients who remain comatose after cardiac arrest.

Termination of Efforts

Chest compressions are terminated following ROSC and unconscious patients with normal breathing are placed in the recovery position. If there is no ROSC, then the decision to terminate efforts is based on the clinical judgment that the patient's arrest is unresponsive to treatment. This decision should be made by the physician leading the emergency response team after consultation with the members of the team. The factors that are considered include the time to initiate chest compressions, duration of chest compressions, initial arrest rhythm, age, comorbidities and any reversible causes of cardiac arrest such as drug overdose. The duration of cardiac arrest is the most important prognostic factor. In general, chest compressions should be continued at least as long as VF persists. Prolonged chest compressions are less likely to succeed if there is no ROSC within half an hour. However, case reports with exceptional ROSC are well documented and each decision to terminate efforts should be made individually. Any family members and patients' loved ones who witness chest compressions should be treated with consideration and sensitivity.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death — SCA is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity such that the victim becomes unresponsive, with either persisting gasping respirations or absence of any respiratory movements, and no signs of circulation as manifest by the absence of a perceptible pulse, and an arrest is presumed to be of cardiac etiology unless a noncardiac cause is known or likely; sudden cardiac death is sudden and unexpected death occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms, or occurring in patients found dead within 24 h of being asymptomatic and presumably due to a cardiac arrhythmia or hemodynamic catastrophe.

### Tight control of effectiveness of cardiac massage with invasive blood pressure monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation [^116okt93]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The continuity of chest compression is the main challenge in prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the field as well as during transport. Invasive blood pressure monitoring with visible pulse waves by means of an arterial line set prehospitally allows for tight control of the effectiveness of chest compressions as well as of the impact of the administered epinephrine and also captures beginning fatigue of the rescuers. In this case, maintaining uninterrupted circulation through manual as well as mechanical chest compressions continued until the successful percutaneous coronary intervention saved the patients life without neurologic damage.

### Cardiac arrest, chain of survival and utstein style [^114GnaXG]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrest is a dramatic condition leading to sudden death if someone cannot perform two interventions, basic life support and early defibrillation, that have been proved to improve long-term survival. The modern era of cardiopulmonary resuscitation began with a description of closed chest cardiac massage by Kouwenhoven in 1960. Research to make advances in cardiac arrest is a very difficult task. Experts set up a series of guidelines that represent a keystone for educational needs and evolving technology. There is a consensus that the highest potential survival rate from cardiac arrest can only be achieved when the following sequence of events occurs as rapidly as possible: (1) recognition of early warning signs, (2) activation of the emergency medical services, (3) basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation, (4) cardiac defibrillation, (5) management of the airway and ventilation of the lungs, and (6) intravenous (i.v.) administration of medications. These events are necessary for any success of emergency cardiovascular care. They are linked in a chain of survival. The links in the adult chain of survival are: early access; early CPR; early defibrillation; and early acute cardiac life support. The 'Utstein style', recently introduced, represents a standard of practice both inside and outside hospital with recommended guidelines for the uniform reporting of clinical data from the patient suffering cardiac arrest. According to the concept of the chain of survival, the Utstein style delineates time and establishes a set of core and supplemental times to be recorded that provide important characteristics of the response of victims of cardiac arrest.

Data collection

Cardiac arrest was defined as the cessation of cardiac mechanical activity or circulatory arrest as confirmed by the absence of signs of circulation that require chest compression or that resulted in death. For this study, we defined PPOCA as cardiac arrest occurring after patient arrival in the operating room until 24 h after completion of anaesthesia. Participants were identified from the hospital database using the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10). The ICD-9 codes were 3965 extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 9960 cardiopulmonary resuscitations, not otherwise specified, 9962 other electric countershock of heart, 9963 closed chest cardiac massage; and the ICD-10 codes were I46 cardiac arrest, I460 cardiac arrest with successful resuscitation, I461 sudden cardiac death, so described, I469 cardiac arrest unspecified. Participants who received intra-operative care for organ donation were excluded from the study. We further categorised PPOCA into intra-operative and postoperative cardiac arrest. Intra-operative cardiac arrest was defined as cardiac arrest occurring in the operating room (during induction, maintenance, or emergence). Postoperative cardiac arrest was defined as cardiac arrest occurring after completion of anaesthesia until 24 h postsurgery (during transfer, PACU, ICU, or regular ward).

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^1155VTG8]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Termination of resuscitative efforts — traumatic cardiac arrest (adults) notes the patient is at least 18 years of age, and resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any blunt trauma patient who, based on thorough primary assessment, is found apneic, pulseless, and asystolic on an EKG or cardiac monitor upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene. Victims of penetrating trauma found apneic and pulseless by EMS should be rapidly assessed for signs of life (pupillary reflexes, spontaneous movement, response to pain, electrical activity on EKG); resuscitation may be terminated by contacting medical direction oversight if these signs of life are absent, and if resuscitation is not terminated, transport is indicated. Cardiopulmonary arrest patients in whom mechanism of injury does not correlate with clinical condition, suggesting a non-traumatic cause of arrest, should have standard ALS resuscitation initiated; all EMS personnel involved in the patient's care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is appropriate, and consider contacting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts.

### Recovery potential in patients after cardiac arrest who die after limitations or withdrawal of life support [^117ULbvh]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How often do experts believe that there was recovery potential in patients who had limitations or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy (WLST) after resuscitation from cardiac arrest?

Findings

In this cohort study of 2391 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, all cases of patients who died after WLST (1431 [59.8%]) were evaluated. Upon independent review by 38 international experts, 913 patients (63.8%) who died after WLST were believed to have had a chance of recovery had life-sustaining therapy been continued.

Meaning

These findings suggest that pessimistic clinical impressions and treatment decisions may perpetuate therapeutic nihilism and biased research.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest definition — Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity such that the victim becomes unresponsive, with either persisting gasping respirations or absence of any respiratory movements, and no signs of circulation as manifest by the absence of a perceptible pulse; an arrest is presumed to be of cardiac etiology unless it is known or likely to have been caused by trauma, drowning, respiratory failure or asphyxia, electrocution, drug overdose, or any other noncardiac cause.

### Clinical predictive models of sudden cardiac arrest: a survey of the current science and analysis of model performances [^1159v23V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is the abrupt cessation of cardiac activity such that an individual becomes unresponsive, without breathing or signs of circulation. 1 In the United States, there are ≈360 000 out‐of‐hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) events and 210 000 in‐hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) events annually. 2 Prognosis after an SCA is dismal, with survival from OHCA and IHCA estimated to be ≈10% 3 and 25%, 4 respectively; rates of good neurologic outcome are even lower. Because of the often‐precipitous nature of SCA, surrogate decision makers may find themselves in the position of having to make unexpected, difficult choices about care for these patients. Critical decisions, such as withdrawal of care, tracheostomy or percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement, and subsequent changes in code status, are particularly difficult when overall prognosis is unclear. Effectively differentiating patients who are likely to do well after an SCA event from those who are unlikely to do well may help to guide these decisions. Unfortunately, this task is made more difficult by a lack of clear criteria or published guidelines on when and from whom care should be withdrawn after an SCA.

Clinical predictive models (CPMs) can help stratify patients by outcome risk. These models use patient‐specific data to make personalized clinical predictions. However, although some CPMs have been validated rigorously and incorporated into clinical practice guidelines, there is currently no CPM related to SCA outcome that has gained widespread use. In the present study, we assessed currently available SCA CPMs with special attention to how rigorously models have been validated and which variables emerge as being consistently important for predicting outcomes.

### Open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation: past, present and future [^112N5F21]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrests account for approximately 1000 sudden cardiac deaths per day in the United States. Since its introduction in 1960 closed-chest cardiac massage (CCCM) often takes place as an attempt at resuscitation, although its survival rates are low. Other resuscitation techniques are available to physicians such as open-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (OCCPR). OCCPR has been shown by several scientists to be hemodynamically superior to CCCM as it increases arterial pressures, cardiac output, coronary perfusion pressures, return of spontaneous circulation and cerebral blood flow. Improved neurological and cardiovascular outcome and an increase in survival rate compared to CCCM have been described. Timing is one of the key variables in determining patient outcome when performing OCCPR. The American Heart Association in association with the International Liaison Committee (ILCOR) has specific indications for the use of OCCPR. Some investigators recommend starting OCCPR in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests on arrival at the scene instead of CCCM. Surprisingly, the incidence of infectious complications after thoracotomy in an unprepared chest is low. The vast majority of the patients' families accept OCCPR as a therapeutic choice for cardiac arrests and it has been showed to be economically viable. This paper reviews some of the basic and advanced concepts of this evolving technique.

Termination of resuscitative efforts — non-traumatic cardiac arrest (adults) applies when the patient is at least 18 years of age and is in cardiac arrest at the time of arrival of advanced life support (ALS) with no pulse, no respirations, and no evidence of meaningful cardiac activity (e.g., asystole or wide complex PEA less than 60 BPM, no heart sounds), and ALS resuscitation is administered appropriate to the presenting and persistent cardiac rhythm. Resuscitation may be terminated in asystole and slow wide complex PEA if there is no return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes in the absence of hypothermia and the EtCO2 is less than 20 mmHg. For narrow complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recurrent ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia, consider resuscitation for up to 60 minutes from the time of dispatch; termination efforts may be ceased before 60 minutes based on factors including, but not limited to, EtCO2 less than 20 mmHg, age, co-morbidities, distance from, and resources available at the closest hospital, and termination before this timeframe should be done in consultation with online medical direction. Additional criteria include that there is no return of spontaneous pulse and no evidence of neurological function (non-reactive pupils, no response to pain, no spontaneous movement), no evidence or suspicion of hypothermia, all EMS clinicians involved in the patient's care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is appropriate, and consider contacting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts.

### Sudden cardiac death: directing the scope of resuscitation towards the heart and brain [^115baAYU]. Resuscitation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The fundamental goal of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is recovery of the heart and the brain. This is best achieved by (1) immediate CPR for coronary and cerebral perfusion, (2) correction of the cause of cardiac arrest, and (3) controlled cardioplegic cardiac reperfusion. Failure of such an integrated therapy may cause permanent brain damage despite cardiac resuscitation.

Methods

This strategy was applied at four centers to 34 sudden cardiac death patients (a) after acute myocardial infarction (n = 20), (b) "intraoperatively" following successful discontinuation of cardiopulmonary bypass (n = 4), and (c) "postoperatively" in the surgical ICU (n = 10). In each witnessed arrest the patient failed to respond to conventional CPR with ACLS interventions, including defibrillation. The cardiac arrest interval was 72 ± 43 min (20–150 min). Compression and drugs maintained a BP > 60 mmHg to avoid cerebral hypoperfusion. Operating room (OR) transfer was delayed until the blood pressure was monitored. In four patients femoral bypass maintained perfusion while an angiographic diagnosis was made.

Results

Management principles included no repeat defibrillation attempts after 10 min of unsuccessful CPR, catheter-monitored peak BP > 60 mmHg during diagnosis and transit to the operating room, left ventricular venting during cardiopulmonary bypass and 20 min global and graft substrate enriched blood cardioplegic reperfusion. Survival was 79.4% with two neurological complications (5.8%).

Conclusions

Recovery without adverse neurological outcomes is possible in a large number of cardiac arrest victims following prolonged manual CPR. Therapy is directed toward maintaining a monitored peak BP above 60 mmHg, determining the nature of the cardiac cause, and correcting it with controlled reperfusion to preserve function.

Because pauses and delay in starting CPR contribute to lower survival, the previous 2020 time-limited recommendation for placement of a mCPR device has been revised to state that mCPR application should not delay the start of manual compressions.

### Reexamination of the UN10 rule to discontinue resuscitation during in-hospital cardiac arrest [^115sz8fU]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Several clinical decision rules (CDRs) have been developed to help practitioners know when to safely terminate resuscitative efforts after in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA). The UN10 rule, a CDR that uses 3 intra-arrest variables, has been shown to predict a poor chance of survival to discharge. However, its large-scale applicability in clinical settings remains unknown.

Objective

To assess the performance of a parsimonious CDR in a national cohort of individuals with IHCA.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study used a nationwide cohort from the American Heart Association Get With the Guidelines-Resuscitation IHCA registry to derive a sample of 96 509 patients from 716 US hospitals who experienced IHCA from January 1, 2000, to January 26, 2016. Data analysis began in January 2018 and concluded in June 2018.

Exposures

The UN10 rule uses 3 variables: (1) unwitnessed arrest, (2) nonshockable rhythm, and (3) no return of spontaneous circulation within 10 minutes of resuscitative efforts. The CDR indicates futility if all 3 criteria are met. This CDR was analyzed according to the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) reporting guideline.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was survival to hospital discharge following resuscitation. Favorable neurologic status at discharge was also assessed. Overall rates of survival and survival with favorable neurologic status (cerebral performance category score, 1 or 2) were compared with predicted values by the UN10 rule using 2×2 contingency tables.

Results

Of 96 509 patients, 55 761 (57.8%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 67.1 (15.3) years. In total, 18 713 patients (19.4%) survived to discharge, and 16 134 patients (16.7%) were discharged with a favorable neurologic status. Overall, 15 838 patients (16.4%) met all 3 criteria for futility in the UN10 rule. A total of 1005 patients (6.3%) who met the UN10 rule survived to discharge, and 754 (4.8%) survived with favorable neurologic status. The percentage of patients meeting the UN10 rule (ie, predicting futile resuscitation) who actually survived in our study cohort was substantially higher than the initial derivation cohort (0%) and single-center validation cohort (1.1%). The positive predictive value of the UN10 rule was 93.7% (95% CI, 93.3%-94.0%), which was lower than the initial derivation cohort (100%; 95% CI, 97.5%-100%) and validation cohort (98.9%; 95% CI, 96.5%-99.7%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Patients who met the UN10 rule were associated with unfavorable neurologic status and low rates of survival after IHCA. Yet their survival rates are higher than reported in the initial validation study, raising the question of whether the UN10 rule may have limited utility as a definitive measure of futility during resuscitations in real-world clinical settings.

Bradycardia or conduction disorders — history and physical examination: In patients with suspected bradycardia or conduction disorders a comprehensive history and physical examination should be performed (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO). The history should include the frequency, timing, duration, severity, longevity, circumstances, triggers and alleviating factors of symptoms suspicious for bradycardia or conduction disorders, and because some medications can elicit or exacerbate bradyarrhythmias, a thorough review of both prescription and over-the-counter medications is essential. Carotid sinus massage can be helpful in patients with symptoms suggestive of carotid sinus hypersensitivity syndrome, but it should be performed in both the supine and upright position with careful blood pressure and electrocardiographic monitoring, and careful carotid auscultation (and/or carotid ultrasound) to exclude an ipsilateral carotid bruit is mandatory before performing this maneuver as strokes precipitated by carotid sinus massage have been reported.

Ventricular arrhythmia classification by clinical presentation — definitions used include: Asymptomatic defined as "The absence of symptoms that could result from an arrhythmia". Minimal symptoms/palpitations are patient-reported palpitations in the chest, throat, or neck with sensations such as "Heartbeat sensations that feel like pounding or racing", "An unpleasant awareness of heartbeat", or "Feeling skipped beats or a pause". Presyncope is reported with symptoms including dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint, or "Graying out". Syncope is "Sudden loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone, not related to anesthesia, with spontaneous recovery as reported by the patient or observer", and patients "may experience syncope when supine". Sudden cardiac death is "Death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms", whereas sudden cardiac arrest is the same presentation "in whom medical intervention (e.g., defibrillation) reverses the event".

### Duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and outcomes for adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest: retrospective cohort study [^114zFFXj]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

In comparison with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, a retrospective analysis of a multicenter, cluster randomized clinical trial (ROC-PRIMED; Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Prehospital Resuscitation Using an Impedance Valve and Early Versus Delayed) in the US and Canada showed that 99% of patients who had favorable functional outcome at hospital discharge had return of spontaneous circulation within 37 minutes' duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. This is shorter than 43 minutes in our results, which is likely explained by the difference in time to start of cardiopulmonary resuscitation in out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings.

Implications of findings

Firstly, we quantified the time dependent changes in the probabilities of patients' outcomes as a function of duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The time dependent probabilities of survival and favorable functional outcome among patients pending the first return of spontaneous circulation at each minute's duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation provide resuscitation teams, patients, and their surrogates with insights into the likelihood of favorable outcomes if the patient continues to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation beyond that time point, which is clinically informative for shared decision making to determine whether further cardiopulmonary resuscitation would be beneficial. For example, a pamphlet describing this time dependent probabilities would be helpful for patients' surrogates to provide objective guidance and make decisions on continuing or discontinuing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. On the other hand, the probabilities of survival and favorable functional outcome among patients who had the first return of spontaneous circulation before or at each time point inform resuscitation teams, patients, and their surrogates of the likelihood of favorable outcomes once the patient has achieved return of spontaneous circulation at or by the time point, which is clinically relevant to estimate subsequent outcomes after return of spontaneous circulation.

### Critical care management of patients after cardiac arrest: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and Neurocritical Care Society [^117WRogc]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiac arrest (CA) affects > 600,000 people in the United States annually, with a worldwide annual incidence of 30 to 97 individuals per 100,000 population. Intensive care management of CA survivors is important and influences survival and neurological outcomes. Although there has been improvement in outcomes of patients with sudden CA, overall survival continues to be low, and the quality of life of survivors is affected. The overall survival to hospital discharge in 2020 in adults resuscitated from out-of-hospital CA was 9% and in those with in-hospital CA was 23%. Research and advancement of care have focused on the chain of survival measures to improve CA resuscitation: recognition of CA and activation of emergency response, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with emphasis on high-quality chest compressions, early defibrillation, basic and advanced life support, post-CA care, and recovery. Focus has been on early response with the goal of achieving return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as soon as possible. Achieving ROSC is just the start of comprehensive, multisystem care for survivors of CA. On achieving ROSC, the majority of CA survivors remain unresponsive, a marker of significant brain injury. Unfortunately, the overall certainty of evidence for the benefit of many interventions after ROSC is limited.

Current guidelines provide few strong recommendations about post-CA care because of the scope of available literature and limited certainty of evidence. The guidelines writing processes consist of a structured framework to transform evidence into a clinical decision; thus, many crucial management questions relevant to the hours and days after CA cannot be answered currently through these processes. The paucity of evidence and guideline recommendations results in wide variations in clinical practice. This variability could be detrimental to patients and presents an opportunity to develop clinical guidance that will standardize and facilitate care for these patients. We sought to bring together a diverse group with expertise in post-CA care to identify current knowledge gaps and to provide guidance on care in topics for which research and existing guidelines were not able to provide high certainty of evidence.

Introduction

Despite continuous medical advances, the majority of patients who are initially resuscitated from cardiac arrest (CA) and admitted to the hospital die because of irreversible hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). As such, research has focused predominantly on the implementation of potential neuroprotective strategies, like targeted temperature management (TTM), as well as on the improvement of prognostication tools to early identify those patients with severe HIE.

Around one third of deaths after CA are due to non-neurological causes, such as cardiogenic shock, sepsis, or multiple organ failure (MOF). Most of these deaths occur during the first 3 days after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), which is earlier than HIE-related deaths. However, delayed deaths from non-neurological causes, i.e. after TTM is discontinued, have been described. Death after awakening (DAA) from post-anoxic coma may thus be misclassified as "neurological" death, since commonly used scores to assess long-term neurological recovery do not clearly distinguish between neurological and non-neurological causes of death. In one recent study, 16% of the CA patients who eventually died after ICU admission had recovered consciousness during their ICU stay. Nevertheless, neurological assessment was limited, and no specific information on the results of additional prognostic tools was provided. This lack of consistency in outcome reporting after CA was also underlined by the Core Outcome Set for Cardiac Arrest (COSCA) initiative, which recently refined recommendations for how and when outcomes after CA should be measured and reported.

Thus, we developed this project called "Best CPC" (i.e. as for Cerebral Performance Category) with the aim to assess the prevalence of DAA in CA patients before hospital discharge. Moreover, we aimed to identify the characteristics of these patients, including predictors of neurological recovery, as we hypothesized that they might show no signs of poor outcome.

Circulatory sequence in the dying process

Forum participants identified several major sequential events in the dying process of patients who suffer a circulatory arrest (Fig. 2). In situation A, the patient has had a cardiac arrest but no CPR intervention, either because CPR was not medically indicated or the patient (or surrogate decision maker) declined it; this would include terminally ill patients whose end-of-life care involves limiting or withdrawing life-sustaining therapies. At C-1, the patient's circulation and breathing stop. After a certain time period (between 2 and 5 min, based on expert consensus), autoresuscitation-the spontaneous, unassisted resumption of circulation-is no longer a possibility under these conditions (C-2). There is currently no published evidence demonstrating autoresuscitation under these conditions. Since no interventions will be made to attempt to restore circulation, cessation of breathing and circulation is permanent and the patient may be determined to be dead (C-2 and C-3 occur at the same time). In situation B, CPR has been used in an attempt to restore circulation and respiration but has been terminated because the patient cannot be revived. Once the time interval when autoresuscitation is possible has passed, cessation of breathing and circulation is permanent and the patient may be determined to be dead. International practice varies with regard to this time interval between C-1 and C-2. The most common waiting period is 5 min with a range from 2 to 10 min. The participants came to consensus on the 'minimum acceptable clinical standards' to test for the cessation of circulatory function (Table 3).

### A retrospective analysis of 62, 571 cases of perioperative adverse events in thoracic surgery at a tertiary care teaching hospital in a developing country [^114jirtb]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

In this study, cardiac arrest was the major adverse event (0.08%, 50/62,571). The rate found in this study was higher than the rates of anaesthesia-related cardiac arrest reported in Japan, Canada and France(from 0.8 to 3.3 per 10,000). This difference likely occurred because our group comprised thoracic surgery patients. Large doses of opioids or thoracic epidural block were used to suppress the double-lumen endotracheal tube and included strong surgical stimulation, which could increase vagus nerve tension. Under such conditions, if the patient is stimulated by an external operation, arrhythmia is induced by the further imbalance of the autonomic nervous system. Of the 50 cases of cardiac arrest during surgery in our group, the patients had no symptoms, and awareness of the arrest often occurred when the electrosurgical interference electrocardiogram (ECG) failed to show a waveform. The surgeon could have been notified immediately by the rapid drop in blood pressure if invasive arterial pressure monitoring had been used. The patients underwent continuous cardiac massage (external or internal thoracic) after the surgeon's rapid reading of the ECG, and drugs or electrical cardioversion were used according to the ECG type. All 50 of the cardiac arrest cases recovered within 3 min, and their anaesthesia recovery processes were the same as those of the other patients. All cases requiring resuscitation were caused by P&S&A rather than surgical factors alone; Providing continuous cardiac massage and an assessment of its effectiveness using invasive arterial blood pressure are important as a guide for medical intervention. Our data show that preoperative cardiac arrest is difficult to predict in thoracic surgery and can not be completely avoided; however, 43 of the 50 cases of cardiac arrest caused by S occurred during left thoracotomy, including 25 cases of lung surgery, and most cases occurred during hilar stretching or lymph node dissection. Eighteen cases were characterized by sinus arrest or pulseless electrical activity. The safe limits of tolerance in patients with sinus asystole or pulseless electrical activity are not clear; Therefore, it is necessary to adopt active treatment to prevent adverse consequences to the central nervous system. Ten cases were treated with atropine and the other 8 cases with adrenaline, but whether this event occurred because the left vagus nerve was close to the left pulmonary artery was unclear. These observations suggest that patients should be closely monitored before effective preventive measures are taken; In particular, the invasive arterial pressure sound alarms should be used to quickly detect cardiac arrest via ECG interference. Electrical cardioversion should be used when ventricular fibrillation occurs, and defibrillators should be used as conventional equipment in thoracic surgery.

### Time-dependent interventions [^114v7wAv]. Critical Care (2004). Low credibility.

The contribution by Pepe and colleagues provides additional evidence that initial defibrillation is not necessarily the optimal intervention for victims of cardiac arrest and especially when cardiac arrest has been untreated for more than 3 min. Precordial compression therefore remains the mainstay of basic life support cardiopulmonary resuscitation after sudden death. It is increasingly apparent that neither epinephrine whether in conventional or high doses nor vasopressin improve ultimate survival. To the contrary, there is evidence favoring beta1-adrenergic blockade.

### Guidelines for neuroprognostication in comatose adult survivors of cardiac arrest [^1144vPki]. Neurocritical Care (2023). High credibility.

Neuroprognostication following cardiac arrest — good practice statements include: We recommend deferral of assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest for at least 72 h following ROSC in patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (goal temperature < 36.5 °C), and at least 72 h following rewarming in patients treated with hypothermia; however, persistence of coma beyond this period in the ICU must not be equated with a poor neurological prognosis (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be performed in the absence of sedation or other potential confounders (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that factors that impact overall prognosis — such as a poor baseline level of functioning, pre-existing illness associated with limited life-expectancy and multi-organ failure — be considered prior to, and distinct from, assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that assessment of the neurological prognosis of comatose survivors of cardiac arrest be multimodal, with consideration of the complete clinical scenario, and never based on a single variable (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We recommend that in the absence of reliable (or multiple moderately reliable) predictors of outcome, surrogates of cardiac arrest survivors who remain comatose at the time of neuroprognostication be counseled that the likelihood, extent and time course of neurological recovery is uncertain; surrogates should also be counseled that the timeline of any functional recovery that does occur may extend from several days to several months (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded). We suggest an extended period of observation for signs of neurological recovery in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest with an indeterminate prognosis, if consistent with the goals of care as established through discussions with patient surrogates (strong recommendation, evidence cannot be graded).

Methods

Data Source

We used the American Heart Association Get With the Guidelines–Resuscitation (GWTG-R) registry, a large, multicenter, prospective, observational registry of IHCA in the United States. The registry has been described in detail previously. Briefly, trained personnel at participating hospitals record observational data during resuscitation of IHCAs, defined as apnea, absence of central palpable pulse, and unresponsiveness. Cases are identified by available arrest flow sheets, paging system logs, medication administration records, emergency resuscitation equipment, and hospital billing sheets. Information is standardized using Utstein definitions as developed by international experts. The American Heart Association provides oversight for the entire process of data collection, analysis, and reporting. A deidentified database was used for statistical analyses. The institutional review board of the University of Michigan reviewed the study protocol and determined the study was exempt. Patient consent was waived owing to the use of a deidentified database. This study follows the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards reporting guideline.

Definitions

Duration of resuscitation was documented in integer minutes and was defined as the time from the onset of resuscitation to ROSC or termination of efforts when the patient was declared deceased. Return of spontaneous circulation was defined as the restoration of a pulse for at least 20 minutes during the cardiac arrest. Shockable rhythms were defined as arrests due to pulseless ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Nonshockable rhythms were defined as pulseless electrical activity or asystole. We used cerebral performance category (CPC) scores to assess neurologic status of survivors at the time of discharge (1, little to no major neurologic disability; 2, moderate disability; 3, severe disability; 4, coma or vegetative state; and 5, brain death). In keeping with prior literature, favorable neurologic survival was defined as survival without severe neurologic disability (ie, CPC score, 1 or 2).

Definitions and outcomes

ECPR was defined as both a successful veno-arterial ECMO implantation and pump-on with cardiac massage during the index procedure in patients with cardiac arrest in this study. Actually, when ROSC occurs during ECMO cannulation, the practitioner does not remove the already inserted cannula and does not stop the process of ECMO pump-on. ECMO pump-on was defined as the status that chest compression was stopped following successful ECMO implantation and activation. At this time, the ECMO flow was gradually increased until respiratory and hemodynamic statuses were stable. In this study, CPR duration was defined as the total time from onset to halting of chest compression. ROSC was defined for all rhythms as restoration of spontaneous rhythm that resulted in more than an occasional gasp, fleeting palpated pulse, or arterial waveform. CPR to ECMO pump-on time was defined as the time from initiation of chest compressions to the time at which the ECMO pump was turned on. Cardiac cause of arrest was presumed to be of cardiac origin unless it was known or likely to have been caused by trauma, submersion, hypothermia, drug overdose, asphyxia, exsanguination, or any other non-cardiac cause including intracranial hemorrhage, and terminal malignancy. Acute coronary syndrome was diagnosed on the basis of electrocardiogram with typical symptoms, cardiac enzyme elevation, and coronary angiographic findings. The primary outcome was neurological status upon hospital discharge, as assessed with the Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance Categories (CPC) scale (1 to 5) — CPC 1 and 2 were classified as good neurological outcomes, while CPC 3, 4, and 5 were considered poor neurological outcomes. We thoroughly reviewed medical records, and patients were graded on the CPC scale by two independent neurologists. Targeted temperature management was performed with surface cooling devices. We used a commercial temperature regulation system consisting of a hydrogel pad (Arctic Sun®; Medivance Corp, Louisville, CO, USA). Targeted temperature management was determined by intensivists in each ICU. Surface cooling and the degree of targeted temperature were determined by each intensivist in the ICU according to the SMC therapeutic hypothermia protocol. If there were no particular problems, moderate therapeutic hypothermia (32–34 °C) was maintained. However, mild therapeutic hypothermia (35–36 °C) was performed if the patient had hemodyamic instability and bleeding complications during ECMO, or any complications after moderate therapeutic hypothermia. All of the recorded brain CT scans were taken within 48 h after ROSC in this study. After successful ECPR, a brain CT scan was not performed in patients who had a rapid recovery of mentality and neurological deficits. If not, a brain CT scan was performed to identify whether control of increased intracranial pressure was needed and to exclude intracranial hemorrhage before therapeutic hypothermia by an intensivist. A 64-channel scanner (LightSpeed VCT; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA) was used for all of the CT studies with a 5-mm slice width. Regions of interest (ROI) were identified by two independent neurologists. Investigators blinded to clinical information opened the CT scans for each patient using commercial image-viewing software (Centricity RA1000 PACS Viewer; GE Healthcare). The images were adjusted to the 'brain' window (window width 90 and window level 30) and comparable brain slices were identified at the level of the basal ganglia (BG) and two levels of the superior cortex, as described previously. Circular regions of measurement (0.1–0.15 cm 2) were placed over these ROI, and the average attenuation in Hounsfield units was recorded. At the BG level, the values were recorded bilaterally for the caudate nucleus (CN), putamen (PU), corpus callosum (CC), and posterior limb of the internal capsule (PIC) (Fig. 2). The gray-to-white matter ratio (GWR) in the BG (GWR-BG) was calculated according to a previously reported method as GWR-BG = (CN + PU) / (CC + PIC). We recorded values bilaterally for the medial cortex and medial white matter at the level of the centrum semiovale (MC1 and MWM1, respectively) and high convexity areas (MC2 and MWM2, respectively). The GWR in the cortex was calculated as GWR-CO = (MC1 + MC2) / (MWM1 + MWM2). Average GWR was calculated as the mean of the basal ganglia and cortical GWR (GWR-AV) = (CN + PU + MC1 + MC2) / (CC + PIC + MWM1 + MWM2). The GWR-BG was calculated using a simplified method as reported previously: GWR-simplified (SI) = PU / PIC. The ROI were measured and averaged to yield the mean value, and the four GWRs (GWR-BG, GWR-CO, GWR-AV, and GWR-SI) were calculated as described above. Increasing cerebral edema indicates less attenuation of grey matter and a lower GWR. Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) was measured at a distance of 3 mm behind the eyeball, immediately below the sclera in a perpendicular vector in reference to the linear axis of the nerve (Fig. 3). The images were changed to the 'chest/abdomen' window (window width 300 and window level 10) and were magnified threefold on the particular image slice which demonstrated the largest diameter of the optic nerve sheath. ONSD was measured from one side of the optic nerve sheath to the other as a section through the center of the optic nerve. The diameters measured for the patient's left and right eyes were averaged to yield a mean value. Loss of the boundary between gray matter and white matter (LOB) was evaluated at the level of the BG on the initial CT scans. The presence of cortical sulcal effacement (SE) was evaluated at the level of the centrum semiovale, and a positive SE sign was defined as SE detectable at this level.

Hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and neurocardiogenic syncope — The hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome is defined as syncope or presyncope resulting from an extreme reflex response to carotid sinus stimulation, with two components: cardioinhibitory, which results from increased parasympathetic tone and is manifested by slowing of the sinus rate or prolongation of the PR interval and advanced AV block, and vasodepressor, which is secondary to reduced sympathetic activity causing loss of vascular tone and hypotension. Hyperactive response to carotid sinus stimulation is defined as asystole due to either sinus arrest or AV block of more than 3 seconds, a substantial symptomatic decrease in systolic blood pressure, or both, and pauses up to 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage are considered to be within normal limits. Because 10% to 20% of patients with this syndrome may have an important vasodepressive component of their reflex response, it is desirable that this component be defined before one concludes that all symptoms are related to asystole alone, and among patients with both components, attention to the vasodepressor component is essential for effective therapy in patients undergoing pacing. In 1 study, 175 elderly patients who had fallen without loss of consciousness and who had pauses of more than 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage were randomized to pacing or nonpacing therapy, and the paced group had a significantly lower likelihood of subsequent falling episodes during follow-up.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — In monitored intensive care units, survival is > 90%, and survival decreases rapidly after the initial 2 minutes from the onset of cardiac arrest, so that by 4 to 5 minutes, survival may be ≤ 25%, and by 10 minutes it is 0%. Paramedic administration of amiodarone after at least 3 failed shocks and administration of epinephrine improved hospital admission rates when compared with placebo or 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine. In RCTs in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to refractory VF or polymorphic VT, survival to hospital discharge and survival with favorable neurologic outcome were not improved with amiodarone or lidocaine; however, in the subset of patients with witnessed cardiac arrest due to initial shock-refractory VF or pulseless VT, survival to hospital discharge after amiodarone administration was higher than with placebo. The administration of procainamide in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF or pulseless VT has been associated with more shocks, more pharmacologic interventions, longer resuscitation times, and lower survival. VA with hemodynamic instability, including VF and pulseless monomorphic or polymorphic VT, causes loss of consciousness and leads to death if untreated, and defibrillation should be performed as quickly as possible; CPR is used until a perfusing rhythm is restored, and if defibrillation is unsuccessful in returning to spontaneous circulation, resuscitation follows advanced cardiovascular life support activities. Quickly identifying and treating patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest related to acute coronary occlusion is associated with improved survival and better functional recovery.

Recommendations for acute treatment of SVT of unknown mechanism — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with regular SVT (COR I; LOE B-R). Vagal maneuvers, including Valsalva and carotid sinus massage, can be performed quickly and should be the first-line intervention to terminate SVT; these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position. For Valsalva, the patient raises intrathoracic pressure for 10 to 30 seconds, equivalent to at least 30 mm Hg to 40 mm Hg; carotid massage is applied for 5 to 10 seconds after confirming absence of bruit. Facial immersion in water at 10°C (50°F) has proved effective, and in one study involving 148 patients with SVT switching between techniques resulted in an overall success rate of 27.7%. The practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned.

Unanswered questions and future research

The stratified time dependent probabilities of survival and favorable functional outcome among patients pending the first return of spontaneous circulation at each time point by clinical features and patient phenotypes provided information about who could benefit from prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, as the probabilities of favorable outcomes differed across features and phenotypes. However, other factors in addition to clinical features and patient phenotypes may also be determinants of the outcomes, and further work is warranted to understand such factors that could justify prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

In our study, the median interval between start of chest compression and termination of resuscitation was 20 (interquartile range 14–30) minutes among patients without return of spontaneous circulation, whereas we found that the probabilities of survival to hospital discharge and favorable functional outcome become less than 1% at 39 minutes' and 32 minutes' duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, respectively. Most termination of resuscitation occurred before the time point of traditional medical futility. Further research is needed to evaluate whether patients' outcomes would improve with prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation before termination of resuscitation. Our results might generate a clinical equipoise that justifies a future clinical trial to compare a resuscitation strategy with duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation at providers' discretion before termination of resuscitation (a usual care group) versus a resuscitation strategy with prespecified duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation before termination of resuscitation (an intervention group) for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is an advanced rescue therapy to support circulation in selected patients with refractory cardiac arrest, by an implantation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A recent meta-analysis showed that extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for patients with in-hospital cardiac arrest was associated with lower in-hospital morality. As our study results showed that the probabilities of favorable outcomes decreased as duration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation increased, future research is needed to assess the optimal timing and patient selection to start extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation when cardiac arrest is refractory to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation in hospitals where extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation is available.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cardiac arrest, more specifically with respect to post-resuscitation evaluation, coronary angiography, ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining CT or invasive coronary angiography to confirm the presence or absence of ischemic heart disease and guide decisions for myocardial revascularization in patients recovered from unexplained sudden cardiac arrest.

Use in the emergency department

The emergency department (ED) cardiac arrest population comprises both OHCA patients that did have a pre-hospital ROSC and patients that arrest in the emergency department. In view of limited personnel and a case-mix that likely includes prolonged cardiac arrests, mechanical device use in the ED may appear an attractive solution. A recent multi-centre Japanese observational study analysed the outcome of 6537 cardiac arrest patients (5619 manual CPR, 918 mechanical CPR) treated in the ED. The use of a device was associated with reduced likelihood of ROSC (unadjusted OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77, 1.06; adjusted 0.71, 95% CI 0.53, 0.94) and hospital survival (unadjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.62, 1.51; adjusted 0.40, 95% CI 0.20, 0.78). However, the decision as to whether or not to use a mechanical device was made on a patient by patient basis, such that there is a high risk that selective enrolment introduced unmeasured confounding variables which may have biased the results.

In a before–after study in two Singaporean hospitals, researchers compared patient outcomes prior to and following the implementation of the Autopulse device as part of the treatment for ED cardiac arrests. In total, 1011 (459 manual CPR period; 552 mechanical CPR period) patients were studied. Unadjusted ORs show an association between treatment in the mechanical CPR period and improved ROSC (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.43, 2.50), hospital survival (OR 2.55, 95% CI 1.00, 6.47), and good neurological outcome (OR 8.7, 95% CI 1.1, 71.6), but the interpretation of these findings is complicated by marked differences in baseline patient characteristics (e.g. initial rhythm, arrest location). Adjusted analyses showed an association between treatment in the mechanical CPR period and ROSC (OR 1.60, 95% 1.16, 2.22), but no association was observed in relation to any other outcome.
