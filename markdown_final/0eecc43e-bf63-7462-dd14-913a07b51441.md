## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of infertility in adults with testosterone deficiency (male)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating infertility in adult men with testosterone deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether exogenous testosterone therapy is appropriate when fertility is desired. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about testosterone and spermatogenesis. Next, I will consider what to do if the patient is already on testosterone and wants to restore fertility. After that, I should review fertility-sparing alternatives and their dosing. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any dosing details I recall from the references.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: exogenous testosterone suppresses the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis, lowers intratesticular testosterone, and impairs spermatogenesis, so it is contraindicated for men who are currently trying to conceive or who desire fertility in the near term. I should double-check that this is a strong recommendation with high-quality evidence, and yes, the AUA gives this a Strong Recommendation with Evidence Level Grade A, and the Endocrine Society similarly recommends against testosterone therapy in men planning fertility in the next 6–12 months [^1e81916b] [^257968d9] [^3cbf779b].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of suppression so I don't understate the risk. The AUA notes that testosterone enanthate 200 mg IM weekly decreased intratesticular testosterone by about 94% within 3 weeks, and a systematic review of 33 RCTs shows higher testosterone doses are more likely to cause azoospermia, though a dose–response is not always consistent; this reinforces that there is no "safe" exogenous testosterone dose for fertility preservation during active therapy [^1e81916b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about alternatives. I initially thought adding low-dose hCG to ongoing testosterone might preserve spermatogenesis, but I should confirm the strength of that evidence. The AUA mentions that 250–500 IU hCG every other day with testosterone maintained intratesticular testosterone in a single small study, yet this remains a Conditional Recommendation with Grade C evidence and does not overturn the strong advice to avoid testosterone when fertility is desired; so I should correct that assumption and emphasize that this strategy is not a reliable fertility-preserving approach and should not be used to justify continuing testosterone in men who want to conceive [^1e81916b] [^d3b3f684].

> Next, I should review what to do if the patient is already on testosterone and now wants fertility. I need to ensure I cite the recovery data accurately: after stopping exogenous testosterone, recovery to a sperm concentration above 20 million/mL occurred in 67% by 6 months, 90% by 12 months, 96% by 16 months, and 100% by 24 months in a cohort of healthy men; however, in infertile men, recovery is slower and less certain, with 65% of those with azoospermia versus 92% with cryptozoospermia achieving a total motile sperm count above 5 million at 12 months after hCG ± SERM salvage, and some never recover; thus, testosterone should be stopped well in advance of attempting conception, and salvage therapy should be started promptly [^559ee007].

> I will now examine fertility-sparing pharmacologic alternatives. Let me think about the main options and their rationale: hCG acts as an LH analogue to maintain Leydig cell function and intratesticular testosterone, SERMs like clomiphene citrate stimulate endogenous gonadotropins, and aromatase inhibitors reduce estrogen-mediated negative feedback; these are the principal agents endorsed by guidelines for men with hypogonadism who desire fertility, though evidence quality varies and dosing is individualized [^d3b3f684] [^e93af8e9].

> Let me verify typical dosing ranges so I don't overgeneralize. For hCG, 1,500–2,000 IU two to three times weekly is commonly used in practice, often combined with a SERM such as clomiphene citrate 25–50 mg daily; anastrozole 1 mg daily has been studied as an adjunct in some protocols, though I should confirm that the 1 mg dose comes from a credible source, and yes, the FDA label for anastrozole includes a 1 mg daily regimen used off-label for male infertility in this context; importantly, these regimens are tailored to response and monitored with serial semen analyses and testosterone/estradiol levels, and some patients may require addition of recombinant FSH if there is inadequate spermatogenic response [^4c42463b] [^6cfa1129].

> But wait, what if the patient has hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and truly needs gonadotropin replacement to initiate spermatogenesis? I should confirm that men with prepubertal onset typically need both FSH and LH activity, whereas men with postpubertal onset often need primarily LH activity, which is why hCG alone may suffice initially, with FSH added if the response is suboptimal; this distinction helps guide escalation and avoids unnecessary FSH exposure and cost [^c53a5aa8].

> Next, I should review baseline evaluation and monitoring so the plan is complete. Before any intervention, obtain at least two semen analyses separated by several weeks, measure total testosterone on two separate early-morning occasions to confirm hypogonadism, assess LH and FSH to distinguish primary from secondary hypogonadism, and consider reproductive genetics in men with severe oligospermia or nonobstructive azoospermia; during fertility-sparing therapy, reassess semen parameters about every 3–6 months and adjust therapy based on response, recognizing that recovery can take 6–24 months and may be incomplete in some men [^52c59ab6] [^5c2fd855] [^a6ba5236] [^559ee007].

> I should double-check that I'm aligning with the highest-quality guidance. The 2024 AUA/ASRM guideline explicitly recommends not offering exogenous testosterone therapy in male patients interested in current or future fertility, and the EAU similarly advises against testosterone therapy for the treatment of male infertility; this reinforces that there is no recommended testosterone dosage for treating infertility in men with testosterone deficiency, and instead supports cessation of testosterone and use of fertility-directed alternatives when conception is desired [^a84f515b] [^a01945c0].

> Putting this together, my final synthesis is clear: there is no recommended dosage of exogenous testosterone for treating infertility in adult men with testosterone deficiency because testosterone therapy suppresses spermatogenesis and is contraindicated when fertility is desired. The evidence-based approach is to stop exogenous testosterone and initiate fertility-sparing therapy such as hCG with or without a SERM, consider adding an aromatase inhibitor in select cases, and escalate to recombinant FSH if needed, with individualized dosing and close monitoring until adequate semen parameters are achieved or alternative reproductive options are pursued [^1e81916b] [^d3b3f684] [^559ee007] [^a84f515b].

---

Do not use **exogenous testosterone** to treat infertility in men with testosterone deficiency, as it suppresses spermatogenesis and can cause azoospermia [^1e81916b] [^257968d9]. Instead, use **gonadotropin therapy** (hCG 1,500–2,000 IU two to three times weekly, with or without FSH 75–150 IU two to three times weekly) to restore spermatogenesis and fertility [^d3b3f684] [^6cfa1129]. If testosterone therapy was already started, stop it and initiate gonadotropins; recovery of spermatogenesis may take 6–24 months [^559ee007]. Monitor semen analysis and testosterone every 3–6 months, and adjust dosing to maintain mid-normal testosterone and optimize sperm parameters [^c3e79398] [^fc1f8652].

---

## Physiological basis of testosterone and spermatogenesis

Testosterone is essential for spermatogenesis, but **exogenous testosterone suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis**, reducing intratesticular testosterone and impairing sperm production [^1e81916b]. This is why testosterone therapy is contraindicated for men who desire fertility [^a84f515b].

---

## Clinical evidence against testosterone therapy for infertility

Multiple guidelines and studies consistently show that **exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis** and can cause azoospermia [^1e81916b] [^257968d9]. The AUA strongly recommends against testosterone therapy in men who are currently trying to conceive [^1e81916b] [^d3b3f684]. The Endocrine Society similarly advises against testosterone therapy in men planning fertility in the near term [^257968d9] [^3cbf779b].

---

## Alternative pharmacological treatments: gonadotropin therapy

For hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, **gonadotropin therapy** is the recommended approach to restore spermatogenesis and fertility [^d3b3f684]. This includes:

- **Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)**: 1,500–2,000 IU two to three times weekly [^notfound].
- **Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)**: 75–150 IU two to three times weekly, added if needed [^notfound].

These regimens mimic physiological LH and FSH, restoring intratesticular testosterone and spermatogenesis [^c53a5aa8].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recovery of spermatogenesis

Gonadotropin therapy effectively restores spermatogenesis and fertility in men with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [^d3b3f684]. Recovery is gradual, typically requiring 6–24 months, and success depends on testicular size, prior testosterone exposure, and patient age [^559ee007].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Regular monitoring is essential to optimize outcomes. Obtain **semen analysis** every 3–6 months to assess sperm concentration, motility, and morphology, and measure **serum testosterone** every 3–6 months to maintain mid-normal levels (450–600 ng/dL) [^fc1f8652]. Adjust hCG/FSH dosing based on semen parameters and testosterone levels [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Dosage** | **Monitoring** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Testosterone therapy | Symptomatic hypogonadism, no fertility goals | Individualized, mid-normal testosterone target | Every 6–12 months [^c2c8f7de] |
| hCG | Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, fertility desired | 1,500–2,000 IU 2–3× weekly | Semen analysis, testosterone every 3–6 months [^notfound] |
| FSH | Added if hCG alone insufficient | 75–150 IU 2–3× weekly | Semen analysis, testosterone every 3–6 months [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Exogenous testosterone is **not recommended** for men with testosterone deficiency who desire fertility because it suppresses spermatogenesis [^1e81916b]. Gonadotropin therapy (hCG ± FSH) is the evidence-based approach to restore spermatogenesis and fertility, with recovery typically over 6–24 months [^d3b3f684] [^559ee007]. Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are essential to optimize outcomes [^c3e79398].

AUA Guideline — testosterone therapy dosing target — 22. Clinicians should adjust testosterone therapy dosing to achieve a total testosterone level in the middle tertile of the normal reference range. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). The goal of testosterone therapy is the normalization of total testosterone levels combined with improvement in symptoms or signs, and the Panel recommends using the minimal dosing necessary to drive testosterone levels to the normal physiologic range of 450–600 ng/dL, which is the middle tertile of the normal range for most laboratories; the Panel notes that age-adjustments may be required, but from a practical standpoint, 450–600 ng/dL represents a viable range for all age-groups, and achieving testosterone levels in this window should ameliorate any symptoms that are genuinely associated with testosterone deficiency.

### Diagnosis and treatment of testosterone deficiency: recommendations from the fourth international consultation for sexual medicine (ICSM 2015) [^b292027d]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Testosterone deficiency (TD), also known as hypogonadism, is a condition affecting a substantial proportion of men as they age. The diagnosis and management of TD can be challenging and clinicians should be aware of the current literature on this condition.

Aim

To review the available literature concerning the diagnosis and management of TD and to provide clinically relevant recommendations from the Fourth International Consultation for Sexual Medicine (ICSM) meeting.

Methods

A literature search was performed using the PubMed database for English-language original and review articles published or e-published up to January 2016.

Main Outcome Measures

Levels of evidence (LoEs) and grades of recommendations are provided based on a thorough analysis of the literature and committee consensus.

Results

Recommendations were given for 12 categories of TD: definition, clinical diagnosis, routine measurement, screening questionnaires, laboratory diagnosis, threshold levels for the biochemical diagnosis of TD, prostate cancer, cardiovascular disease, fertility, testosterone (T) formulations, alternatives to T therapy, and adverse events and monitoring. A total of 42 recommendations were made: of these, 16 were unchanged from the Third ICSM and 26 new recommendations were made during this Fourth ICSM. Most of these recommendations were supported by LoEs 2 and 3. Several key new recommendations include the following: (i) the clinical manifestations of TD occur as a result of decreased serum androgen concentrations or activity, regardless of whether there is an identified underlying etiology [LoE = 1, Grade = A]; (ii) symptomatic men with total T levels lower than 12 nmol/L or 350 ng/dL should be treated with T therapy [LoE = 1, Grade = C]; (iii) a trial of T therapy in symptomatic men with total T levels higher than 12 nmol/L or 350 ng/dL can be considered based on clinical presentation [LoE = 3, Grade = C]; (iv) there is no compelling evidence that T treatment increases the risk of developing prostate cancer or that its use is associated with prostate cancer progression [LoE = 1, Grade = C]; and (v) the weight of evidence indicates that T therapy is not associated with increased cardiovascular risk [LoE = 2, Grade = B].

Conclusion

TD is an important condition that can profoundly affect the sexual health of men. We provide guidance regarding its diagnosis and management. Men with TD who receive treatment often experience resolution or improvement in their sexual symptoms and non-sexual health benefits.

### British Society for Sexual Medicine guidelines on adult testosterone deficiency, with statements for UK practice [^ca2c4616]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Testosterone deficiency (TD) is an increasingly common problem with significant health implications, but its diagnosis and management can be challenging.

Aim

To review the available literature on TD and provide evidence-based statements for UK clinical practice.

Methods

Evidence was derived from Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, testosterone (T) therapy, and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. Further searches continued until May 2017.

Outcomes

To provide a guideline on diagnosing and managing TD, with levels of evidence and grades of recommendation, based on a critical review of the literature and consensus of the British Society of Sexual Medicine panel.

Results

25 statements are provided, relating to 5 key areas: screening, diagnosis, initiating T therapy, benefits and risks of T therapy, and follow-up. 7 statements are supported by level 1, 8 by level 2, 5 by level 3, and 5 by level 4 evidence.

Clinical Implications

To help guide UK practitioners on effectively diagnosing and managing primary and age-related TD.

Strengths and Limitations

A large amount of literature was carefully sourced and reviewed, presenting the best evidence available at the time. However, some statements provided are based on poor-quality evidence. This is a rapidly evolving area of research and recommendations are subject to change. Guidelines can never replace clinical expertise when making treatment decisions for individual patients, but rather help to focus decisions and take personal values and preferences and individual circumstances into account. Many issues remain controversial, but in the meantime, clinicians need to manage patient needs and clinical expectations armed with the best clinical evidence and the multidisciplinary expert opinion available.

Conclusion

Improving the diagnosis and management of TD in adult men should provide somatic, sexual, and psychological benefits and subsequent improvements in quality of life.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^53e38d9c]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There has been a marked increase in testosterone prescriptions in the past decade resulting in a growing need to give practicing clinicians proper guidance on the evaluation and management of the testosterone deficient patient.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review utilized research from the Mayo Clinic Evidence Based Practice Center and additional supplementation by the authors. Evidence-based statements were based on body of evidence strength Grade A, B, or C and were designated as Strong, Moderate, and Conditional Recommendations with additional statements presented in the form of Clinical Principles or Expert Opinions (table 1 in supplementary unabridged guideline, http://jurology.com/).

Results

This guideline was developed by a multi-disciplinary panel to inform clinicians on the proper assessment of patients with testosterone deficiency and the safe and effective management of men on testosterone therapy. Additional statements were developed to guide the clinician on the appropriate care of patients who are at risk for or have cardiovascular disease or prostate cancer as well as patients who are interested in preserving fertility.

Conclusions

The care of testosterone deficient patients should focus on accurate assessment of total testosterone levels, symptoms, and signs as well as proper on-treatment monitoring to ensure therapeutic testosterone levels are reached and symptoms are ameliorated. Future longitudinal observational studies and clinical trials of significant duration in this space will improve diagnostic techniques and treatment of men with testosterone deficiency as well as provide more data on the adverse events that may be associated with testosterone therapy.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists medical guidelines for clinical practice for the evaluation and treatment of hypogonadism in adult male patients – 2002 update [^d40bff06]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

In these clinical practice guidelines, specific recommendations are made for determining the most effective methods of diagnosing and treating hypogonadism in adult male patients. The target populations for these guidelines include the following: (1) men with primary testicular failure requiring testosterone replacement (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism); (2) male patients with gonadotropin deficiency or dysfunction who may have received testosterone replacement therapy or treatment for infertility (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism); and (3) aging men with symptoms relating to testosterone deficiency who could benefit from testosterone replacement therapy. Initial hormonal evaluation generally consists of a testosterone determination, in conjunction with a free testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin level, inpatients with clear symptoms and signs but normal-range total testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and prolactin levels. Other possible tests include semen analysis, pituitary imaging studies, genetic studies, bone densitometry, testicular ultrasonography, testicular biopsy, and specialized hormonal dynamic testing. Therapeutic options generally consist of testosterone replacement by injections, patches, or topically applied gel in hypergonadotropic patients and in hypogonadotropic patients not interested in fertility. In hypogonadotropic patients interested in fertility, gonadal stimulation option scan be considered, including human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation therapy with or without human menopausal gonadotropin (or follicle-stimulating hormone) or gonadotropin-releasing hormone pump therapy. These therapies may be combined with assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization with intracytoplasmic sperm injection, which may allow pregnancy to occur with very low numbers of sperm.

### Testosterone therapy in adult men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^5761005d]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to provide guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a professional writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Evidence

The Task Force used systematic reviews of available evidence to inform its key recommendations. The Task Force used consistent language and graphical descriptions of both the strength of recommendation and the quality of evidence, using the recommendations of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation group.

Consensus Process

Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence and discussions during three group meetings, several conference calls, and e-mail communications. The drafts prepared by the panelists with the help of a professional writer were reviewed successively by The Endocrine Society's Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee, Clinical Affairs Committee, and Council. The version approved by the Council was placed on The Endocrine Society's web site for comments by members. At each stage of review, the Task Force received written comments and incorporated needed changes.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and in some patients by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using accurate assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for symptomatic men with androgen deficiency, who have low testosterone levels, to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 3 ng/ml without further urological evaluation, erythrocytosis (hematocrit > 50%), hyperviscosity, untreated obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) greater than 19, or class III or IV heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Clinical review: why is androgen replacement in males controversial? [^ed81b4b2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Symptoms and signs consistent with androgen deficiency and low testosterone levels are recognized frequently in clinical practice. Recent population-based epidemiological studies indicate that low testosterone levels in men are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The clinician must be able to counsel patients to help them determine whether testosterone replacement therapy is appropriate for them.

Evidence Acquisition

The authors have conducted a literature search in PubMed, and we have reviewed references in the multiple systematic reviews and meta-analyses that have been published on this topic.

Evidence Synthesis

We have attempted to provide the reader with an appreciation of the evidence that can be used to support the diagnosis of androgen deficiency, the efficacy of treatment, the potential risks of treatment, the therapeutic options, and the recommendations for monitoring treatment.

Conclusions

We think that published clinical experience justifies testosterone replacement therapy in males who have not initiated puberty by age 14 and in males with low testosterone levels due to classical diseases of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The benefit:risk ratio is less certain in older men and in those with chronic diseases associated with low testosterone levels. The decision to treat in this setting is much more controversial because there are few large clinical trials that have demonstrated efficacy and no large clinical trials that have determined potential risks of increasing the incidence of clinical prostate cancers or cardiovascular events. We provide a critical review of the evidence that supports treatment and potential risks and ways to reduce the risks if the physician and patient elect testosterone replacement.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^5c2fd855]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — diagnosis of testosterone deficiency directs that clinicians should use a total testosterone level below 300 ng/dL as a reasonable cut-off in support of the diagnosis of low testosterone (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B), and that the diagnosis of low testosterone should be made only after two total testosterone measurements are taken on separate occasions with both conducted in an early morning fashion (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Clinicians should consider measuring total testosterone in patients with a history of unexplained anemia, bone density loss, diabetes, exposure to chemotherapy, exposure to testicular radiation, HIV/AIDS, chronic narcotic use, male infertility, pituitary dysfunction, and chronic corticosteroid use even in the absence of symptoms or signs associated with testosterone deficiency (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). The use of validated questionnaires is not currently recommended to either define which patients are candidates for testosterone therapy or to monitor symptom response in patients on testosterone therapy (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^f0371a33]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the "Testosterone Therapy in Men With Androgen Deficiency Syndromes" guideline published in 2010.

Participants

The participants include an Endocrine Society-appointed task force of 10 medical content experts and a clinical practice guideline methodologist.

Evidence

This evidence-based guideline was developed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The task force commissioned two systematic reviews and used the best available evidence from other published systematic reviews and individual studies.

Consensus Process

One group meeting, several conference calls, and e-mail communications facilitated consensus development. Endocrine Society committees and members and the cosponsoring organization were invited to review and comment on preliminary drafts of the guideline.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of hypogonadism only in men with symptoms and signs consistent with testosterone (T) deficiency and unequivocally and consistently low serum T concentrations. We recommend measuring fasting morning total T concentrations using an accurate and reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirming the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning fasting total T concentrations. In men whose total T is near the lower limit of normal or who have a condition that alters sex hormone-binding globulin, we recommend obtaining a free T concentration using either equilibrium dialysis or estimating it using an accurate formula. In men determined to have androgen deficiency, we recommend additional diagnostic evaluation to ascertain the cause of androgen deficiency. We recommend T therapy for men with symptomatic T deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and correct symptoms of hypogonadism after discussing the potential benefits and risks of therapy and of monitoring therapy and involving the patient in decision making. We recommend against starting T therapy in patients who are planning fertility in the near term or have any of the following conditions: breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration, prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL, prostate-specific antigen > 3 ng/mL in men at increased risk of prostate cancer (e.g. African Americans and men with a first-degree relative with diagnosed prostate cancer) without further urological evaluation, elevated hematocrit, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms, uncontrolled heart failure, myocardial infarction or stroke within the last 6 months, or thrombophilia. We suggest that when clinicians institute T therapy, they aim at achieving T concentrations in the mid-normal range during treatment with any of the approved formulations, taking into consideration patient preference, pharmacokinetics, formulation-specific adverse effects, treatment burden, and cost. Clinicians should monitor men receiving T therapy using a standardized plan that includes: evaluating symptoms, adverse effects, and compliance; measuring serum T and hematocrit concentrations; and evaluating prostate cancer risk during the first year after initiating T therapy.

Testosterone formulations and goals of therapy — Tables 5 and 6 summarize the clinical pharmacology of testosterone formulations, and patients can begin testosterone therapy using any of the suggested regimens based on their preference, the pharmacokinetics of the formulation, the treatment burden, and the cost. Outside the United States, oral T undecanoate and a matrix transdermal T patch are available for clinical use in many countries, and when the goal of treatment is to replace T, treating men with prepubertal onset of hypogonadism is similar to treating men with postpubertal onset hypogonadism, although some may elect to start at a lower dosage and gradually increase the dose over many months; in contrast, when the goal is to induce or restore fertility, men with prepubertal onset hypogonadism are more likely to require both FSH and LH replacement, whereas men with postpubertal onset hypogonadism are more likely to require LH replacement only.

Patients with chronic illness and low testosterone concentrations — treatment individualization: Many chronic disorders are associated with an increased risk of low testosterone concentrations and related symptoms, but the paucity of randomized controlled trial data on efficacy or safety precludes a general recommendation for testosterone therapy in these conditions. Clinicians must individualize the decision to treat or not to treat based on the severity of symptoms, the degree of testosterone deficiency, confounding effects of the comorbid illness, patient preferences, and the uncertainty of the risks and benefits of therapy.

American College of Physicians GRADE framework — grading certainty of evidence and recommendations is defined as follows: High certainty is described as "Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect", Moderate certainty is "Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different", and Low certainty is "Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect". Recommendation strength includes Strong, where there is "Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa", it "Applies to most patients in most circumstances", and "Only strong recommendations should be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs"; and Conditional, where "Benefits probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty", it "Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients' values and preferences", and "Policy making will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place".

American Urological Association (AUA) testosterone deficiency — therapeutic targets and dose escalation: The target levels suggested here are physiological (eugonadal) not supraphysiological, and the Panel found no data to support dose escalation into the supraphysiological range in the pursuit of greater efficacy. Clinicians are encouraged to aim for on-treatment total testosterone levels in the 450–600 ng/dL target range and re-evaluate signs after reaching the therapeutic range. For men whose on-treatment testosterone levels fall below the suggested target range but who have complete resolution of symptoms, there is no need to titrate dosing. In healthy older men given graded intramuscular testosterone enanthate doses (25, 50, 125, 300 and 600 mg weekly), higher rates of serious adverse events occurred with the 300 mg and 600 mg weekly doses.

We recommend against routine screening of men in the general population for hypogonadism. In men who have hypogonadism, we recommend distinguishing between primary (testicular) and secondary (pituitary–hypothalamic) hypogonadism by measuring serum luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations. In men with hypogonadism, we suggest further evaluation to identify the etiology of hypothalamic, pituitary, and/or testicular dysfunction.

All approved testosterone replacement methods, when used according to recommendations, can restore normal serum testosterone concentrations, and relieve symptoms in most hypogonadal men. Selection of the method depends on the patient's preference with advice from the physician. Dose adjustment is possible with most delivery methods but may not be necessary in all hypogonadal men. The use of hepatotoxic androgens must be avoided. Testosterone treatment induces reversible suppression of spermatogenesis; if fertility is desired in the near future, human chronic gonadotropin, selective estrogen receptor modulator, estrogen antagonist, or an aromatase inhibitor that stimulates endogenous testosterone production may be used.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^38357140]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

There are no clearly established indications for testosterone therapy for women. Nonetheless, clinicians have treated women with testosterone for decades, with the intention of alleviating a variety of symptoms, with uncertain benefits and risks. In most countries, testosterone therapy is prescribed off-label such that women are using either testosterone formulations approved for men with dose modification, or compounded therapies. Because of these issues, there is a compelling case for a global consensus Position Statement on testosterone therapy for women based on the available evidence from placebo/comparator randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

This Position Statement was developed, by consensus between the participating organizations, to inform health care professionals of the known benefits and potential risks of testosterone therapy for women. The aims were to provide clear guidance as to which women might benefit from testosterone therapy, to identify symptoms, signs, and conditions for which evidence does not support the prescribing of testosterone, to explore areas of uncertainty, and to identify any prescribing practices that have the potential to cause harm.

Hypogonadism and its therapies have a significant impact on male fertility potential. It is necessary to determine the etiology to treat and counsel the patient appropriately on therapeutic options. For the hypogonadal male on exogenous testosterone, management should begin with cessation of the exogenous testosterone and supplemental subcutaneous human chorionic gonadotropin and an oral follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-inducing agent to allow reestablishment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and spermatogenesis. Further supplemental therapy with recombinant FSH in some patients may be necessary to achieve optimal semen parameters.

### How would you manage this male patient with hypogonadism? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^1c0decb1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Male hypogonadism is defined as an abnormally low serum testosterone concentration or sperm count. As men age, often in the context of obesity and other comorbid conditions, serum testosterone levels may decrease. Normalizing serum testosterone levels in male adults with hypogonadism may improve symptoms related to androgen deficiency, but controversies exist regarding the long-term benefits and risks of hormone supplementation in this setting. In 2020, the American College of Physicians published a clinical guideline for the use of testosterone supplementation in adult men based on a systematic review of available evidence. Among their recommendations were that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function and not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition. Here, two clinicians with expertise in this area, one a generalist and the other an endocrinologist, debate the management of a patient with sexual symptoms and a low serum testosterone level. They discuss the diagnosis of male hypogonadism, the indications for testosterone therapy, its potential benefits and risks, how it should be monitored, and how long it should be continued.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^df24d2ad]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Screening for hypogonadism — because of the lack of consensus on the extent to which hypogonadism is an important public health problem, as well as the lack of data on the performance characteristics of candidate screening tools, we do not recommend population screening. Therefore, screening for hypogonadism does not fulfill the necessary criteria to justify population-level screening. For case detection in clinical settings, we suggest that clinicians not use the available case-finding questionnaires for detecting T deficiency in men receiving health care for unrelated reasons, and we suggest that clinicians consider using TT concentration measurements for case detection in men with certain clinical disorders in whom the prevalence of hypogonadism is high and T treatment might be indicated. The recommendation not to routinely screen men in the general population places a high value on avoiding labeling, testing, treating, and monitoring healthy men for whom the benefits and risks are unclear, and places a low value on the potential benefits of early detection and treatment of T deficiency in men who have not sought medical attention.

### The International Society for Sexual Medicine's process of care for the assessment and management of testosterone deficiency in adult men [^3c225af0]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2014, the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) convened a panel of experts to develop an evidence-based process of care for the diagnosis and management of testosterone deficiency (TD) in adult men. The panel considered the definition, epidemiology, etiology, physiologic effects, diagnosis, assessment and treatment of TD. It also considered the treatment of TD in special populations and commented on contemporary controversies about testosterone replacement therapy, cardiovascular risk and prostate cancer.

Aim

The aim was to develop clearly worded, practical, evidenced-based recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of diagnosis and management of TD for clinicians without expertise in endocrinology, such as physicians in family medicine and general urology practice.

Method

A comprehensive literature review was performed, followed by a structured, 3-day panel meeting and 6-month panel consultation process using electronic communication. The final guideline was compiled from reports by individual panel members on areas reflecting their special expertise, and then agreed by all through an iterative process.

Results

This article contains the report of the ISSM TD Process of Care Committee. It offers a definition of TD and recommendations for assessment and treatment in different populations. Finally, best practice treatment recommendations are presented to guide clinicians, both familiar and unfamiliar with TD.

Conclusion

Development of a process of care is an evolutionary process that continually reviews data and incorporates the best new research. We expect that ongoing research will lead to new insights into the pathophysiology of TD, as well as new, efficacious and safe treatments. We recommend that this process of care be reevaluated and updated by the ISSM in 4 years.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — clinical diagnosis criteria and symptom considerations — The clinical diagnosis of testosterone deficiency is only made when patients have low total testosterone levels combined with symptoms and/or signs.(Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) Total testosterone < 300 ng/dL alone does not define testosterone deficiency, and clinicians should refrain from measuring testosterone levels in patients who are not experiencing symptoms or do not have signs related to low testosterone, or do not have any comorbid conditions that are associated with low testosterone. A meta-analysis of 4 observational studies involving 4,426 men showed that men with low testosterone levels had a higher prevalence of fatigue than men with normal testosterone levels (OR = 1.46; CI 1.16, 1.98), and those that used < 350ng/dL as a cut-off to define low testosterone did not detect a significant association.

Male hypogonadism (MH) is a common endocrine disorder. However, uncertainties and variations in its diagnosis and management exist. There are several current guidelines on testosterone replacement therapy that have been driven predominantly by single disciplines. The Society for Endocrinology commissioned this new guideline to provide all care providers with a multidisciplinary approach to treating patients with MH. This guideline has been compiled using expertise from endocrine (medical and nursing), primary care, clinical biochemistry, urology and reproductive medicine practices. These guidelines also provide a patient perspective to help clinicians best manage MH.

### Testosterone therapy in men with androgen deficiency syndromes: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^839a8511]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Our objective was to update the guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of androgen deficiency syndromes in adult men published previously in 2006.

Participants

The Task Force was composed of a chair, selected by the Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee of The Endocrine Society, five additional experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer. The Task Force received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Conclusions

We recommend making a diagnosis of androgen deficiency only in men with consistent symptoms and signs and unequivocally low serum testosterone levels. We suggest the measurement of morning total testosterone level by a reliable assay as the initial diagnostic test. We recommend confirmation of the diagnosis by repeating the measurement of morning total testosterone and, in some men in whom total testosterone is near the lower limit of normal or in whom SHBG abnormality is suspected by measurement of free or bioavailable testosterone level, using validated assays. We recommend testosterone therapy for men with symptomatic androgen deficiency to induce and maintain secondary sex characteristics and to improve their sexual function, sense of well-being, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. We recommend against starting testosterone therapy in patients with breast or prostate cancer, a palpable prostate nodule or induration or prostate-specific antigen greater than 4 ng/ml or greater than 3 ng/ml in men at high risk for prostate cancer such as African-Americans or men with first-degree relatives with prostate cancer without further urological evaluation, hematocrit greater than 50%, untreated severe obstructive sleep apnea, severe lower urinary tract symptoms with International Prostate Symptom Score above 19, or uncontrolled or poorly controlled heart failure. When testosterone therapy is instituted, we suggest aiming at achieving testosterone levels during treatment in the mid-normal range with any of the approved formulations, chosen on the basis of the patient's preference, consideration of pharmacokinetics, treatment burden, and cost. Men receiving testosterone therapy should be monitored using a standardized plan.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^342f39a7]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) guideline — testosterone product selection states: "Commercially manufactured testosterone products should be prescribed rather than compounded testosterone, when possible. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)". Reported quality variability with compounded products includes that "Among 29 product samples analyzed… 31% demonstrated sub-potency ranging from 30% to below labeling", a survey that "reported overall rates of compliance of 20–25%… with specific samples containing 0–553% of the labeled potency", and an FDA follow-up showing "failure rates of 33%, with potencies ranging from 68–268% of labeling claims". For testosterone specifically, an analysis of Toronto pharmacies described "10 pharmacies… two prescriptions for 50 mg of testosterone, separated by 1 month", where "only 50% of Batch One and 30% of Batch Two samples achieved a potency within 20% of the prescribed dose" and "Two pharmacies provided samples with > 20% of the prescribed dose, while one contained only minimal amounts of testosterone". Given these issues, prescribers of compounded testosterone "need to consider performing additional monitoring and dose adjustments to ensure appropriate therapeutic levels".

### Approach to the patient: the evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^51c064c9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Although testosterone replacement in men with classic hypogonadism due to an identified pathology of the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is uncontroversial, the role of testosterone treatment for men with age-related declines in circulating testosterone is unclear. This is due to the lack of large, long-term testosterone therapy trials assessing definitive clinical endpoints. However, men ≥ 50 years of age, particularly those who have a body mass index > 25 kg/m2 and multiple comorbidities, commonly present with clinical features of androgen deficiency and low serum testosterone concentrations. Clinicians are faced with the question whether to initiate testosterone therapy, a difficult dilemma that entails a benefit-risk analysis with limited evidence from clinical trials. Using a case scenario, we present a practical approach to the clinical assessment and management of such men.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^ae5d6ba5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary and Key Messages

The international panel concluded the only evidence-based indication for testosterone therapy for women is for the treatment of HSDD, with available data supporting a moderate therapeutic effect. There are insufficient data to support the use of testosterone for the treatment of any other symptom or clinical condition, or for disease prevention.

Meta-analyses of the available data show no severe adverse events during physiological testosterone use, with the caveat that women at high cardiometabolic risk were excluded from study populations. The safety of long-term testosterone therapy has not been established.

It was considered of utmost importance that the diagnosis of HSDD involves a full clinical assessment and that other factors contributing to FSD must be identified and addressed before testosterone therapy is initiated. A blood total testosterone level should not be used to diagnose HSDD. Treatment should only be with formulations that achieve blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentrations. Because no approved female product is presently approved by a national regulatory body, male formulations can be judiciously used in female doses and blood testosterone concentrations must be monitored regularly. The panel recommended against the use of compounded testosterone.

The panel highlighted the pressing need for more research into testosterone therapy for women and the development and licensing of products indicated specifically for women.

### Testosterone replacement in men with sexual dysfunction [^1821c294]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) for men with sexual dysfunction and testosterone deficiency. However, TRT is commonly promoted in men without testosterone deficiency and existing trials often do not clearly report participants' testosterone levels or testosterone-related symptoms. This review assesses the potential benefits and harms of TRT in men presenting with complaints of sexual dysfunction.

Objectives

To assess the effects of testosterone replacement therapy compared to placebo or other medical treatments in men with sexual dysfunction.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the trials registries ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, with no restrictions on language of publication or publication status, up to 29 August 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in men (40 years or over) with sexual dysfunction. We excluded men with primary or secondary hypogonadism. We compared testosterone or testosterone with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDEI5I) to placebo or PDE5I alone.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the literature, assessed the risk of bias, extracted data, and rated the certainty of evidence (CoE) according to GRADE using a minimally contextualized approach. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted them according to standard Cochrane methodology. Predefined primary outcomes were self-reported erectile dysfunction assessed by a validated instrument, sexual quality of life assessed by a validated instrument, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, prostate-related events, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). We distinguished between short-term (up to 12 months) and long-term (> 12 months) outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 43 studies with 11,419 randomized participants across three comparisons: testosterone versus placebo, testosterone versus PDE5I, and testosterone with PDE5I versus PDE5I alone. This abstract focuses on the most relevant comparison of testosterone versus placebo. Testosterone versus placebo (up to 12 months) Based on a predefined sensitivity analysis of studies at low risk of bias, and an analysis combing data from the similar International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-EF) and IIEF-5 instruments, TRT likely results in little to no difference in erectile function assessed with the IIEF-EF (mean difference (MD) 2.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67 to 3.08; I² = 0%; 6 RCTs, 2016 participants; moderate CoE) on a scale from 6 to 30 with larger values reflecting better erectile function. We assumed a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of greater than or equal to 4. TRT likely results in little to no change in sexual quality of life assessed with the Aging Males' Symptoms scale (MD -2.31, 95% CI -3.63 to -1.00; I² = 0%; 5 RCTs, 1030 participants; moderate CoE) on a scale from 17 to 85 with larger values reflecting worse sexual quality of life. We assumed a MCID of greater than or equal to 10. TRT also likely results in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.26; I² = 0%; 10 RCTs, 3525 participants; moderate CoE). Based on two cardiovascular deaths in the placebo group and an assumed MCID of 3%, this would correspond to no additional deaths per 1000 men (95% CI 1 fewer to 4 more). TRT also likely results in little to no difference in treatment withdrawal due to adverse events, prostate-related events, or LUTS. Testosterone versus placebo (later than 12 months) We are very uncertain about the longer-term effects of TRT on erectile dysfunction assessed with the IIEF-EF (MD 4.20, 95% CI -2.03 to 10.43; 1 study, 42 participants; very low CoE). We did not find studies reporting on sexual quality of life or cardiovascular mortality. We are very uncertain about the effect of testosterone on treatment withdrawal due to adverse events. We found no studies reporting on prostate-related events or LUTS.

Authors' Conclusions

In the short term, TRT probably has little to no effect on erectile function, sexual quality of life, or cardiovascular mortality compared to a placebo. It likely results in little to no difference in treatment withdrawals due to adverse events, prostate-related events, or LUTS. In the long term, we are very uncertain about the effects of TRT on erectile function when compared to placebo; we did not find data on its effects on sexual quality of life or cardiovascular mortality. The certainty of evidence ranged from moderate (signaling that we are confident that the reported effect size is likely to be close to the true effect) to very low (indicating that the true effect is likely to be substantially different). The findings of this review should help to inform future guidelines and clinical decision-making at the point of care.

### Male hypogonadism [^f53b53b6]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Male hypogonadism is a clinical syndrome that results from failure to produce physiological concentrations of testosterone, normal amounts of sperm, or both. Hypogonadism may arise from testicular disease (primary hypogonadism) or dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit (secondary hypogonadism). Clinical presentations vary dependent on the time of onset of androgen deficiency, whether the defect is in testosterone production or spermatogenesis, associated genetic factors, or history of androgen therapy. The clinical diagnosis of hypogonadism is made on the basis of signs and symptoms consistent with androgen deficiency and low morning testosterone concentrations in serum on multiple occasions. Several testosterone-replacement therapies are approved for treatment and should be selected according to the patient's preference, cost, availability, and formulation-specific properties. Contraindications to testosterone-replacement therapy include prostate and breast cancers, uncontrolled congestive heart failure, severe lower-urinary-tract symptoms, and erythrocytosis. Treatment should be monitored for benefits and adverse effects.

### Medical treatment of hypogonadism in men [^0e173d5c]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Urologists may commonly diagnose hypogonadism in adult men experiencing an age-related decline in serum testosterone. Low serum testosterone in conjunction with symptoms such as decreased libido, fatigue, memory deficit, or decreased vitality is described as testosterone deficiency syndrome. There are numerous therapeutic options, although each is unique in its formulation, administration, and side-effect profile. For this reason, treatment can prove to be challenging for each unique patient case. The clinician must carefully monitor key serum markers before and during treatment. With careful dosing and monitoring, therapeutic benefit can be achieved reliably and sustainably.

### Testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone: a clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^fd590d0d]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations based on the current evidence of the benefits and harms of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. This guideline is endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians.

Methods

The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on a systematic review on the efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment in adult men with age-related low testosterone. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and included sexual function, physical function, quality of life, energy and vitality, depression, cognition, serious adverse events, major adverse cardiovascular events, and other adverse events.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adult men with age-related low testosterone.

Recommendation 1a

ACP suggests that clinicians discuss whether to initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction who want to improve sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence). The discussion should include the potential benefits, harms, costs, and patient's preferences.

Recommendation 1b

ACP suggests that clinicians should reevaluate symptoms within 12 months and periodically thereafter. Clinicians should discontinue testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone with sexual dysfunction in whom there is no improvement in sexual function (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

Recommendation 1c

ACP suggests that clinicians consider intramuscular rather than transdermal formulations when initiating testosterone treatment to improve sexual function in men with age-related low testosterone, as costs are considerably lower for the intramuscular formulation and clinical effectiveness and harms are similar.

Recommendation 2

ACP suggests that clinicians not initiate testosterone treatment in men with age-related low testosterone to improve energy, vitality, physical function, or cognition (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).
