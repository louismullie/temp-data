## Question

why does alcohol withdrawl cause afib

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why alcohol withdrawal causes atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neurobiology of alcohol withdrawal and the resulting autonomic changes. Then, I should review recognized transient triggers for atrial fibrillation. Next, I will connect these physiologic changes to atrial electrophysiology and substrate. After that, I should verify clinical and guideline evidence that acknowledges arrhythmias during withdrawal and recommended management. Finally, I will synthesize the causal pathway and highlight practical implications, while carefully checking that I am not conflating effects of acute intoxication with withdrawal per se.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS): chronic alcohol use downregulates inhibitory GABAergic tone and upregulates excitatory glutamatergic pathways; abrupt cessation removes CNS depression and unmasks a hyperadrenergic state with increased catecholamines and sympathetic outflow, producing autonomic instability that escalates over the first 6–96 hours depending on severity, which is precisely the window when complications like seizures and delirium tremens occur [^114cWaGK] [^117HXFoc].

> Next, I should review recognized transient triggers for atrial fibrillation (AF) to see if AWS physiology aligns with them; transient precipitants include a hyperadrenergic state, impaired vagal tone (reduced heart rate variability), electrolyte disturbances, and electrophysiologic changes such as shortened atrial effective refractory periods and altered conduction, all of which can acutely facilitate AF initiation, especially in susceptible atria [^114uUU5P] [^111eorQT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — how exactly does the hyperadrenergic surge in AWS translate to AF triggers in the atria; sympathetic overdrive increases automaticity, shortens atrial refractory periods, and amplifies triggered activity from pulmonary vein foci, mechanisms repeatedly implicated in AF initiation, and alcohol exposure has been reported to create short-coupled pulmonary vein triggers and shorten pulmonary vein refractory periods, which suggests that an adrenergically charged milieu during withdrawal could similarly potentiate these triggers even in the absence of ethanol itself [^115Q1G9A] [^114uUU5P].

> Wait, let me verify the role of electrolytes because AWS often produces metabolic derangements; hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia are common in AWS and are proarrhythmic, and the ASAM guideline explicitly recommends magnesium administration in patients with hypomagnesemia, cardiac arrhythmias, or electrolyte disturbances during withdrawal care, underscoring recognition that arrhythmias occur and that correcting electrolytes is part of prevention and management [^1113DJZP] [^114Mf9Eo].

> I will now examine autonomic dysregulation more closely; AWS shifts the sympathovagal balance toward sympathetic dominance with impaired vagal tone, and although many studies address acute alcohol exposure, patient-level data show alcohol and vagal activity frequently trigger paroxysmal AF, implying that rapid swings in autonomic tone — of the sort seen during withdrawal — can be arrhythmogenic in predisposed individuals [^114EZmmT] [^114cWaGK].

> Let me check whether clinical guidance treats arrhythmias as a withdrawal complication requiring specific monitoring and treatment; ASAM recommends frequent cardiac monitoring in withdrawal delirium and prioritizes benzodiazepines as first-line to blunt hyperadrenergic symptoms and prevent seizures, with parenteral therapy and close monitoring after seizures, all of which mitigates the adrenergic and metabolic stress that can precipitate arrhythmias including AF during severe AWS [^112t2tP9] [^113V64BP] [^117Tfpnm].

> Hmm, wait a minute — I initially thought about ethanol's direct electrophysiologic toxicity, but I should confirm I am not conflating intoxication with withdrawal; mechanistic studies show that acute ethanol can activate proarrhythmic pathways such as late sodium current via CaMKII-dependent Nav1.5 phosphorylation and JNK2–CaMKII–calcium mishandling, while clinical telemetry demonstrates autonomic swings around binge drinking, yet in AWS the dominant driver is a rebound hyperadrenergic state rather than ethanol's direct ion-channel effects, with the shared pathway being acute autonomic and intracellular calcium instability that lowers the threshold for AF initiation [^116k1JTm] [^113oC7Lx] [^114qnqXZ].

> Let me synthesize the causal pathway clearly and double-check internal consistency: chronic alcohol use neuroadaptation leads to abrupt withdrawal with sympathetic surge and vagal impairment; this autonomic storm shortens atrial refractory periods and enhances pulmonary vein ectopy; concurrent AWS-related electrolyte deficits, particularly low magnesium and potassium, further destabilize atrial electrophysiology; in patients with any substrate vulnerability, these transient triggers overcome compensatory mechanisms to initiate AF via focal firing or reentry, which aligns with mechanistic and clinical observations and with guideline recognition of arrhythmia risk and electrolyte-focused mitigation in AWS [^114cWaGK] [^114uUU5P] [^1113DJZP].

> Before concluding, I should review implications for prevention and secondary AF care because that can indirectly validate causality; abstinence and alcohol reduction reduce AF burden and recurrence, and major AF guidelines now advise limiting alcohol as part of comprehensive risk factor management, which is consistent with the notion that eliminating both intoxication-related and withdrawal-related autonomic stresses reduces AF triggers and improves rhythm outcomes [^114Rzxua] [^115kge1y].

Alcohol withdrawal causes atrial fibrillation (AF) primarily through a **hyperadrenergic state** with elevated catecholamines, which increases atrial automaticity and triggers arrhythmias [^114cWaGK] [^114qnqXZ]. This is compounded by **electrolyte disturbances** (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) that destabilize atrial electrophysiology, and by autonomic imbalance with reduced vagal tone and increased sympathetic activity [^113RHaQz] [^114qnqXZ]. Chronic alcohol use also causes atrial remodeling and fibrosis, creating a substrate for AF [^1145wJpJ]. Together, these factors explain why AF is common during withdrawal and why benzodiazepines, electrolyte correction, and close monitoring are essential [^113V64BP] [^1113DJZP] [^112t2tP9].

---

## Autonomic nervous system imbalance

During withdrawal, **sympathetic overactivity** — driven by chronic alcohol use that upregulates glutamate and downregulates GABA, with abrupt cessation producing a hyperadrenergic state with elevated catecholamines [^114cWaGK] — increases atrial automaticity and ectopy [^114qnqXZ], while **reduced vagal tone** further heightens sympathetic dominance and arrhythmia risk.

---

## Electrolyte disturbances

During withdrawal, **hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia** commonly occur, destabilizing atrial electrophysiology and promoting AF [^113RHaQz] [^1113DJZP]; **calcium imbalance** may also increase atrial excitability and arrhythmogenesis [^113oC7Lx].

---

## Direct cardiac effects of alcohol withdrawal

Atrial remodeling from chronic alcohol use leads to atrial enlargement and fibrosis, creating a substrate for AF [^112nFAW8], while withdrawal-related **electrical instability** increases atrial ectopy and shortens refractory periods [^115Q1G9A] [^114uUU5P], facilitating AF.

---

## Clinical implications and management

- **Benzodiazepines**: First-line therapy to reduce sympathetic overactivity and prevent arrhythmias [^113V64BP].

- **Electrolyte correction**: Prompt correction of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia is essential [^1113DJZP] [^113RHaQz].

- **Monitoring**: Close cardiac monitoring is recommended during withdrawal due to arrhythmia risk [^112t2tP9] [^113iww8o].

---

Alcohol withdrawal causes AF through a combination of **sympathetic overactivity, electrolyte disturbances, and atrial remodeling**, making AF a common complication of withdrawal.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^114uUU5P]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation (CA) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) was analyzed. Although alcohol consumption was strongly associated with the outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after the initial CA, the impact did not remain after the final CA. Several reports have described the mechanisms by which alcohol consumption causes AF.

- **Alcohol-related cardiac issues**: Chronic alcohol abuse is linked to alcoholic cardiomyopathy, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmias such as AF.

- **Transient triggers**: Factors such as a hyperadrenergic state (increased levels of serum catecholamines), impaired vagal tone (decreased heart rate variability), electrolyte imbalances, and various electrophysiological changes in atrial cells, including an increase in intra-atrial conduction time (length of the P-wave), reduction in the refractory period, and negative inotropic effect through calcium-channel inhibition in ventricular cells, are associated with the occurrence of AF.

Regarding the outcome after AF ablation in patients with PAF, these transient factors seem to have more of an effect than chronic alcohol-related factors. Neither the duration of drinking history nor the volume of alcohol consumption, which could have a severe chronic effect, significantly affected the outcome in multivariate analysis, even though these factors were remarkably related to the outcome in univariate analysis. Instead, the frequency of weekly alcohol consumption, which could be a transient trigger, remained a significant predictor of AF recurrence after the initial CA, even in multivariate analysis.

### Alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^114cWaGK]. Nursing (2023). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on alcohol withdrawal syndrome:

- **Definition**: AWS is a condition that occurs after the abrupt cessation or significant reduction of alcohol intake following heavy and prolonged use.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of AWS involves neuroadaptive changes in the CNS due to chronic alcohol consumption. Chronic alcohol use leads to the upregulation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate and the downregulation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. When alcohol consumption is abruptly stopped, this results in a hyperadrenergic state and increased glutamatergic activity, causing withdrawal symptoms.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for AWS include heavy and prolonged alcohol use, prior withdrawal episodes, concomitant use of other sedative-hypnotics, and comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of AWS typically begins with mild symptoms, such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea within 6–12 hours of cessation of alcohol intake. More severe symptoms, such as hallucinations and seizures, can occur within 12–48 hours. Delirium tremens, characterized by severe confusion, hallucinations, and cardiovascular instability, typically occurs within 48–96 hours.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although most cases of AWS are self-limiting and resolve within a week, severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens can be life-threatening. The use of validated risk assessment tools, such as the PAWSS, can help identify patients at risk of severe AWS and guide management strategies.

### Acute alcohol consumption and arrhythmias in young adults: The MunichBREW II study [^114qnqXZ]. European Heart Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Acute excessive alcohol intake may cause the holiday heart syndrome, characterized by cardiac arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Since underlying data are scarce, the study aimed to prospectively investigate the temporal course of occurring cardiac arrhythmias following binge drinking in young adults.

A total of 202 volunteers planning acute alcohol consumption with expected peak breath alcohol concentrations (BACs) of ≥ 1.2g/kg were enrolled. The study comprised 48-hour electrocardiogram monitoring covering baseline (Hour 0), the 'drinking period' (Hours 1–5), the 'recovery period' (Hours 6–19), and two control periods corresponding to 24 hours after the 'drinking' and 'recovery periods', respectively. Acute alcohol intake was monitored by BAC measurements during the 'drinking period'. Electrocardiograms were analyzed for mean heart rate, atrial tachycardia, premature atrial complexes, premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), and heart rate variability measures.

Data revealed an increase in heart rate and an excess of atrial tachycardias with increasing alcohol intake. Heart rate variability analysis indicated autonomic modulation with sympathetic activation during alcohol consumption and the subsequent 'recovery period', followed by parasympathetic predominance thereafter. Premature atrial complexes occurred significantly more frequently in the 'control periods', whereas PVCs were more frequent in the 'drinking period'. Ten participants experienced notable arrhythmic episodes, including atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardias.

### Alcohol consumption and risk of atrial fibrillation in men and women: the Copenhagen City Heart Study [^116zpskv]. Circulation (2005). Low credibility.

The relationship between the full range of alcohol consumption and the risk of incident atrial fibrillation has been inconsistent in previous, mainly case-control studies.

- **Methods and results**: In a prospective cohort study, the association between self-reported alcohol use and incident atrial fibrillation was studied among 16,415 women and men enrolled in the Copenhagen City Heart Study. Use of beer, wine, and spirits was ascertained individually at up to three study visits using a structured questionnaire. Cases of atrial fibrillation were identified by routine study ECGs and a validated nationwide registry of all hospitalizations. A total of 1071 cases occurred during follow-up. Among both women and men, alcohol consumption throughout the moderate range was not associated with the risk of atrial fibrillation. However, consumption of 35 or more drinks per week among men was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.45 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.04); few women consumed this amount of alcohol. Approximately 5% of cases of atrial fibrillation among men were attributable to heavy alcohol use. Further adjustment for blood pressure and incident coronary heart disease and congestive heart failure did not attenuate the association (hazard ratio 1.63; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.31).

- **Conclusions**: Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with a higher risk of atrial fibrillation, at least among men. This relationship does not appear to be related to the adverse effects of heavy drinking on coronary heart disease or blood pressure.

### Alcohol consumption and risk of incident atrial fibrillation in women [^114GaGsy]. JAMA (2008). Low credibility.

Previous studies suggest that consuming moderate to high amounts of alcohol on a regular basis might increase the risk of developing atrial fibrillation in men but not in women. However, these studies were not powered to investigate the association of alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation among women.

- **Objective**: To prospectively assess the association between regular alcohol consumption and incident atrial fibrillation among women.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Participants were 34,715 initially healthy women participating in the Women's Health Study, a completed randomized controlled trial conducted in the United States. Participants were older than 45 years, free of atrial fibrillation at baseline, and underwent prospective follow-up from 1993 to October 31, 2006. Alcohol consumption was assessed via questionnaires at baseline and at 48 months of follow-up and was grouped into four categories (0, > 0 and < 1, ≥ 1 and < 2, and ≥ 2 drinks per day). Atrial fibrillation was self-reported on the yearly questionnaires and subsequently confirmed by electrocardiogram and medical record review.

- **Main outcome measure**: Time to the first episode of atrial fibrillation.

- **Results**: Over a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 653 cases of incident atrial fibrillation were confirmed. Age-adjusted incidences among women consuming 0 (n = 15,370), more than 0 and less than 1 (n = 15,758), 1 or more and less than 2 (n = 2228), and 2 or more (n = 1359) drinks per day were 1.59, 1.55, 1.27, and 2.25 events/1000 person-years of follow-up. Thus, compared with nondrinking women, those who consumed 2 or more drinks per day had a higher incidence rate.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114s4FGr]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning anticonvulsants, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering phenobarbital monotherapy, managed by a clinician experienced with its use, in outpatient settings with extensive monitoring. This is suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines or when benzodiazepines are contraindicated in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal, or those at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal symptoms.

### Alcohol and atrial fibrillation: An update and new perspectives [^114JRCNd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

In the Western world, sales of alcoholic beverages are skyrocketing. Alcohol (ethanol) is consumed for its transient euphoric effects but is a risk factor for the development of heart disease. Here, we review the possible association between alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation. Using a familiar analogy, we propose that atrial fibrillation is the mere tip of an iceberg (alcohol-associated heart disease). Our concern is that the many research studies on the effects of ethanol on the heart have produced inconsistent results. These include studies of individuals drinking only moderate amounts of alcoholic beverages (aka the "French paradox") on the one hand, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation after binge drinking ("holiday heart syndrome") on the other hand. The evidence available in the literature suggests that hypertension, structured heart disease of any form, neurohumoral stress, and cardiometabolic disorders all favor the development of atrial fibrillation triggered by alcohol. We also suggest that alcohol should be classified as a modifiable risk factor for atrial fibrillation and also for heart disease in general.

### Research priorities in the secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation: A national Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute virtual workshop report [^1116SVHE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Most research into the influence of modifiable exposures, such as alcohol, smoking, and diet, on atrial fibrillation (AF) risk has focused on long-term patterns of consumption as predictors of new-onset disease among cohorts of individuals, leaving three overarching gaps in knowledge: (1) the effects of these exposures and interventions among those already diagnosed with the disease, including AF recurrence and complications; (2) the risk of an immediate exposure, such as a particular drinking event, a cigarette smoked, or short-term ingestion of a dietary component, and the near-term risk of a discrete AF event; and (3) how interactions with common genetic variants may result in heterogeneity of these effects among individuals.

Alcohol, smoking, and various dietary patterns, foods, and nutrients may lead to discrete episodes of recurrent AF via acute changes, such as proarrhythmic autonomic effects or acute electrophysiologic effects, or may lead to greater propensity for AF via chronic structural changes, such as diffuse left atrial remodeling (manifested as low voltages as shown in the left atrial electroanatomic map) and left atrial enlargement (as shown in echocardiographic images). Knowledge gaps in these areas as well as research priorities moving forward are highlighted.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^112t2tP9]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in the context of managing withdrawal delirium, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend monitoring vital signs, oximetry, and cardiac status of patients with alcohol withdrawal delirium as frequently as required. Ensure that resuscitative equipment is readily available when patients require high doses of benzodiazepines, continuous infusion of medication is used, or patients have significant comorbid medical conditions.

### Alcohol and atrial fibrillation: Dose matters, not so much the type [^115jjXKp]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

In line with previous observations, our data showed that hazard ratios tended to be higher in beer and spirit drinkers than in wine drinkers, but the difference was not statistically significant despite the comparatively large number of outcomes. Our findings suggest that reducing alcohol consumption may be important for both the prevention and management of AF, independent of the type of alcohol consumed. The causal pathways underlying this observation are probably manifold and need to be elucidated.

### Alcohol and vagal tone as triggers for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^114EZmmT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Alcohol and vagal activity may be important triggers for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), but it remains unknown if these associations occur more often than would be expected by chance alone because of the lack of a comparator group in previous studies. We compared the self-reported frequency of these triggers in patients with PAF to those with other supraventricular tachycardias (SVTs). Consecutive consenting patients presenting for electrophysiology procedures at a single university medical center underwent a structured interview regarding arrhythmia triggers.

Two hundred twenty-three patients with a documented arrhythmia (133 with PAF and 90 with SVT) completed the survey. After multivariable adjustment, patients with PAF had a 4.42 greater odds (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35 to 14.44) of reporting alcohol consumption (p = 0.014) and a 2.02 greater odds (95% CI 1.02 to 4.00) of reporting vagal activity (p = 0.044) as an arrhythmia trigger compared to patients with SVT. In patients with PAF, drinking primarily beer was associated with alcohol as a trigger (odds ratio [OR] 4.49, 95% CI 1.41 to 14.28, p = 0.011), whereas younger age (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.95, p = 0.022) and a family history of AF (OR 5.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 27.23, p = 0.028) each were independently associated with having vagal activity provoke an episode. Patients with PAF and alcohol triggers were more likely to have vagal triggers (OR 10.32, 95% CI 1.05 to 101.42, p = 0.045).

In conclusion, alcohol consumption and vagal activity elicit PAF significantly more often than SVT.

### Alcohol consumption, cardiac biomarkers, and risk of atrial fibrillation and adverse outcomes [^113cpBzi]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

There is inconsistent evidence on the relation of alcohol intake with incident atrial fibrillation (AF), particularly at lower doses. We assessed the association between alcohol consumption, biomarkers, and incident AF across the spectrum of alcohol intake in European cohorts.

In a community-based pooled cohort, we followed 107,845 individuals for the association between alcohol consumption, including types of alcohol and drinking patterns, and incident AF. We collected information on classical cardiovascular risk factors and incident heart failure (HF) and measured the biomarkers N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and high-sensitivity troponin I. The median age of individuals was 47.8 years, with 48.3% being men. The median alcohol consumption was 3 g/day. A total of 5,854 individuals developed AF over a median follow-up time of 13.9 years. In a sex- and cohort-stratified Cox regression analysis, alcohol consumption was non-linearly and positively associated with incident AF. The hazard ratio for one drink (12 g) per day was 1.16, with a 95% CI of 1.11–1.22, P < 0.001. Associations were similar across different types of alcohol. In contrast, alcohol consumption at lower doses was associated with a reduced risk of incident HF. The association between alcohol consumption and incident AF was neither fully explained by cardiac biomarker concentrations nor by the occurrence of HF.

In contrast to other cardiovascular diseases such as HF, even modest habitual alcohol intake of 1.2 drinks/day was associated with an increased risk of AF, which needs to be considered in AF prevention strategies.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113V64BP]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly concerning indications for inpatient pharmacotherapy, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal, indicated by a CIWA-Ar score ≥ 19. Phenobarbital may be administered if benzodiazepines are contraindicated, provided the provider has experience with its use. It is also advisable to consider phenobarbital as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in a setting with close monitoring. Additional adjunct medications should only be considered after ensuring that an adequate dose of benzodiazepines has been administered.

### Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and atrial fibrillation: Possible pathophysiological links and therapeutic interventions [^116CzTtF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Pharmacological interventions

Unfortunately, many patients find it challenging to institute lifestyle changes over the long term. Many medications that act on atrial fibrillation (AF) are also effective for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and vice versa, because of the suggested common pathophysiological pathway (Figure 2). Medications effective for the conditions target four pathways: renin-angiotensin system (RAS), hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and inflammation. The medications with a proven effect on both conditions are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) (only demonstrated in animal studies), pioglitazone, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, statins, and vitamin E.

In addition to these well-established medications, we highlight a list of developing or novel therapies for NAFLD that have the potential to be effective for AF. These established and proposed experimental medications are categorized based on their mechanism of action. Note that some medications are known to have multiple mechanisms. Unfortunately, we were unable to account for baseline therapies for AF, such as anticoagulants or antiarrhythmics, as they can be potential confounders in the treatment for AF and NAFLD.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^1149HCZ9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Results from the univariate analysis demonstrated that several factors were significantly associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence following the initial catheter ablation (CA) session. These included the duration of the AF history (P < 0.0001), the presence of structural heart disease (P = 0.0004), left atrial diameter (P = 0.002), the duration of drinking history (P = 0.002), as well as the frequency (P = 0.0002) and volume (P = 0.001) of weekly alcohol consumption. In the multivariate analysis, the duration of the AF history, presence of structural heart disease, and left atrial diameter remained significant predictors of AF recurrence. Interestingly, while the duration of drinking history and weekly alcohol consumption volume were not significant predictors, the weekly frequency of alcohol consumption was significantly associated with AF recurrence, with a hazard ratio of 1.07 per 1 day/week increase (CI 1.00–1.15, P = 0.04).

Although patients who consumed alcohol generally experienced worse outcomes after the initial CA, those consuming alcohol more than five times per week exhibited a marked increase in the risk of AF recurrence.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^115Wq4DT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our ablation strategy has been described in detail in previous reports. Briefly, after performing a transseptal puncture using the 1‐puncture technique, two long sheaths were inserted into the left atrium (LA). Pulmonary venography and contrast esophagography examinations were performed to determine the anatomical relationships among the pulmonary vein (PV) ostia, LA, and esophagus. An activated clotting time of 250 to 350 seconds was maintained with a continuous infusion of heparin during the procedure. Two circular mapping catheters were placed in the superior and inferior PVs, and ipsilateral PVs were circumferentially and extensively ablated under fluoroscopic and electrophysiological guidance.

All radiofrequency applications were delivered using an 8‐mm‐tip ablation catheter (Japan Lifeline Inc, Tokyo, Japan) in the temperature control mode at a target temperature of 55°C and maximum power of 35 W on the posterior wall of the LA and 40 W at the anterior aspect of the PVs. The radiofrequency energy was delivered for 30 to 40 seconds at each site. The esophageal temperature is routinely measured during radiofrequency application to avoid esophagus‐related complications. However, radiofrequency application was discontinued in cases in which the esophageal temperature reached 42°C. When the temperature decreased to below 38°C, radiofrequency application was initiated again. Both an entrance block (elimination of all PV potentials) and exit block (noncapture of the LA during placement of a circular catheter) were confirmed as end points.

### Alcohol consumption is associated with postablation recurrence but not changes in atrial substrate in patients with atrial fibrillation: Insight from a high-density mapping study [^115Q1G9A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

In this study, alcohol consumption was associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence following a single ablation, even after adjustment for covariates with significant differences among the three groups, and drinkers had a significantly higher AF recurrence rate than abstainers. However, alcohol consumption was not associated with AF recurrence after single or multiple ablations. Alcohol is associated with increased levels of serum catecholamines, impaired vagal tone, and transient triggers. Furthermore, alcohol has been reported to shorten the effective refractory period, particularly the effective refractory period of the pulmonary veins (PV). Alcohol consumption generates a short-coupled PV trigger in patients with AF, which may lead to an increase in AF initiation. If pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is completed and can be maintained for a long time, the PV triggers are blocked, and as a result, the incidence of alcohol-related AF is expected to decrease. However, there are some cases where durable PVI is not completed with only a single ablation. It was reported that 62% of patients with AF undergoing contact force–guided PVI and 22% of patients undergoing ablation index–guided PVI had PV reconnections during the follow-up period. Alcohol may be associated with AF recurrence following a single ablation because it is difficult to maintain the permanent block of PV-left atrium (LA) conduction in all PVs following a single ablation. In this study, among the 19 patients who exhibited AF recurrence, 9 underwent a second ablation, and among them, PV reconnection was observed in 33%.

### Alcohol and illicit drug use as precipitants of atrial fibrillation in young adults: a case series and literature review [^11286rB9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation in young patients (≤ 45 years) is uncommon. There is a perception that alcohol is the primary precipitant in such cases; however, there are also noted instances related to illicit drug abuse. Currently, there are no clear guidelines for treating atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with "lone atrial fibrillation" precipitated by alcohol or illicit drugs.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively analyzed young patients (defined as ≤ 45 years) with "lone" atrial fibrillation admitted to the hospital over a 6-year period. Their condition was confirmed electrocardiographically and was precipitated by either alcohol or illicit drugs.

- **Results**: Eighty-eight patients aged ≤ 45 years were admitted with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. In 22 patients, with a mean (SD) age of 33.6 (8.4) years (20 male), the precipitant was alcohol (n = 19) and/or illicit drugs (n = 3). One patient required electrical cardioversion; the rest returned to sinus rhythm either pharmacologically or spontaneously. Twelve (54.5%) were investigated for atrial fibrillation burden by 24-hour Holter monitoring, and the majority also underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram (81.8%). At discharge, 14 (63.6%) were treated with anti-arrhythmic drugs, and 10 received either antiplatelets or anticoagulants. Most (85%) were followed up for at least 12 months, during which time six experienced further paroxysms; all continued to abuse either alcohol or illicit drugs.

- **Conclusions**: Alcohol and illicit drugs are significant precipitants of atrial fibrillation and should be a focus in treating young patients presenting with this condition.

Regarding medical management for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, particularly in relation to benzodiazepines, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend educating patients taking benzodiazepines and their caregivers about the following:

- **Drug-drug interactions**: The danger of interactions between benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, which can cause impairment and respiratory depression.

- **Risks with alcohol**: The risks associated with combining alcohol and benzodiazepines and the importance of abstinence from alcohol.

- **Driving and machinery**: The risks associated with driving or using heavy machinery during the first few days of benzodiazepine administration.

- **Dose adjustment**: Instructions to reduce the benzodiazepine dose if drowsiness occurs.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116kZ1V3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation was discontinued after 3 to 6 months in patients who were free of AF recurrence and had no risk factors for thromboembolism. No antiarrhythmic drugs were prescribed. All patients were followed up at 2, 6, 10, 14, 24, 36, and 48 weeks after the ablation procedure; 12-lead ECG findings were recorded at every visit, and 24-hour monitoring was performed every 3 months. Thereafter, the patients were followed up every 1 to 3 months at our institution or with their general physician. Patients with heart-related symptoms were encouraged to undergo a 1-month event recorder.

Successful ablation was defined as the absence of any atrial tachyarrhythmias lasting at least 30 seconds without any antiarrhythmic drugs following a blanking period of 1 month. Repeat ablation was recommended for patients who experienced atrial tachyarrhythmias after this time.

- **Statistical analysis**: Data were expressed as means ± SD for continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. To compare the two groups, χ² analysis or Fisher's exact test was used to analyze categorical variables, and an unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon's analysis was used to analyze continuous variables. A multivariate Cox proportional analysis was performed to determine significant risk factors and calculate the hazard ratios and 95% CI. The follow-up period was calculated from the date of the procedure to the date of AF recurrence or censoring. AF recurrence-free rates were calculated using Kaplan–Meier analysis, and log-rank statistics were used to make comparisons between the two groups.

### An ethanol protocol to prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^115GsrdH]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2006). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) occurs in dependent patients during the initial period of sudden onset abstinence. It is usually manifested by mild symptoms such as disorientation, agitation, and tachycardia, but if untreated, can lead to severe confusion, seizures, and even cardiovascular collapse. Prevention of AWS has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality and shorten hospital and ICU stays. We examined the efficacy of ethanol as a method of prophylaxis.

- **Study design**: Our patient population was divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of surgical patients receiving alcohol prophylaxis for AWS between January 2001 and July 2004 (n = 124), as identified by retrospective chart review. We then developed a protocol for the initiation, dosage, and weaning of intravenous ethanol in patients at risk for AWS, based on blood alcohol levels and clinical assessment of withdrawal symptoms and signs. Group 2 consisted of all patients treated prospectively with this protocol during the subsequent year (n = 76). Patients who did not fit inclusion criteria for the protocol were excluded from analysis, resulting in 92 and 68 patients in group 1 and group 2, respectively. We compared initiation criteria, efficacy, dosage, route, duration, and referral pattern to the substance abuse clinic before and after initiation of the protocol.

- **Results**: Our initial use of intravenous ethanol was very variable in dosage, duration, and indication. The protocol decreased the duration of treatment between the two groups from 7 days to a mean of 3 days. The failure rate dropped from 2

### Lower risk of stroke after alcohol abstinence in patients with incident atrial fibrillation: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^117JuQ3b]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol consumption was associated with an increased risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (AF). Compared to non-drinkers, individuals with mild alcohol consumption still showed a significantly higher risk of ischaemic stroke and demonstrated a linear dose–response relationship between the amount of alcohol intake and the risk of ischaemic stroke. Furthermore, alcohol abstinence after the diagnosis of AF could reduce the risk of ischaemic stroke. Lifestyle interventions, including attention to alcohol consumption, should be encouraged as part of a comprehensive approach in the management of patients with a new diagnosis of AF to improve clinical outcomes.

### Individualized studies of triggers of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: The I-STOP-AFib randomized clinical trial [^112jmjAC]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Although patients have reported that various exposures determine when and if an AF event will occur, a prospective evaluation of patient-selected triggers has not been conducted, and the utility of characterizing presumed AF-related triggers for individual patients remains unknown.

- **Objective**: To test the hypothesis that n-of-1 trials of self-selected AF triggers would enhance AF-related quality of life.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A randomized clinical trial lasting a minimum of 10 weeks tested a smartphone mobile application used by symptomatic patients with paroxysmal AF who owned a smartphone and were interested in testing a presumed AF trigger. Participants were screened between December 22, 2018, and March 29, 2020.

- **Interventions**: n-of-1 participants received instructions to expose or avoid self-selected triggers in random 1-week blocks for 6 weeks, and the probability their trigger influenced AF risk was then communicated. Controls monitored their AF over the same time period.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: AF was assessed daily by self-report and using a smartphone-based electrocardiogram recording device. The primary outcome comparing n-of-1 and control groups was the Atrial Fibrillation Effect on Quality-of-Life (AFEQT) score at 10 weeks. All participants could subsequently opt for additional trigger testing.

Results showed that of the 446 participants who initiated (mean [SD] age, 58 [14] years; 289 men [58%]; 461 White [92%]), 320 (72%) completed all study activities. Self-selected triggers included various factors.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and specifically in the context of managing withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating immediate treatment with medication effective at preventing subsequent seizures. Benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line therapy, with a preference for fast-acting agents such as lorazepam or diazepam. Phenobarbital may also be considered as an option, though it is less preferred than benzodiazepines.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on substrate remodeling and ablation outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^112nFAW8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The effect of alcohol consumption on substrate remodeling and the ablation outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation remains unknown.

- **Methods and results**: We performed circumferential pulmonary vein isolation and voltage mapping of the left atrium during sinus rhythm in 122 consecutive patients with symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (age, 55.4 ± 9.4 years; 73.8% men). Low‐voltage zones were semiquantitatively estimated and presented as a low‐voltage index. Each patient's daily alcohol consumption history was recorded at baseline and classified into alcohol abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism definition. The follow‐up period was ≥ 12 months for recurrence. Alcohol abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers numbered 70 (57.4%), 13 (10.6%), and 39 (32.0%), respectively. In total, low‐voltage zones were observed in 44 patients (36.1%). Daily alcohol consumption independently predicted the presence of low‐voltage zones (odds ratio, 1.097; 95% confidence interval, 1.001–1.203; P = 0.047). During a mean follow-up of 20.9 ± 5.9 months, 40 patients (35.1%) experienced recurrence. The success rate was 81.3% in alcohol abstainers, 69.2% in moderate drinkers, and 35.1% in heavy drinkers (overall log rank, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that both alcohol consumption and the presence of low‐voltage zones were independent predictors of recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.579; 95% confidence interval, 1.085–2.298; P = 0.017, and 2.188; 95%, 1.582–3.026; P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that low‐voltage zones acted as a partial mediator in the effect of alcohol consumption on ablation outcomes.

- **Conclusions**: Daily alcohol consumption independently affects substrate remodeling and the outcome of ablation in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation cases.

### Lower risk of stroke after alcohol abstinence in patients with incident atrial fibrillation: A nationwide population-based cohort study [^1137u3bX]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of incident atrial fibrillation (AF). Not only heavy drinking but also a "low spectrum of alcohol consumption" could be a risk factor for incident AF, as reported in a recent observational study. Regarding the risk of AF, alcohol consumption showed a consistent linear dose–response relationship.

While the association and dose–response relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of AF is well-established, the association between drinking alcohol and stroke is more controversial. In the general population, the overall association of alcohol intake with the risk of stroke was almost null, and the association with ischemic stroke showed a marginal reduction. In several prior studies, the associations between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular risk, including ischemic stroke, vary depending on whether the study focused on an immediate effect, long-term effect, or alcohol dose in the general population. The relationship between alcohol consumption and incident stroke in patients with AF per se remains unclear.

In a recent study, alcohol abstinence reduced AF recurrence in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF. Alcohol abstinence in AF patients with moderate to heavy drinking showed a significant reduction in the recurrence of AF and AF burden compared to those who continue their alcohol consumption. However, this study did not report the reduction of hard clinical endpoints, such as stroke. Physicians also need to consider the potentially beneficial effect of low amounts of alcohol on the broader health context.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^1145wJpJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Although alcohol consumption has been associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) in several large epidemiologic studies, the responsible mechanisms remain unknown. Previous electrophysiologic studies have failed to demonstrate an electrical mechanism, suggesting that structural changes in the atrium may be responsible.

Heavy alcohol consumption has long been known to result in ventricular cardiomyopathy. As the smaller atria are known to be more prone to enlargement and fibrosis than the ventricles, it is possible that more modest amounts of alcohol might be associated with evidence of atrial myopathy. However, the impact of cumulative alcohol exposure, especially modest alcohol consumption during adulthood, on left atrial structure remains largely undetermined. Furthermore, although emerging literature provides evidence that alcohol may increase atrial size, studies conducted at the time of writing have not taken into account the possible effects of interim AF. As AF itself may lead to left atrial enlargement, it remains unknown whether the alcohol‐associated atrial enlargement represents a co‐traveler, a subsequent effect of AF, or a key intermediate phenotype along the causal pathway between alcohol exposure and AF.

Using data from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), we sought to determine whether cumulative alcohol exposure is associated with enlargement of the left atrium in a large ambulatory cohort prior to any ascertainment of AF and to explore the hypothesis that an increase in left atrial size mediates the association between alcohol exposure and AF.

### Comparison of in-hospital outcomes of patients with versus without atrial fibrillation and alcohol withdrawal syndrome [^113iww8o]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) has been associated with significant medical complications and length of stay. Cardiovascular effects from AWS include a physiologic tachycardia and hypertensive response. Although atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common arrhythmias, the impact of a known history of AF on AWS is unclear. The purpose of our study is to assess the impact of a history of AF on clinical outcomes, cost, and length of stay in AWS.

The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients aged 18 years or older who underwent AWS with or without AF using the International Classification of Disease 9 Clinical Modification codes from January 2010 to December 2014. Outcomes were compared between those with and without AF using the propensity score method-stratified morbidity ratio weighing to adjust for baseline patient and hospital characteristics. A total of 280,451 patients with AWS were identified, of which 14,459 (5.2%) had a history of AF. Patients with AF were older, less likely to be female, and had a higher burden of co-morbidities.

In an adjusted model, in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.61 to 2.45), ischemic stroke (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.95), acute kidney injury (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.49), acute kidney injury requiring dialysis (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.39 to 2.50), and cost (mean ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.33) were higher in the AF cohort. Length of stay was shorter in patients with AF (mean ratio 0.85, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.90).

In conclusion, a known history of AF increased the risk of in-hospital mortality, morbidity, and hospital expenditures.

### Lower risk of stroke after alcohol abstinence in patients with incident atrial fibrillation: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^1167mAU2]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Although the amount of alcohol intake shows a linear relationship with incident AF, and alcohol abstinence is an important modifiable factor for effective rhythm control in patients with AF, there has been limited evidence on recommendations regarding optimal care of such patients, especially in relation to stroke prevention. In the general population, the association between alcohol intake and the risk of stroke showed a U-shaped relationship, wherein light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of stroke compared to abstinence. However, there has been no definitive answer to the question of whether a U-shaped relationship exists between alcohol intake and the risk of stroke in the population with AF.

A previous study reported that heavy drinking was associated with an increased risk of the composite of thromboembolism and death in the population with AF. However, this result was mainly driven by death, and the numbers were insufficient to address the beneficial effect of abstinence from alcohol and establish a dose–response relationship for the risk of stroke. Al-Khalili et al. reported that prior alcohol-related hospitalization was associated with a two-fold increased risk of ischaemic stroke in young patients with AF (18–64 years, median 55 years) at low risk for ischaemic stroke stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score (0 in men and 1 in women). However, a direct relationship between alcohol intake and ischaemic stroke was not demonstrated in this prior study.

### Ethanol-induced atrial fibrillation results from lateand can be prevented by ranolazine [^116k1JTm]. Circulation (2023). Low credibility.

Mechanistically, ethanol activates CaMKII in human atrial cardiomyocytes (T287 autophosphorylation; Figure I), leading to increased S571 phosphorylation on Na V 1.5 (Figure I).

To test whether ethanol-induced AF can be treated in vivo by late I Na inhibition with ranolazine, wild-type mice received simultaneous gavage of ranolazine (30 mg/kg) in addition to ethanol, which effectively prevented AF (Figure J). In contrast, 2 mg/kg of metoprolol did not prevent AF (data not shown). Consistently, the S571A mutation prevented ethanol-induced AF (Figure J); plasma ethanol concentration in S571A mice was 0.273 ± 0.0036% (n = 4).

Our findings demonstrate that:

- Induction of late I Na is the central mechanism by which acute ethanol exposure triggers AF.
- This is mediated by CaMKII-dependent Na V 1.5 phosphorylation at Ser-571.
- Ethanol-triggered AF can be effectively prevented with ranolazine (as a late I Na inhibitor).

Limitations of our model include diverging AP duration, heart rate, and diastolic function in isolated human cardiomyocytes and mice compared with human patients. Thus, we suggest that ranolazine should be investigated as a pharmacological strategy to prevent ethanol consumption–associated paroxysmal AF. The most promising candidates are likely patients without overt atrial remodeling and normal or increased alcohol consumption.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^114Hy2Y6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

During a mean follow-up of 44.4 ± 30.7 months (median 52.8 months, range 1–111.3 months) after the first catheter ablation (CA) session, 513 (37.7%) of 1361 patients experienced atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence. The breakdown is as follows: patients who consumed alcohol had a recurrence rate of 261/623 (41.9%), while patients who did not consume alcohol had a recurrence rate of 252/738 (34.1%) [P = 0.003].

The sinus rhythm maintenance rates at 3, 5, and 7 years after the first CA session were 64.9%, 58.5%, and 56.1% for patients who consumed alcohol, and 69.6%, 66.1%, and 61.7% for those who did not consume alcohol, respectively. AF recurred more frequently in patients who consumed alcohol after the initial CA [P = 0.0009], as shown in Figure 1A.

- **AF-free survival curve**: After the initial (A) and the final (B) catheter ablation. AF indicates atrial fibrillation; CA indicates catheter ablation.

Among 360 patients who underwent the second CA, 277 (76.9%) patients showed reconnection between the pulmonary veins (PVs) and the left atrium (LA). Specifically, patients who did not consume alcohol showed a reconnection rate of 119/175 (68.0%), while patients who consumed alcohol had a rate of 158/185 (85.4%) [P < 0.0001]. In addition, non-PV AF foci were identified in 161 (44.7%) patients. The breakdown is 92/175 (52.6%) for patients who did not consume alcohol versus 69/185 (37.3%) for those who did consume alcohol [P < 0.004].

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^1163kV9u]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, particularly concerning patients with atrial flutter and anticoagulation, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of long-term anticoagulation. This is suggested after successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation in patients with typical atrial flutter without any known previous history of atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at high risk for developing AF. Risk factors include left atrium enlargement, inducible AF, COPD, and heart failure. Anticoagulation should be considered if thromboembolic risk assessment suggests a high risk (greater than 2% annual risk) for stroke.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically in the context of managing withdrawal seizures, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend the preference for parenteral administration of medications. Following a withdrawal seizure, intravenous (IV) administration is preferred over intramuscular (IM) administration if available, although IM administration is also effective. Parenteral phenobarbital should only be used in highly supervised settings, such as an intensive care unit (ICU) or critical care unit, due to the risks of oversedation and respiratory depression.

### Commonly consumed beverages in daily life: Do they cause atrial fibrillation [^114H21FR]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent cardiac arrhythmia in the United States and worldwide. Caffeine, alcohol, and, more recently, energy drinks are the most commonly consumed beverages in daily life, especially by young individuals. Several questions have been raised about the implications of caffeine, alcohol, and energy drinks in cardiovascular health, particularly in triggering AF. This review focuses on the role of these commonly consumed beverages as a cause of AF, with special emphasis on potential mechanisms and studies addressing this issue.

### Benzodiazepine loading versus symptom-triggered treatment of alcohol withdrawal: a prospective, randomized clinical trial [^11736ExN]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2012). High credibility.

The objectives were to compare the efficacy of a benzodiazepine loading versus a symptom-triggered protocol in the management of alcohol withdrawal. We conducted a prospective, randomized, controlled trial including 47 consecutive patients admitted to one of two tertiary care medical centers who developed alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Patients were randomly assigned to either a benzodiazepine loading protocol or a symptom-triggered treatment protocol. The Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised scale (CIWA-Ar) was recorded throughout the length of stay, along with measures of autonomic system functioning.

The average rate of change of CIWA-Ar scores was -1.5 ± 1.3 for the symptom-triggered group and -2.3 ± 2.5 for the loading group. The average rate of change for systolic blood pressure was -2.7 ± 5.3 for the symptom-triggered group and -2.3 ± 6.4 for the loading group. There was no significant difference between the rates of change for either group on either measure. Similarly, there was no significant difference in total benzodiazepine use between groups. Within 72 hours of treatment, 69.6% of patients in the loading group were free of withdrawal symptoms versus 41.7% in the symptom-triggered group, a difference not reaching statistical significance.

This study did not reveal clear evidence of a clinical advantage for choosing either treatment method.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in an outpatient setting, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of preventive pharmacotherapy at the discretion of providers with extensive experience in managing alcohol withdrawal. This is particularly recommended for patients at risk of severe or complicated withdrawal or complications arising from withdrawal. Benzodiazepines should be administered as first-line therapy to reduce withdrawal signs and symptoms, including the risk of seizure and delirium. For providers experienced with its use, phenobarbital may be administered as an alternative option. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, providers should either administer phenobarbital or transfer patients to a more intensive level of care.

The ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy for patients at risk of developing new or worsening signs or symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, especially when away from the outpatient treatment setting. This is particularly important for those with a history of withdrawal episodes of at least moderate severity or those within the symptomatic time window of withdrawal. For monotherapy, administer benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, or gabapentin. Alternatively, use at least a single dose of benzodiazepine followed by ongoing treatment according to symptom severity. It is essential to reassess patients frequently over the next 24 hours to monitor their need for withdrawal medication if the risk of developing severe withdrawal is unknown.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically concerning indications for pharmacotherapy in inpatient settings, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as the first-line therapy for patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Carbamazepine or gabapentin can be administered as alternative options. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced in its use). Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if there is no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

### Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation associated with the trigger sequence of strenuous exercise followed by cold water ingestion [^1147q5F6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Patients often present to the emergency department with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. There is increasing recognition that, in a subset of patients, certain clinical triggers mediated via the autonomic nervous system may precipitate episodes of atrial fibrillation. Although identification of these triggers may be critical for prevention of future episodes, they may be overlooked by treating physicians.

- **Case report**: We describe an otherwise healthy 64-year-old physician who presented on two separate occasions to the emergency department with atrial fibrillation. He was electrically cardioverted successfully into normal sinus rhythm and discharged without medications both times. The patient ultimately recognized that both episodes occurred in the setting of strenuous exercise followed soon after by ingestion of cold water. Since avoiding this sequence, he has not had any episodes of atrial fibrillation in the ensuing 7 years.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Emergency physicians often encounter patients who present with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, some of whom may have autonomic triggers or trigger sequences that precipitated it. Although our single case report cannot prove that the sequence described caused the atrial fibrillation, we hope the case can serve to highlight the increasing awareness that, in a subset of patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, identification of specific triggers could be critical in prevention and should be sought.

### Alcohol abstinence in drinkers with atrial fibrillation [^114Rzxua]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with incident atrial fibrillation and adverse atrial remodeling; however, the effect of abstinence from alcohol on secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation is unclear.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled trial at six hospitals in Australia. Adults who consumed 10 or more standard drinks (with 1 standard drink containing approximately 12 g of pure alcohol) per week and who had paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation in sinus rhythm at baseline were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either abstain from alcohol or continue their usual alcohol consumption. The two primary end points were freedom from recurrence of atrial fibrillation (following a 2-week "blanking period") and total atrial fibrillation burden (proportion of time in atrial fibrillation) during 6 months of follow-up.

- **Results**: Of 140 patients who underwent randomization (85% men; mean [± SD] age, 62 ± 9 years), 70 were assigned to the abstinence group and 70 to the control group. Patients in the abstinence group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.8 ± 7.7 to 2.1 ± 3.7 standard drinks per week (a reduction of 87.5%), and patients in the control group reduced their alcohol intake from 16.4 ± 6.9 to 13.2 ± 6.5 drinks per week (a reduction of 19.5%). After a 2-week blanking period, atrial fibrillation recurred in 37 of 70 patients (53%) in the abstinence group and in 51 of 70 patients (73%) in the control group. The abstinence group had a longer period before recurrence of atrial fibrillation than the control group.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^115Pje8n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Findings regarding the relationship between alcohol consumption and atrial fibrillation (AF) foci during repeat catheter ablation (CA) demonstrated that patients who consumed alcohol had a significantly higher pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection but significantly lower non-PV AF foci. The higher PV reconnection should not be attributed to the difficulty in achieving complete PV isolation in these patients. Jiang et al. examined 32 patients without AF recurrence after the initial CA and found that PV conduction recovered in 90.6% of these patients, implying that even patients without AF recurrence could be candidates for PV-related AF. We speculate that frequent triggers from alcohol consumption activate the PVs, possibly playing a role in the clinical recurrence of AF. Furthermore, the ablation outcome was similar between final CA patients who did and did not consume alcohol. This suggests that even with more PV triggers from alcohol consumption, triggered PV firing should be confined to the veins and not affect the left atrium if the PVs are completely isolated. Although our speculation appears reasonable, further research is needed to confirm this theory.

The lower non-PV AF foci during the second CA in patients who consumed alcohol may be explained by comparing baseline clinical characteristics. Some studies have reported that chronic alcohol consumption negatively affects the atrial substrate and causes atrial remodeling to progress, potentially associated with AF generation.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113pRDwj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, specifically with respect to indications for pharmacotherapy, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend initiating pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines as a first-line therapy in patients experiencing moderate alcohol withdrawal (CIWA-Ar score 10–18). Administer carbamazepine or gabapentin as alternative options. If benzodiazepines are contraindicated, administer carbamazepine, gabapentin, or phenobarbital (for providers experienced with its use). Consider administering carbamazepine, gabapentin, or valproic acid (if there is no liver disease or childbearing potential) as an adjunct to benzodiazepines.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to caffeine restriction, the 2024 ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS guidelines recommend not advising caffeine abstention to prevent episodes of AF. However, they acknowledge that caffeine reduction may alleviate symptoms in patients who report caffeine as a trigger or as exacerbating AF symptoms.

### Research priorities in the secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation: A National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute virtual workshop report [^114RD1u2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Extensive observational evidence indicates that excessive alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking are associated with the risk of developing atrial fibrillation (AF), whereas the data linking diet and AF are less consistent. Understanding the effect of alcohol, smoking, and dietary interventions on the secondary prevention of AF is more limited.

- **Alcohol intake**: A meta‐analysis of the association of alcohol consumption with incident AF demonstrated a convincing dose‐response relationship. The adjusted relative risk by drinks per day was 1.08 for 1, 1.17 for 2, 1.26 for 3, 1.36 for 4, and 1.47 for 5. Alcohol intake is a common trigger for AF episodes and has been associated with atrial enlargement, adverse electrical atrial remodeling, and higher risk of AF recurrence after ablation. An Australian open‐label randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 140 patients (15% women; mean age, 62 years) with paroxysmal or persistent AF who consumed ≥ 10 drinks per week randomized half to abstain and half to usual alcohol consumption. Patients in the abstinence group reduced their alcohol consumption by 88% and experienced longer periods before AF recurrence and reduced AF burden.

- **Smoking**: A meta‐analysis of observational studies reported a dose‐response association between cigarette smoking and incident AF. There is limited evidence linking smoking with secondary prevention of AF. In an observational study, smoking was found to be a predictor of AF recurrence after ablation and was therefore included in a risk score for recurrent AF (reAF) with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.40–2.51]. Proposed mechanisms include proarrhythmic effects.

### Alcohol and atrial fibrillation: A sobering review [^111YyPZn]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Alcohol is popular in Western culture, supported by a perception that modest intake is cardioprotective. However, excessive drinking has detrimental implications for cardiovascular disease. Atrial fibrillation (AF) following an alcohol binge, known as the "holiday heart syndrome", is well characterized. More modest levels of alcohol intake on a regular basis may also increase the risk of AF.

The pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the relationship between alcohol and AF may include direct toxicity and alcohol's contribution to obesity, sleep-disordered breathing, and hypertension. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of the epidemiology and pathophysiology by which alcohol may be responsible for AF and determine whether alcohol abstinence is required for patients with AF.

### Alcohol consumption, left atrial diameter, and atrial fibrillation [^116WzsDw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The findings of several recent investigations suggest that chronic consumption of alcohol may lead to LA‐specific structural and electrophysiological remodeling. In one cross‐sectional study including over 4,000 elderly Atherosclerosis Risk in Community study participants, increasing alcohol intake was associated with larger left ventricular diastolic and systolic diameters as well as larger LA diameter (P < 0.05). We observed a similar association between alcohol consumption and LAD in a larger and younger ambulatory cohort affected by less cardiovascular comorbidity and with modest consumption of alcohol. However, we were not able to detect a statistically significant association between alcohol consumption and change in LAD over serial echocardiograms.

One possible explanation for this negative finding is the fact that the effect of chronic alcohol consumption on LA size requires several years or even decades. As such, the first echocardiogram reflects a greater burden of alcohol‐related change than is captured by the serial echocardiographic images obtained over a relatively short period of time. Another possible explanation for this finding relates to the fact that alcohol leads to an increase in LAD only up to a point (quantified by the first echo), but with limited or negligible subsequent effect. Lastly, this analysis required that at least two LAD measurements be required for inclusion, and limited statistical power may have been responsible for our inability to detect significant relations between alcohol consumption and change in LAD over time.

### Lower risk of stroke after alcohol abstinence in patients with incident atrial fibrillation: A nationwide population-based cohort study [^115F6SHK]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was the incidence of ischaemic stroke during follow-up. A detailed definition of the primary outcome is presented in Supplementary Material online, Table S1. We defined the index date of follow-up as the second health examination date, which was performed within two years after atrial fibrillation diagnosis. Patients were followed up starting from the index date until the occurrence of ischaemic stroke, death, or the end of the study period (31 December 2017), whichever came first.

### Alcohol use disorders and the heart [^115WFQ68]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

Heavy alcohol consumption in a binge pattern is associated with the development of acute cardiac arrhythmia, even in those with normal heart function. The term "holiday heart" was coined by Ettinger in 1978 to describe "an acute cardiac rhythm and/or conduction disturbance associated with heavy ethanol consumption in a person without other clinical evidence of heart disease and disappearing without evident residual, with abstinence". The authors noted a seasonal rise in the incidence of arrhythmias during periods of traditional binge drinking, such as Christmas and New Year. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common arrhythmia noted. However, atrial flutter, junctional tachycardia, isolated premature ventricular complexes, isolated premature atrial complexes, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia were also described.

Alcohol may act together with coexistent electrolyte disturbance and/or acute illnesses, such as infections, to produce supraventricular arrhythmias. Sudden death in alcohol misuse (SUDAM) is increasingly recognized, and case series have described heavy drinkers who die suddenly with no autopsy findings other than fatty liver change. There are several possible but unproven causes of such deaths, and a ventricular arrhythmia unmasked by persistent heavy alcohol use is one possibility. When compared with deaths due to sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, the SUDAM group is significantly older and has a tenfold greater incidence of fatty liver change. Heavy alcohol consumption is associated with QT interval prolongation.

### Role of stress kinase JNK in binge alcohol-evoked atrial arrhythmia [^113oC7Lx]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Excessive binge alcohol drinking has acute cardiac arrhythmogenic effects, including the promotion of atrial fibrillation (AF), which underlies "Holiday Heart Syndrome". The mechanism coupling binge alcohol abuse with AF susceptibility remains unclear. Previous reports indicate that stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling contributes to AF development. Notably, JNK is implicated in alcohol-caused organ malfunction beyond the heart.

- **Objectives**: The purpose of this study was to detail how JNK promotes binge alcohol-evoked susceptibility to AF.

- **Methods**: The authors found that binge alcohol exposure leads to activated JNK, specifically JNK2. Furthermore, binge alcohol induces AF (24- vs. 1.8-Hz burst pacing-induced episodes per attempt per animal) and a higher incidence of diastolic intracellular Ca 2+ activity (Ca 2+ waves and sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] Ca 2+ leakage), along with membrane voltage (Vm) and systolic Ca 2+ release spatiotemporal heterogeneity (Δt Vm-Ca). These changes were completely eliminated by JNK inhibition both in vivo and in vitro. Calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a proarrhythmic molecule known to drive SR Ca 2+ mishandling.

- **Results**: The authors report for the first time that binge alcohol activates JNK2, which subsequently phosphorylates the CaMKII protein, enhancing CaMKII-driven SR Ca 2+ mishandling. CaMKII inhibition eliminates binge alcohol-evoked arrhythmic activities.

- **Conclusions**: Our studies demonstrate that binge alcohol exposure activates JNK2 in the atria, which then drives CaMKII activation, prompting aberrant Ca 2+ wave.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on substrate remodeling and ablation outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^116FmfVr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The effect of alcohol consumption on substrate remodeling and ablation outcome of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) remains unknown.

- **Methods and results**: We performed circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) and voltage mapping of the left atrium (LA) during sinus rhythm in 122 consecutive patients with symptomatic PAF (age, 55.4 ± 9.4 years; 73.8% men). Low-voltage zones (LVZs) were semiquantitatively estimated and presented as a low-voltage index (LVI). Each patient's daily alcohol consumption history was recorded at baseline and classified into alcohol abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers based on the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism definition. Follow-up was ≥ 12 months for AF recurrence. Alcohol abstainers and moderate and heavy drinkers were 70 (57.4%), 13 (10.6%), and 39 (32.0%), respectively. In total, LVZs were observed in 44 patients (36.1%). Daily alcohol consumption independently predicted the presence of LVZs (odds ratio [OR], 1.097; 95% confidence interval, 1.001–1.203; P = 0.047). During the mean follow-up of 20.9 ± 5.9 months, 40 patients (35.1%) experienced AF recurrence. The success rate was 81.3%, 69.2%, and 35.1% in alcohol abstainers, moderate drinkers, and heavy drinkers, respectively (overall log rank, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that both alcohol consumption and LVI were independent predictors of AF recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.579; 95% CI, 1.085–2.298; P = 0.017; HR, 2.188; 95% CI, 1.582–3.026; P < 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that LVZs acted as a partial mediator in effect.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113Sgp6e]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, and more specifically with respect to anticonvulsants, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend considering the administration of phenobarbital, managed by a clinician experienced with its use, in inpatient settings with close monitoring. This can be used as an adjunct to benzodiazepines in patients with severe alcohol withdrawal or those at risk of developing severe or complicated alcohol withdrawal, or complications thereof.

### Alcohol consumption, cardiac biomarkers, and risk of atrial fibrillation and adverse outcomes [^113RHaQz]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an arrhythmia with a significant impact on public health due to its rising prevalence in aging populations and its association with adverse outcomes, including stroke and heart failure (HF), which more than double the mortality risk. The effect of alcohol on AF risk has remained ambiguous. For diseases predisposing to AF, such as coronary artery disease or HF, low to moderate alcohol consumption seems to be related to a lower incidence, while higher levels are associated with an increased risk. Reported associations with AF range from null at lower regular alcohol intake, rather linearly increasing in large meta-analyses, to a more J-shaped relation in women. In particular, the association at low levels of alcohol consumption is less clear.

From a pathophysiological perspective, alcohol may directly affect arrhythmogenesis as observed in the holiday heart syndrome. Acute alcohol consumption induces autonomic imbalance, reflected by sinus tachycardia, predisposing one to arrhythmia. Electrolyte disturbances and alterations of the acid-base balance are further pro-arrhythmic triggers. Chronic alcohol consumption is known to be correlated with changes in cardiac structure and function, including cardiomyopathy.

Habitual alcohol intake has been linked to atrial remodeling as an intermediate AF phenotype in the community. Moreover, alcohol intake is also associated with the most prevalent risk factors of AF. Increased alcohol intake is accompanied by a higher frequency of hypertension and obesity.

### Acute consumption of alcohol and discrete atrial fibrillation events [^116ZAzii]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Patients' self-reports suggest that acute alcohol consumption may trigger a discrete atrial fibrillation (AF) event.

- **Objective**: To objectively ascertain whether alcohol consumption heightens the risk for an AF episode.

- **Design**: A prospective, case-crossover analysis.

- **Setting**: Ambulatory persons in their natural environments.

- **Participants**: Consenting patients with paroxysmal AF.

- **Measurements**: Participants were fitted with a continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor and an ankle-worn transdermal ethanol sensor for 4 weeks. Real-time documentation of each alcoholic drink consumed was self-recorded using a button on the ECG recording device. Fingerstick blood tests for phosphatidylethanol (PEth) were used to corroborate ascertainments of drinking events.

- **Results**: Of 100 participants (mean age, 64 years [SD, 15]; 79% male; 85% White), 56 had at least 1 episode of AF. Results of PEth testing correlated with the number of real-time recorded drinks and with events detected by the transdermal alcohol sensor. An AF episode was associated with 2-fold higher odds of 1 alcoholic drink (odds ratio [OR], 2.02 [95% CI, 1.38 to 3.17]) and greater than 3-fold higher odds of at least 2 drinks (OR, 3.58 [CI, 1.63 to 7.89]) in the preceding 4 hours. Episodes of AF were also associated with higher odds of peak blood alcohol concentration (OR, 1.38 [CI, 1.04 to 1.83] per 0.1% increase in blood alcohol concentration) and the total area under the curve of alcohol exposure (OR, 1.14 [CI, 1.06 to 1.22] per 4.7% increase in alcohol exposure) inferred from the transdermal ethanol sensor.

### Impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation [^111oMt4g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The study investigated the impact of alcohol consumption on the outcome of catheter ablation (CA) in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF). A total of 1361 consecutive patients, with a mean age of 61 ± 11 years, including 334 women, were enrolled. They were referred to the institution between 2005 and 2010 to undergo their first CA session for the treatment of symptomatic PAF that was refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs.

AF was considered PAF if it terminated spontaneously and persisted for 7 days, with amiodarone discontinued for more than one month before CA. All patients received anticoagulation medication for over one month. A 7-French 20- or 14-pole, 2-site mapping catheter from Irvine Biomedical Inc, located in Irvine, CA, was inserted through the right jugular vein and positioned in the coronary sinus for pacing, recording, and internal cardioversion. These procedures were performed with patients under sedation using intravenous propofol or dexmedetomidine in a fasting state.

### Lower risk of stroke after alcohol abstinence in patients with incident atrial fibrillation: a nationwide population-based cohort study [^114X2SkM]. European Heart Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The crude event numbers and incidence rates (IRs) of all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and non-cardiovascular death were different among the three groups. The results were consistent even when adjusting for the competing risks of death.

- **Subgroup analyses**: In each subgroup, stratified according to sex, age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and smoking status, the overall results were consistent with the main findings. There were no significant interactions regarding ischemic stroke between groups categorized by alcohol status and all subgroups.

- **Alcohol consumption amount at the first health examination**: To account for previous cumulative alcohol intake, abstainers and drinkers were stratified according to their weekly alcohol intake as described in the methods section: mild (0 to < 105 g), moderate (105 to < 210 g), and heavy (≥ 210 g). Abstainers who consumed mild or moderate amounts of alcohol per week and stopped drinking after the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) had a similar risk of ischemic stroke as non-drinkers. Ex-heavy drinkers showed a significantly higher risk of ischemic stroke than non-drinkers, despite cessation of drinking after the diagnosis of AF (adjusted HR 1.433, 95% CI 1.122–1.831). All drinkers showed a higher risk of ischemic stroke compared to non-drinkers.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^114D4UXd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend performing a neurological examination in patients presenting with a seizure to identify the cause. A seizure should be attributed to alcohol withdrawal only if there has been a recent cessation of, or reduction in, alcohol consumption. Obtain an EEG and/or neuroimaging in patients experiencing new onset seizures or with a known history of alcohol withdrawal seizures showing a new pattern. Avoid obtaining additional neurological testing and neurology consultation in patients with a known history of withdrawal seizure attributed to alcohol withdrawal. This includes cases when the seizure was generalized and without focal elements, if a thorough neurological examination reveals no evidence of focal deficits, and if there is no suspicion of meningitis or other causes.
