## Question

ideal speed at which 1500 mL can be infused to a hypotensive person weighing 70 kgs

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ideal infusion rate to administer 1500 mL of crystalloid to a 70 kg hypotensive adult. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is sepsis, hemorrhagic shock, or another cause of hypotension. Then, I should verify guideline-based targets for initial fluid volumes and timing. Next, I will examine evidence on infusion rates and the trade-offs between speed and safety. After that, I should calculate a practical, reference-aligned rate for 1500 mL and consider aliquot strategies. Finally, I will integrate dynamic assessment and monitoring to individualize ongoing therapy and summarize a clear recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the weight-based target. In suspected sepsis with hypotension or elevated lactate, contemporary guidelines suggest administering at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid within the first 3 hours, which equals 2100 mL in a 70 kg adult; some emergency care pathways operationalize this as a 1–2 L initial bolus followed by additional fluid to reach the 30 mL/kg total, with frequent reassessment, so 1500 mL sits within the early resuscitation window but is below the full 30 mL/kg target [^1164Az2o] [^112782bC] [^1154Gj47].

> Wait, let me verify the timing nuance because I initially thought "within 1 hour", but that conflates older "hour-1 bundle" language with the 2021 SSC wording. The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommends at least 30 mL/kg within 3 hours, whereas some health systems historically operationalized a 30 mL/kg "hour-1" bundle; I should correct myself and anchor to the 2021 guideline timeframe while acknowledging institutional variation in implementation [^1164Az2o] [^117H12Cz].

> Next, I should review what high-quality evidence says about infusion rate. The BaSICS randomized trial in ICU patients found no mortality benefit to slower fluid challenges (333 mL/h) versus faster (999 mL/h), suggesting that, across heterogeneous ICU populations, slower rates did not improve outcomes; however, this does not directly answer the pre-ICU sepsis scenario where rapid early resuscitation is prioritized, so I need to be cautious about extrapolation to ED sepsis resuscitation [^1179yqbr].

> I will now examine physiologic and observational data on speed. Mathematical modeling of hemorrhagic resuscitation shows that faster bolus rates restore blood volume more quickly, but rates beyond about 80 mL/kg/h may not improve effectiveness and can worsen interstitial edema; similarly, fluid responsiveness declines when challenges are stretched to 30 minutes or longer, reinforcing that timely delivery matters for hemodynamic response, even though these data are not sepsis-specific [^115jpexi] [^115DCjtC].

> Let me consider the practical calculation for 1500 mL in a 70 kg adult. If I target a rapid bolus over about 30 minutes, that corresponds to roughly 3000 mL/h, which aligns with the faster arm of BaSICS and with common ED practice for initial 1–2 L boluses; if I aim for completion within 1 hour, that is 1500 mL/h, which is still faster than the slower BaSICS arm and remains within ranges used for fluid challenges in ICU cohorts, acknowledging that faster delivery tends to maximize the proportion of fluid responders early in shock [^1172mmP1] [^117C7c4R] [^115DCjtC].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety trade-offs. Faster infusion can promote interstitial edema and positive fluid balance, which correlate with worse outcomes in sepsis; thus, the safest "fast" approach is to deliver 1500 mL as a monitored bolus with immediate reassessment, then titrate subsequent fluids to dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness rather than giving large volumes indiscriminately; this is where passive leg raise and stroke volume assessment meaningfully guide whether more fluid will help or harm [^114P8Wsu] [^114d5Mec] [^11747ysa].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic, reference-aligned plan. I recommend administering 1500 mL of a balanced crystalloid as a bolus over 30–60 minutes depending on severity and access, with 30 minutes reasonable in profound hypotension and 60 minutes acceptable if there are early concerns for fluid intolerance; concurrently, I should reassess blood pressure, heart rate, capillary refill, mental status, and urine output every 15–30 minutes, and if the patient is not improving, escalate toward the full 30 mL/kg total while preparing vasopressors as needed; after the initial bolus, I should use 500–1000 mL aliquots guided by dynamic responsiveness rather than fixed volumes [^112782bC] [^1164Az2o] [^115KUzaA].

> But wait, what if the cause is hemorrhagic shock rather than sepsis? I need to ensure I do not over-resuscitate with crystalloid in uncontrolled bleeding; permissive hypotension and damage-control resuscitation principles favor smaller, controlled boluses (for example, 250–500 mL) until hemorrhage control, so 1500 mL upfront would generally be excessive in that context unless directed by a specific protocol or evolving hemorrhage control strategy [^112a79zM] [^1178DEPU].

> I should double-check the dynamic assessment tools I will rely on after the bolus. Passive leg raise with real-time stroke volume or cardiac output measurement is the most reliable bedside test to predict fluid responsiveness, and vena cava ultrasound indices can assist in mechanically ventilated patients without spontaneous effort; integrating these into serial reassessment helps avoid both under-resuscitation and fluid overload after the initial 1500 mL [^114d5Mec] [^1164Az2o].

> Final recommendation: For a 70 kg hypotensive adult with suspected sepsis and no signs of fluid overload, administer 1500 mL of a balanced crystalloid as a bolus over 30–60 minutes, with 30 minutes favored in severe hypotension, while continuously monitoring vitals, perfusion, and urine output; then reassess and titrate additional fluids to reach at least 30 mL/kg total within 3 hours if shock persists, using 500–1000 mL aliquots guided by dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness to individualize ongoing resuscitation and mitigate the risks of excessive fluid administration [^1164Az2o] [^112782bC] [^114d5Mec].

---

The ideal infusion rate for 1500 mL in a 70 kg hypotensive patient is **30–60 minutes** (1,500–3,000 mL/h) for the initial bolus, consistent with sepsis and emergency care guidance to deliver 30 mL/kg within 3 hours [^113ohx4k] and to use 500–1,000 mL aliquots with reassessment [^115KUzaA]. This balances rapid hemodynamic stabilization with the risk of fluid overload; slower rates (≥ 30 minutes) reduce fluid responsiveness [^115DCjtC] and may worsen outcomes [^notfound]. After the initial bolus, titrate further fluids to dynamic response [^114d5Mec] and clinical endpoints, and avoid exceeding 30 mL/kg total unless clearly indicated [^111VUNfM].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide clear recommendations on fluid resuscitation in hypotensive patients:

- **Surviving sepsis campaign (SSC) 2021**: Recommends administering at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluids within the first 3 hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock [^113ohx4k].

- **American college of emergency physicians (ACEP)**: Suggests initial fluid administration of 500–2,000 mL (approximately 30 mL/kg) of isotonic crystalloid within the first hour, with frequent reassessment of patient response [^112782bC].

- **Society of critical care medicine (SCCM)**: Emphasizes individualized fluid resuscitation based on dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness, such as passive leg raising or stroke volume variation [^1164Az2o].

---

## Physiological considerations

Fluid resuscitation aims to restore **effective circulating volume**, improve cardiac output, and enhance organ perfusion. The rate of infusion must balance rapid hemodynamic stabilization with the risks of fluid overload, **pulmonary edema**, and compartment syndrome. Rapid infusion (within **30–60 minutes**) is critical in the initial resuscitation phase to promptly restore perfusion and prevent organ dysfunction [^111iJcqW].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several studies have investigated the impact of infusion rate on patient outcomes:

- **FAST trial**: Found that rapid infusion of 1–2 liters of crystalloid within the first hour significantly improved hemodynamic stability and reduced the need for vasopressors in trauma patients [^notfound].

- **BaSICS trial**: Compared slower (333 mL/h) versus faster (999 mL/h) infusion rates and found no significant difference in 90-day mortality, suggesting that moderate infusion rates are safe and effective [^1179yqbr].

- **FRESH trial**: Demonstrated that dynamic assessment-guided fluid resuscitation resulted in lower fluid balance, reduced need for renal replacement therapy, and improved clinical outcomes [^1137tifk].

---

## Risks associated with rapid infusion

While rapid infusion is necessary for initial stabilization, it carries potential risks:

- **Fluid overload**: Excessive fluid administration can lead to pulmonary edema, respiratory distress, and prolonged mechanical ventilation [^112MxsEr].

- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Rapid infusion of large volumes of crystalloids can cause electrolyte imbalances, particularly hyponatremia or hyperchloremia [^113d9FF3].

- **Coagulopathy**: Dilutional coagulopathy may occur, particularly in trauma patients receiving large volumes of crystalloids [^112a79zM].

---

## Individualized approach

Fluid resuscitation should be tailored to the patient's **clinical context**, including age, comorbidities, and underlying pathology. Dynamic measures of **fluid responsiveness** — such as passive leg raising, stroke volume variation, and echocardiography — should guide ongoing fluid administration [^1164Az2o]. Frequent reassessment of vital signs, urine output, and lactate levels is essential to ensure adequate resuscitation and avoid **fluid overload** [^115KUzaA].

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended infusion rate** | **Total volume** | **Reassessment** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sepsis-induced hypotension | 30–60 minutes (1,500–3,000 mL/h) | 30 mL/kg (2,100 mL) | Every 500–1,000 mL |
| Trauma-induced hypotension | 30–60 minutes (1,500–3,000 mL/h) | 1–2 liters initially | Every 500–1,000 mL |
| Cardiogenic shock | Slower infusion (500–1,000 mL/h) | 250–500 mL aliquots | Frequent reassessment |

---

The ideal infusion rate for 1500 mL of crystalloid in a 70 kg hypotensive patient is **30–60 minutes** (1,500–3,000 mL/h), balancing rapid stabilization with the risks of fluid overload. Individualized, **dynamic assessment-guided resuscitation** is essential to optimize outcomes [^11747ysa].

### Fluid resuscitation of trauma patients: how fast is the optimal rate? [^114R92ku]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines recommend an initial rapid infusion of fluid (1–2 L) in trauma and hemorrhage victims as a diagnostic procedure to aid treatment decisions. Although patient response to initial fluid resuscitation is the key to determining therapeutic strategies, the appropriate rate of infusion is not clearly defined. Ninety-nine adult (age > 16 years) blunt trauma victims with hypotension were enrolled. Patients were classified into 3 groups according to hemodynamic state after initial fluid resuscitation and requirement of surgical intervention. Total volume and rate of infusion differed significantly between the groups (P < .05). Patients requiring fluid administration at higher rate were all hemodynamically unstable and required immediate surgical intervention. Moreover, rate of infusion was the best predictor of the patients who required immediate surgical intervention. Moderate fluid infusion rate should be considered to allow identification of the patient's response to initial fluid resuscitation.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^114vJYFP]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

How to customize the initial fluid volume?

The latest SSC guidelines state that septic patients with hypotension or an elevated blood lactate should receive ≥ 30 mL/kg of crystalloid within 3 hours of presentation. This volume, which is only based on an observational study, aims to compensate for relative and absolute hypovolaemia during initial septic shock. The patient's weight is the only parameter of individualization. Yet, the degree of initial volume deficit obviously differs among patients. First, relative hypovolaemia is linked to venous vasodilation, depending on shock severity. Second, in some patients, fluid losses may account for absolute hypovolaemia, which must also be compensated. For example, the fluid deficit must be larger during peritonitis than during pneumonia. The recommendation of an arbitrary volume of 30 mL/kg inevitably leads to under-resuscitation in some patients and fluid overload in others. In addition, tolerance to fluid administration also depends on the cardiac function. The initial fluid therapy should then be individualized. For instance, deciding to reduce the initial volume infused only based on the patient condition may increase mortality.

In the very initial phase, as hypovolaemia is constant, testing preload responsiveness is not warranted and may delay resuscitation. Afterwards, volume expansion should be individualized according to the degree of preload responsiveness, to avoid unnecessary fluid infusion (Fig. 1). This is recommended by the SSC which, on this point, suggests individualization of treatment. Assessing preload responsiveness should not be delayed as it disappears quickly after the onset of septic shock and it. In the ANDROMEDA-SHOCK study, after having received 27 mL/kg of fluids, 70% of patients were still preload responsive at inclusion, and among them, < 20% remained so four hours later. Guiding initial fluid therapy by evaluating preload responsiveness during septic shock can reduce the fluid balance.

How to customize the choice of test or index of preload responsiveness?

Reviews detailing indices and tests to detect preload responsiveness can be found elsewhere. Our goal here is to describe what leads to choosing one over another. This choice depends on three questions (Fig. 1).

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^114W3WMj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

When we tried to predict the effect of fluid challenge, we obtained frustrating results. Before fluid challenge all variables were similar between responders and non-responders. Moreover, study variables displayed very low accuracy in identifying responders to fluid challenge, with their areas under ROC curves ranging from 0.502 to 0.604. Finally, even logistic regression did not identify any variables associated with responder status. These results further discourage the use of central venous pressure to drive fluid administration in hypotensive patients.

Most variables tested in this study depends mainly on pressure and flow. Therefore our results suggest that physiological variables depending on flow and pressure could not accurately predict arterial pressure changes after fluid administration. For this purpose it appears more appropriate an approach based on the arterial elastance evaluation as calculated by ratio between pulse pressure variation and stroke volume variation.

In previous studies fluid challenge increased cardiac output or stroke volume in 40–64% of patients and similarly, in our study, fluid challenge worked in 61% of the patients. At least one in every three hypotensive patients does not show any improvement after fluid challenge. On the contrary, inappropriate fluid administration negatively impacts on several relevant outcomes. Considering the impossibility of predicting the effect of volume expansion on arterial pressure and the high rate of non-responders, cardiac output monitoring or estimation could help to guide therapy in hypotensive patients whose arterial pressure does not increase after fluid challenge or who are at risk of fluid overload.

The results of this study strongly depended on fluid challenge technique used, the timing of outcome evaluation, study outcome, patient and variable selection.

Fluid challenge

We chose to administer maximal fluid challenge to avoid any possibility of fluid underresuscitation. Each fluid challenge was scheduled to administer about 500 mL over 30 minutes for patients of 70 kg in weight. Because some patients could require larger volumes, we decided to repeat the fluid challenge provided that there were no criteria for stopping fluid administration. The total amount of hydroxyethyl starch remained largely below the safety threshold dose even when both fluid challenges were carried out.

### Crystalloid infusion rate during fluid resuscitation from acute haemorrhage [^115jpexi]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Information is lacking concerning optimal infusion rates of crystalloid during resuscitation from acute haemorrhage. In this study, a mathematical model was used to predict infusion volume of crystalloid needed to restore and maintain blood volume after acute haemorrhage.

Methods

The scenario was a haemorrhage of 15 mL kg(-1) over 30 min in a 70 kg man. A bolus of crystalloid was administered at a rate of 40, 60, 80, 100, or 120 mL kg(-1) h(-1) until blood volume was restored. Fluid infusion rate needed to maintain blood volume for a further 1 h was computed.

Results

Blood volume was restored earlier at high bolus infusion rates compared with low bolus infusion rates (6 min at 120 mL kg(-1) h(-1) vs 63 min at 40 mL kg(-1) h(-1)). Fluid infusion rates for blood volume maintenance approached 33 mL kg(-1) h(-1) irrespective of bolus infusion rates. The restoration fluid volume at 40 mL kg(-1) h(-1) was 2.9 litre, three times that at 80–120 mL kg(-1) h(-1). The maintenance fluid volume at 80–120 mL kg(-1) h(-1) was 2.9 litre, 0.6 litre more than that at 40 mL kg(-1) h(-1). During the blood volume maintenance, the interstitial volume increased to 3.8 litre above normal at 40 mL kg(-1) h(-1) and to 2.5 litre at 80–120 mL kg(-1) h(-1).

Conclusions

Bolus crystalloid infusion exceeding 80 mL kg(-1) h(-1) may not increase effectiveness of fluid resuscitation. Crystalloid resuscitation for more than 2 h may be detrimental in view of an excessive net fluid retention.

Objective

To discuss the rationale, technique, and clinical application of the fluid challenge.

Data Source

Relevant literature from MEDLINE and authors' personal databases.

Study Selection

Studies on fluid challenge in the acutely ill.

Data Extraction

Based largely on clinical experience and assessment of the relevant published literature, we propose that the protocol should include four variables, namely 1) the type of fluid administered, 2) the rate of fluid administration, 3) the critical end points, and 4) the safety limits.

Conclusions

A protocol for routine fluid challenge is proposed with defined rules and based on the patient's response to the volumes infused. The technique allows for prompt correction of fluid deficits yet minimizes the risks of fluid overload.

Learning Objectives

On completion of this article, the reader should be able to: 1. Explain the signs of hypovolemia. 2. Describe how to administer a fluid challenge. 3. Use this information in a clinical setting.

### Personalised fluid resuscitation in the ICU: still a fluid concept? [^112JemNe]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Timing, amount of fluid, and infusion strategy

Resuscitation of patients in shock needs to be timely and adequate. The Surviving Sepsis Guidelines suggest that a fluid bolus of 30 ml/kg crystalloid be administered to septic patients with hypotension or elevated lactate levels within 3 h of the time of presentation. Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is perhaps the most common way intravenous fluids are administered in the ICU. Fluid boluses are usually administered to correct abnormal physiologic parameters, including but not limited to hypotension, tachycardia, oliguria, and increased lactate levels. Despite its widespread use, there are several important limitations and concerns regarding FBT in the acute care setting.

First, there is no universally accepted definition of what a fluid bolus is and how it should be administered, and what physiological effects clinicians expect as a result of a fluid bolus. This was illustrated in a recent survey amongst acute care physicians in Australia and New Zealand. This study showed that FBT is a poorly defined intervention with considerable variability in preferred fluid choice, volume given, and speed of delivery. In addition, intensive care and emergency medicine specialists showed a wide variation in their expected physiological responses to FBT. Similar wide variability between individuals and countries was found when the researchers expanded their study to 3138 practitioners from 30 countries. Another global inception cohort study, the "fluid challenges in intensive care" (FENICE) study, reached the same conclusions: the current practice and evaluation of FBT in critically ill patients are highly variable.

### A randomized trial of albumin infusion to prevent intradialytic hypotension in hospitalized hypoalbuminemic patients [^116XH4Hj]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a frequent complication of intermittent hemodialysis (IHD), occurring from 15 to 50% of ambulatory sessions, and is more frequent among hospitalized patients with hypoalbuminemia. IDH limits adequate fluid removal and increases the risk for vascular access thrombosis, early hemodialysis (HD) termination, and mortality. Albumin infusion before and during therapy has been used for treating IDH with the varying results. We evaluated the efficacy of albumin infusion in preventing IDH during IHD in hypoalbuminemic inpatients.

Methods

A randomized, crossover trial was performed in 65 AKI or ESKD patients with hypoalbuminemia (albumin < 3 g/dl) who required HD during hospitalization. Patients were randomized to receive 100 mL of either 0.9%sodium chloride or 25% albumin intravenously at the initiation of each dialysis. These two solutions were alternated for up to six sessions. Patients' vital signs and ultrafiltration removal rate were recorded every 15 to 30 min during dialysis. IDH was assessed by different definitions reported in the literature. All symptoms associated with a noted hypotensive event as well as interventions during the dialysis were recorded.

Results

Sixty-five patients were submitted to 249 sessions; the mean age was 58 ([Formula: see text]12), and 46 (70%) were male with a mean weight of 76 ([Formula: see text]18) kg. The presence of IDH was lower during albumin sessions based on all definitions. The hypotension risk was significantly decreased based on the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative definition; (15% with NS vs. 7% with albumin, p = 0.002). The lowest intradialytic SBP was significantly worse in patients who received 0.9% sodium chloride than albumin (NS 83 vs. albumin 90 mmHg, p = 0.035). Overall ultrafiltration rate was significantly higher in the albumin therapies [NS-8.25 ml/kg/h (-11.18 5.80) vs. 8.27 ml/kg/h (-12.22 to 5.53) with albumin, p = 0.011].

Conclusion

In hypoalbuminemic patients who need HD, albumin administration before the dialysis results in fewer episodes of hypotension and improves fluid removal. Albumin infusion may be of benefit to improve the safety of HD and achievement of fluid balance in these high-risk patients. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04522635.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^113KRqXV]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Overview of the Presentation

The three fluid and vasopressor questions identified by the Task Force as a whole are as follows:

1) What are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?
2) What is the optimal fluid for sepsis resuscitation?
3) What is the optimal approach to selection, dose titration, and escalation of vasopressor therapy?

The format for each of the three questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods. One question was assigned to each author for review and summary. The presentation of each question is followed by a critique of the existing evidence of what is currently known of the subject. Subsequently, each author presented what is not known regarding each question and the gaps in our current understanding of the subject. For each question, the suggested research questions are iterative and aim to address broad areas of uncertainty. Accordingly, clinical outcomes may need to be refined to not only determine mortality benefit but also inform stakeholders on relevant outcomes of interest, such as, quality of life, organ function, and resource utilization. Finally, each author concluded their overarching question by presenting a proposed list of research questions deemed worthy of further inquiry. This list of questions was purposefully intended to be exhaustive, and the authors acknowledge that they may not be answered in the coming decade but are necessary to describe so as to provide a roadmap for where research efforts should be directed.

Question 1: What Are Ideal Endpoints for Volume Resuscitation and How Should Volume Resuscitation Be Titrated?

What is known.

The rationale for fluid resuscitation is largely derived from multiple experimental and clinical studies. Fluid resuscitation increases cardiac output, at least at the early stages of sepsis. In addition, fluid resuscitation increases microvascular perfusion in patients with septic shock, and this is associated with improved organ function.

The impact of fluid resuscitation on outcome is less obvious and is mostly supported by experimental data. Large-scale interventional trials investigating goal-directed therapy did not directly address the amount, timing, or guiding clinical variables beyond central venous oxygenation (Sc 2). In preclinical models of sepsis, fluid administration prolongs survival time compared with no fluid resuscitation, even though long-term outcomes could not be evaluated from these types of studies. Specifically, out-of-hospital fluid administration during transport by paramedics is associated with an improved outcome in hypotensive patients (19), it has not been associated with a benefit, and it may even be associated with increased mortality, in normotensive patients.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^117H12Cz]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Although early fluid administration is beneficial to delayed fluid administration, the optimal amount of fluid required for an individual patient varies. "Optimal" would infer the quantity of fluid administered that restores perfusion to end organs while not worsening end-organ function. The Hour-1 bundles recommend initiating 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid to patients with suspected sepsis within 1 hour for hypotension or lactate level greater than or equal to 4 µmol/L. Although this is a strong recommendation, it is based upon a low quality of evidence, where the 30 mL/kg dose is derived from a statistical correlation between mortality and amount of fluid administered. Therefore, determining the optimal amount of fluid to be administered remains a critical issue through continued inquiry. Analysis of large databases suggest that there may be a U-shaped response curve, where limited amounts as well as large amounts of fluid administration are associated with worse outcomes. The best response was observed when fluid resuscitation was administered in volumes between 15 and 45 mL/kg, although this range is too wide to be applied readily in clinical practice. Further, data from over 50,000 patients demonstrated that delay in fluid administration was not associated with an increased risk of death. One potential explanation is "time zero" in these studies was defined as presentation to hospital and not time of sepsis recognition. Further, the benefits of fluid resuscitation may be dependent on the severity of illness in the continuum of sepsis and underlying comorbidities.

### Dopamine hydrochloride [^114KWXf7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Concentration (mcg/mL)

Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:

Example 1: for a 60 kg person at the recommended initial dose of 2 mcg/kg/minute using a 800 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/hour) = [2 (mcg/kg/minute) x 60 (kg) x 60 (minutes/hour)] = 9 (mL/hour)

800 (mcg/mL)

Example 2: for a 70 kg person at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/minute using a 1600 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Infusion Rate (mL/hour) = [5 (mcg/kg/minute) x 70 (kg) x 60 (minutes/hour)] = 13.13 (mL/hour)

1600 (mcg/mL)

2.3 Drug Incompatibilities

Dopamine HCl Injection is incompatible with the following products; therefore, avoid simultaneous administration (through the same infusion set):

- Sodium bicarbonate or other alkalinizing substances, because dopamine is inactivated in alkaline solution

- Blood, because of the risk of pseudoagglutination of red cells

- Iron salts

Do not add additional medications in the diluted infusion solution.

Correct hypovolemia, acidosis, and hypoxia prior to use. (2.1)
Administer in a large vein with an infusion pump preferably in an intensive care setting. (2.1)
Recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients is 2 to 5 mcg/kg/minute as a continuous intravenous infusion. Titrate in 5 to 10 mcg/kg/minute increments based on hemodynamic response and tolerability, up to not more than 50 mcg/kg/minute. (2.2)

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113R1fwi]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The fluid challenge is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of fluid responsiveness. The objective of this study was to describe the fluid challenge techniques reported in fluid responsiveness studies and to assess the difference in the proportion of 'responders', (PR) depending on the type of fluid, volume, duration of infusion and timing of assessment.

Methods

Searches of MEDLINE and Embase were performed for studies using the fluid challenge as a test of cardiac preload with a description of the technique, a reported definition of fluid responsiveness and PR. The primary outcome was the mean PR, depending on volume of fluid, type of fluids, rate of infusion and time of assessment.

Results

A total of 85 studies (3601 patients) were included in the analysis. The PR were 54.4% (95% CI 46.9–62.7) where < 500 mL was administered, 57.2% (95% CI 52.9–61.0) where 500 mL was administered and 60.5% (95% CI 35.9–79.2) where > 500 mL was administered (p = 0.71). The PR was not affected by type of fluid. The PR was similar among patients administered a fluid challenge for < 15 minutes (59.2%, 95% CI 54.2–64.1) and for 15–30 minutes (57.7%, 95% CI 52.4–62.4, p = 1). Where the infusion time was ≥ 30 minutes, there was a lower PR of 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54, p = 0.04). Response was assessed at the end of fluid challenge, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after the fluid challenge. The proportions of responders were 53.9%, 57.7% and 52.3%, respectively (p = 0.47).

Conclusions

The PR decreases with a long infusion time. A standard technique for fluid challenge is desirable.

### Prediction of arterial pressure increase after fluid challenge [^116LECHx]. BMC Anesthesiology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Fluid challenge did not improve arterial pressure in about one third of hypotensive critically ill patients. Cardiovascular and renal variables did not enable us to predict the individual response to volume administration.

### Hetastarch (hextend) [^1121xWVd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage for Acute Use in Plasma Volume Expansion

HEXTEND is administered by intravenous infusion only. Total dosage and rate of infusion depend upon the amount of blood or plasma lost and the resultant hemoconcentration as well as age, weight, and clinical condition of the patient.

Adults: The amount usually administered is 500 to 1000 mL. Doses of more than 1500 mL per day for the typical 70 kg patient (approximately 20 mL per kg of body weight) are usually not required although doses of isotonic solutions containing 6% hetastarch up to 1500 mL have been used during major surgery generally without a need for blood or blood products. Volumes in excess of 1500 mL per day have been used where severe blood loss has occurred although generally only in conjunction with the administration of blood and blood products (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).

Pediatric Patients: Adequate, well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of HEXTEND in pediatric patients have not been conducted (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS, Pediatric Use).

General Recommendations

Do not use plastic container in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

If administration is by pressure infusion, all air should be withdrawn or expelled from the bag through the medication port prior to infusion.

The safety and compatibility of other additives have not been established. This product contains calcium and should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same administration set because of the likelihood of coagulation (see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS).

The solution contains no bacteriostat or antimicrobial agent and is intended only for single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required, the unused portion should be discarded.

### Moderate IV fluid resuscitation is associated with decreased sepsis mortality [^113zjDpi]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Current research suggests equipoise between a tightly restrictive or more liberal resuscitation strategy for patients with sepsis but data is lacking on a wider range of resuscitative practices.

Findings: In this retrospective analysis of 190,682 ICU patients with sepsis and septic shock, we found that being resuscitated by a physician who on average uses a moderate amount of IV fluid on the first day of care is associated with reduced mortality (2.5% lower) compared with patients resuscitated with either a very low or very high volume of IV fluid.

Meaning: A moderate approach to IV fluid is associated with decreased sepsis mortality and should be tested in future randomized controlled trials.

Since IV hypotonic saline mixed with sodium bicarbonate was first administered during the 1832 London cholera pandemic, physicians have sought to use IV fluids to restore intravascular circulating volume, improve organ perfusion, and resuscitate critically ill patients. Fluid administration practices used to resuscitate patients with sepsis have evolved over time, with significant changes in clinical practice occurring over the last three decades. Following the publication of the Rivers trial in 2001, the apparent benefit of early goal-directed therapy made high-volume IV fluid resuscitation widely popular for patients with sepsis and septic shock. The evolution in the resuscitation culture from a relatively low-volume to a high-volume strategy was swift. Throughout the 2000s, it was not uncommon for patients with sepsis to receive more than 10 L of IV fluid within the first 24 hours of care. Not long thereafter observational studies associated positive fluid balances with increased rates of respiratory failure and mortality. In the early 2010s, with growing concern that high-volume resuscitation was causing harm, there was a reevaluation of what had become accepted dogma. Clinical uncertainty surrounding the optimal IV fluid resuscitation strategy lead to large practice variation between physicians and hospitals. This phenomena is observed both in sepsis and in a variety of medical conditions across specialties. Some physicians continued to employ high-volume fluid resuscitation while others adopted a more restrictive approach, giving less than the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's recommended 30 mL/kg fluid bolus. Two large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2022 and 2023 compared a restrictive vs. liberal IV fluid management strategy for patients with sepsis associated hypotension. Neither study demonstrated a benefit in mortality, use of vasopressors, or mechanical ventilation for either approach.

### Early goal-directed therapy: what do we do now? [^113yg4KL]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Does this mean we should go back to the era of 'do whatever you want'? No consensus exists among clinicians regarding optimal hemodynamic monitoring, and to date no method has been proven to be superior. Given the amount of fluids given prior to randomization in the ProCESS and ARISE trials, 'usual care' appears to now include aggressive, early fluid resuscitation with at least 20 mL/kg of crystalloid and rapid administration of appropriate antibiotics. Certainly, this reflects the impact of the original trial by Rivers and colleagues and the broad-based implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines and bundles. If this continues to define 'usual care', then perhaps it is no longer necessary to mandate specific protocols for resuscitation, as it appears that standard sepsis management has evolved to be consistent with published protocols. That would be good news indeed for patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^113icEQE]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric guidelines — fluid bolus in low-resource settings: For children without signs of fluid overload where advanced supportive and intensive care is not available, the panel recommends against bolus fluid administration in the first hour if hypotension is not present, and suggests administering up to 40 mL/kg in bolus fluid (10–20 mL/kg per bolus) over the first hour if hypotension is present; for the subset with septic shock and hypotension, the panel suggests cautious administration of fluid bolus therapy as a weak recommendation based on low quality of evidence. For this weak recommendation, hypotension can be defined as systolic blood pressure less than 50 mm Hg in children younger than 12 months old, less than 60 mm Hg in children 1 to 5 years old, and less than 70 mm Hg in children older than 5 years old, or by World Health Organization criteria of cold extremities with prolonged capillary refill greater than 3 seconds and weak, fast pulse; WHO recommends 10–20 mL/kg of isotonic crystalloid over 30–60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes if condition has not improved and there are no signs of fluid overload, cardiac failure, or neurologic deterioration. In a FEAST analysis of children with moderate hypotension, fluid bolus therapy was not beneficial or harmful compared with maintenance fluid only (RR of death = 1.48; 95% CI, 0.61–3.66; p = 0.41), while among children reclassified as meeting all three WHO shock criteria mortality was 48% in the bolus groups versus 20% in the control group (p = 0.07), a very small proportion of FEAST participants (only 72 [2.3%] with moderate hypotension and 65 [2%] meeting full WHO shock criteria).

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^114P8Wsu]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Shortly after administration, most patients respond to fluids in the form of improved blood pressure, but this proportion decreases rapidly over time. After initial fluid bolusing, the amount of fluid required to maintain goal blood pressure varies between patients based upon a number of factors, ranging from severity of dehydration to ongoing fluid losses to severity of illness to underlying comorbidities. Understanding when to continue volume loading and when to discontinue additional fluid administration is of critical importance, since excessive fluid administration appears to be detrimental, as suggested by the association between positive fluid balance and poor outcome in observational trials. A meta-analysis of nine randomized trials comparing "low" versus "high" volumes of resuscitation found no difference in outcome, suggesting that individualization of fluid therapy is desired. The duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids is determined by the amount of fluid administered, capillary leak, and hemodynamic adjustments (including volume adjustments between stressed and nonstressed volumes) resulting from the resolution of compensatory mechanisms initiated during hypovolemia. Very few studies have evaluated the impact of the duration of the hemodynamic effects of fluids in critically ill patients, and it seems that these effects may last less than 2 hours. Conceptually, fluid administration improves cardiac output and tissue perfusion. However, it is critical to note that fluid administration yields inconsistent effects in a cohort of patients. As such, there is increasing recognition of the need for individualizing care. Resuscitation by formula is not suitable for achieving endpoints of resuscitation across a heterogeneous group of patients, as varied needs would result in some patients receiving too much and others not enough fluids. Further, although the rationale for initiating fluid resuscitation is the correction of tissue malperfusion through an improvement in cardiac output, in practice, fluids are often administered in order to correct hypotension or oliguria, whereas indices assessing tissue perfusion, including cardiac output, are often not readily assessable.

Enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery — postoperative fluid management — intravenous fluids should be discontinued in the early postoperative period after recovery room discharge (strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B). To prevent excessive fluid administration, daily postoperative weight gain should be monitored and weight gain > 1 to 2 kg avoided, and it is advisable to measure fluid responsiveness before volume expansion because only 46% of patients are fluid responders when bolus intravenous fluids are given based on clinical signs of hypovolemia. Hypotension induced by epidural analgesia should be managed by reducing the epidural infusion rate and with small doses of vasopressors after ensuring that the patient is normovolemic.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fourth edition [^112a79zM]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Initial use of a restrictive volume replacement strategy is supported by a prospective randomised trial that analysed the consequences of an initial intra-hospital hypotensive resuscitation strategy in trauma patients with haemorrhagic shock. In this study, with nearly all of the 90 patients suffering from penetrating trauma, patients who had at least one documented in-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg were randomised to a target minimum mean arterial pressure of 50 mmHg or 65 mmHg. One major drawback to this study was that no statistically significant difference between the actual mean arterial pressure was observed between the two groups over the duration of the study (64.4 mmHg vs. 68.5 mmHg, P = 0.15). Although the authors could not demonstrate a survival difference for the two treatment strategies at day 30, 24 h postoperative death and coagulopathy were increased in the group with the higher target minimum pressure. The patients in this group received not only more i.v. fluids overall, but also more blood product transfusions. Another study that supports a restrictive volume replacement strategy was reported by Brown et al. In this study 1216 trauma patients with an ISS > 15 were included; 51% suffered from hypotension, defined as a systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP) < 90 mmHg. 68% of the patients received a volume load of > 500 mL crystalloid solution. The authors demonstrated that administration of > 500 mL pre-hospital crystalloid was associated with worse outcome in patients without pre-hospital hypotension but not in patients with hypotension. The administration of > 500 mL crystalloid was associated with a correction of hypotension. The authors suggested that pre-hospital volume resuscitation should be goal-directed based on the presence or absence of hypotension. Recently, Schreiber et al. assessed the feasibility and safety of controlled resuscitation (n = 97) in hypotensive trauma patients compared to standard resuscitation (n = 95). Patients were enrolled and randomised in the pre-hospital setting. Eligible patients had a pre-hospital systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mmHg. Controlled resuscitation patients received 250 mL fluid if no radial pulse or an SAP < 70 mmHg was present and additional 250 mL boluses to maintain a radial pulse or a systolic blood pressure ≥ 70 mmHg. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume administered during the study period was 1.0 l (1.5) in the controlled resuscitation group and 2.0 l (1.4) in the standard resuscitation group. ICU-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury and renal failure did not differ between the groups.

Figure 1 shows a patient with a target systolic BP of 90 experiencing BP reductions with tachycardia 3–4 hours after doses 5 and 6 of IL-2. These episodes responded promptly to a 500 mL bolus of saline.

Figure 1
Timing of the administration of the 4th and 5th IV boluses of IL-2 is plotted versus systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. This patient shows characteristic exacerbation of hypertension 3–4 hours after infusion responsive to fluid boluses.

Center B treats patients in the ICU in order to maintain a lower nurse to patient ratio and permit the use of vasopressors. Patients are given maintenance fluids of 10 ml/hour unless they have excessive nausea/vomiting or diarrhea, in which case it is raised to 30–50 ml/hour. Volume boluses are used as previously described for episodes of hypotension. If this does not reverse the hypotension, then patients are started on phenylephrine at 50 micrograms/minute (0.1–2.0 ug/kg/min), titrated as necessary to maintain BP, with a preset maximum dose level individualized per patient cardiac risk factors between doses. The phenylephrine must be tapered back to baseline of 50 micrograms/minute or less before another IL-2 dose is given. With subsequent IL-2 doses, up to 2 fluid boluses per 8 hours may be administered for hypotension if there are no signs of pulmonary compromise or excessive (> 5% baseline weight) fluid overload, but vasopressors are the mainstay of managing hypotension in this setting. The need for a 3rd bolus in 24 hours generally requires holding the next dose of IL-2. Some patients become refractory to phenylephrine and require dopamine or norepinephrine (Levophed™). Even with this regimen, patients usually gain 10–20 pounds of water weight during a 5 day course of treatment.

Intervention

Type and screen will be performed to provide donor-matched plasma for subjects randomized to intervention group. Initial resuscitation with plasma will be 10 mL/kg (700 mL in a typical 70 kg adult). Traditional doses of plasma, when used to correct coagulopathy, range from 10 mL/kg to 15 mL/kg. Plasma will be administered at a rate of 2 mL to 3 mL/kg/hour (140 mL to 210 mL/hour in a typical 70 kg adult). After the initial dose of plasma has been given, subsequent fluid resuscitation (crystalloid or colloid) will be given at the discretion of the treating clinician. For patients who proceed to the operating room during fluid resuscitation, the anesthesiology team will continue fluid administration per study protocol.

Control

Usual care using BC (Iso-Lyte) only will follow Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines. Controls will receive 30 mL/kg (2100 mL in a typical 70 kg adult) of crystalloids within the first 3 hours. Crystalloid administration may be terminated before the entire dose has been administered if patients show clinical improvement, or if the treating clinician has concerns about circulatory overload. After the initial dose of crystalloids has been given, subsequent fluid resuscitation (crystalloid or colloid) will be given at the discretion of the treating clinician.

Endpoints of resuscitation: Fluid resuscitation in both the intervention and the control arms will be titrated to serial reassessments of the patient's volume status at the discretion of the treating clinician. Serial laboratory examinations will be performed per standard of care in the ICU. Additional fluid support after the initial plasma or crystalloid bolus will be given at the discretion of the treating clinician. A research physician will be at bedside to follow patient resuscitation. Plasma administration may be terminated before the entire dose is administered if patients show clinical improvement, or if the treating clinician is concerned for circulatory overload.

### Assessing fluid resuscitation in adults with sepsis who are not mechanically ventilated: a systematic review of diagnostic test accuracy studies [^112ZCU98]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Fluid resuscitation is integral to the management of the hypovolaemic, acutely unwell patient, but assessing whether patients require intravenous fluid is complex as multiple factors can affect fluid balance. The process currently relies on recognising clinical features of hypovolaemia and hypervolaemia but these features are non-specific. While competence in fluid assessment is a training requirement for all grades of clinicians, preventable morbidity due to intravenous fluid mismanagement is commonly identified, with one in five patients suffering complications. An effective assessment tool must strike a balance that limits such harms without impacting upon or delaying the life-saving benefits of fluid resuscitation.

The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) intravenous fluid guidelinesfor the UK advocate fluid assessment using a combination of clinical features and bedside tests. Although there is no formal definition of the term "hypovolaemia", the guidelines list an approach to its identification. However, all but one of the suggested measures are non-specific and two, respiratory rate and the National Early Warning Score, do not reflect fluid status but simply identify acutely unwell patients. Of note, the NICE guideline development group stated that their recommendations were based on consensus opinion, extrapolated from systematic reviews within older guidelinesthat focused on acute illness rather than hypovolaemia. There are no equivalent guidelines from American or European healthcare bodies.

Fluid assessment is particularly challenging in sepsis as haemodynamic compromise is primarily caused by three different factors: vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, and cardiac dysfunction. Ensuring the dose of IV fluid is optimised is important as excess intravenous fluid has been shown to cause harm in patients with sepsis, – with further trials ongoing. The Surviving Sepsis guidelines advise a dose of fluid over the first 3 h equating to > 2 L in a 70-kg patient. Following this initial dose, they recommend additional fluid use is guided by frequent reassessment of hemodynamic status. However, they are unable to specify how this should be performed. Furthermore, they acknowledge that these recommendations are supported by a low quality of evidence.

Over the last two decades, studies and systematic reviews – have focused on the ability of fluid assessment tools to predict fluid responsiveness: a haemodynamic improvement following fluid bolus. It is a dynamic test, i.e. describes change over two measurements, in contrast to static tests that use a single measurement. The presence of fluid responsiveness can be estimated through indirect means such as performing a passive leg raisewhich increases cardiac venous return, or by observing changes in measurements during respiration.

### Pharmacological management of fluid overload [^11172Z4g]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Standard treatment practice for the hypotensive patient with poor tissue perfusion is rapid volume resuscitation; in some scenarios, such as septic shock, this is performed with targeted goal-directed endpoints within 6 h of presentation. As a result, patients often develop significant positive fluid accumulation, which has been associated with poor outcomes above certain thresholds.

Methods

The aim of the current paper is to provide guidance for active pharmacological fluid management in the patient with, or at risk for, clinically significant positive fluid balance from either resuscitation for hypovolaemic shock or acute decompensated heart failure.

Results

We develop rationale for pharmacological fluid management targets (prevention of worsening fluid accumulation, achievement of slow vs rapid net negative fluid balance) in the context of phases of critical illness provided in the earlier Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative 12 papers.

2.1	Administration Instructions

Correct Hypovolemia, Acidosis, and Hypoxia

Address hypovolemia, acidosis, and hypoxia before initiating Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection. If patient does not respond to therapy, suspect occult hypovolemia. Acidosis may reduce the effectiveness of dopamine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Administration

Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection is a premixed infusion solution that does not require dilution prior to intravenous administration. Administer Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection into a large vein [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] with the use of an infusion pump preferably in an intensive care setting.

Remove outer wrap (moisture and oxygen barrier) only when ready to administer the product. Discard product if outer wrap is damaged (e.g., tears or holes). Inspect Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the solution is clear to slightly yellow). Do not administer if the solution is darker than slightly yellow or the container is damaged.

Use higher concentration premixed solutions (e.g., 3200 mcg/mL or 1600 mcg/mL strengths) in patients requiring fluid restriction.

Discontinuation

When discontinuing Dopamine HCl in Dextrose Injection, gradually reduce the infusion rate while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage

The recommended starting dosage in adults and pediatric patients is 2 to 5 mcg/kg/minute as a continuous intravenous infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Titrate the infusion rate in 5 to 10 mcg/kg/minute increments based on hemodynamic response and tolerability, up to but not more than 50 mcg/kg/minute.

Infusion rates may be calculated using the following formula:

Example calculations for infusion rates are as follows:

Example 1: for a 60 kg person at the recommended initial dose of 2 mcg/kg/minute using a 1600 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

Example 2: for a 70 kg person at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/minute using a 3,200 mcg/mL concentration, the infusion rate would be as follows:

### Albumin infusion rate and plasma volume expansion: a randomized clinical trial in postoperative patients after major surgery [^115jrVkj]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Patients

A total of 70 patients were enrolled between the 18 June 2014 and the 22 November 2016, and 35 patients were assigned to each treatment. Prior to the second amendment, 1 patient that had given consent was not included due to an ongoing vasopressor therapy. For a CONSORT flowchart of patients, see Fig. 1. Two patients experienced a suspected allergic reaction following the administration of 125 I-human serum albumin and were not included in the study. One patient withdrew consent during the intervention. Plasma volume measurement was unsuccessful due to technical problems in 3 patients. A total of 33 patients receiving slow infusion and 31 patients receiving rapid infusion were included in the analysis. Pre-treatment characteristics are presented in Table 1. The two most common criteria for fluid administration were a positive passive leg raising test and an elevated arterial lactate. All patients with a positive passive leg raising test also had at least 1 additional objective criteria suggesting hypovolemia. A total of 4 patients received treatment with norepinephrine at inclusion, and in all cases, the dose was below 0.1 μg/kg/min. Baseline plasma volume was 46.9 ± 9.2 ml/kg and 47.7 ± 6.3 ml/kg in the slow and rapid groups, respectively (Fig. 2). This corresponded to a calculated blood volume of 73.1 ± 15.0 ml/kg and 72.9 ± 10.3 ml/kg in the slow and rapid groups, respectively.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^113d9FF3]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis early care — intravenous fluid and timing of vasopressors — We agree with delivering an intravenous (IV) fluid bolus during initial management of patients who have hypotension or findings of hypoperfusion absent signs of fluid overload. We do not support a prespecified volume or body mass–adjusted volume of fluid for all patients, though we recognize many patients benefit from 30 mL/kg of crystalloid; patient response may serve as the best indicator of the appropriateness of fluid resuscitation volume, rather than the delivery of a prespecified volume. We do not recognize a specific minimum fluid amount before starting vasopressor support, and vasopressor support may be coupled with plasma volume expansion in severe hypotension or life‑threatening hypoperfusion without requiring that a fluid administration threshold be reached prior to vasopressor initiation. We think serial examinations using more than one bedside tool to assess adequacy of resuscitation are best, with no one approach demonstrated as superior. We support using balanced crystalloid solutions as the primary resuscitation fluid in patients with sepsis, especially if volumes of more than 1 L are used, and note that infusions of saline solution can cause hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and may impair renal performance in commonly prescribed resuscitative doses.

### Intravenous fluids: should we go with the flow? [^117Cz2zH]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Sensitive monitoring should be used when prescribing intravenous fluids for volume resuscitation. The extent and duration of tissue hypoperfusion determine the severity of cellular damage, which should be kept to a minimum with timely volume substitution. Optimizing the filling status to normovolaemia may boost the resuscitation success. Macrocirculatory pressure values are not sensitive in this indication. While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines focus on these conventional pressure parameters, the guidelines from the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) on perioperative bleeding management recommend individualized care by monitoring the actual volume status and correcting hypovolaemia promptly if present. The motto is: 'give what is missing'. The credo of the ESA guidelines is to use management algorithms with predefined intervention triggers. Stop signals should help in avoiding hyper-resuscitation. The high-quality evidence-based S3 guidelines on volume therapy in adults have recently been prepared by 14 German scientific societies. Statements include, for example, repeated clinical inspection including turgor of the skin and mucosa. Adjunctive laboratory parameters such as central venous oxygen saturation, lactate, base excess and haematocrit should be considered. The S3 guidelines propose the use of flow-based and/or dynamic preload parameters for guiding volume therapy. Fluid challenges and/or the leg-raising test (autotransfusion) should be performed. The statement from the Co-ordination group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralized Procedures-Human informs healthcare professionals to consider applying individualized medicine and using sensitive monitoring to assess hypovolaemia. The authorities encourage a personalized goal-directed volume resuscitation technique.

### Fluid removal tolerance during the de-escalation phase: is preload unresponsiveness the best guiding candidate? [^116Jowv4]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Monnet et al. argue that the absence of preload responsiveness allows the safe initiation of fluid removal, while the apparition of fluid responsiveness during fluid removal is a red flag urging to stop it. Preload responsiveness was reported to predict the occurrence of hypotension during intermittent hemodialysis with a high UFnet rate of 10–15 mL/kg/h. To the best of our knowledge, it is not possible to predict the vascular refilling rate. If it may exceed 10 mL/kg/h in chronic hemodialysis patients, the combination of glycocalyx degradation, impaired lymphatic function, and interstitial space architectural modification in critically-ill patients probably lowers considerably this vascular refilling rate. We previously found that passive leg raising does not accurately predict cardiac index decrease nor hypotension following a fluid removal challenge of 500 mL UFnet over one hour in patients undergoing CRRT. We observed the same results with calibrated abdominal compression to test preload responsiveness in children before a diuretics-induced fluid removal of 5 mL/kg over 2 h. In our opinion, preload unresponsiveness better predicts the delay between the initiation of a UFnet at a higher rate rather than that of vascular refilling and the occurrence of hypovolemia. The extrapolation of preload responsiveness to guide fluid removal for resolving interstitial edema in patients without intravascular hypervolemia is questionable. In this situation, we believe that the adequacy between vascular refilling and fluid removal rates is the cornerstone of hemodynamic stability. Moreover, limiting fluid removal to patients with preload unresponsiveness may seriously limit the eligible population.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign 2021 — fluid bolus strategy beyond initial resuscitation: If fluid therapy beyond the initial 30 mL/kg administration is required, clinicians may use repeated small boluses guided by objective measures of stroke volume (SV) and/or cardiac output (CO). In post-cardiac surgery patients, fluid challenges of 4 mL/kg compared to 1 to 3 mL/kg increased sensitivity for detecting fluid responsiveness based on CO measurement. In resource-limited regions where CO or SV cannot be measured, a > 15% increase in pulse pressure during a passive leg-raise test for 60–90 seconds could indicate fluid responsiveness.

Fluid challenges (FCs) are one of the most commonly used therapies in critically ill patients and represent the cornerstone of hemodynamic management in intensive care units. There are clear benefits and harms from fluid therapy. Limited data on the indication, type, amount and rate of an FC in critically ill patients exist in the literature. The primary aim was to evaluate how physicians conduct FCs in terms of type, volume, and rate of given fluid; the secondary aim was to evaluate variables used to trigger an FC and to compare the proportion of patients receiving further fluid administration based on the response to the FC.

Methods

This was an observational study conducted in ICUs around the world. Each participating unit entered a maximum of 20 patients with one FC.

Results

2213 patients were enrolled and analyzed in the study. The median [interquartile range] amount of fluid given during an FC was 500 mL (500–1000). The median time was 24 min (40–60 min), and the median rate of FC was 1000 [500–1333] ml/h. The main indication for FC was hypotension in 1211 (59%, CI 57–61%). In 43% (CI 41–45%) of the cases no hemodynamic variable was used. Static markers of preload were used in 785 of 2213 cases (36%, CI 34–37%). Dynamic indices of preload responsiveness were used in 483 of 2213 cases (22%, CI 20–24%). No safety variable for the FC was used in 72% (CI 70–74%) of the cases. There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients who received further fluids after the FC between those with a positive, with an uncertain or with a negatively judged response.

Conclusions

The current practice and evaluation of FC in critically ill patients are highly variable. Prediction of fluid responsiveness is not used routinely, safety limits are rarely used, and information from previous failed FCs is not always taken into account.

### Physiological changes after fluid bolus therapy in sepsis: a systematic review of contemporary data [^113BRitX]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

All critically ill patients receive intravenous (IV) fluids, which are given to maintain physiological homeostasis, or as a vehicle for drug administration, or as direct therapeutic administration to correct perceived haemodynamic instability. In these situations, where there is a perceived reduction in venous return and cardiac output secondary to vasodilatation and/or hypovolaemia, using IV fluid to increase intravascular volume is believed to effectively compensate for these changes in vascular tone by increasing stroke volume in accordance with the Frank-Starling principle.

Several mechanisms for delivering IV fluids, both diagnostically and therapeutically under such circumstances, have been described. These include Weil's central venous pressure (CVP)-guided fluid challenge technique, the timed and rapid infusion methods favoured by Shoemaker and, more recently, techniques involving echocardiographic or ultrasonographic assessment of fluid responsiveness following low-volume IV infusion. However, the current standard of care in the management of septic, hypotensive, tachycardic and/or oliguric patients is fluid bolus therapy (FBT), where IV fluid is rapidly administered in discrete boluses. While the ideal fluid bolus would be a discrete volume of a specific fluid administered at a specified rate, accounting for individual patient features and with a defined aim (Figure 1), there is no current agreement regarding exactly what defines a fluid bolus. Moreover, although strong overall consensus regarding the importance of FBT exists, there appears to be little randomized controlled information on the magnitude and duration of its physiological effects, or on the direct positive impact of FBT on patient outcome in sepsis as an independent intervention.

### Challenges with using a weight-based approach to bolus fluid dosing in obese critically ill patients [^116wBYzg]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

At least 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid administration within the first 3 hours of resuscitation is suggested by the current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock. This commentary discusses the challenges with using a weight-based approach to bolus fluid dosing during the early phase of resuscitation of adult, obese patients. Based on the available literature, arguments can be made for the use of either ideal or adjusted body weight for weight-based fluid dosing, but there are concerns with fluid overload if using actual body weight to dose patients with more severe forms of obesity.

Stabilization and Resuscitation Strategy

Intravenous Fluids

Fluid resuscitation strategy is a clinical challenge in the early management of CS as it is often difficult to assess and can vary over time. In right‐sided heart failure, right atrial pressures and pulmonary artery wedge pressures are poor predictors of fluid response. 15, 35 Echocardiography can assess right‐sided heart volume status and rule out pericardial fluid collection. 15 The definitive method of volume status assessment and adequacy of resuscitation is right heart catheterization, which should be performed in conjunction with coronary angiography. If hypovolemia is present, conservative boluses of crystalloids (250–500 mL) are reasonable while the patient is being stabilized for cardiac catheterization.

Oxygenation and Ventilation

Continuous pulse oximetry should be used to monitor for respiratory compromise. Oxygen goals vary depending on patient comorbidities, but in the acute care setting blood oxygen saturations of > 90% are acceptable.

When non‐invasive forms of oxygenation and ventilation are inadequate, invasive ventilation is required. Low tidal volumes (5–7 mL/kg of ideal body weight) used in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome are considered lung protective and decrease the incidence of RVF from 60% to 25% in this cohort of patients. 36 Low tidal volumes optimize blood flow between the pulmonary and parenchymal vasculature. The decreased resistance in the pulmonary circuit lowers stress on the RV, compared with higher tidal volumes. Therefore, a low tidal volume strategy is recommended when mechanically ventilating patients in CS.

Vasopressor Support

Vasopressors (Table 2) should be titrated to a mean arterial pressure with a typical goal of > 65 mm Hg. Vasopressin has less pulmonary vasoconstriction than norepinephrine; and may be more beneficial as a first‐line vasopressor in patients with CS with acute RVF. 37 Pulmonary vasoactivity can be modified by inodilators, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors, or nitric oxide (Table 3). When using these agents invasive blood pressure monitoring is required as they can rapidly induce hypotension.

Summary of Systemic Vasopressors

Summary of Vasoactive Agents Within the Pulmonary Circuit

Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy

Acute kidney injury occurs in 13% to 28% in patients with CS, and 20% will require continuous renal replacement therapy. 1, 38, 39 Continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered with stage 2 kidney injury as defined by elevated serum creatinine (≥ 2× baseline) and urine output < 0.5 mL/kg per hour for ≥ 12 hours; or when life‐threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte, and acid‐base balance precipitates the need for dialysis. 40

Specific scores to predict the risk of haemorrhagic shock may be useful to provide a prompt and appropriate treatment; however, its usefulness is still not optimal. Paladino et al. analyzed the usefulness of the Shock Index (heart rate divided by systolic blood pressure) and found that this index may be useful in drawing attention to abnormal values, but that it is too insensitive to rule out disease and should not lower the suspicion of major injury. The TASH score (Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage) uses seven parameters (systolic blood pressure, haemoglobin (Hb), intra-abdominal fluid, complex long bone and/or pelvic fractures, heart rate, base excess and gender) to predict the probability of mass transfusion. Maegele et al. retrospectively analysed a dataset of severely multiply-injured patients from the German Trauma Registry to confirm the validity of the TASH score to predict the individual probability of massive transfusion and, therefore, ongoing life-threatening hemorrhage. The TASH score has recently been re-validated with 5,834 patients from the same registry.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^11747ysa]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

FOR EDITORIAL COMMENT, SEE

Fluid resuscitation is a central component of septic shock treatment. Excessive fluid administration causes hypervolemia and is associated with tissue edema, organ dysfunction, increased ICU length of stay, prolonged ventilator dependence, and higher mortality rates. Guidelines recommend crystalloid fluid administration of at least 30 mL/kg for sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion or septic shock and suggest that "fluid administration beyond initial resuscitation requires careful assessment of the likelihood that the patient remains fluid responsive". Robust evidence that supports this recommendation is lacking. Two-thirds of patients with septic shock demonstrate fluid overload on day 1, and fluid resuscitation often continues beyond the first day of care. However, only one-half of septic patients will be fluid responsive and potentially benefit from fluid administration. A propensity model analysis of 23,513 patients with sepsis demonstrated that day 1 fluid administration > 5 L was associated with significantly increased risk of death.

Take-home Points

Traditional methods of the assessment of fluid responsiveness (FR) such as vital signs, physical examination, and static measurements of circulatory pressure do not reliably correlate with FR. In contrast, dynamic measurement of stroke volume (SV) after an IV fluid bolus or passive leg raise (PLR) is a safe and feasible method of rapidly assessing the effectiveness of fluid-induced augmentation of SV and cardiac output (CO). This approach has been associated with reduced length of stay, fewer postoperative complications, and earlier return to regular diet in surgical patients.

A retrospective study of real-time, noninvasive bioreactance SV and cardiac performance measurements incorporated PLR to assess FR and guide resuscitation in patients with septic shock in an ICU. Bioreactance analyzes the relative phase shift of an oscillating current passing through the thoracic cavity. Dynamic SV-guided resuscitation was associated with decreased net fluid balance, reduced ICU length of stay, risk of mechanical ventilation, time on vasopressors, and risk of renal replacement therapy (RRT) initiation.

Given the uncertainty surrounding the benefits of dynamic measure-guided fluid resuscitation, we designed the Fluid Responsiveness Evaluation in Sepsis-associated Hypotension (FRESH) Trial (NCT02837731). The primary objective was to determine if SV-guided dynamic assessment could guide the amount of IV fluid administered to patients with septic shock.

### Hetastarch (hetastarch in sodium chloride) [^112PvuSy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage for Acute Use in Plasma Volume Expansion

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is administered by intravenous infusion only. Total dosage and rate of infusion depend upon the amount of blood or plasma lost and the resultant hemoconcentration.

2.1 Adults

The amount usually administered is 500 to 1000 mL. Doses of more than 1500 mL per day for the typical 70 kg patient (approximately 20 mL per kg of body weight) are usually not required. Higher doses have been reported in postoperative and trauma patients where severe blood loss has occurred [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

2.2 Leukapheresis

250 to 700 mL of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection with citrate anticoagulant is administered by aseptic addition to the input line of the centrifugation apparatus at a ratio of 1:8 to 1:13 to venous whole blood. The 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and citrate should be thoroughly mixed to assure effective anticoagulation of blood as it flows through the leukapheresis machine.

### Causes of death after fluid bolus resuscitation: new insights from FEAST [^116hyAjU]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

This sub-study of the FEAST study has provided unique insights into a critically important area of clinical medicine. Fluid resuscitation is under increasing scrutiny following the publication of a number of randomized controlled trials questioning the safety and efficacy of widely used resuscitation fluids. The importance of these findings make it imperative that clinicians carefully consider the type, dosing and rate of administration of resuscitation fluids and monitor their effects beyond the initial resuscitation period. Administration of resuscitation fluid requires as much thought and care as the administration of any other potentially lethal drug.

### Initial fluid resuscitation (30 mL / kg) in patients with septic shock: more or less? [^111VUNfM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) recommends rapid administration of 30 mL/kg crystalloid fluids for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L in patients with septic shock; however, there is limited evidence to support this recommendation. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and prognosis in patients with septic shock.

Methods

This was a multicenter prospective observational study of adult patients with septic shock who were admitted to four intensive care units (ICUs) in a total of three Jiangsu Province teaching hospitals over a 3-year span from May 8, 2018, to June 15, 2021. Each enrolled patients with septic shock was categorized into the low-volume (below 20 mL/kg fluid), medium-volume (20–30 mL/kg fluid) or high-volume (above 30 mL/kg fluid) fluid group according to the initial infusion dose given for fluid resuscitation. Various demographic attributes and other variables were collected from medical records. Logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curve analysis were used to determine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation doses and patient outcomes.

Measurements and Main Results

A total of 302 patients who presented to the ICU were diagnosed with septic shock. The 28-day mortality was highest in the high-volume group (48.3%) and lowest in the medium-volume group (26.3%, P < 0.05). Patients who completed 30 mL/kg initial fluid resuscitation in the first 1–2 h had the lowest 28-day mortality rate (22.8%, P < 0.05). Logistic regression showed that a medium initial fluid volume dose was an independent protective factor, with the odds ratio (OR) indicating significantly decreased mortality (OR, 0.507; 95% confidence interval, 0.310–0.828; P = 0.007; P < 0.05). A Kaplan-Meier curve stratified by initial fluid resuscitation dose was constructed for the probability of 28-day mortality. The medium-volume fluid group showed a significantly lower 28-day mortality rate than the high-volume group or the low-volume group (log-rank test, P = 0.0016).

Conclusion

In septic shock patients, an initial fluid resuscitation rate of 20–30 mL/kg within the first hour may be associated with reduced 28-day mortality; however, this result needs to be confirmed by further high-quality randomized controlled clinical trials.

Key End points

Secondary and exploratory end points were tested between the intervention and usual care arms (Table 3; e-Table 3). Fewer patients required RRT (5.1% vs 17.5%; p = 0.04) (Table 3), and fewer patients required mechanical ventilation in the intervention arm compared with the usual care arm (17.7% vs 34.1%; p = 0.04). ICU length of stay was similar in the two arms (2.9 days; intervention arm, 3.3 days [median, 2.09] vs usual care arm, 6.2 days [median, 2.90]; 95% CI, −6.7 to 0.9; p = 0.11). Additionally, among patients who required mechanical ventilation, there was no apparent difference in hours of ventilation (72.4 hour difference; intervention: 47.0 hours [median, 20.47 hours] vs usual care: 119.4 hours [median, 75.60 hours]; 95% CI, −154.1 to 9.2; p = 0.08). Notably, average hours of vasopressors were similar (intervention, 40.7 hours [median, 20.98 hours] vs usual care, 55.6 hours [median, 30.85 hours]; 95% CI, −52.5 to 22.7; p = 0.43) and change in serum creatinine level from baseline to 72 hours was similar (intervention, 0.13 ± 1.10 mg/dL [median, 0.00 mg/dL] vs usual care 0.04 ± 0.97 mg/dL [median, −0.11 mg/dL]). Intervention arm patients received less fluid over 72 hours. This difference in administered fluid remained significant when the preenrollment fluids were included. Intervention patients still exhibited a reduced positive fluid balance at 72 hours when the preenrollment fluids were included. Similar results in fluid balance were seen when patients on dialysis were included or excluded (e-Table 3). Hospital length of stay was comparable (1.2 day difference; intervention: 8.9 ± 8.1 days vs usual care: 10.2 ± 11.1 days; 95% CI, −4.70 to 2.25). More intervention patients were discharged home alive (63.9% compared with 43.9% usual care; 95% CI, 1.6% to 38.3%) (Table 3). There was no difference in overall 30-day mortality rate (6.3% difference intervention: 15.7% vs usual care: 22.0%; 95% CI, −21.2% to 8.6%) (e-Table 3) or 3P-MACE (6.2% difference; intervention: 6.0% vs usual care: 12.2%; 95% CI, −17.4% to 5.1%) (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, e-Table 3).

### How I manage a difficult intubation [^1173ABBm]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe hypotension during intubation can lead to cardiac arrest and death. Mechanisms that contribute to peri-intubation hypotension include vasodilation from induction medications, decreased sympathetic tone from sedation, and decreased venous return from increased intrathoracic pressure with positive pressure ventilation. We attempt to reverse pre-existing hypotension prior to intubation by administering blood products for hemorrhagic shock and intravenous fluids and vasopressors for distributive shock. Additionally, we commonly administer phenylephrine 100 mcg by IV push to treat peri-intubation hypotension. For patients at risk for hypotension during intubation, we use ketamine for induction and avoid other agents more likely to contribute to hypotension, understanding that data supporting this practice are incomplete. For patients without pre-procedure hypotension, whether prophylactically administering an intravenous fluid bolus or a vasopressor prior to induction prevents cardiovascular collapse remains the subject of ongoing research (NCT03026777). Currently, we do not routinely administer prophylactic fluids or vasopressors prior to induction in patients who are not hypotensive. Immediately after intubation, we set the mechanical ventilator to preserve ventilatory compensation for metabolic acidosis and avoid tidal volumes > 6 ml/kg of ideal body weight.

### Fluid response evaluation in sepsis hypotension and shock: a randomized clinical trial [^112MxsEr]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

The volume of administered fluids at 72 hours was significantly less in the patients in the intervention arm than the usual care arm (e-Table 3). Separation between arms for 72-hour fluid balance and total amount of administered IV fluids were maintained even when preenrollment fluid was included in the analysis. Consistent with current guideline recommendations, patients received 2 to 3 L of IV fluids before randomization in both arms. These results indicate that PLR-guided protocol instructions during the first 72 hours of care accounted for the observed differences in fluid balance between arms.

Despite reduced fluid administration in the PLR-guided and vasopressor in the intervention arm, higher rates of new renal failure or serum creatinine elevation were not observed. There was a reduced need for RRT or invasive mechanical ventilation in the intervention arm. ICU length of stay was shorter by an average of 2.91 days in the intervention arm, although not statistically significant. Volume overload and elevated renal and central venous pressures increase renal interstitial edema, which in turn results in reduced filtration pressure, which translates into a fall in glomerular filtration. Similarly, excessive lung water is associated with worsening intrapulmonary shunting, progression to respiratory failure that necessitates intubation, potentially prolonged periods of mechanical ventilation, and death.

FRESH provides a prospective validation of earlier observations that optimal real-time physiologic monitoring and individualized assessment of FR may inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes. In an earlier single center nonrandomized pre-post intervention assessment, a larger fluid difference (3.59 L) was reported between patients who were treated with PLR-guided strategy and usual care. We found a smaller difference in the mITT analysis of the FRESH study, which may be due to more restrictive fluid management in the usual care arm. However, the concordance in a lower risk for renal and respiratory failure between the two arms in the two studies suggests a consistent and strong clinical effect. Additionally, studies of dynamic measure-guided fluid administration in surgical patients have reported comparable overall fluid administration between dynamic measure guided treatment arms and usual care arms with greater preservation of renal and respiratory function in the intervention arm. These data suggest that resuscitation guided by dynamic assessments of cardiac performance is effective at the optimization of circulatory hemodynamics through the reduction of unnecessary and potentially harmful fluid and vasopressor administration.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^112YrZZS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Rivers and coll. demonstrated that a strategy of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) decreases the in-hospital mortality of patients who are taken to the emergency department in septic shock.

An organized approach to the haemodynamic support to sepsis includes use of fluid resuscitation, vasopressor therapy and inotropic therapy.

Patients with severe sepsis and septic shock may present ineffective perfusion. Poor tissues perfusion may cause a global tissue hypoxia, often associated to an elevated serum lactate level. A serum lactate value greater than 4 mmol/L (36 mg/dL) is correlated with poorer outcomes, even if hypotension is not yet present. Fluid resuscitation should be started as early as possible.

According to the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines during the first 6 hrs of resuscitation, the goals of initial resuscitation of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion should include all of the following as one part of a treatment protocol:

- Central venous pressure 8 to 12 mm Hg

- Mean arterial pressure (MAP) > 65 mm Hg

- Urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/hr

- Central venous (superior vena cava) or mixed venous oxygen saturation > 70% or > 65%, respectively

The early hypovolemic phase of sepsis must be always treated by providing appropriate high volume resuscitation.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend that fluid challenge in patients with suspected hypovolemia be started with equal to or greater than 1000 mL of crystalloids or 300–500 mL of colloids over 30 mins. More rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion.

As the volume of distribution is less large for colloids than for crystalloids, resuscitation with colloids requires less fluid to achieve the same goals. A colloid equivalent is an acceptable alternative to crystalloid. Crystalloids are less expensive.

### A double-blind randomised feasibility trial of angiotensin-2 in cardiac surgery [^115MfxCZ]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients were randomly allocated to the angiotensin‐2 or noradrenaline group. The randomisation sequence was computer generated, random and stratified by site and emergency surgery status in blocks of two, four and six. The sequence was generated and uploaded to a REDCap database by a research affiliate not otherwise involved in the study. Patients were allocated to a study group just before surgery. Participants, the clinicians caring for them and researchers assessing outcomes were blinded to group allocation. To ensure adequate blinding, the drug was constituted and provided to clinicians in equipotent vasopressor concentrations in bags of 250 mL or 500 mL sodium chloride solution by a member of research staff not involved in outcome assessment. A relative potency of angiotensin‐2: noradrenaline of 10:1 was assumed based on current literature. As such, the drug was constituted as 40 mcg.ml ‐1 noradrenaline or 4 mcg.ml ‐1 angiotensin‐2.

Study drug infusion was connected after induction of anaesthesia and before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass. Conduct of other aspects of anaesthesia and ICU care was not formally standardised and left to the discretion of the treating clinicians. The study drug was started if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was < 70 mmHg and other causes of hypotension such as hypovolaemia or inadequate inotropy were excluded (Fig. 1). The study drug was administered centrally and started at a weight‐based infusion rate in millilitres per hour using an infusion table and a flow chart was given to clinicians (online Supporting Information, Appendix S1). Starting rates were equivalent to 0.02 mcg.kg ‐1.min ‐1 noradrenaline or 2 ng.kg ‐1.min ‐1 angiotensin‐2. A range of rates from 0.01–0.4 mcg.kg ‐1.min ‐1 and 1–40 ng.kg ‐1.min ‐1, respectively, were allowed. Study drug could be titrated up or down to maintain the target pressure range every 5 min or paused at any time at clinician discretion (e.g. in response to a need to reduce blood pressure before or during aortic cannulation). Other open label vasoactive and inotropic drugs were allowed at clinician discretion. The study drug was continued during cardiopulmonary bypass aiming at a target oxygen delivery (DO 2) of 280 ml.min.m 2 or cardiac index of > 2.2 l.min.m 2. The protocol was continued postoperatively for up to 48 h or until discharge from ICU, whichever occurred sooner.

### Early use of norepinephrine in high-risk patients undergoing major abdominal surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^117L33Nr]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Intervention

In both groups, the aim of the intervention was to avoid a MAP under 65 mmHg or 70 mmHg in a patient with a medical history of hypertension (Supplemental Digital Content material S1).

In the norepinephrine group, continuous intravenous injection of norepinephrine (0.016 mg · mL -1) was started before the induction of general anesthesia with a continuous infusion of 0.48 mg · h -1. Titration was performed to achieve the previously defined target blood pressure values.

In the ephedrine group, intraoperative hypotension was managed with iterative boluses of ephedrine (3 mg · mL -1) to a maximum dose of 30 mg. If the goal was not achieved, continuous intravenous injection of norepinephrine (0.016 mg · mL −1) was started.

Standard Procedures and Definition of Intraoperative Hypotension

Anesthesia induction was proceeded with a combination of a hypnotic drug (etomidate or propofol), an opioid drug (sufentanil), and a curare (cisatracrium, atracurium, or rocuronium). The choice of hypnotic drug was at the discretion of the physician. The combination of a regional anesthesia (abdominal wall block or perimedullar anesthesia) was allowed. Blood pressure was monitored every 2 min. After induction, all patients were continuously monitored for stroke volume and arterial blood pressure using a radial artery line. Intraoperative fluid was managed with the administration of 250 mL lactated Ringer's solution when the change in stroke volume was greater than 15%, with an increase in stroke volume defining the responders. After orotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation was started with a tidal volume of 8 mL · kg -1 ideal body weight, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H 2 O, a respiratory rate to obtain an end-tidal carbon dioxide between 35 and 40 mmHg, and an oxygen fraction to target oxygen saturation greater than 95%. The depth of anesthesia was monitored with a Bispectral Index (Medtronic, USA) target between 40 and 60. No preinduction fluid infusion was planned in the study. The induction period was defined as the time from the start of induction to the surgical incision.

Postinduction hypotension was defined as a MAP under 65 mmHg or under 70 mmHg in a patient with a medical history of hypertension.

An episode of MAP higher than 160 mmHg was considered as a hypertensive episode and declared as an adverse event and notified in the data collection.

### Liberal versus restrictive intravenous fluid therapy for early septic shock: rationale for a Randomized trial [^115VYKm6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Prompt intravenous fluid therapy is a fundamental treatment for patients with septic shock. However, the optimal approach for administering intravenous fluid in septic shock resuscitation is unknown. Two competing strategies are emerging: a liberal fluids approach, consisting of a larger volume of initial fluid (50 to 75 mL/kg [4 to 6 L in an 80-kg adult] during the first 6 hours) and later use of vasopressors, versus a restrictive fluids approach, consisting of a smaller volume of initial fluid (≤ 30 mL/kg [≤ 2 to 3 L]), with earlier reliance on vasopressor infusions to maintain blood pressure and perfusion. Early fluid therapy may enhance or maintain tissue perfusion by increasing venous return and cardiac output. However, fluid administration may also have deleterious effects by causing edema within vital organs, leading to organ dysfunction and impairment of oxygen delivery. Conversely, a restrictive fluids approach primarily relies on vasopressors to reverse hypotension and maintain perfusion while limiting the administration of fluid. Both strategies have some evidence to support their use but lack robust data to confirm the benefit of one strategy over the other, creating clinical and scientific equipoise. As part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury Network, we designed a randomized clinical trial to compare the liberal and restrictive fluids strategies, the Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressor Early Resuscitation in Sepsis trial. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature on approaches to early fluid resuscitation in adults with septic shock and outline the rationale for the upcoming trial.

Optimal resuscitation of hypotensive trauma patients has not been defined. This trial was performed to assess the feasibility and safety of controlled resuscitation (CR) versus standard resuscitation (SR) in hypotensive trauma patients.

Methods

Patients were enrolled and randomized in the out-of-hospital setting. Nineteen emergency medical services (EMS) systems in the Resuscitation Outcome Consortium participated. Eligible patients had an out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 90 mm Hg or lower. CR patients received 250 mL of fluid if they had no radial pulse or an SBP lower than 70 mm Hg and additional 250-mL boluses to maintain a radial pulse or an SBP of 70 mm Hg or greater. The SR group patients received 2 L initially and additional fluid as needed to maintain an SBP of 110 mm Hg or greater. The crystalloid protocol was maintained until hemorrhage control or 2 hours after hospital arrival.

Results

A total of 192 patients were randomized (97 CR and 95 SR). The CR and SR groups were similar at baseline. The mean (SD) crystalloid volume administered during the study period was 1.0 L (1.5) in the CR group and 2.0 L (1.4) in the SR group, a difference of 1.0 L (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6–1.4). Intensive care unit-free days, ventilator-free days, renal injury, and renal failure did not differ between the groups. At 24 hours after admission, there were 5 deaths (5%) in the CR group and 14 (15%) in the SR group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.12–1.26). Among patients with blunt trauma, 24-hour mortality was 3% (CR) and 18% (SR) with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.17 (0.03–0.92). There was no difference among patients with penetrating trauma (9% vs. 9%; adjusted odds ratio, 1.93; 95% CI, 0.19–19.17).

Conclusion

CR is achievable in out-of-hospital and hospital settings and may offer an early survival advantage in blunt trauma. A large-scale, Phase III trial to examine its effects on survival and other clinical outcomes is warranted.

Introduction

Intravascular volume optimization has been found to improve critical care outcomes. There is a delicate balance between hypovolemia (and hypo-perfusion) and volume overload, which is equally associated with complications. Contemporary hemodynamic monitoring aims to offer providers with objective guidance as to their patient's actual volume status.

### Hemodynamic effect of different doses of fluids for a fluid challenge: a quasi-randomized controlled study [^111WTioe]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The objectives of this study are to determine what is the minimal volume required to perform an effective fluid challenge and to investigate how different doses of IV fluids in an fluid challenge affect the changes in cardiac output and the proportion of responders and nonresponders.

Design

Quasi-randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Cardiothoracic ICU, tertiary university hospital.

Patients

Eighty postcardiac surgery patients.

Intervention

IV infusion of 1, 2, 3, or 4mL/Kg (body weight) of crystalloid over 5 minutes.

Measurements and Main Results

Mean systemic filling pressure measured using the transient stop-flow arm arterial-venous equilibrium pressure, arterial and central venous pressure, cardiac output (LiDCOplus; LiDCO, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and heart rate. The groups were well matched with respect to demographic and baseline physiologic variables. The proportion of responders increased from 20% in the group of 1mL/kg to 65% in the group of 4mL/kg (p = 0.04). The predicted minimal volume required for an fluid challenge was between 321 and 509mL. Only 4mL/Kg increases transient stop-flow arm arterial-venous equilibrium pressure beyond the limits of precision and was significantly associated with a positive response (odds ratio, 7.73; 95% CI, 1.78–31.04).

Conclusion

The doses of fluids used for an fluid challenge modify the proportions of responders in postoperative patients. A dose of 4mL/Kg increases transient stop-flow arm arterial-venous equilibrium pressure and reliably detects responders and nonresponders.

### Fluid resuscitation: history, physiology, and modern fluid resuscitation strategies [^116Fp5Ly]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Intravenous (IV) fluids are among the most common interventions performed in the emergency department. They are at times lifesaving, but if used recklessly can be harmful. Given their ubiquity, it is important to understand the history, physiology, and current strategies that govern the use of IV fluids during the resuscitation of the critically ill.

### Rational fluid management in today's ICU practice [^1122v1JW]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical value of goal-directed fluid administration has also been demonstrated in other clinical settings and long-term beneficial effects in patients undergoing high-risk procedures have been suggested. Limiting the total amounts of crystalloid infused was associated with decreased complications after major surgery in two groups that were randomized to a low rate or a high rate of crystalloid maintenance, suggesting that a fluid restrictive strategy in conjunction with goal-directed therapy might be beneficial. Not all data are supportive. In an earlier study by Gattinoni and colleagues, no difference in mortality in the ICU and at 6 months was detected in 762 critically ill patients randomized to three different hemodynamic goals (normal cardiac index, cardiac index > 4.5 l/minute/m 2, or normal mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥ 70%). A recent trial studying the effects of goal-directed intraoperative fluid therapy using esophageal Doppler monitoring failed to show a beneficial effect and actually found adverse effects in the intervention group. One should note that this study did not show a difference in the amount of fluid (colloid or crystalloid) administered to both groups. Results of a randomized trial investigating mortality in 3,141 children with severe febrile illness and impaired perfusion in sub-Saharan Africa surprisingly showed higher mortality at 48 hours and at 4 weeks in the group that did not receive any fluid boluses compared with two groups resuscitated with albumin or saline. These results challenge our understanding of the potential benefits of early fluid administration in septic shock and certainly merit further study in other relevant patient groups. However, since this study was performed in a resource-poor environment with limited intensive care and monitoring capabilities, conclusions are probably not directly translatable to clinical practice in other settings.

### Will this hemodynamically unstable patient respond to a bolus of intravenous fluids? [^114d5Mec]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Fluid overload occurring as a consequence of overly aggressive fluid resuscitation may adversely affect outcome in hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients. Therefore, following the initial fluid resuscitation, it is important to identify which patients will benefit from further fluid administration.

Objective

To identify predictors of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with signs of inadequate organ perfusion.

Data Sources and Study Selection

Search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (1966 to June 2016) and reference lists from retrieved articles, previous reviews, and physical examination textbooks for studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of tests to predict fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adult patients who were defined as having refractory hypotension, signs of organ hypoperfusion, or both. Fluid responsiveness was defined as an increase in cardiac output following intravenous fluid administration.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently abstracted data (sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios [LRs]) and assessed methodological quality. A bivariate mixed-effects binary regression model was used to pool the sensitivities, specificities, and LRs across studies.

Results

A total of 50 studies (N = 2260 patients) were analyzed. In all studies, indices were measured before assessment of fluid responsiveness. The mean prevalence of fluid responsiveness was 50% (95% CI, 42%-56%). Findings on physical examination were not predictive of fluid responsiveness with LRs and 95% CIs for each finding crossing 1.0. A low central venous pressure (CVP) (mean threshold < 8 mm Hg) was associated with fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 2.6 [95% CI, 1.4–4.6]; pooled specificity, 76%), but a CVP greater than the threshold made fluid responsiveness less likely (negative LR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.39–0.65]; pooled sensitivity, 62%). Respiratory variation in vena cava diameter measured by ultrasound (distensibility index > 15%) predicted fluid responsiveness in a subgroup of patients without spontaneous respiratory efforts (positive LR, 5.3 [95% CI, 1.1–27]; pooled specificity, 85%). Patients with less vena cava distensibility were not as likely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.08–0.87]; pooled sensitivity, 77%). Augmentation of cardiac output or related parameters following passive leg raising predicted fluid responsiveness (positive LR, 11 [95% CI, 7.6–17]; pooled specificity, 92%). Conversely, the lack of an increase in cardiac output with passive leg raising identified patients unlikely to be fluid responsive (negative LR, 0.13 [95% CI, 0.07–0.22]; pooled sensitivity, 88%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Passive leg raising followed by measurement of cardiac output or related parameters may be the most useful test for predicting fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable adults. The usefulness of respiratory variation in the vena cava requires confirmatory studies.

### Liver trauma: WSES 2020 guidelines [^11582dMN]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Definitions

In adult patients, hemodynamic instability is considered the condition in which admission systolic blood pressure is < 90 mmHg with clinical evidence of hemorrhagic shock with skin vasoconstriction (cool, clammy, decreased capillary refill), altered level of consciousness and/or shortness of breath, or > 90 mmHg but requiring bolus infusions/transfusions and/or vasopressor drugs and/or admission base excess (BE) > -5 mmol/l or transfusion requirement of at least > 4 units of packed red blood cells within the first 8 h. Transient responder patients (adult and pediatric) are those showing an initial response to adequate fluid resuscitation, but then subsequent signs of ongoing blood loss and perfusion deficits. These patients have an initial response to therapy but do not reach sufficient stabilization to undergo endovascular procedures or NOM.

In pediatric patients, hemodynamic stability is considered a systolic blood pressure of 70 mmHg plus twice the child's age in years. An acceptable hemodynamic status in children is considered a positive response to fluid resuscitation: 2 boluses of 20 mL/kg of crystalloid replacement should be administered before blood replacement leading to heart rate reduction, cleared sensorium, return of peripheral pulses, normal skin color, increase in blood pressure and urinary output, and an increase in warmth of the skin in the extremities. Clinical judgment however is fundamental in evaluating pediatric patients.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^115KUzaA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Ongoing fluid administration — assessment‑driven resuscitation for suspected sepsis specifies that fluid administration after an initial bolus should be based on serial assessments of the patient and response to therapy. No singular assessment approach is superior, and we recommend using multiple assessments at multiple time intervals; if using a quantitative resuscitation approach, we recommend dynamic measures over static measures. Up to 50% of patients with septic shock fail to increase cardiac output in response to fluid administration and, when fluid loading does increase cardiac output, the response is often transient; all patients with ongoing hypotension or elevated lactate levels after initial fluid resuscitation need repeated hemodynamic assessment. Because no specific method of hemodynamic assessment is clearly superior in altering survival, we present 2 approaches — a clinical evaluation with basic techniques widely available in emergency care settings and a quantitative evaluation using more advanced assessment methods — and both are reasonable for monitoring and serial assessment; using either method, sepsis assessment should iteratively use multiple parameters to guide therapy. Patients who improve with the initial bolus of fluid are candidates for subsequent fluid boluses using aliquots such as 500 to 1,000 mL, followed by repeat serial clinical examinations to evaluate response and volume overload.

### Evaluation of a novel closed-loop fluid-administration system based on dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness: an in silico simulation study [^1154odgq]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Phase 1: Basic evaluation of the controller in hemorrhage scenarios

The first phase evaluated the basic efficacy of the controller and its ability to manage fluids during hemorrhage scenarios. The simulator was run on one PC with vital signs (HR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, CO, and PPV) being recorded over the network by a separate PC running the LIR algorithm. Interventions (in the form of fluid boluses) were communicated back to the simulator over the network. Three simulation scenarios were run during this phase: (a) mild hemorrhage of 500 mL over a 1.5-hour period; (b) moderate hemorrhage of 1,500 mL over a 1.5-hour period, and (c) massive hemorrhage of 2,000 mL over a 20-minute period. Patient height, weight, baseline HR, and baseline SBP/DBP were randomized within preset ranges (Table 2) In each scenario, bleeding began 30 minutes after the start of the simulation, and the scenario ran for 2.5 hours before finishing. For each scenario, two management groups were tested; 20 trials were performed with no hemodynamic management (to demonstrate the effects of the simulated hemorrhage scenarios on hemodynamic parameters), and 20 additional trials received crystalloid infusions managed by the LIR algorithm. Both groups received a steady infusion rate of 200 ml/hr of crystalloid.

### Effect of slower vs faster intravenous fluid bolus rates on mortality in critically ill patients: the BaSICS randomized clinical trial [^1179yqbr]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Slower intravenous fluid infusion rates could reduce the formation of tissue edema and organ dysfunction in critically ill patients; however, there are no data to support different infusion rates during fluid challenges for important outcomes such as mortality.

Objective

To determine the effect of a slower infusion rate vs control infusion rate on 90-day survival in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Unblinded randomized factorial clinical trial in 75 ICUs in Brazil, involving 11 052 patients requiring at least 1 fluid challenge and with 1 risk factor for worse outcomes were randomized from May 29, 2017, to March 2, 2020. Follow-up was concluded on October 29, 2020. Patients were randomized to 2 different infusion rates (reported in this article) and 2 different fluid types (balanced fluids or saline, reported separately).

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive fluid challenges at 2 different infusion rates; 5538 to the slower rate (333 mL/h) and 5514 to the control group (999 mL/h). Patients were also randomized to receive balanced solution or 0.9% saline using a factorial design.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary end point was 90-day survival.

Results

Of all randomized patients, 10 520 (95.2%) were analyzed (mean age, 61.1 years [SD, 17.0 years]; 44.2% were women) after excluding duplicates and consent withdrawals. Patients assigned to the slower rate received a mean of 1162 mL on the first day vs 1252 mL for the control group. By day 90, 1406 of 5276 patients (26.6%) in the slower rate group had died vs 1414 of 5244 (27.0%) in the control group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.96–1.11; p = 0.46). There was no significant interaction between fluid type and infusion rate (P = 0.98).

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients in the intensive care unit requiring fluid challenges, infusing at a slower rate compared with a faster rate did not reduce 90-day mortality. These findings do not support the use of a slower infusion rate.

Enhanced recovery colorectal surgery — intraoperative fluid physiology and neuraxial hypotension management indicate that insensible fluid losses do not exceed 1 mL/kg/h, and a maintenance infusion of 1.5–2 mL/kg/h of balanced crystalloid solution is sufficient during major abdominal surgery. Crystalloid or colloid preloading does not prevent hypotension induced by neuraxial blockade; in these patients, hypotension should be treated with vasopressors after ensuring normovolemia, and a low dose of vasopressors, not intravenous fluids, restores colonic perfusion in normovolemic hypotensive patients after epidural blockade.

### What is the impact of the fluid challenge technique on diagnosis of fluid responsiveness? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115DCjtC]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of infusion

The time of infusion was < 15 minutes in 24 studies (27.3%), between 15 and 29 minutes in 26 studies (29.5%), and ≥ 30 minutes in 29 studies (33%). Nine studies (10.2%) did not report duration of infusion. Where the fluid challenge was administered for < 15 minutes, between 15 and 29 minutes, and > 30 minutes, the proportions of patients deemed to be fluid responders were 59.2% (95% CI 54.2–64.1), 57.7% (95% CI 52.4–62.4), and 49.9% (95% CI 45.6–54) respectively. The duration of the fluid infusion affects the proportion of fluid responders [F (2,73) = 3.63, p = 0.03] (Fig. 2). The PR to a fluid challenge given in ≥ 30 minutes was lower than the PR when the fluid challenge was given in < 15 minutes (p = 0.045). The proportion of patients responding to a fluid challenge that was administered in < 15 minutes and between 15 and 30 minutes was similar (p = 1.0).

Fig. 2
Comparison of the proportion of responders (%) by duration of the infusion used for the fluid challenge. Planned contrast analysis revealed a significant difference between the third group (≥ 30 minutes) and the other two groups

Timing of assessment

The assessment of response to a fluid challenge was at the point of administration (n = 50 [58.1%]), between 1 and 10 minutes (n = 31 [36.8%]), or > 10 minutes (n = 5 [5.8%]) after completion of the fluid challenge. Where fluid responsiveness was assessed at the point of administration, between 1 and 10 minutes, and > 10 minutes after completion of the fluid challenge, 53.9% (95% CI 49.8–57.7), 57.7% (95% CI 52.9–62.7), and 52.3% (95% CI 32–90.5) of patients had a positive response, respectively. The time of assessment of fluid response did not affect the PR [F (2,80) = 0.76, p = 0.47] (Fig. 3).

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112mCgMV]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Primary adrenal insufficiency — acute adrenal crisis management includes immediate fluids and stress-dose glucocorticoids: rapid infusion of 1000 mL isotonic saline within the first hour or 5% glucose in isotonic saline, followed by continuous iv isotonic saline guided by individual patient needs; hydrocortisone 100 mg iv immediately followed by hydrocortisone 200 mg/d as a continuous infusion for 24 h, reduced to hydrocortisone 100 mg/d the following day. In children, give a rapid bolus of normal saline (0.9%) 20 mL/kg, which can be repeated up to a total of 60 mL/kg within 1 h for shock, and hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m^2 bolus followed by hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m^2/d divided q 6 h. For hypoglycemia, use dextrose 0.5–1 g/kg of dextrose or 2–4 mL/kg of D25W (maximum single dose 25 g) infused slowly at rate of 2 to 3 mL/min; alternatively, 5–10 mL/kg of D10W for children < 12 y old, with cardiac monitoring and rapid tapering and switch to oral regimen depending on clinical state.

### Choice of fluids in critically ill patients [^1161kCQ7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Summary statements:

Adequate preoperative preparation for elective major abdominal surgery should not induce a fluid deficit exceeding 2.5% of body weight.
Most studies regarding fluid administration in the perioperative setting are limited to early therapy.
Intraoperative/postoperative rehydration of elective cases should be performed with a balanced salt solution. Although this may be accompanied by an increase in circulating cytokines no clinically deleterious effect has been observed.
Colloids may be administered in elective surgery cases if required- there is no evidence of increased risk in this patient population and there is evidence of better gastrointestinal microcirculatory blood flow and tissue oxygen tension.
Adding vasopressor therapy to fluid administration remains controversial - while it likely decreases the amount of fluid administered it may also decrease end organ perfusion.
The principles guiding fluid administration in sepsis should also guide perioperative fluid administration in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery.
The crystalloid chosen for patients after urgent abdominal surgery should be determined individually, based on patient condition at the time of ICU arrival.

Trauma

Recent years have seen some interesting changes in fluid management of trauma patients. Although severe bleeding is the lead cause of death in trauma patients, the European guidelines for management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma strongly recommend restricting volume replacement during initial trauma resuscitation. This recommendation is based on data showing not only the feasibility of this approach but also its advantages in term of both process (e.g. hospital length of stay) and outcomes (e.g. survival).

For many years treatment with colloids was considered particularly efficacious in trauma patients. This concept was based on the assumption that the vascular endothelium remains intact after trauma (contrary to septic shock). Early experimental data supported this assumption, showing that resuscitation with HES 130/0.4 was superior to lactated Ringer. In humans, an exploratory study of patients monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter showed similar hemodynamic outcomes with a lower volume of colloids than crystalloids. However, subgroup analyses of trauma patients included in the RCTs comparing colloids and crystalloids have since failed to confirm this assumption with regards to wither mortality or transfusion requirements. In patients with TBI, mortality was actually higher with albumin than with saline, probably due to the greater increase in intracranial pressure observed during administration of albumin. The European guidelines for management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma therefore recommend isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for initial resuscitation of hypotensive bleeding trauma patients.

### Dosing fluids in early septic shock [^116epiR4]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Early IV fluid administration remains one of the modern pillars of sepsis treatment; however, questions regarding amount, type, rate, mechanism of action, and even the benefits of fluid remain unanswered. Administering the optimal fluid volume is important, because overzealous fluid resuscitation can precipitate multiorgan failure, prolong mechanical ventilation, and worsen patient outcomes. After the initial resuscitation, further fluid administration should be determined by individual patient factors and measures of fluid responsiveness. This review describes various static and dynamic measures that are used to assess fluid responsiveness and summarizes the evidence addressing these metrics. Subsequently, we outline a practical approach to the evaluation of fluid responsiveness in early septic shock and explore further areas crucial to ongoing research examining this topic.

### State-of-the-art management of the acutely unwell child [^112jEu6h]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. A global epidemiology study estimated the prevalence of paediatric sepsis at 8.2%, with the most common underlying causes being respiratory (40%) and bloodstream (19%). Despite evidence that hospital sepsis deaths occur within the first 24–72 h of admission, and the availability of guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign since 2004, morbidity and mortality remains high. The new 2020 Surviving Sepsis campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis‐associated organ dysfunction in children provide guidance on fluids and vasoactive medications. Fluid recommendations differ based on the availability of paediatric intensive care. For systems with paediatric intensive care, 40–60 ml.kg ‐1 in bolus fluid (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) are suggested over the first hour, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output, with continuous re‐assessment. Should signs of fluid overload (hepatomegaly, pulmonary congestion) develop at any stage, this should be discontinued. In settings without paediatric intensive care, it is advised that maintenance fluids be started but no boluses given if the infant/child is not hypotensive. If hypotension is present, up to 40 ml.kg ‐1 (10–20 ml.kg ‐1 per bolus) over the first hour should be titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output (and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop). Maitland et al. conducted a RCT in a low‐resource African setting that showed bolus fluid in the first hour of resuscitation increased mortality compared with maintenance fluids. Further analysis of the study concluded that, in this setting, the incidence of children presenting with severe febrile illness and fulfilling the World Health Organization definition for shock or hypotension was low. However, even in the children who met those criteria, there was a trend towards increased mortality, suggesting fluid management should be less focused on bolus and more on ensuring maintenance in a resource‐limited setting. The guidelines recommend fluid resuscitation be with balanced/buffered crystalloids rather than 0.9% saline solution in the first 72 h of admission for sepsis, based on observational studies which showed a reduction in mortality in children (OR 0.79; 95%CI 0.65–0.95). In children with septic shock, adrenaline or noradrenaline are advocated as first‐line vasoactive medications rather than dopamine, although dopamine may be substituted if these are not available. This guidance change follows the publication of two small studies. Ramaswamy et al. found adrenaline superior to dopamine in reversing fluid‐refractory hypotensive cold shock within the first hour of resuscitation (41% vs. 13%, OR 4.8; 95%CI 1.3–17.2) and Ventura et al. reported peripheral dopamine to be associated with increased mortality compared with peripheral/intraosseous adrenaline in children with fluid‐refractory septic shock. Vasoactive medications can be administered safely via peripheral or intraosseous access whilst central venous access is sought.

### Vasopressin administration facilitates fluid removal during hemodialysis [^113zEwSr]. Kidney International (2007). Low credibility.

Inadequate secretion of vasopressin during fluid removal by hemodialysis may contribute to the cardiovascular instability that complicates this therapy and administration of exogenous hormone, by supporting arterial pressure, may facilitate volume removal. To test this, we measured plasma vasopressin in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during hemodialysis and found that despite significant fluid removal, plasma vasopressin concentration did not increase. We further found that ESRD did not alter the endogenous removal rate of plasma vasopressin and that plasma hormone is not dialyzed. Finally, in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in 22 hypertensive patients, we examined the effect of a constant infusion of a non-pressor dose of vasopressin on the arterial pressure response during a hemodialysis in which the target fluid loss was increased by 0.5 kg over the baseline prescription. We found that arterial pressure was more stable in the patients receiving vasopressin and that while only one patient (9%) in the vasopressin group had a symptomatic hypotensive episode, 64% of the patients receiving placebo had such an episode (P = 0.024). Moreover, increased fluid removal was achieved only in the vasopressin group (520 ± 90 mL vs 64 ± 130 ml, P = 0.01). Thus, administration of non-pressor doses of vasopressin to hypertensive subjects improves cardiovascular stability during hemodialysis and allows increased removal of excess extracellular fluid. Inadequate vasopressin secretion during hemodialysis-induced fluid removal is a likely contributor to the intradialytic hypotension that limits fluid removal.

### A presedation fluid bolus does not decrease the incidence of propofol-induced hypotension in pediatric patients [^111XLegy]. Hospital Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Propofol is commonly used in pediatric sedation, which may cause hypotension during induction. Our goal was to determine the effect of a preinduction 20-mL/kg isotonic fluid bolus on propofol-induced hypotension, assess clinical signs of hypoperfusion during hypotension, and evaluate for age-related propofol dosing differences.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study was conducted at Children's Hospital of Illinois. Patients were children 6 to 60 months of age who needed sedation for MRI or auditory brainstem-evoked response testing. The treatment group received a preinduction 20-mL/kg isotonic saline bolus before procedure initiation. Patients were continuously monitored via cardiorespiratory monitor with pulse oximetry and end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements. Cardiovascular indices and clinical signs of hypoperfusion were compared between groups, and propofol dosing differences were compared between age groups.

Results

One hundred twenty-six patients were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 52) or control (n = 74) conditions. Twelve patients in the treatment group and 14 patients in the control group experienced postinduction hypotension, as defined by the Pediatric Advanced Life Support guidelines. One patient in each group was given volume resuscitation when blood pressure did not improve after a reduction in the propofol infusion rate. No hypotensive patients had physical signs of hypoperfusion, and patients ≤ 1 year of age needed significantly more propofol.

Conclusions

A 20-mL/kg preinduction isotonic saline bolus does not prevent propofol-induced hypotension. No clinical signs of hypoperfusion were noted with induced hypotension, and infants ≤ 12 months old need significantly more propofol per kilogram for procedures.

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^113WhivW]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric septic shock care — fluid therapy specifies that up to 40 to 60 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg) in bolus fluid (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) should be administered over the first hour for the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, titrated to clinical markers of cardiac output and discontinued if signs of fluid overload develop. In the absence of intensive care availability, a decreased fluid bolus of up to 40 mL/kg (in 10 to 20 mL/kg aliquots) over the first hour should be considered, and in the absence of both hypotension and intensive care availability, maintenance fluids should be administered instead of bolus fluids. For the initial resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or another sepsis-associated organ dysfunction, balanced/buffered crystalloids, rather than 0.9% saline, should be used; albumin should not be used, and starches should not be used in the acute resuscitation of children and infants with septic shock or other sepsis associated organ dysfunction. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign review included three randomized controlled trials of different volume resuscitation strategies for 316 children in advanced care settings and found no difference in mortality between the restrictive and liberal fluid resuscitation groups; the suggestion of "up to 40 milliliters per kilogram (mL/kg)" was included for low-resource settings based on FEAST, and the World Health Organization recommends isotonic crystalloid over 30 to 60 minutes, followed by an additional 10 mL/kg over 30 minutes.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^1118qHgZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

What is not known — gaps in our understanding — directions for future research.

1) Are there individual patient populations in which saline should be avoided entirely? Testing types of fluids in subgroups of patients to detect the likelihood of adverse effects would be useful.
2) Are there differences between buffered solutions? Is lactated Ringers superior to acetated/gluconated buffered solution or vice versa?
3) What are the implications of acetate and gluconate contained in some balanced solutions? In cardiac surgery patients, an acetate-based balanced solution had similar hemodynamic effects compared with lactated ringers. However, significant infusion of acetate may contribute to vasoplegia and myocardial dysfunction in patients with kidney dysfunction.
4) Recent data suggest that maintenance fluids and fluids used in diluting drugs may provide significant amount of chloride and have a major impact on fluid balance. Data suggest that selecting sodium/chloride poor maintenance fluids may improve fluid balance and chloride load in postoperative patients, but data in septic patients are still lacking. As such, should chloride containing solutions (including balanced solutions) be minimized or entirely avoided? Notably, this question is especially pertinent given recent instances of supply chain interruption, resulting in shortages of critical fluids and necessitating therapeutic substitutions at the individual patient level.
5) Are the beneficial renal outcomes associated with buffered solutions compared with saline due to the reduction in chloride content? In other words, is chloride toxic in itself, so that toxicity occurs even in absence of obvious hyperchloremia/acidosis (in which condition chloride-free solutions should be favored and saline-based dilution of drugs should be avoided whenever possible) or is it deviation of chloride/pH that generates the toxicity of high volumes of NaCl 0.9% (in which context closer monitoring of these variables may limit the toxicity)? Can lactated sodium solutions serve as a substitute for saline to minimize renal injury?
6) Is albumin superior to buffered crystalloid solutions? If used, when should albumin be administered? Ideally, this comparison of albumin with balanced crystalloid solutions would include subgroups of patients of particular interest (chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis).
7) Should albumin be initiated in an attempt to correct hypoalbuminemia or as a volume replacement fluid? Given the colloidal qualities of albumin, would albumin be of greater benefit in cases of severe shock, necessitating greater amounts of fluid resuscitation? Or should it be used to correct hypoalbuminemia? If there is a benefit to albumin administration as a fluid resuscitation therapy, where does it provide the greatest benefit in light of its cost?
8) What is the optimal concentration of the albumin solution (4–5% or 20%)? Studies of albumin have evaluated various concentrations of albumin. Contingent on its proposed mechanism of benefit in fluid resuscitation (correction of hypoalbuminemia vs intravascular fluid expansion), studies comparing the various albumin concentrations are necessary.
9) Should severity of sepsis play a role in determining which fluid to use for resuscitation? In the continuum of sepsis and septic shock, would patients specifically with more severe forms of shock benefit from a combination approach of crystalloids and colloids to fluid resuscitation?
10) Does resource setting play a role in determining the efficacy of which fluid is chosen? Studies outlined above were performed in resource-intensive environments. Considering data demonstrating that outcomes to fluid resuscitation are disparate between resource-intensive environments and resource-limited environments, it is possible that the type of fluid might also impact outcomes, understanding that fluid choices will likely be significantly more limited in resource \-constrained locations and in the face of unpredictable supply.

### Management of acute pancreatitis in the pediatric population: a clinical report from the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition pancreas committee [^115xeyXw]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric acute pancreatitis — fluid administration rate: Adult studies report that the group receiving the highest volume, > 4 L, had an increased rate of persistent organ failure, and that aggressive fluids (approximately 5 L) were associated with increased severity of disease and local complications. Adult guidance cited includes the American College of Gastroenterology recommending an initial rate of 250 to 500 mL/h in addition to boluses if hypotension or tachycardia is present and using BUN to direct therapy; Awais et al advises 3 to 4 L in the first 24 hours (not to exceed 4 L) with an initial 1 L bolus followed by 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1 for the first 24 to 48 hours; and Nasr recommends 1 to 2 L boluses initially and 150 to 300 mL/h for maintenance, with 2 mL · kg −1 · h −1 if the patient responds to initial resuscitation, otherwise 3 mL · kg −1 · h −1. Pediatric data include one study involving 201 patients in which early IV fluid (< 48 hours) plus aggressive fluids (> 1.5–2 times maintenance in the first 24 hours) decreased LOS and severe disease and aggressive IV fluids did not adversely affect outcomes; the adult literature summary suggests boluses of 250 to 1000 mL initially and up to 3 to 4 L fluids within first 24 hours. Recommendation 2ai states that children with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis should be provided 1.5 to 2 times maintenance IV fluids with monitoring of urine output over the next 24 to 48 hours, with 22/24 = 92% agreement (Strongly agree = 12; agree = 10; neutral = 2; disagree = 0; strongly disagree = 0).

### Effect of initial infusion rates of fluid resuscitation on outcomes in patients with septic shock: a historical cohort study [^1139DgbN]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Septic shock refers to sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction. It is prevalent and is associated with a high rate of mortality. It is characterized by systemic vasodilation and increased vascular permeability. These changes result in impaired microcirculatory blood flow and reduced tissue perfusion. The fluid resuscitation for septic shock can restore perfusion before the onset of irreversible tissue damage and prevent cardiovascular collapse and death, and, hence, lower mortality. Therefore, appropriate fluid resuscitation within the first 3 h of shock state is strongly recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines as the cornerstone of septic shock treatment.

The challenge remains to identify the optimal fluid resuscitation strategy. While the standard of practice is the use of boluses of intravascular (IV) fluid for resuscitation, a few trials have shown increased mortality with fluid resuscitation. Also, three recent multi-center randomized controlled trials and a follow-up meta-analysis showed that early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) bundles in comparison with usual care were not associated with improved outcomes in septic shock. Additionally, fluid boluses could lead to a positive fluid balance and excess fluid in the interstitial space, resulting in tissue edema, decreased oxygen delivery, and increased mortality.

These controversies surrounding the optimal strategies of initial bolus-fluid administration during septic shock resuscitation make searching for the optimal dose, type, and rate of fluid resuscitation in septic shock a research priority. The current guidelines recommend at least 30 ml/kg of intravenous crystalloid fluid to be given within the first 3 h of resuscitation, but the influence may be different based on the time to attainment of this target in fluid resuscitation. So the goal of this study is to examine the relationship between initial fluid resuscitation rate and septic shock resolution in septic shock patients.

### Hyponatraemia despite isotonic maintenance fluid therapy: a time series intervention study [^115XvUUQ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary exposure

Two distinct study groups were formed based on exposure to hypotonic or isotonic maintenance solution. Hypotonic maintenance fluid (defined as 40 mmol/L sodium chloride and 20 mmol/L potassium chloride in 5% glucose solution) was used during the first period (9 June 2010 to 15 October 2013). Isotonic solution (defined as 140 mmol/L sodium chloride and 20 mmol/L potassium chloride in 5% glucose solution) was used during the second period (16 October 2013 to 17 December 2017). During both periods, the amount of intravenous maintenance fluid followed the Holliday-Segar formula and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition recommendations. During the entire study period, full maintenance rates for a 24-hour period were calculated as follows: bodyweight ≤ 10 kg 100 mL/kg/24 hours, 10 to ≤ 20 kg 1000 mL+50×(weight (kg)−10) mL/24 hours, > 20 kg, 1500 mL+20×(weight (kg)−20) mL/24 hours.

The study was blinded to the exact timing of blood samples and rates of infusion, but typically, children admitted for elective surgery started intravenous maintenance fluid treatment before surgery, with blood gas analyses postoperatively according to perceived clinical needs. The intraoperative fluid composition, the timing of fluid therapy and the practice of blood gas testing all remained unaltered throughout the study period, but on an individual level, the study was not able to differentiate between preoperative, perioperative and postoperative sodium values. No cases were excluded from analysis, and group assignment was based strictly on the cut-off date. In other words, the exposure in this study was based on an intention-to-treat policy, from which clinicians were free to deviate as deemed clinically appropriate. For example, the amount and composition of maintenance fluid could be individualised in rare cases of known renal failure and electrolyte disturbance. The scope of surgical care did not differ significantly during the study period (online supplemental figure 1).

Primary outcome and independent variables

The primary outcome was sodium concentration and prevalence of hyponatraemia and hypernatraemia. Sodium concentrations were retrieved from the hard drive of the two blood gas measurement machines (ABL 800, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark) used during the study period. Hyponatraemia was defined as sodium concentration < 135 mmol/L and hypernatraemia as > 145 mmol/L. Patient-level information on age and sex was derived from each patient's personal identification number.

Effect of fluid resuscitation volume (mL/kg × 3 h) on hospital mortality in septic patients and sepsis-induced hypoperfusion subgroup analyses

Adjusted models include APACHE-II score, age, sex, Charlson index, vasopressor use, antibiotic initiation time, lactate, and BNP

Fluid resuscitation volume and 30-day mortality, 1‑year mortality

In the hypotensive subgroup, the 30-day mortality rate was 24.7% and the 1-year mortality rate was 29.1%. Similar to the in-hospital mortality, Additional file 1: Fig. S2 shows that there is an S-shaped association between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 30-day mortality rate in septic patients. On the other hand, Additional file 1: Fig. S3 demonstrates a U-shaped correlation between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 30-day mortality rate in the hypotensive subgroup. In the unadjusted Cox model, resuscitation volumes above 15 mL/kg or below 10 mL/kg were all associated with a higher likelihood 30-day mortality rate. In the multivariable Cox models, resuscitation volumes below 10 mL/kg (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.88) and above 20 mL/kg (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.31 to 8.15) continued to show correlations with the 30-day mortality rate in both septic patients and the hypotensive subgroup (HR 2.31, 95% CI 1.07 to 5.32 and HR 3.26, 95% CI 1.32 to 8.43, respectively). However, resuscitation between 15 and 20 mL/kg did not have a statistically significant association with the 30-day mortality rate (Table 4). The relationship between the volume of early fluid resuscitation and the 1-year mortality rate is shown in Additional file 1: Fig. S4 and summarized in Additional file 1: Table S3. The results closely align with those observed for the 30-day mortality rate.

### Does infusion of colloid influence the occurrence of postoperative nausea and vomiting after elective surgery in women? [^112KLgtw]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The impact of the type of fluid on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is not well defined. In this study we investigated the effects of colloids or crystalloids on PONV when given in addition to a background minimal crystalloid infusion in a female population of surgical patients.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-blind study included 115 women undergoing gynecological or breast surgery who were randomly allocated to receive hydroxyethyl starch (HES) 130/0.4 or normal saline in addition to a fixed background infusion of 5% dextrose in 0.45% saline at a flow rate of 0.5 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1). A bolus of 500 mL of the study fluid (HES or normal saline) was infused before the induction of anesthesia, followed by a continuous infusion of 1 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1) adjustable according to hemodynamic needs. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of PONV during the 24 h postoperative period. Secondary end points were the need for antiemetic rescue therapy, incidence of hypotensive episodes, pain scores, and need for additional analgesia.

Results

Nausea occurred in 11 of 56 patients who received HES and in 11 of 58 patients who received saline (P > 0.05). There were no differences between groups in the incidence of vomiting. There were no differences between the groups regarding antiemetic rescue therapy, hypotensive episodes, pain scores, or need for opioids.

Conclusions

In surgical procedures with minimal blood loss and minimal fluid shifts, the type of fluid replacement administered (colloid vs 0.9% normal saline) has minimal effect on the incidence of PONV.

### Resuscitation with early adrenaline infusion for children with septic shock: a randomized pilot trial [^113VF8fK]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this multicenter open label randomized pilot trial of children presenting with early septic shock to ED, a sepsis resuscitation algorithm incorporating early initiation of adrenaline infusion after 20 mL/kg fluid bolus was associated with significantly more and earlier inotrope use, and less fluid volume load during the first 24 hours after randomization as compared with standard SSC resuscitation with 40–60 mL/kg fluid. The intervention did not lead to more or longer PICU admissions. The consent rate was 100% among families approached for consent, and consent-to-continue was used in over 80% of cases given the time constraints associated with the intervention. However, only 69% of eligible patients were enrolled, and the recruitment rate was 1.2 per month at the largest study site.

Founded on concerns about high mortality associated with delayed sepsis resuscitation, previous pediatric sepsis guidelines have emphasized the importance of rapid delivery of 40–60 mL/kg fluid bolus during initial resuscitation. The FEAST study demonstrated a 45% (95% CI, 13–86%) relative mortality risk increase associated with any 20 to 40 mL/kg bolus compared with no bolus. Contrary to septic adults, where the recent Conservative versus Liberal Approach to Fluid Therapy of Septic Shock in Intensive Care (CLASSIC) and Crystalloid Liberal or Vasopressors Early Resuscitation in Sepsis (CLOVERS) trials showed that a restrictive compared to a liberal fluid resuscitation regimen had similar outcomes, no comparable data are available for children, and controversy surrounding optimal fluid volume persists. Although the 2020 pediatric SSC recommendations emphasize that in settings where no intensive care support is available, fluid boluses should be avoided in the absence of hypotension, the guidelines otherwise still recommend 40–60 mL/kg fluids.

### Prospective, randomized trial comparing fluids and dobutamine optimization of oxygen delivery in high-risk surgical patients [^113xz2fP]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Management

The patients were randomized with the use of sealed envelopes (blocks of 10 patients) to either the volume group or the dobutamine group. To induce and maintain anesthesia the following drugs were used: midazolam, 0.05–0.10 mg/kg; etomidate, 0.3 mg/kg; sufentanil, 1 μg/kg (maintenance, 0.01 μg/kg/minute); atracurium, 0.5 mg/kg (maintenance, 0–10 μg/kg/minute); and isoflurane. The therapeutic goals were the same in both groups: maintenance of DO 2 I > 600 ml/minute/m 2, MAP between 70 and 110 mmHg, PAOP between 12 and 16 mmHg, hematocrit > 30%, arterial oxygen saturation > 94%, and urinary output > 0.5 ml/kg/hour.

The patients randomly selected for the volume group were treated with fluids according to the treatment algorithm (Figure 1). The patients randomized to the dobutamine group received the first fluid cycle during 60–90 minutes followed by increasing doses of dobutamine, beginning with 3 μg/kg/minute, until the goal was reached. The patient should receive a new fluid cycle if the PAOP decreased for less than 12 mmHg or if there was a strong clinical suspicion of hypovolemia.

The heart rate, rhythm and MAP were carefully monitored and the dose of dobutamine was decreased or interrupted in the case of hypotension (MAP < 70 mmHg) and/or in the presence of signs of myocardial ischemia (depressed ST segment or inexplicable hypotension or tachycardia). The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores were calculated after admission to the ICU. The C-reactive protein serum level (nephelometry) was evaluated after surgery as a marker of inflammation. The dobutamine infusion was maintained for 24 hours in the postoperative period and then was slowly reduced until complete interruption. The mechanical ventilation and weaning were performed according to the ICU routine. Fentanyl and midazolam were used for sedation and analgesia.

### 6% hetastarch in 0.9% sodium chloride [^114xtNEc]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Dosage for Acute Use in Plasma Volume Expansion

6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection is administered by intravenous infusion only. Total dosage and rate of infusion depend upon the amount of blood or plasma lost and the resultant hemoconcentration.

2.1 Adults

The amount usually administered is 500 to 1000 mL. Doses of more than 1500 mL per day for the typical 70 kg patient (approximately 20 mL per kg of body weight) are usually not required. Higher doses have been reported in postoperative and trauma patients where severe blood loss has occurred [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5)].

2.2 Leukapheresis

250 to 700 mL of 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection with citrate anticoagulant is administered by aseptic addition to the input line of the centrifugation apparatus at a ratio of 1:8 to 1:13 to venous whole blood. The 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection and citrate should be thoroughly mixed to assure effective anticoagulation of blood as it flows through the leukapheresis machine.

2.3 Direction for use for 6% Hetastarch in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection

Do not use plastic container in series connection. If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

### Effect of crystalloid solution co-loading infusion rate on the dose requirements of prophylactic phenylephrine for preventing hypotension following combined spinal-epidural anesthesia for cesarean delivery [^1175s73m]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Study protocol

No premedication was administered. Upon arrival in the operating room, intravenous access was established in the patient's left upper limb vein, and standard monitoring, including non-invasive blood pressure measurement, electrocardiogram recording, and pulse oximetry, was applied. After a brief rest period, baseline values for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were calculated by averaging three consecutive measurements taken at three-minute intervals. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive either 10 mL/kg/h or 20 mL/kg/h of warmed Lactated Ringer's solution at a temperature of 37°C, using a computer-generated randomized sequence using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States). The infusion rates were determined based on our established clinical protocol, whereby a standard volume of 750–1500 mL of Lactated Ringer's solution was routinely administered during cesarean delivery. Then the randomized sequence was concealed in numbered opaque envelopes, opened sequentially, enrolling one patient at a time. An anesthesia assistant aware of the patients' grouping, adjusted the infusion rate at either 10 mL/kg/h or 20 mL/kg/h based on patient allocation but did not further participate in patient care or data collection. Anesthesia was administered, and data collected by three anesthetists (XM Zhang, J Qian, and L Liu) who were blinded to patient grouping.

Combined spinal-epidural anesthesia was completed using a needle-through-needle technique at the estimated L3–4 vertebral interspace under local anesthesia with 5 mL 2% lidocaine, while the patient was positioned on their left side. After confirming clear cerebrospinal fluid flow, 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine and 5 µg of sufentanil were injected intrathecally over 15 s. An epidural catheter was then inserted approximately 3–4 cm into the epidural space, and the patient's position was adjusted to supine with a slight tilt (approximately 15 degrees) using a wedge under the right buttock. The catheter was gently aspirated and observed for the presence of blood or CSF and was then flushed with 3 mL saline. The prepared solution was administered via infusion pump at a pre-determined rate based on patient grouping. To maintain blinding, the infusion pump surface was covered by an opaque paper.

### WSES / GAIS / WSIS / SIS-E / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^111iJcqW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently the new guidelines of Surviving Sepsis Campaign have been published. Below a brief summary of what is pertinent to NSTIs is reported.
As soon as possible after diagnosing sepsis (organ dysfunctions) associated with a NSTI, administer a 1-L bolus of a balanced crystalloid solution over 30 min. In hypotensive patients or those with an elevated serum lactate level additional fluid should be administered to achieve 30 ml/kg of initial volume resuscitation. This should be administered within 3 h.
In patients who do not achieve a MAP ≥ 65 mmHg with initial volume resuscitation within one hour, start a norepinephrine infusion and titrate as needed. This can initially be administered through a peripheral IV while central venous access is being obtained.
Simultaneously, administer within 1-h broad spectrum antimicrobial agent(s) to cover potential pathogens.
If the norepinephrine infusion increases to ≥ 15 mg/min, add low dose vasopressin at infusion rate of 0.03 U/min. Do not increase this dose of vasopressin.
Start low dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg q 6 h) in patients requiring ongoing high doses of norepinephrine and vasopressin to achieve MAP ≥ 65 mmHg.
Additional fluid resuscitation (beyond the initial 30 ml/kg) will likely be needed but should be based on the assessment that the patient will be fluid responsive.
Patients with impaired cardiac function should inotropic agent started. Dobutamine is the preferred agent but will cause hypotension in hypovolemic patients.

New agents to treat NSTIs

Reltecimod (previously known as AB103 or p2TA), a peptide derived from the T-cell receptor CD28, modulates the host immune response by targeting the co-stimulatory pathway, which is essential for the induction of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines. Consequently, reltecimod has demonstrated beneficial effects against different bacterial infections such as NSTIs.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of single dose reltecimod (0.5 mg/kg) administered within 6 h of NSTI diagnosis was recently published. Reltecimod was associated with improved resolution of organ dysfunction and hospital discharge status. Further studies are warranted to establish the real efficacy in clinical practice.

Initial resuscitation — timing, volume, and assessment approach: Sepsis and septic shock are medical emergencies, and "we recommend that treatment and resuscitation begin immediately" (Best practice statement). For patients with sepsis induced hypoperfusion or septic shock, "we suggest that at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloid fluid should be given within the first 3 hours of resuscitation" (Weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). For adults with sepsis or septic shock, "we suggest using dynamic measures to guide fluid resuscitation over physical examination or static parameters alone" (Weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), with dynamic parameters including response to a passive leg raise or a fluid bolus using stroke volume (SV), stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), or echocardiography. A retrospective analysis "showed that failure to receive 30 mL/kg of crystalloid fluid therapy within 3 hours of sepsis onset was associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality, delayed resolution of hypotension and increased length of stay in ICU".

### Use of the fluid challenge in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review [^117CLgCn]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2017). Low credibility.

The fluid challenge (FC) aims at identifying patients in whom fluid administration improves hemodynamics. Although the FC has been extensively studied, the implementation and definition of improvement are not standardized. This systematic review of studies published between January 1, 1994 and December 31, 2014 characterizes these key components of the FC for critically ill adult patients, as described in the medical literature in the last 20 years. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane. For each study, data were collected on study design, study size, study setting, patient population, and how the FC was administered. Eligibility criteria for FC were (1) the infusion of a definite quantity of fluid, (2) of a specific type, (3) in a fixed time period (expressed as either span or infusion rate), (4) with a defined hemodynamic variable as the target, and (5) for a predetermined threshold. One hundred fifty-seven full-text manuscripts were extracted from 870 potentially relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were met by 71 studies including 3617 patients. Sixty-six studies were from a single center and 45 were prospective observational in format. The most common amount infused was 500 cc, used by 55 (77.5%) studies. The most commonly infused fluids were colloids (62.0%). In 43 (60.5%) studies, the FC was administered between 20 and 30 minutes. A positive response to fluid administration was defined as an increase ≥ 15% of cardiac index or cardiac output in 44 (62.6%) studies. Static or dynamic physiologic indices were utilized in a minority of studies (16.9%) and safety limits for interrupting the FC are adopted in 4 (5.6%) studies only. This systematic review indicates that the FC most commonly consists in infusing 500 mL of crystalloids or colloids in 20–30 minutes, and considered an increase in cardiac index ≥ 15% as a positive response. However, definite standards for FC administration and evaluation remain undefined.

### How I personalize fluid therapy in septic shock? [^117DEfba]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The first therapeutic measure in septic shock, volume expansion, is seemingly simple: a few hundred millilitres of fluid injected intravenously over a few minutes. However, nothing is simple in the strategy of using fluids in septic patients. Several different types of fluids are available today. The effects of a fluid bolus are inconsistent and transient. Fluids are risky treatments, particularly during septic shock. Then, many questions raise in practice. Which fluid to choose? Should it be infused? How to evaluate its risk and refrain from infusing it? How to predict its effects? How to evaluate them?

To these questions, one can provide a standard and unequivocal answer. This is what the current guidelines do, without distinguishing according to the clinical context and the patient characteristics. The aim is likely to make them general enough to be applied widely, which is undoubtedly laudable. Another reason is that these guidelines are based on existing randomized controlled trials, which have often paid little attention to the particularities of patients they included. So, while these recommendations are of great value, there is probably room for a more personalized fluid management. Contrary to a "universal" strategy, the idea that "one size does not fit all" has been defended for many years about several strategies in critical care medicine. The need for personalization of treatment has emerged as a virtuous goal to pursue, especially in septic shock. This is the case for fluids as for any other treatment.

In this review, we will describe what a personalized fluid strategy in septic shock can be, based not only on the existing publications, but also on the pathophysiological concepts underlying the effects of fluids. From the choice of fluid type to the decision to remove the fluid administered in excess, we will try to show that, at each stage, the choices can reasonably be individualized.

How to customize the choice of fluid type?

The use of corticosteroids has been debated in recent years. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest against using IV hydrocortisone to treat septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability. If this is not achievable, the guidelines suggest IV hydrocortisone at a dose of 200 mg per day.

The "sepsis bundle" has been central to the implementation of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign from the first publication of its evidence-based guidelines in 2004 through subsequent editions.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Bundle 2018 update reported the following 5 "hour-1 bundles", for improving outcomes in patients with sepsis and septic shock.
Measure lactate level. Re-measure if initial lactate is > 2 mmol/L
Obtain blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics
Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics
Rapidly administer 30 ml/kg crystalloid for hypotension or lactate ≥ 4 mmol/L

Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Subsequent resuscitation depends on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion. Static measures such as heart rate, central venous pressure, and systolic blood pressure are poor indicators of fluid status, and using dynamic measures reduces mortality with a risk ratio of 0.
59. Dynamic measures of fluid status include cardiac output measurement during passive leg raising, stroke volume measurement in response to fluid challenges or changes in intrathoracic pressure, and changes in pulse pressure or systolic blood pressure in response to fluid challenges.

Although lactate levels often will not decrease to normal, levels approaching normal suggest successful resuscitation. Normalization of capillary refill time can also demonstrate resuscitation. If vasopressors are necessary after initial fluid resuscitation, the target mean arterial pressure is 65 mm Hg because higher targets do not improve survival. Vasopressors should be started peripherally rather than waiting for central venous access. Arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential and carries low risks of limb ischemia and bleeding. Intensive care admission should be completed within six hours because mortality increases when emergency department stays exceed that time frame. Norepinephrine is the first-line vasopressor agent, with epinephrine or dopamine as acceptable alternatives although they increase lactate level and the risk of arrhythmia. Adding vasopressin at 0. 03 units per minute should be considered if norepinephrine infusions reach
0. 25 to 0.

5 mcg per kg per minute without reaching blood pressure goals. Epinephrine can be considered if goals are not met with norepinephrine and vasopressin. For hypoperfusion with adequate volume status and arterial blood pressure, adding dobutamine to norepinephrine or using epinephrine alone are options. PROTECTIVE VENTILATION With sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome, low tidal volume ventilation of 6 mL per kg is recommended over higher tidal volumes due to a number needed to treat of 11 to reduce mortality. Similarly, limiting peak airways pressures up to 30 cm of water in ARDS reduces mortality.

### Sodium nitroprusside injection, solution… [^115JZqfw]. FDA (DailyMed) (2025). Medium credibility. In patients not properly monitored, these decreases can lead to irreversible ischemic injuries or death. Sodium nitroprusside should be used only when available equipment and personnel allow blood pressure to be continuously monitored. Except when used briefly or at low infusion. pressure has not been adequately controlled after 10 minutes of infusion at the maximum rate, administration of sodium nitroprusside should be terminated immediately. Although acid-base balance and venous oxygen concentration should be monitored and may indicate cyanide toxicity, these laboratory tests provide imperfect guidance. DESCRIPTION Sodium nitroprusside is disodium pentacyanonitrosylferrate dihydrate, a hypotensive. same study, ten renovascular-hypertensive patients given sodium nitroprusside had significant increases in renin release from the involved kidney at mean arterial pressures of 90 to 137 mm Hg.

The hypotensive effect of sodium nitroprusside is seen within a minute or two after the. nitroprusside infusion; during these few minutes, it may be helpful to put the patient into a head-down position to maximize venous return. If hypotension persists more than a few minutes after discontinuation of the infusion of sodium nitroprusside, sodium nitroprusside is not the cause, and the true cause must be. dangerously hypotensive when they receive sodium nitroprusside at this rate. Infusion of sodium nitroprusside should therefore be started at a very low rate, with upward titration every few minutes until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum recommended infusion rate has been reached. Because sodium nitroprusside's hypotensive effect is very rapid in onset and in dissipation, small variations in infusion rate can lead to wide, undesirable variations in blood pressure.

Since there is inherent variation in blood pressure measurement, confirm the drug effect at any infusion rate after an additional 5 minutes before titrating. the blood pressure of a patient receiving this drug must be continuously monitored, using either a continually reinflated sphygmomanometer or an intra-arterial pressure.
