## Question

Sepsis mechanism

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of sepsis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initiating trigger and how pathogens are sensed. Then, I should verify the dysregulated immune response, including both hyperinflammation and immunosuppression. Next, I will examine the key effector systems that translate immune dysregulation into organ injury, such as endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, mitochondrial injury, and metabolic reprogramming. After that, I need to consider organ-specific manifestations and the concept of treatable traits. Finally, I should review temporal dynamics, heterogeneity, and how these mechanistic insights inform precision medicine and current research priorities.

> Let me first confirm the initiating event and sensing mechanisms. Sepsis begins when infection triggers a systemic host response via pattern recognition receptors that detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns, with TLRs, NOD-like receptors, and cGAS-STING as central nodes that activate transcriptional programs and propagate inflammation throughout the organism [^e7a59b34] [^95b3fa0a].

> Wait, let me verify the nature of the immune response before I overstate a linear model. Contemporary understanding rejects a simple hyperinflammatory phase followed by hypoinflammation; instead, pro- and anti-inflammatory processes coexist from the outset, producing a dysregulated host response that fails to return to homeostasis and drives organ dysfunction [^5c4cf916] [^1fb601a7] [^7e990853].

> I will now examine the hyperinflammatory arm. Early activation of innate immunity leads to cytokine storms with TNF, IL-1, IL-6, and IFN-γ, while complement and coagulation cascades amplify tissue injury; this systemic inflammation contributes to endothelial activation, vascular leak, and organ edema, and it is increasingly clear that cytokine effects are combinatorial and context-dependent rather than monolithic [^e7a59b34] [^ec6e7c7a] [^a2907bde].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about inflammation alone explaining outcomes. Concurrent immunosuppression is pervasive, with impaired antigen presentation, lymphocyte apoptosis, and expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells; this state increases susceptibility to secondary infections and correlates with late mortality, underscoring the need to consider immune stimulation strategies in appropriately selected patients [^f837791b] [^3bcab5ce] [^b1a96a7a].

> Next, I should review endothelial dysfunction as a central amplifier. Endothelial activation increases permeability, promotes leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, shifts the hemostatic balance toward procoagulant phenotypes, and alters vasomotor tone; these changes unify many seemingly disparate manifestations of sepsis and make the endothelium a compelling therapeutic target [^4b02661f] [^94af0437] [^a3f2fbf6].

> I need to check the coagulation cascade next. Sepsis-induced coagulopathy reflects immune-mediated thrombin generation, platelet activation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic mechanisms; clinically, SIC is common and associated with worse outcomes, and its pathophysiology is tightly interwoven with innate immune signaling and endothelial injury [^3ba90c84] [^00db8549] [^78ce9f10].

> Let me consider mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming. Sepsis drives mitochondrial structural damage, respiratory chain impairment, and ROS/RNS generation, while also triggering inflammasome activation via mtDNA and cardiolipin release; these bioenergetic defects contribute to organ dysfunction and are not merely epiphenomena, prompting interest in mitochondria-targeted therapies [^e4ec500c] [^f840912b] [^95b3fa0a].

> I should confirm organ-specific manifestations to avoid overgeneralization. Sepsis-associated AKI often occurs without frank ischemia and reflects microvascular dysfunction, inflammation, and tubular signaling changes rather than classic ATN; sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy is typically functional and reversible, with cytokine-mediated receptor and calcium-handling changes; ARDS arises from endothelial injury, barrier breakdown, and inflammatory alveolar damage; the liver shows cholestasis from cytokine-mediated transporter inhibition; and the brain manifests encephalopathy via neuroinflammation and microvascular compromise [^1100bb00] [^261e1fcc] [^93f45e3a] [^fdc19992] [^fb09df37] [^dbe6bc04].

> But wait, what if the clinical course is not uniform across patients or over time. Temporal dynamics include an early phase dominated by inflammatory activation and a later phase marked by immunosuppression and persistent organ dysfunction; this phase-dependent biology helps explain why anti-inflammatory strategies may fail if given too late and why immune stimulation may be beneficial in the immunosuppressed window [^b1a96a7a] [^5ce299e1] [^f837791b].

> I should double-check the implications of heterogeneity for precision medicine. Sepsis exhibits both severity heterogeneity and mechanistic heterogeneity; distinguishing these is essential because outcome differences by severity do not prove mechanistic divergence, and future progress likely hinges on identifying treatable traits and mechanistically coherent endotypes that predict response to targeted therapies [^0ecf2428] [^49f83515] [^27908aa7].

> Let me reconsider how these mechanisms inform current research priorities. Major gaps include defining what causes organ injury and how to detect it early, individualizing fluids and vasopressors across phases, and moving toward precision immunomodulation; basic science priorities include improving animal models, clarifying brain–immune–endocrine crosstalk, and understanding how genetics and epigenetics shape trajectory and treatment response [^1c657dea] [^4d551723] [^eaedf117].

> In summary, sepsis arises when infection perturbs a tightly balanced host response, producing simultaneous hyperinflammation and immunosuppression that propagate via endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, mitochondrial injury, and metabolic reprogramming to cause organ failure; recognizing this complexity and the heterogeneity of patients and phases explains past therapeutic failures and supports a precision medicine approach anchored in treatable traits and longitudinal phenotyping [^a2907bde] [^5c4cf916] [^1e32945a].

Sepsis is driven by a **dysregulated host response** to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction [^a2907bde]. The core mechanism is a **loss of immune homeostasis**, with concurrent hyperinflammation and immunosuppression [^1fb601a7] that vary over time and by patient [^7e990853]. Key drivers include **pathogen recognition** via PRRs (TLRs, NLRs, cGAS-STING) [^e7a59b34], **endothelial activation** with barrier breakdown and microvascular thrombosis [^4b02661f] [^3ba90c84], and **mitochondrial dysfunction** with metabolic failure in immune and parenchymal cells [^f840912b]. These processes converge to cause multi-organ failure, with mortality rising as dysfunction progresses from sepsis to septic shock [^a2907bde].

---

## Initiation: pathogen recognition and immune activation

- **Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)**: TLRs, NLRs, and cGAS-STING detect PAMPs/DAMPs, triggering innate immune activation and cytokine release [^e7a59b34] [^95b3fa0a].
- **Cytokine storm**: Excess TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ drive systemic inflammation, endothelial injury, and organ dysfunction [^e7a59b34] [^ec6e7c7a].
- **Complement activation**: Amplifies inflammation and coagulation, worsening tissue injury [^notfound].

---

## Endothelial dysfunction and microvascular failure

- **Endothelial activation**: Increased permeability, leukocyte adhesion, and procoagulant phenotype cause edema, hypoperfusion, and microthrombosis [^4b02661f] [^94af0437].
- **Microcirculatory dysfunction**: Capillary shunting and thrombosis impair oxygen delivery, contributing to lactic acidosis and organ failure [^dbe6bc04].
- **Organ-specific effects**: AKI, ARDS, hepatic dysfunction, and encephalopathy reflect microvascular injury and hypoxia [^1100bb00] [^fb09df37].

---

## Immune dysregulation: concurrent hyperinflammation and immunosuppression

- **Hyperinflammation**: Early cytokine-driven tissue damage and organ failure [^e7a59b34].
- **Immunosuppression**: Later-phase lymphocyte apoptosis, impaired antigen presentation, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells increase secondary infections and mortality [^f837791b] [^3bcab5ce].
- **Temporal dynamics**: Phases overlap; timing of immune interventions is critical but often missed [^b1a96a7a].

---

## Mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic failure

Mitochondrial damage causes **bioenergetic failure** in immune and parenchymal cells, impairing function and promoting apoptosis [^f840912b]. Metabolic reprogramming shifts leukocytes to glycolysis, altering immune function and contributing to immunosuppression [^notfound]. Persistent mitochondrial dysfunction sustains organ dysfunction and delays recovery [^d795c83c].

---

## Coagulation cascade activation and thrombosis

- **Immune-thrombosis**: TLR-driven tissue factor expression and platelet activation drive thrombin generation and microthrombi [^00db8549].
- **Sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC)**: Occurs in ~24% of sepsis and ~66% of septic shock, correlating with mortality [^00db8549].
- **Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)**: Consumptive coagulopathy with bleeding and thrombosis worsens organ failure [^notfound].

---

## Organ dysfunction and failure

| **Organ system** | **Mechanism of dysfunction** | **Clinical manifestation** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardiovascular | - Vasodilation <br/> - Myocardial depression <br/> - Microvascular failure | - Hypotension <br/> - Shock <br/> - Arrhythmias [^93f45e3a] |
| Respiratory | - Endothelial injury <br/> - Alveolar damage <br/> - Inflammation | - ARDS <br/> - Hypoxemia [^notfound] |
| Renal | - Microvascular thrombosis <br/> - Tubular injury <br/> - Mitochondrial failure | - AKI <br/> - Oliguria [^1100bb00] |
| Hepatic | - Cholestasis <br/> - Hepatocellular injury <br/> - Coagulopathy | - Jaundice <br/> - Elevated liver enzymes [^fb09df37] |
| Neurologic | - Blood-brain barrier breakdown <br/> - Neuroinflammation <br/> - Mitochondrial failure | - Encephalopathy <br/> - Delirium <br/> - Coma [^notfound] |

---

## Heterogeneity and precision medicine

- **Patient heterogeneity**: Age, comorbidities, genetics, and pathogen type create variable responses and outcomes [^7e990853].
- **Endotypes**: Transcriptomic and proteomic subtypes (e.g. inflammopathic, adaptive, coagulopathic) may guide targeted therapy [^7e990853] [^45e92ad6].
- **Precision approach**: Biomarker-guided immunomodulation (e.g. IL-7, GM-CSF, PD-1 blockade) is under study to match therapy to immune phenotype [^3bcab5ce] [^860811d1].

---

## Therapeutic implications and research priorities

- **Early recognition**: Rapid detection and source control remain foundational [^a2907bde].
- **Supportive care**: Timely antibiotics, fluids, and vasopressors reduce mortality but do not address immune dysregulation [^9944d212].
- **Immune modulation**: Trials targeting specific immune defects (e.g. PD-1, IL-7) are ongoing but require better stratification [^3bcab5ce] [^860811d1].
- **Research gaps**: Organ-specific mechanisms, biomarkers, and phase-specific interventions are key priorities [^1c657dea] [^4d551723].

---

Sepsis arises from a **multifactorial cascade** of immune activation, endothelial injury, coagulopathy, mitochondrial failure, and metabolic dysregulation, producing heterogeneous organ dysfunction. Effective therapy will require **precision strategies** that align interventions with the patient's immune phenotype and disease phase [^1e32945a].

### Mechanisms of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction [^3fa3fd97]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The past several years have seen remarkable advances in understanding the basic cellular and physiologic mechanisms underlying organ dysfunction and recovery relating to sepsis. Although several new therapeutic approaches have improved outcome in septic patients, the far-reaching potential of these new insights into sepsis-associated mechanisms is only beginning to be realized.

Aim

The Brussels Round Table Conference in 2006 convened > 30 experts in the field of inflammation and sepsis to review recent advances involving sepsis and to discuss directions that the field is likely to take in the near future.

Findings

Current understanding of the pathophysiology underlying sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction highlights the multiple cell populations and cell-signaling pathways involved in this complex condition. There is an increasing appreciation of interactions existing between different cells and organs affected by the septic process. The intricate cross-talk provided by temporal changes in mediators, hormones, metabolites, neural signaling, alterations in oxygen delivery and utilization, and by modifications in cell phenotypes underlines the adaptive and even coordinated processes beyond the dysregulated chaos in which sepsis was once perceived. Many pathologic processes previously considered to be detrimental are now viewed as potentially protective. Applying systems approaches to these complex processes will permit better appreciation of the effectiveness or harm of treatments, both present and future, and also will allow development not only of better directed, but also of more appropriately timed, strategies to improve outcomes from this still highly lethal condition.

### The immunopathology of sepsis and potential therapeutic targets [^5c4cf916]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In sepsis, the immune response that is initiated by an invading pathogen fails to return to homeostasis, thus culminating in a pathological syndrome that is characterized by sustained excessive inflammation and immune suppression. Our understanding of the key mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis has increased tremendously, yet this still needs to be translated into novel targeted therapeutic strategies. Pivotal for the clinical development of new sepsis therapies is the selection of patients on the basis of biomarkers and/or functional defects that provide specific insights into the expression or activity of the therapeutic target.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^fd42bbf4]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

A consensus committee of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and Society of Critical Care Medicine was convened at the annual meetings of both societies. Subgroups had teleconference and electronic-based discussion. The entire committee iteratively developed the entire document and recommendations.

Methods

Each committee member independently gave their top five priorities for sepsis research. A total of 88 suggestions (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D636) were grouped into categories by the committee co-chairs, leading to the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup had teleconferences to go over each priority followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee provides 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Of these, the top six clinical priorities were identified and include the following questions: 1) can targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches determine which therapies will work for which patients at which times?; 2) what are ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and how should volume resuscitation be titrated?; 3) should rapid diagnostic tests be implemented in clinical practice?; 4) should empiric antibiotic combination therapy be used in sepsis or septic shock?; 5) what are the predictors of sepsis long-term morbidity and mortality?; and 6) what information identifies organ dysfunction?

Conclusions

While the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines give multiple recommendations on the treatment of sepsis, significant knowledge gaps remain, both in bedside issues directly applicable to clinicians, as well as understanding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the development and progression of sepsis. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

Conflating severity with mechanism

Since sepsis is a response syndrome, differential severity and differential disease mechanisms are often indistinguishable. In critically ill populations, the probability of death varies continuously over a wide range. This has a direct mathematical effect on the probability of net benefit from therapeutic interventions, and hence on the observed treatment effect in clinical trials. This form of heterogeneity of treatment effect means that there are always some patients with a much higher chance of net benefit from an effective therapy, and conversely, some patients with a higher probability of null effect, or harm. The impact of HTE is that the optimal probability of net benefit from a given therapy is a balance between the benefit and harm associated with that therapy, and is hence specific to that therapy.

Similarly, different patients prioritise different disease outcomes: some may value survival above all else, whereas others will place greater value on symptom control. So the choice of the ideal group of patients to receive a given therapy is not only determined by the probability of net benefit, but by the definition of "benefit" for each patient. Disease severity has direct and important therapeutic consequences, but it is conceptually distinct from disease mechanism. Heterogeneity of severity acts on a single dimension, and is quantifiable by definition for any clinical outcome. In contrast, mechanistic heterogeneity is as broad as our current understanding of disease biology, and as multidimensional as the number of different pathophysiological processes that exist. Since mechanistic heterogeneity is expected to overlap with severity heterogeneity, we recommend that a difference between subgroups in disease outcome should not be taken as evidence of difference in underlying mechanism.

### A historical perspective on sepsis [^4aba435e]. The American Journal of Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

In North America, approximately 700,000 cases of sepsis occur each year, with mortality ranging between 30% and 50%. The American Journal of Pathology has featured numerous articles on the topic, revealing mechanistic insights gleaned from both experimental rodent models and human sepsis. Nonetheless, there remains urgent need to determine the basis for sepsis-related complications and how they can be avoided, as well as how they can be most effectively treated once recognized. This historical perspective reviews what we currently understand about the mechanisms of sepsis, as well as the barriers that remain in our treatment strategies.

### Embracing complexity in sepsis [^1e32945a]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Biomedical research has sought to dissect the pathophysiology of sepsis for decades, which has led to a rich understanding of the separate components that together manifest sepsis. However, the totality of sepsis has remained ungovernable, as effective, clinically implemented therapies remain elusive. This is not for a lack of effort: numerous trials have been performed over the last 30 years, but without success. The cause of this failure is likely multi-facetted, including a disregard for heterogeneity and uncertainty, and a translational gap between pre-clinical and clinical models. While these considerations are relevant, we here argue for a more fundamental problem: the complexity of sepsis cannot be fully understood by single-timepoint, reductionist studies. The interplay between all components of sepsis together results in emergent behaviour that is more than and different from the sum of its parts. Emergent properties are central to complex systems, although the term 'emergence' can remain somewhat vague due to a variety of definitions and interpretations. In essence, complex systems can display properties or behaviour that cannot be reduced to, or understood and predicted by, the individual components that make up the system. While it may feel self-evident that sepsis represents such an emergent state, still the vast majority of studies is based on a single biological snapshot of patients, often limited to a specific part of pathophysiology. In order to fully understand sepsis, it is pivotal that we complement these research efforts with approaches derived from complex systems science.

In this perspective we will discuss sepsis through the lens of complexity theory. We describe what non-linear, dynamic mechanisms contribute to the emergent state of sepsis, and how one can evaluate complex systems like the host response to infection. We highlight the progress that has been made in the understanding and analysis of complex adaptive systems and discuss why these advancements have remained generally unrecognized and have yet to translate into clinical tools. We consider the implications of treating sepsis as a complex and nonlinear system, with regards to measurement, research approaches and trial design. Specifically, we advocate more emphasis on longitudinal biological data, computational modelling and model-informed interventions.

### Sepsis: pathophysiology and clinical management [^9944d212]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock represent increasingly severe systemic inflammatory responses to infection. Sepsis is common in the aging population, and it disproportionately affects patients with cancer and underlying immunosuppression. In its most severe form, sepsis causes multiple organ dysfunction that can produce a state of chronic critical illness characterized by severe immune dysfunction and catabolism. Much has been learnt about the pathogenesis of sepsis at the molecular, cell, and intact organ level. Despite uncertainties in hemodynamic management and several treatments that have failed in clinical trials, investigational therapies increasingly target sepsis induced organ and immune dysfunction. Outcomes in sepsis have greatly improved overall, probably because of an enhanced focus on early diagnosis and fluid resuscitation, the rapid delivery of effective antibiotics, and other improvements in supportive care for critically ill patients. These improvements include lung protective ventilation, more judicious use of blood products, and strategies to reduce nosocomial infections.

### Molecular biology of inflammation and sepsis: a primer [^446c5851]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Remarkable progress has been made during the last decade in defining the molecular mechanisms that underlie septic shock. This rapidly expanding field is leading to new therapeutic opportunities in the management of severe sepsis.

Aim

To provide the clinician with a timely summary of the molecular biology of sepsis and to better understand recent advances in sepsis research.

Data Selection

Medline search of relevant publications in basic mechanisms of sepsis/severe sepsis/septic shock, and selected literature review of other manuscripts about the signalosome, inflammasome, apoptosis, or mechanisms of shock. DATA SYNTHESIS AND FINDINGS: The identification of the toll-like receptors and the associated concept of innate immunity based upon pathogen- or damage-associated molecular pattern molecules allowed significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis. The essential elements of the inflammasome and signal transduction networks responsible for activation of the host response have now been characterized. Apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, sepsis-related immunosuppression, late mediators of systemic inflammation, control mechanisms for coagulation, and reprogramming of immune response genes all have critical roles in the development of sepsis.

Conclusions

Many of these basic discoveries have direct implications for the clinical management of sepsis. The translation of these "bench-to-bedside" findings into new therapeutic strategies is already underway. This brief review provides the clinician with a primer into the basic mechanisms responsible for the molecular biology of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^6e0a58e3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Raising concerns about the Sepsis-3 definitions

Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors. If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impairment of one or more vital organs or systems. There are many well-known risk factors for the infections that most commonly precipitate organ dysfunction, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many cancers, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and advanced age. Although big steps forward have been made, the pathophysiological mechanisms for organ dysfunction are not entirely known, but it has become apparent that infection triggers a much more complex, variable, and prolonged host response, involving early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Sepsis has variable clinical presentations depending on the initial site of infection, the causative organism, the pattern of acute organ dysfunction, and the underlying health status of the patient.

There is general consensus that early recognition and timely treatment largely determine outcome of sepsis.

Since the first classification in 1991, the definition of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, though imprecise, have provided the clinicians a useful framework for clinical management, stressing the need for early recognition, and when these criteria are followed by the application of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, they have an impressive history of success in reducing the mortality of sepsis in several areas of the world.

Several studies demonstrated that sepsis-related mortality reduced steadily over the years. A meta-analysis reported a reduction of sepsis 28-day mortality rates from 46.9% during the period 1991–1995 to 29% during 2006–2009. In the USA, mortality due to severe sepsis decreased by 51% from 1988 to 2012. In Australia and New Zealand, an overall decrease of 16.7% in hospital sepsis mortality was reported between 2000 and 2012 (from 35 to 18.4%). However, high mortality rates are still reported in low- and middle-income countries.

### Sepsis pathophysiology, chronic critical illness, and persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome [^16644f8d]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To provide an appraisal of the evolving paradigms in the pathophysiology of sepsis and propose the evolution of a new phenotype of critically ill patients, its potential underlying mechanism, and its implications for the future of sepsis management and research.

Design

Literature search using PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google Scholar.

Measurements and Main Results

Sepsis remains one of the most debilitating and expensive illnesses, and its prevalence is not declining. What is changing is our definition(s), its clinical course, and how we manage the septic patient. Once thought to be predominantly a syndrome of over exuberant inflammation, sepsis is now recognized as a syndrome of aberrant host protective immunity. Earlier recognition and compliance with treatment bundles has fortunately led to a decline in multiple organ failure and in-hospital mortality. Unfortunately, more and more sepsis patients, especially the aged, are suffering chronic critical illness, rarely fully recover, and often experience an indolent death. Patients with chronic critical illness often exhibit "a persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome", and it is proposed here that this state of persisting inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism contributes to many of these adverse clinical outcomes. The underlying cause of inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome is currently unknown, but there is increasing evidence that altered myelopoiesis, reduced effector T-cell function, and expansion of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells are all contributory.

Conclusions

Although newer therapeutic interventions are targeting the inflammatory, the immunosuppressive, and the protein catabolic responses individually, successful treatment of the septic patient with chronic critical illness and persistent inflammation-immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome may require a more complementary approach.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^c3910a51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

WHAT'S NEW ON THIS TOPIC Sepsis 2016 guidelines provide a new definition for sepsis: a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality; the presence of hypotension is no longer required. 8, 9 The terminology was simplified, and sepsis and septic shock are now the only recognized terms. 8, 9 Sepsis is now defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. SIRS is defined as the presence of at least two of the following four criteria: temperature greater than 100. 4°F or less than
96.

8°F; heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute; respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute or partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 32 mm Hg; and white blood cell count greater than 12, 000 per μL are the most common causative organisms for sepsis. 18 Some patients with sepsis are infected with multiple microbial organisms. A small number of patients with sepsis have fungal, viral, or parasitic infections. 21 Infusing an initial 1-L bolus over the first 30 minutes is an accepted approach.

The remainder of fluid resuscitation should be given by repeat bolus infusions. 43 Infusion of intravenous fluids in this manner enhances preload and cardiac output, thereby improving oxygen delivery. However, the hemodynamic effects of fluid boluses in sepsis last only 60 minutes. 44.

### Causal inference can lead us to modifiable mechanisms and informative archetypes in sepsis [^49f83515]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A syndrome definition can err by inclusion and by exclusion. The definition of sepsismakes both errors: it is simultaneously too broad and too narrow. A single syndrome that combines coma due to meningitis, respiratory failure due to critical Covid-19, and cardiovascular shock due to urosepsis is self-evidently incoherent: it is very likely that distinct causal mechanisms underlie outcomes in these diseases. In part as a consequence, it also errs by exclusion - although classifiers exist, to our knowledge no immune process has been discovered to be shared across the whole spectrum of patients with sepsis, that is not also evident in patients with severe systemic inflammation precipitated by sterile injury such as trauma, pancreatitis, haemorrhage and burns.

Critical care medicine does not need a new definition of sepsis. Instead, we anticipate that future progress will ultimately replace the sepsis syndrome with overlapping, mechanistically-coherent diagnoses with specific therapeutic consequences. Here, we report a series of recommendations following an ongoing discussion among an international group of experts across a range of relevant disciplines, and consider some concrete steps that can be taken to discover and modify causal mechanisms of disease in sepsis.

Definitions

Endotype: A subgroup within a population of patients who are distinguished by a shared disease process. Historically, the underlying mechanism is what distinguishes a disease from a syndrome.

Trait*: A specific distinguishing characteristic of an organism.

Phenotype*: An observable characteristic of an organism.

Genotype*: The genetic makeup of an organism

Treatable trait: The pathophysiological feature (or, in a looser sense, a biomarker or group of biomarkers for that feature) that determines whether a given therapy will improve a given patient's outcome. The same trait may be present in many different clinical syndromes or disease processes.

Modifiable mechanism: An underlying disease process that can be modified by treatment.

Archetype: A description of the idealised, typical appearance representative of a group.

* these words are used widely in biology under these, or similar, definitions, so it would be undesirable for clinical researchers to attempt to redefine them.

### Harmful molecular mechanisms in sepsis [^e4abbe31]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Sepsis and sepsis-associated multi-organ failure are major challenges for scientists and clinicians and are a tremendous burden for health-care systems. Despite extensive basic research and clinical studies, the pathophysiology of sepsis is still poorly understood. We are now beginning to understand that sepsis is a heterogeneous, dynamic syndrome caused by imbalances in the 'inflammatory network'. In this Review, we highlight recent insights into the molecular interactions that occur during sepsis and attempt to unravel the nature of the dysregulated immune response during sepsis.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign research priorities 2023 [^1c657dea]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcome, and pathophysiology of sepsis and septic shock.

Design

Shortly after publication of the most recent Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, the Surviving Sepsis Research Committee, a multiprofessional group of 16 international experts representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, convened virtually and iteratively developed the article and recommendations, which represents an update from the 2018 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities.

Methods

Each task force member submitted five research questions on any sepsis-related subject. Committee members then independently ranked their top three priorities from the list generated. The highest rated clinical and basic science questions were developed into the current article.

Results

A total of 81 questions were submitted. After merging similar questions, there were 34 clinical and ten basic science research questions submitted for voting. The five top clinical priorities were as follows: 1) what is the best strategy for screening and identification of patients with sepsis, and can predictive modeling assist in real-time recognition of sepsis? 2) what causes organ injury and dysfunction in sepsis, how should it be defined, and how can it be detected? 3) how should fluid resuscitation be individualized initially and beyond? 4) what is the best vasopressor approach for treating the different phases of septic shock? and 5) can a personalized/precision medicine approach identify optimal therapies to improve patient outcomes? The five top basic science priorities were as follows: 1) How can we improve animal models so that they more closely resemble sepsis in humans? 2) What outcome variables maximize correlations between human sepsis and animal models and are therefore most appropriate to use in both? 3) How does sepsis affect the brain, and how do sepsis-induced brain alterations contribute to organ dysfunction? How does sepsis affect interactions between neural, endocrine, and immune systems? 4) How does the microbiome affect sepsis pathobiology? 5) How do genetics and epigenetics influence the development of sepsis, the course of sepsis and the response to treatments for sepsis?

Conclusions

Knowledge advances in multiple clinical domains have been incorporated in progressive iterations of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, allowing for evidence-based recommendations for short- and long-term management of sepsis. However, the strength of existing evidence is modest with significant knowledge gaps and mortality from sepsis remains high. The priorities identified represent a roadmap for research in sepsis and septic shock.

### Sepsis: current dogma and new perspectives [^c1b3672d]. Immunity (2014). Low credibility.

Sepsis, a clinical syndrome occurring in patients following infection or injury, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current immunological mechanisms do not explain the basis of cellular dysfunction and organ failure, the ultimate cause of death. Here we review current dogma and argue that it is time to delineate novel immunometabolic and neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the altered cellular bioenergetics and failure of epithelial and endothelial barriers that produce organ dysfunction and death. These mechanisms might hold the key to future therapeutic strategies.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: basic / translational science research priorities [^4d551723]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

OVERVIEW OF THE PRESENTATION

The five basic science questions identified by the Task Force as a whole as follows:

1) What mechanisms underlie sepsis-induced cellular and subcellular dysfunction?
2) How does sepsis alter bioenergetics and/or metabolism (both enhancement and failure)?
3) How does sepsis (and/or approaches used to manage sepsis) alter phenotypes and interactions in the host microbiome and do alterations in the microbiome affect outcomes?
4) How do epigenetics influence the pathobiology of sepsis?
5) What mechanisms initiate, sustain, and terminate recovery after sepsis?

The format for each of the five questions directly mirrors that used in the previously published overview, which contains a more extensive description of the methods.

Question 1: What Mechanisms Underlie Sepsis-Induced Cellular and Subcellular Dysfunction?

What Is Known.

The redefinition of sepsis by the Sepsis-3 Task Force focuses on the importance of organ dysfunction as the sine qua non of the disorder. As a result, there is a compelling need to develop new clinical constructs for dysfunction in individual organ systems, as well as to continue to advance animal models to more accurately reflect human sepsis. The process is hampered by 1) lack of a true gold standard to identify sepsis and 2) a need to develop indices of organ dysfunction that can be measured in patients, where access to cells is limited. There is little to be done about the first point. To address the second, it will first be necessary to identify the cellular abnormalities that underlie dysfunction in specific organ systems. These abnormalities can then be related to updated proxy measures that correlate, as closely and specifically as possible, with the actual cellular changes that lead to sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. However, access to clinical samples is limited, most often to what can be obtained from sampling blood, urine, or less frequently with biopsy or lavage specimens. Thus, WBCs are likely to be all that is routinely available. As a result, there is an imperative to use either models or in silico constructs to identify cellular abnormalities consistent with sepsis-induced dysfunction in different organs. Correlation of these abnormalities with measurements that can be made using blood or urine, or with noninvasive functional testing (e.g. echocardiography) will provide a clinically useful approach to organ dysfunction.

### Causal inference can lead us to modifiable mechanisms and informative archetypes in sepsis [^9c6d7ef7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Many of these pitfalls can almost always be avoided by a simple, intuitive approach which is too often missed in large scale studies: maintaining a focus on the desirable real-life destination of subclassification research. By considering the ultimate goal - to delineate a landscape of informative disease archetypes - the ultimate utility of sepsis research can be significantly improved.

Like SIRS, sepsis is, fundamentally, more of a hypothesis than a disease. Perhaps our mistake has been to use the term in the context usually reserved for diseases - "treatment of sepsis", "diagnostic criteria for sepsis" - rather than the more circumspect language used to describe a theory, that is, that organ damage is caused by a common pathway of host immune mechanisms precipitated by a broad range of infectious triggers. We contend that progress in sepsis research will require, above all, a focus on causal mechanisms driving clinical outcomes.

There is no single objectively-true view of the landscape of human disease. We consider the defining feature of a successful view of the landscape to be utility. Subgrouping aims to identify mechanistically coherent disease archetypes with value beyond the clinically obvious, with differential genetic predisposition and treatment response. Ultimately, we need to move beyond classification, to recognising, explaining and modifying continuous traits within the sepsis population.

### Sepsis subclasses: a framework for development and interpretation [^27908aa7]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials tested therapies for sepsis over the past 2 decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biologic features. Combinations of these features, however, may identify previously unrecognized groups, or "subclasses" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment. As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise. These include: 1) the semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses, 2) the conceptual goal of subclasses, 3) considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods, 4) the role of emerging data types, and 5) how to determine whether subclasses represent "truth". We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodologic approaches, and guide clinicians in how to consider subclasses in bedside care.

### Pathophysiology of sepsis [^63b0b800]. The American Journal of Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis remains a critical problem with significant morbidity and mortality even in the modern era of critical care management. Multiple derangements exist in sepsis involving several different organs and systems, although controversies exist over their individual contribution to the disease process. Septic patients have substantial, life-threatening alterations in their coagulation system, and currently, there is an approved therapy with a component of the coagulation system (activated protein C) to treat patients with severe sepsis. Previously, it was believed that sepsis merely represented an exaggerated, hyperinflammatory response with patients dying from inflammation-induced organ injury. More recent data indicate that substantial heterogeneity exists in septic patients' inflammatory response, with some appearing immuno-stimulated, whereas others appear suppressed. Cellular changes continue the theme of heterogeneity. Some cells work too well such as neutrophils that remain activated for an extended time. Other cellular changes become accelerated in a detrimental fashion including lymphocyte apoptosis. Metabolic changes are clearly present, requiring close and individualized monitoring. At this point in time, the literature richly illustrates that no single mediator/system/pathway/pathogen drives the pathophysiology of sepsis. This review will briefly discuss many of the important alterations that account for the pathophysiology of sepsis.

### Targeting the host response in sepsis: current approaches and future evidence [^860811d1]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis, a dysregulated host response to infection characterized by organ failure, is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Disbalances of the immune response play an important role in its pathophysiology. Patients may develop simultaneously or concomitantly states of systemic or local hyperinflammation and immunosuppression. Although a variety of effective immunomodulatory treatments are generally available, attempts to inhibit or stimulate the immune system in sepsis have failed so far to improve patients' outcome. The underlying reason is likely multifaceted including failure to identify responders to a specific immune intervention and the complex pathophysiology of organ dysfunction that is not exclusively caused by immunopathology but also includes dysfunction of the coagulation system, parenchymal organs, and the endothelium. Increasing evidence suggests that stratification of the heterogeneous population of septic patients with consideration of their host response might led to treatments that are more effective. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of current studies aimed at optimizing the many facets of host response and to discuss future perspectives for precision medicine approaches in sepsis.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^3ba90c84]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

SUMMARY

SIC is a complication of sepsis involving dysregulated coagulation that is mechanistically linked to innate immune activation and contributes to organ injury and high mortality. While immune-mediated thrombin generation, platelet activation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic mechanism are separate mechanistic pathways, they interact in a coordinated fashion in the pathogenesis of SIC. The current therapeutic approaches in treating SIC have focused on reintroducing exogenous regulators of these systems, but their effectiveness appears to lie in accurate and timely diagnostics. Clarification of underlying mechanisms in SIC has continued, but efforts to develop targeted therapeutics have stalled. New focus and insight into pathological mechanisms underlying coagulopathy will help advance translational approaches to rapid diagnosis and prognosis of SIC to identify patients who would benefit most from therapies.

### The immunology of sepsis [^1fb601a7]. Immunity (2021). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to an infection. This recently implemented definition does not capture the heterogeneity or the underlying pathophysiology of the syndrome, which is characterized by concurrent unbalanced hyperinflammation and immune suppression. Here, we review current knowledge of aberrant immune responses during sepsis and recent initiatives to stratify patients with sepsis into subgroups that are more alike from a clinical and/or pathobiological perspective, which could be key for identification of patients who are more likely to benefit from specific immune interventions.

### Future of sepsis therapies [^fdbc8311]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. In the past decades many clinical trials tested immune modulatory compounds designed to restore homeostasis in patients with sepsis. In spite of these efforts, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, not a single new drug was integrated into clinical practice. Thus, it is obvious that the clinical and scientific communities need to reconsider the therapeutic approach to sepsis. Novel strategies to treat sepsis face serious challenges in their path to the patient in the intensive care unit (ICU).

The first question one might ask when confronted with the many negative sepsis trials is whether our current understanding of the pathophysiology of sepsis is correct. The traditional concept of sepsis as a syndrome caused by uncontrolled injurious inflammation has been replaced by the current model of a multifaceted host response, entailing not only abundant and sustained inflammation, but also lengthy immune suppression. It is now widely acknowledged that acute preclinical sepsis models do not adequately capture the prolonged course in patients with sepsis, in whom the majority develop organ dysfunction over the course of days with deaths occurring mostly more than 1 week after ICU admission. Preclinical research on novel therapeutic interventions should better integrate current knowledge of the course and consequences of sepsis, incorporating aged animals with comorbidity and supportive care, including resuscitation and antibiotic therapy, in different models relevant for sepsis.

### Pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy [^93f45e3a]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis is the life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection and is the leading cause of death in intensive care units. Cardiac dysfunction caused by sepsis, usually termed sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy, is common and has long been a subject of interest. In this Review, we explore the definition, epidemiology, diagnosis and pathophysiology of septic cardiomyopathy, with an emphasis on how best to interpret this condition in the clinical context. Advances in diagnostic techniques have increased the sensitivity of detection of myocardial abnormalities but have posed challenges in linking those abnormalities to therapeutic strategies and relevant clinical outcomes. Sophisticated methodologies have elucidated various pathophysiological mechanisms but the extent to which these are adaptive responses is yet to be definitively answered. Although the indications for monitoring and treating septic cardiomyopathy are clinical and directed towards restoring tissue perfusion, a better understanding of the course and implications of septic cardiomyopathy can help to optimize interventions and improve clinical outcomes.

### The inflammatory response in sepsis [^4cdbf891]. Trends in Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of sepsis and its accompanying systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and the events that lead to multiorgan failure and death are poorly understood. It is known that, in septic humans and rodents, the development of SIRS is associated with a loss of the redox balance, but SIRS can also develop in noninfectious states. In addition, a hyperinflammatory state develops, together with impaired innate immune functions of phagocytes, immunosuppression, and complement activation, collectively leading to septic shock and lethality. Here, we discuss recent insights into the signaling pathways in immune and phagocytic cells that underlie sepsis and SIRS and consider how these might be targeted for therapeutic interventions to reverse or attenuate pathways that lead to lethality during sepsis.

### Mechanisms and treatment of organ failure in sepsis [^dbe6bc04]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a dysregulated immune response to an infection that leads to organ dysfunction. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of organ failure in sepsis is crucial for optimizing the management and treatment of patients and for the development of potential new therapies. In clinical practice, six major organ systems - the cardiovascular (including the microcirculation), respiratory, renal, neurological, haematological and hepatic systems - can be assessed and monitored, whereas others, such as the gut, are less accessible. Over the past 2 decades, considerable amounts of new data have helped improve our understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, including the regulation of inflammatory pathways and the role played by immune suppression during sepsis. The effects of impaired cellular function, including mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cell death mechanisms, on the development of organ dysfunction are also being unravelled. Insights have been gained into interactions between key organs (such as the kidneys and the gut) and organ-organ crosstalk during sepsis. The important role of the microcirculation in sepsis is increasingly apparent, and new techniques have been developed that make it possible to visualize the microcirculation at the bedside, although these techniques are only research tools at present.

### Organ dysfunction during sepsis [^f1f271e3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the commonest reason for sepsis-associated mortality.

Discussion

In the 40 years since it was first described understanding of its pathophysiology has improved, and novel methodologies for monitoring and severity of illness scoring have emerged. These, together with the development of systematic strategies for managing organ dysfunction in sepsis, and potentially effective new therapeutic interventions, should assist in reducing sepsis-associated mortality.

Conclusion

These historical developments are discussed, and the reader is directed to these references for further guidance.

### Sepsis-induced immunosuppression: from cellular dysfunctions to immunotherapy [^f837791b]. Nature Reviews: Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Sepsis - which is a severe life-threatening infection with organ dysfunction - initiates a complex interplay of host pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes. Sepsis can be considered a race to the death between the pathogens and the host immune system, and it is the proper balance between the often competing pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways that determines the fate of the individual. Although the field of sepsis research has witnessed the failure of many highly touted clinical trials, a better understanding of the pathophysiological basis of the disorder and the mechanisms responsible for the associated pro- and anti-inflammatory responses provides a novel approach for treating this highly lethal condition. Biomarker-guided immunotherapy that is administered to patients at the proper immune phase of sepsis is potentially a major advance in the treatment of sepsis and in the field of infectious disease.

### Biomarkers of sepsis [^2d5e464d]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A complex network of biological mediators underlies the clinical syndrome of sepsis. The nonspecific physiologic criteria of sepsis syndrome or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome do not adequately identify patients who might benefit from either conventional anti-infective therapies or from novel therapies that target specific mediators of sepsis. Validated biomarkers of sepsis may improve diagnosis and therapeutic decision making for these high-risk patients.

Objectives

To develop a methodologic framework for the identification and validation of biomarkers of sepsis.

Methods

A small group meeting of experts in clinical epidemiology, biomarker development, and sepsis clinical trials; selective narrative review of the biomarker literature.

Results

The utility of a biomarker is a function of the degree to which it adds value to the available clinical information in the domains of screening, diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of the response to therapy. We identified needs for greater standardization of biomarker methodologies, greater methodologic rigor in biomarker studies, wider integration of biomarkers into clinical studies (in particular, early phase studies), and increased collaboration among investigators, pharmaceutical industry, biomarker industry, and regulatory agencies.

Conclusions

Biomarkers promise to transform sepsis from a physiologic syndrome to a group of distinct biochemical disorders. This transformation could aid therapeutic decision making, and hence improve the prognosis for patients with sepsis, but will require an unprecedented degree of systematic investigation and collaboration.

### A pairwise cytokine code explains the organism-wide response to sepsis [^ec6e7c7a]. Nature Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Main

Molecules, cells and tissues with immune functions are ubiquitous in the body. While the organismal nature of the immune system is vital for the host against infection, the systemic dysregulation of immune processes in response to infectious and noninfectious triggers can be harmful. For example, sepsis is a systemic host response to infection with life-threatening consequences. The disease is a global health issue in need of targeted therapies addressing the short-term and long-term effects on the host –. Our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the impact of sepsis on the body is rudimentary, as highlighted by expert consensus in the field of sepsis. The timing and location of events that take place across organs other than blood during sepsis remain unclear. Sepsis is thus a clear example for which learning the multifactorial effects of the disease on the molecules, cells and tissues of the whole body is critically important for basic and clinical sciences.

A myriad of cells and molecules has been linked to sepsis. Numerous studies have established immune and endothelial cells together with cytokines and the complement and coagulation systems as key cellular and molecular factors in the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, the links between the molecular and cellular factors that produce the damaging impact of sepsis for the body have not been systematically mapped. For example, the uncontrolled, systemic activity of cytokines contributes to tissue injury and organ failure, but it is unclear which cytokines — alone or in combination — impact which cells and tissues across the body. This gap in knowledge is due to features of the cytokine language that make it hard to decode, such as the variations in concentrations (local and systemic), activities (pro-inflammatory, anti-inflammatory or both for any given cytokine), and interactions within a mixture of cytokines present in a tissue. As a result, we lack a unifying framework to understand how the cytokine network functions in sepsis, including the network's target cells, hierarchy, interactions and feedback loops.

### Sepsis: a roadmap for future research [^40487413]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a common and lethal syndrome: although outcomes have improved, mortality remains high. No specific anti-sepsis treatments exist; as such, management of patients relies mainly on early recognition allowing correct therapeutic measures to be started rapidly, including administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control measures when necessary, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs when needed. Although substantial developments have been made in the understanding of the basic pathogenesis of sepsis and the complex interplay of host, pathogen, and environment that affect the incidence and course of the disease, sepsis has stubbornly resisted all efforts to successfully develop and then deploy new and improved treatments. Existing models of clinical research seem increasingly unlikely to produce new therapies that will result in a step change in clinical outcomes. In this Commission, we set out our understanding of the clinical epidemiology and management of sepsis and then ask how the present approaches might be challenged to develop a new roadmap for future research.

### The pathophysiology of sepsis-associated AKI [^1100bb00]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Sepsis-associated AKI is a life-threatening complication that is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients who are critically ill. Although it is clear early supportive interventions in sepsis reduce mortality, it is less clear that they prevent or ameliorate sepsis-associated AKI. This is likely because specific mechanisms underlying AKI attributable to sepsis are not fully understood. Understanding these mechanisms will form the foundation for the development of strategies for early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis-associated AKI. Here, we summarize recent laboratory and clinical studies, focusing on critical factors in the pathophysiology of sepsis-associated AKI: microcirculatory dysfunction, inflammation, NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, microRNAs, extracellular vesicles, autophagy and efferocytosis, inflammatory reflex pathway, vitamin D, and metabolic reprogramming. Lastly, identifying these molecular targets and defining clinical subphenotypes will permit precision approaches in the prevention and treatment of sepsis-associated AKI.

### Unraveling the role of HIF-1 α in sepsis: from pathophysiology to potential therapeutics-a narrative review [^a92d2ed2]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is a complex and multifaceted condition triggered by infection, leading to a series of pathological, physiological, and molecular alterations in the body. As both basic and clinical research on sepsis advance, the understanding and characterization of this condition undergo continuous refinement and expansion. The evolution of the sepsis definition can be traced from its initial description in Sepsis 1.0, which defined sepsis as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) resulting from infection. This progressed in Sepsis 2.0, which integrated clinical symptoms and signs into the assessment of Sepsis 1.0. Subsequently, Sepsis 3.0 redefined sepsis as a life-threatening condition arising from an uncontrolled inflammatory response to infection, coupled with life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by the same. The evolution of the concept of sepsis mirrors an advancement in the understanding of the disease, shifting from the examination of external signs and symptoms to the exploration of molecular-level abnormalities inherent to sepsis.

Hypoxia is a prevalent pathophysiological alteration observed in sepsis. Heightened inflammatory responses increase vascular permeability, resulting in acute pulmonary edema and subsequent development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Moreover, organ dysfunction in septic patients arises from ineffective perfusion to organ tissues due to vascular endothelial damage, cellular dysfunction, and activation of the coagulation system, leading to intravascular microthrombosis and subsequent macrocirculatory and microcirculatory failure. Furthermore, inadequate perfusion exacerbates hypoxia and compromises cellular oxygen utilization. Hypoxia acts as the link connecting the pathophysiological changes in sepsis to the molecular alterations of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Specifically, HIF-1α levels are intricately regulated by oxygen, undergoing degradation under normoxic conditions and accumulation in hypoxic environments. HIF-1α is a heterodimeric protein complex that serves as a critical regulator of the cellular response to physiological hypoxia and infection, exerting diverse pathophysiological effects at the cellular, tissue, and organismal levels. The aim of this review is to elucidate the role of HIF-1α and its related mechanisms in the initiation, progression, and immune response of sepsis, as well as to evaluate its potential therapeutic implications.

### Recent advances in pathophysiology and biomarkers of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury [^7a705b3a]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to an infective insult. This process often leads to widespread tissue injury and multiple organ dysfunction. In particular, the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most frequent complications, which increases the complexity and cost of care, and is an independent risk factor for mortality. Previous suggestions highlighting systemic hypotension, renal vasoconstriction and ischaemia-reperfusion injury as the primary pathophysiological mechanisms involved in sepsis-induced AKI have been challenged. Recently it has been shown that sepsis-induced AKI occurs in the setting of microvascular dysfunction with release of microparticles, inflammation and energetic adaptation of highly metabolic organs to cellular stress. The intolerable high mortality rate associated with sepsis-induced AKI is partially explained by an incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology and a delay in diagnosis. The aim of this review is to focus on advances in understanding the sepsis pathophysiology, with particular attention to the fundamental mechanisms of sepsis-induced AKI and the potential diagnostic and prognostic markers involved.

### The role of transcriptomics in redefining critical illness [^e7a59b34]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Transcriptomes: An Indispensable Player in Unraveling the Mechanisms of Sepsis

The growing body of data on sepsis pathophysiology has revealed an unprecedented level of molecular complexity. Such intricate analyses may initially appear to be far removed from the observable clinical characteristics of the critically ill patient. However, it is at this mechanistic level where a profound source of heterogeneity is discovered, providing a fresh outlook on developing rapid and precise methods for managing septic patients. While it is outside the scope of this chapter to investigate the pathophysiology in detail, highlighting the key cellular processes involved assists in understanding the governing role of transcriptomes.

Overview of the Molecular Pathophysiology of Sepsis

The host response to sepsis begins with detecting the invading microorganism via pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These foreign antigens interact directly with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present at the cell surface or intracellularly. This recognition event transduces the pathogenic signal to the cell nucleus through multiple pathways. A core example involves nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, which regulates the transcription of early-activation genes that code for a myriad of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This inflammatory network is crucial for the activation of innate immune cells and subsequent signaling cascades that ultimately serve to eliminate invading pathogens from the host. During early sepsis, however, this response is abruptly upregulated, leading to systemic inflammation that can beget endothelial damage, increased vascular permeability, hypercoagulation and metabolic dysfunction. Reciprocal damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released from dying cells perpetuate the inflammatory and innate immune response. The secretion of inflammatory mediators is therefore amplified, resulting in sustained tissue inflammation and injury from excessive leukocyte infiltration. End organ dysfunction manifests consequently, with complications like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute kidney injury (AKI), cardiomyopathy, and encephalopathy commonly experienced. Many patients also develop secondary immunosuppression, typically characterized by a concurrent production of anti-inflammatory cytokines to compensate for the overwhelming proinflammatory response. An enhanced anti-inflammatory response is regulated by molecular pathways that result in widespread loss of immune cells and an impaired capacity for antigen presentation. Thus, immunosuppressed patients are subservient to ongoing primary infection, the development of secondary infection, and viral reactivation.

### Unraveling the role of HIF-1 α in sepsis: from pathophysiology to potential therapeutics-a narrative review [^dde4f69a]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is characterized by organ dysfunction resulting from a dysregulated inflammatory response triggered by infection, involving multifactorial and intricate molecular mechanisms. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a notable transcription factor, assumes a pivotal role in the onset and progression of sepsis. This review aims to furnish a comprehensive overview of HIF-1α's mechanism of action in sepsis, scrutinizing its involvement in inflammatory regulation, hypoxia adaptation, immune response, and organ dysfunction. The review encompasses an analysis of the structural features, regulatory activation, and downstream signaling pathways of HIF-1α, alongside its mechanism of action in the pathophysiological processes of sepsis. Furthermore, it will delve into the roles of HIF-1α in modulating the inflammatory response, including its association with inflammatory mediators, immune cell activation, and vasodilation. Additionally, attention will be directed toward the regulatory function of HIF-1α in hypoxic environments and its linkage with intracellular signaling, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage. Finally, the potential therapeutic value of HIF-1α as a targeted therapy and its significance in the clinical management of sepsis will be discussed, aiming to serve as a significant reference for an in-depth understanding of sepsis pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets, as well as to establish a theoretical foundation for clinical applications.

### Advances in the understanding and treatment of sepsis-induced immunosuppression [^3bcab5ce]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2018). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction that is caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis can induce acute kidney injury and multiple organ failures and represents the most common cause of death in the intensive care unit. Sepsis initiates a complex immune response that varies over time, with the concomitant occurrence of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. As a result, most patients with sepsis rapidly display signs of profound immunosuppression, which is associated with deleterious consequences. Scientific advances have highlighted the role of metabolic failure, epigenetic reprogramming, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, immature suppressive neutrophils and immune alterations in primary lymphoid organs (the thymus and bone marrow) in sepsis. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying this immunosuppression as well as of the similarities between sepsis-induced immunosuppression and immune defects in cancer or immunosenescence has led to novel therapeutic strategies aimed at stimulating immune function in patients with sepsis. Trials assessing the therapeutic benefit of IL-7, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL1) for the treatment of sepsis are in progress. The reappraisal of sepsis pathophysiology has also resulted in a novel approach to the design of clinical trials evaluating sepsis treatments, based on an evaluation of the immune status and biomarker-based stratification of patients.

### The late phase of sepsis is characterized by an increased microbiological burden and death rate [^b1a96a7a]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The time course of disease in a large population of patients suffering from severe sepsis or septic shock was characterized by three different mortality peaks, which suggests that these patients undergo phases which may also be dominated by different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

- The late phase of sepsis is characterized by a significant resurgence of positive blood culture findings, which underlines the importance of the innate immune responses in this phase.

- Positive microbiological findings of opportunistic bacteria and Candida spp. increase over the length of ICU stay in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

- In sepsis, diagnostic tools monitoring the immune status as well as therapies aimed at restoring the immune response are urgently needed.

### Lipopolysaccharide: an endotoxin or an exogenous hormone? [^1a5a0584]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Conventional models of the pathogenesis of sepsis assume that microorganisms or their products are necessarily injurious to the host. In contrast, an evolutionary perspective suggests that host-microbial interactions are a symbiotic model and that disease results from the disruption of a mutually beneficial homeostatic state. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria is a prototypical trigger of sepsis and a target for the development of novel therapeutics. The biological mechanisms underlying the recognition of, and response to, LPS are more characteristic of a hormone than of a toxin. All mammals carry endogenous stores of LPS and express dedicated carrier proteins, a cellular receptor complex, and mechanisms that specifically antagonize the response to LPS. Disruption of any component of this complex recognition system jeopardizes host defenses against infection with exogenous microorganisms. Thus, LPS is not less an endotoxin than an exohormone, and its neutralization may potentially result in either benefit or harm.

### The role of the endothelium in severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^4b02661f]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis, defined as sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The development of novel therapies for sepsis is critically dependent on an understanding of the basic mechanisms of the disease. The pathophysiology of severe sepsis involves a highly complex, integrated response that includes the activation of a number of cell types, inflammatory mediators, and the hemostatic system. Central to this process is an alteration of endothelial cell function. The goals of this article are to (1) provide an overview of sepsis and its complications, (2) discuss the role of the endothelium in orchestrating the host response in sepsis, and (3) emphasize the potential value of the endothelium as a target for sepsis therapy.

### Fourth Surviving Sepsis Campaign's hemodynamic recommendations: a step forward or a return to chaos? [^2d5497c8]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Important knowledge on the pathophysiology of septic shock has been built up over decades of experimental and clinical research. Translation of these scientific foundations into clinical practice has, however, been slow and erratic. For such a condition with a mortality risk of at least 30–40%, we should expect the rationale of consensus recommendations to be firmly grounded on pathophysiology. Our opinion is that some of the recent SSC's hemodynamic recommendations move far away from this objective and might not constitute a valuable contribution to improve septic shock morbidity or mortality.

### Unraveling the role of HIF-1 α in sepsis: from pathophysiology to potential therapeutics-a narrative review [^ee075289]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and prospect

HIF-1α plays a crucial role in sepsis, and its activation is closely tied not only to intracellular hypoxia but also to the inflammatory process and immune regulation. During sepsis, the activation of HIF-1α governs the host's adaptive response to hypoxia and influences the release of inflammatory mediators, as well as the balance between anti-inflammatory and immune tolerance states. Furthermore, HIF-1α activation is implicated in regulating a spectrum of pathophysiological processes, including mitochondrial function and apoptosis. Future studies can explore the molecular mechanisms and pathways of HIF-1α in sepsis, with the potential to reveal new targets and strategies for the early diagnosis and treatment of sepsis.

Question 5: What Mechanisms Initiate, Sustain, and Terminate Recovery After Sepsis?

The phrase "recovery from sepsis" can have a broad meaning. On an organism, wide level recovery can mean survival, reversal of organ dysfunction, or resumption of premorbid activities. Control/elimination of the focus of infection is required but it is by no means sufficient. Indeed, organ dysfunction can persist for a prolonged period afterward; some sepsis-induced abnormalities may never fully resolve. Overall, recovery likely reflects reversal of a vast array of maladaptive cellular, subcellular, and biochemical changes that develop during sepsis. These alterations involve metabolism, dysfunction in organelles, in particular mitochondria, attenuation of intracellular signal transduction pathways and decrement in the activity of WBCs, neuronal pathways and endocrine responses that are responsible for the transfer information from one part of the organism to another.

Despite reports that describe the events occurring during recovery or lack of recovery, the specific mechanisms that initiate recovery are unknown. It is possible that recovery represents an extension of Darwinian theory: sepsis resolves and the fittest cells/patients survive by implementing general mechanisms of protection. Alternatively, it may be that specific molecules/processes/events directly promote recovery from sepsis. Or perhaps recovery represents a combination of both.

A) What immunological processes contribute to recovery from sepsis?

In contrast to a substantial body of work describing the resolution of "normal" or "balanced" inflammation, much about the reversal of the unique inflammatory state present in sepsis is poorly understood. Perhaps the greatest hindrance lies in a limited ability to characterize that state. To some extent, sepsis resembles an exaggeration of normal inflammation, with expression of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Other aspects, such as white cell bacterial engulfment and bacterial killing, are impaired. However, the combination of immune excess and immure incompetence characteristic of sepsis is strikingly unusual. It is logical to assume that the resolution of sepsis will be similarly difficult to understand. Thus, the complexity of the issue is apparent and requires attention.

1) Do anti-inflammatory cytokines contribute to recovery after sepsis? If so, how?

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^f840912b]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Sepsis is a severe medical condition characterized by a systemic inflammatory response, often culminating in multiple organ dysfunction and high mortality rates. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the pivotal role played by mitochondrial damage in driving the progression of sepsis. Various factors contribute to mitochondrial impairment during sepsis, encompassing mechanisms such as reactive nitrogen/oxygen species generation, mitophagy inhibition, mitochondrial dynamics change, and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Damaged mitochondria actively participate in shaping the inflammatory milieu by triggering key signaling pathways, including those mediated by Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and cyclic GMP-AMP synthase. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in developing therapeutic strategies targeting mitochondria to mitigate septic pathogenesis. This review aims to delve into the intricate mechanisms underpinning mitochondrial dysfunction during sepsis and its significant impact on immune dysregulation. Moreover, we spotlight promising mitochondria-targeted interventions that have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in preclinical sepsis models.

### Conventional and unconventional T-cell responses contribute to the prediction of clinical outcome and causative bacterial pathogen in sepsis patients [^bf01a5fa]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

There is a growing realization in the field that the current definition of sepsis is inadequate, which draws focus to the dysregulated host response as the characterizing feature of sepsis. In fact, most clinical trials that sought to restore the immune balance have either failed to show benefit or have proven harmful. The complicated patterns of clinical presentation represent a barrier to the advancement of diagnosis and therapy, while the Sepsis-3 definition cannot distinguish the complex heterogeneity observed in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Research into COVID-19, a condition that has many parallels to sepsis, has reported success in uncovering immunological signatures associated with poor outcomes with links back to the underlying biological mechanisms. Thus, focusing on a well-defined pathology within sepsis is likely to yield findings more readily associated with the underlying mechanism driving the immune response. Any future study expanding on the work discussed here should carefully consider the exact recruitment strategy. Reflecting on the success of immunophenotyping of COVID-19, simple strategies could be employed to limit recruitment to those of comparable aetiology, such as culture-positive urosepsis or acute lower respiratory infection. However, this poses the general dilemma of whether to conduct studies in a well-defined but relatively artificial cohort with strict inclusion or exclusion criteria, which will be best suited to define pathophysiological pathways specific for certain subtypes of sepsis, or rather to focus on common mechanisms and biomarkers in an inclusive real-world scenario as it presents in the clinic. Alternatively, a robust recruitment approach might leverage unsupervised clustering and the identification of endotypes that could be treated as distinct yet overlapping groups. In the future, sepsis is likely to be recognized not as an all-embracing syndrome but rather as a group of related conditions, each characterized by specific cellular alterations and associated biomarkers.

1) What causes the increased metabolic rate noted in sepsis?
2) What mechanisms mediate alterations in oxidative phosphorylation? In particular, what underlies the altered activity in specific ETC complexes?
3) What mechanisms alter sepsis-induced changes in pathway (e.g. glycolysis, beta-oxidation, nitrogen cycle), substrate (e.g. carbohydrate, fat, protein, micronutrient), and/or cell (e.g. cardiomyocyte, hepatocyte) specific metabolism?
4) What mechanisms underlie sepsis-induced defects in endocrine activity?
5) How does sepsis affect brain circuits that control metabolism?
6) How do cytokines alter metabolic pathways?
7) Do metabolic pathways influence inflammation, and if so, how?

9) Are defects affecting energetics present only in mitochondria or are there also changes in other subcellular structures?
10) Is obesity protective against sepsis? Why are results in human sepsis and animal models discrepant?

Question 3: How Do the Microbiota and the Microbiome Contribute to the Pathobiology of Sepsis?

What Is Known.

In a number of disease states, pathology is determined by an alteration in the interactions between the host and its complex microbial ecosystem. These changes, which likely affect outcomes of critically ill and septic patients, are the subjects of intense clinical and basic science investigations. The development of culture-independent methods to detect microbial genes has revolutionized this research and greatly enhanced microbe identification. We now appreciate the enormous diversity of microbial species (microbiota) and microbial genomes (microbiome) that exist within human ecosystems (e.g. GI tract [gut], lungs, skin, etc.), as well as the importance of the microbiome to human health and disease. It has become clear that the gut microbiome plays an important role in patients with sepsis, suggesting that the microbiome and host-microbiome interactions may be therapeutic targets.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^1a1b4d4f]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Sepsis varies in its clinical manifestations over time, which necessitates different requirements for identification of sepsis across the various stages of its progression. In the early phases, clinicians may have limited information available, but require criteria to make a presumptive diagnosis that is sufficient to implement effective therapeutic approaches. At later stages, clinicians usually have access to substantive information, including results of diagnostic testing, clinical progression, and response to therapy, to allow a definitive diagnosis. This concept enables clinicians to consider parameters for early initiation of antibiotic therapy, while allowing early termination of antibiotic therapy, once additional information allows for reevaluation of the diagnosis and risk. To ensure widespread adoption and patient benefit, criteria for sepsis should correlate with clinically relevant intervention points (e.g. invasive bacterial infection = antibiotic therapy, organ dysfunction = organ support therapy), as well as the risk of mortality in each situation.

Sepsis represents a broad umbrella term covering a condition that may be caused by a wide range of pathogens (bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic). There are no simple and unambiguous clinical, biological, imaging, or laboratory features that uniquely identify a patient with sepsis. The lack of rapid and reliable sepsis tests hampers the ability to make a definitive diagnosis of life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, at the time of presentation.

Dysregulation of host response includes imbalances in proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory states driven by the innate and adaptive immune systems and contributing to new or worsening organ injury and death. The adult Sepsis-3 criteria emphasize the importance of identification of organ dysfunction in patients with infection and have led to research that improves our mechanistic understanding of the pathobiology of sepsis, including infection-specific biology and responses to specific interventions. In this context, phenotyping using biological and clinical characteristics, and specific pathophysiology, has great potential to be employed as an enrichment strategy in the evaluation of treatment responses.

### Mechanisms and regulation of the gene-expression response to sepsis [^a1d7642a]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as the systemic inflammatory response of the human host that is triggered by an invading pathogen. Despite tremendous advances in both our knowledge of and treatment strategies for this syndrome, sepsis remains among the major causes of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Thus, we hypothesize that an improved mechanistic understanding obtained via basic and translational science will continue to identify novel therapeutic targets and approaches. As a result, given the central importance of the alterations in gene expression in regulating the human host's physiologic response to a pathogen, we review the complex factors-genetics, transcriptional expression, and epigenetics-that regulate unique gene-expression patterns in pediatric sepsis and septic shock. We anticipate that emerging data from genetic, genomic, and other translation studies in pediatric sepsis will advance our biological understanding of this response and undoubtedly identify targets for newer therapies.

### Septic shock [^72d870e9]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Septic shock, the most severe complication of sepsis, is a deadly disease. In recent years, exciting advances have been made in the understanding of its pathophysiology and treatment. Pathogens, via their microbial-associated molecular patterns, trigger sequential intracellular events in immune cells, epithelium, endothelium, and the neuroendocrine system. Proinflammatory mediators that contribute to eradication of invading microorganisms are produced, and anti-inflammatory mediators control this response. The inflammatory response leads to damage to host tissue, and the anti-inflammatory response causes leucocyte reprogramming and changes in immune status. The time-window for interventions is short, and treatment must promptly control the source of infection and restore haemodynamic homoeostasis. Further research is needed to establish which fluids and vasopressors are best. Some patients with septic shock might benefit from drugs such as corticosteroids or activated protein C. Other therapeutic strategies are under investigation, including those that target late proinflammatory mediators, endothelium, or the neuroendocrine system.

### Sepsis and the heart [^fd072e0e]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis is generally viewed as a disease aggravated by an inappropriate immune response encountered in the afflicted individual. As an important organ system frequently compromised by sepsis and always affected by septic shock, the cardiovascular system and its dysfunction during sepsis have been studied in clinical and basic research for more than 5 decades. Although a number of mediators and pathways have been shown to be associated with myocardial depression in sepsis, the precise cause remains unclear to date. There is currently no evidence supporting global ischemia as an underlying cause of myocardial dysfunction in sepsis; however, in septic patients with coexistent and possibly undiagnosed coronary artery disease, regional myocardial ischemia or infarction secondary to coronary artery disease may certainly occur. A circulating myocardial depressant factor in septic shock has long been proposed, and potential candidates for a myocardial depressant factor include cytokines, prostanoids, and nitric oxide, among others. Endothelial activation and induction of the coagulatory system also contribute to the pathophysiology in sepsis. Prompt and adequate antibiotic therapy accompanied by surgical removal of the infectious focus, if indicated and feasible, is the mainstay and also the only strictly causal line of therapy. In the presence of severe sepsis and septic shock, supportive treatment in addition to causal therapy is mandatory. The purpose of this review is to delineate some characteristics of septic myocardial dysfunction, to assess the most commonly cited and reported underlying mechanisms of cardiac dysfunction in sepsis, and to briefly outline current therapeutic strategies and possible future approaches.

### The late phase of sepsis is characterized by an increased microbiological burden and death rate [^5ce299e1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite aggressive supportive care to improve treatment options and outcome, sepsis and its sequelae remain a leading cause of death in intensive care units. Extensive studies investigating the host responses during sepsis have revealed that the late phase of sepsis is dominated by a status of immune suppression with respect to missing or widespread depressed innate, as well as adaptive, immune defense mechanisms. Since various authors introduced the intriguing model of a phase-dependent variation of immune activity, the concept of an anergic immune system is held responsible as a principal mechanism and cause of death in patients with sepsis. However, the concept itself, but more the impact of sequential hyper- and hypo-inflammatory phases, has been discussed controversially. The lack of tools assessing the individual immune status of patients at the bedside and the complex pathophysiological processes, which are often overlapping, have so far limited the meaning of such concepts describing hyper- and hypo-inflammatory immune phases for the clinician. Confirmatory studies demonstrating the clinical significance, especially of the so-called late phase in sepsis, are largely missing. We, therefore, thought to investigate whether a so-called late phase during the course of sepsis would be accompanied by higher death rates and higher rates of positive blood culture results, especially by typically opportunistic bacteria. The latter might be interpreted as a hint for an underlying immune suppressive status, which has been suggested by many studies investigating separate immune defense mechanisms in patients suffering from sepsis.

### Mechanisms of disease: mechanisms and clinical implications of cholestasis in sepsis [^fb09df37]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Medium credibility.

Cholestasis is a common complication in patients with extrahepatic bacterial infection and sepsis. This article gives a comprehensive overview of the molecular and cellular mechanisms of sepsis-associated cholestasis. Recent advances in the understanding of intrahepatic cholestasis have allowed us to delineate the molecular mechanisms that underlie sepsis-associated cholestasis and to describe their potential clinical and therapeutic applications. The mechanisms and clinical presentation of sepsis-associated liver injury vary according to the severity of the bacterial infection. Proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide cause cholestasis by impairing hepatocellular and ductal bile formation. Ischemic liver injury and, rarely, progressive sclerosing cholangitis can also be found in patients with septic shock, or major trauma with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Treatment is mainly focused on eradication of the underlying infection and managing the sepsis. The use of ursodeoxycholic acid or extracorporeal liver support as treatments for sepsis-associated cholestasis is under investigation, but neither can be recommended in routine clinical practice at present. Patients with progressive sclerosing cholangitis should be considered for orthotopic liver transplantation.

### Sepsis endotypes identified by host gene expression across global cohorts [^7e990853]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection. The signs and symptoms of sepsis are highly variable and typically nonspecific, including aberrations in vital signs like tachycardia and tachypnea alongside indications of organ dysfunction, such as altered mental status, hypotension, and renal dysfunction, potentially leading to shock and death. The infecting pathogen, pathogen load, site of infection, comorbidities, and immunological response by the patient contribute to the clinical presentation and course of disease resulting in a complex heterogeneous syndrome. In addition, the model for host response to sepsis has evolved from a simplified linear hyperinflammatory phase followed by a compensatory anti-inflammatory phase to a more complex paradigm where pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms are acting in concert. The failure to develop effective therapeutics and the limited success in developing diagnostic or prognostic tests are often attributed to this clinical and immunological heterogeneity.

### Kidney histopathology in lethal human sepsis [^261e1fcc]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a severe and frequent clinical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU) with an associated mortality rate varying between 35 and 50% in septic shock. The host response to infection leads to organ failure in patients with sepsis. One of the severely affected organs is the kidney, with sepsis being the leading cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically ill patients. Moreover, patients with sepsis-AKI are twice as likely to die as patients with sepsis without AKI.

For a long time, acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to hypoxia together with the severe hyperinflammatory response were thought to be the main drivers of renal failure in patients with sepsis-AKI. Renal tubuli have a marginal oxygen supply combined with high oxygen consumption, yet a reduction in renal blood flow below critical limits is not uniformly reported in clinical sepsis-AKI studies. Additionally, hemodynamic impairment has not been found to be the main driver of renal failure in patients with sepsis. During the last three decades numerous clinical trials targeting supposedly pathophysiological mediators within the devastating cascade of inflammatory mediators in sepsis have failed to improve patient outcome. As a result, mortality in sepsis remains unacceptably high. This failure undermines the validity of the hypothetical causality of these mediators in sepsis and underscores the limited understanding of the pathogenesis of sepsis and resulting organ dysfunction. Recently, an elegant sheep model of gram-negative sepsis with intensive care treatment, combined with sequential biopsies, also suggested that hypoxia and inflammation cannot fully explain sepsis-AKI. Histological data addressing morphological damage such as ATN in patients with sepsis-AKI are scarce. In the past, most data were acquired from post-mortem studies conducted hours or even days after death. As a result, tissue autolysis and post-mortem processes may have hampered pathophysiological interpretation. However, recently 2 important studies reported histopathological findings on post-mortem biopsies taken immediately after death. Collectively, the available human tissue data also do not support the hypothesis that hypoxia and inflammation are the major underlying causes of sepsis-AKI, since only limited inflammation, coagulation and cell death have been identified. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of AKI in patients with sepsis is indispensable for the development of a therapy that will improve outcome. Therefore, renewed orientation on human tissue with a broader scope might reveal additional pathophysiological mechanisms.

### Understanding, assessing and treating immune, endothelial and haemostasis dysfunctions in bacterial sepsis [^78ce9f10]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The interplay between the immune system, coagulation, and endothelium is critical in regulating the host response to infection. However, in sepsis and other critical illnesses, a dysregulated immune response can lead to excessive alterations in these mechanisms, resulting in coagulopathy, endothelial dysfunction, and multi-organ dysfunction. This review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the pathophysiological mechanisms that govern the complex interplay between immune dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation in sepsis. It emphasises clinical significance, evaluation methods, and potential therapeutic interventions. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing effective treatments that can modulate the immune response, mitigate thrombosis, restore endothelial function, and ultimately improve patient survival.

### Pyroptotic death storms and cytopenia [^cbf14562]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

For over two decades, we have embraced the cytokine storm theory to explain sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock. The failure of numerous large-scale clinical trials, which aimed to treat sepsis by neutralizing inflammatory cytokines and LPS, indicates that alternative pathophysiological mechanisms are likely to account for sepsis and the associated immune suppression in patients with severe infection. Recent insights that extricate pyroptotic death from inflammatory cytokine production in vivo have highlighted a need to investigate the consequences of apoptotic and non-apoptotic death in contributing to cytopenia and immune suppression. In this review, we will focus on the biochemical and cellular mechanisms controlling pyroptosis, a Caspase-1/11 dependent form of cell death during infection.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^7aa4c19d]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The pathogenesis of sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune system and the infecting microorganisms. Sepsis describes a broad-based syndrome covering many infectious agents, affecting various sites in patients of differing age, gender, and comorbidity. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and death. Despite remarkable advances in the management of patients with sepsis, its recognition and timely, appropriate treatment remain of utmost importance.

The Sepsis-3 definitions underline the concept of a dysregulated immune response resulting in potentially modifiable life-threatening organ dysfunction. However, they may fail in identifying patients with serious infections before organ dysfunction ensues.

Downplaying infections that do not meet the current Sepsis-3 criteria may hinder their identification, resulting in an unnecessary increase in both morbidity and mortality due to their inexorable progression in the following hours.

Clear definitions for sepsis and septic shock should guide clinicians both to support early recognition of at-risk patients and to facilitate an understanding of the global epidemiology of sepsis.

Sepsis is a burden for global health. Its global nature calls for a global response, both in the geographic sense and across the whole range of sectors involved.

In this paper, we have raised our concerns regarding the Sepsis-3 definitions. We believe that in order for sepsis definitions to be universally accepted, they should facilitate clinical care on a global scale.

On Friday, May 26th, 2017, the World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization made sepsis a global health priority, by adopting a resolution to improve, prevent, diagnose, and manage sepsis.

The Global Alliance for Infections in Surgery suggests that future revisions have a more global perspective and include a wider range of representatives and expertise. We also hope our comments can serve as a basis for future discussions on how to further improve the definitions of the sepsis continuum.

### The pathophysiological basis and consequences of fever [^517dec06]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

A mild elevation in core temperature is of benefit in sepsis. Non-pyrogenic hyperthermia is associated with short-term, medium-term, and long-term effects in a variety of organs. The damage occurs via a number of local and systemic mechanisms. Additionally, there appears to be emerging evidence of an overlap in the mechanisms of heat generation in different conditions. The evidence is that in sepsis the beneficial effects of pyrexia may balance these deleterious factors. However, in non-sepsis, the accumulation of the deleterious consequences of hyperthermia occurs early, at even mild degrees of fever. Hyperthermia above 40 °C appears to carry a high mortality by whatever cause. Early recognition, immediate cooling, and organ support are the mainstays of treatment, and to this end an improved understanding of the pathophysiology will continue to develop.

### The immunopathogenesis of sepsis [^e09da507]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Sepsis is a condition that results from a harmful or damaging host response to infection. Many of the components of the innate immune response that are normally concerned with host defences against infection can, under some circumstances, cause cell and tissue damage and hence multiple organ failure, the clinical hallmark of sepsis. Because of the high mortality of sepsis in the face of standard treatment, many efforts have been made to improve understanding of the dysregulation of the host response in sepsis. As a result, much has been learnt of the basic principles governing bacterial-host interactions, and new opportunities for therapeutic intervention have been revealed.

### Sepsis-induced coagulopathy: a comprehensive narrative review of pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management strategies [^00db8549]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Physiological hemostasis is a balance between pro- and anticoagulant pathways, and in sepsis, this equilibrium is disturbed, resulting in systemic thrombin generation, impaired anticoagulant activity, and suppression of fibrinolysis, a condition termed sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC). SIC is a common complication, being present in 24% of patients with sepsis and 66% of patients with septic shock, and is often associated with poor clinical outcomes and high mortality. Recent preclinical and clinical studies have generated new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of SIC. In this article, we analyze the complex pathophysiology of SIC with a focus on the role of procoagulant innate immune signaling in hemostatic activation––tissue factor production, thrombin generation, endotheliopathy, and impaired antithrombotic functions. We also review clinical presentations of SIC, the diagnostic scoring system and laboratory tests, the current standard of care, and clinical trials evaluating the efficacies of anticoagulant therapies.

### Plasma proteomics identifies molecular subtypes in sepsis [^45e92ad6]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated immune response to an infection. It is a frequent cause of death in intensive care units (ICU) and represents a major burden in global healthcare with persistently high mortality rates. Up to now, the major improvements in sepsis therapy were based on the effective treatment of the underlying infection and supportive measures. All therapeutic approaches that specifically targeted molecular mechanisms in sepsis failed in large clinical trials. The major reason for this is seen in the fact that sepsis is a complex, multifactorial syndrome and patient subgroups that might benefit from the tested medication were masked by others in heterogeneous clinical cohorts. The concept of personalized medicine is based on the identification and treatment of only those patients that benefit from a therapy. This, however, requires accurate knowledge of the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease and appropriate markers for patient stratification.

In this respect, high throughput technologies can be used to screen patients for biomarkers and elucidate molecular disease mechanisms in an unbiased manner. Mass spectrometry-based plasma proteomics have emerged as a powerful analytical tool, giving access to large patient cohorts and a wide range of blood proteins. Despite these opportunities, studies that analyzed the blood proteome of septic patients remain comparably rare. A landmark study published in 2024 was the first with a cohort size that allowed the identification of patient subgroups representing molecular sepsis subtypes. This approach was complementary to others, that mostly used clinical standard parameters or transcriptomic data. The generalizability of phenotyping studies, however, remains questionable, especially between different geographic locations. We conclude that beyond the mere identification, the molecular and clinical characterization of subtypes is an absolute necessity to receive transferable insights. In addition, a deep characterization is crucial to elucidate the pathophysiological relevance of the observed subtypes and infer future therapeutic concepts.

In this study, we analyzed proteomics data from a multicenter cohort comprising 333 patients and samples collected at two time points in early sepsis. We applied cluster analysis and identified four sepsis plasma proteome subtypes and their trajectories between both time points. We present a deep characterization of the subtypes and their clinical characteristics. In addition, we developed a supervised machine learning model to allocate new patients to the proteome clusters based on a minimized number of features, demonstrating how proteome subtypes could be implemented in clinical practice in the future.

### The association of endothelial cell signaling, severity of illness, and organ dysfunction in sepsis [^94af0437]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent advances in biomedical research, sepsis remains an important medical challenge. An estimated 750,000 cases of severe sepsis are diagnosed each year in the United States alone, incurring health care costs of $16.7 billion annually. One major potential shortcoming of prior therapeutic approaches in sepsis is the attempt to target one specific pathway, component, or cytokine involved in the host response; however, the host response in sepsis is coordinated across multiple pathways including inflammation, coagulation, metabolism and tissue hypoxia. An important goal in sepsis research is to develop a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying the host response to infection, with the expectation that such studies will yield novel insights into potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

There is increasing evidence that the endothelium plays a central and pathogenic role in sepsis. Endothelial cells are diverse in function and highly responsive to their extracellular environment (reviewed in). When exposed to certain agonists, such as lipopolysaccharide, cytokines, chemokines or growth factors, endothelial cells become activated. The activation state is manifested by enhanced permeability, increased leukocyte adhesion, a shift in the hemostatic balance towards a procoagulant phenotype, and altered regulation of vasomotor tone. Collectively, these changes likely evolved as an adaptive host response to extravascular pathogens, allowing for increased blood flow to the area of insult, local efflux of plasma proteins and leukocytes, and sequestering of the infection. This activated state may be considered dysfunctional when an overactive endothelium disturbs the homeostatic state instead of restoring it, representing a net liability to the host. In this context, endothelial dysfunction typically involves some combination of increased leukocyte adhesion and transmigration, increased permeability, a shift in the hemostatic balance towards the procoagulant side and an alteration in vasomotor tone. In sepsis, endothelial activation and dysfunction are critical determinants of the host response and, thus, represent a unifying explanation for the complex sepsis pathophysiology, as well as an attractive target for systemic therapy.

### Sepsis biomarkers: a review [^65f00346]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

A multitude of biomarkers has been proposed in the field of sepsis, many more than in other disease processes; for example, a study of patients with myocardial infarction revealed 14 biomarkers suitable for diagnosis and determination of prognosis and in patients with Alzheimer's disease, just 8 biomarkers were identified. This large difference in the numbers of biomarkers for sepsis is likely to be related to the very complex pathophysiology of sepsis, which involves many mediators of inflammation, but also other pathophysiological mechanisms. Coagulation, complement, contact system activation, inflammation, and apoptosis are all involved in the sepsis process, and separate markers for each (part of each) system have been proposed (Tables 1 to 9). Additionally, the systemic nature of sepsis and the large numbers of cell types, tissues and organs involved expand the number of potential biomarker candidates, compared with disease processes that involve individual organs or are more localized.

### Dual effects and balanced regulation of cytokines in sepsis [^a868ad7d]. Trends in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition triggered by infection, disrupts the body's immune balance and remains a major global health challenge. This forum explores the dual roles of cytokines in sepsis: their overactivation drives 'cytokine storms', and dysregulation leads to immunosuppression. It also discusses regulatory mechanisms for developing targeted therapies.

### Neonatal sepsis and cardiovascular dysfunction I: mechanisms and pathophysiology [^9e7e724b]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The highest incidence of sepsis across all age groups occurs in neonates leading to substantial mortality and morbidity. Cardiovascular dysfunction frequently complicates neonatal sepsis including biventricular systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction, vasoregulatory failure, and pulmonary arterial hypertension. The haemodynamic response in neonatal sepsis can be hyperdynamic or hypodynamic and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are heterogeneous. The diagnosis and definition of both neonatal sepsis and cardiovascular dysfunction complicating neonatal sepsis are challenging and not consensus-based. Future developments in neonatal sepsis management will be facilitated by common definitions and datasets especially in neonatal cardiovascular optimisation. IMPACT: Cardiovascular dysfunction is common in neonatal sepsis but there is no consensus-based definition, making calculating the incidence and designing clinical trials challenging. Neonatal cardiovascular dysfunction is related to the inflammatory response, which can directly target myocyte function and systemic haemodynamics.

### Soluble adhesion molecules as markers for sepsis and the potential pathophysiological discrepancy in neonates, children and adults [^bce0a096]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a severe and life-threatening systemic inflammatory response to infection that affects all populations and age groups. The pathophysiology of sepsis is associated with aberrant interaction between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium. As inflammation progresses, the adhesion molecules that mediate these interactions become shed from cell surfaces and accumulate in the blood as soluble isoforms that are being explored as potential prognostic disease biomarkers. We critically review the studies that have tested the predictive value of soluble adhesion molecules in sepsis pathophysiology with emphasis on age, as well as the underlying mechanisms and potential roles for inflammatory shedding. Five soluble adhesion molecules are associated with sepsis, specifically, E-selectin, L-selectin and P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. While increased levels of these soluble adhesion molecules generally correlate well with the presence of sepsis, their degree of elevation is still poorly predictive of sepsis severity scores, outcome and mortality. Separate analyses of neonates, children and adults demonstrate significant age-dependent discrepancies in both basal and septic levels of circulating soluble adhesion molecules. Additionally, a range of both clinical and experimental studies suggests protective roles for adhesion molecule shedding that raise important questions about whether these should positively or negatively correlate with mortality. In conclusion, while predictive properties of soluble adhesion molecules have been researched intensively, their levels are still poorly predictive of sepsis outcome and mortality. We propose two novel directions for improving clinical utility of soluble adhesion molecules: the combined simultaneous analysis of levels of adhesion molecules and their sheddases; and taking age-related discrepancies into account. Further attention to these issues may provide better understanding of sepsis pathophysiology and increase the usefulness of soluble adhesion molecules as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers.

### Septic shock, multiple organ failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome [^d8cc8ff5]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

In 1914, Schottmueller wrote "Septicemia is a state of microbial invasion from a portal of entry into the blood stream which causes signs of illness". In the last few decades, the evidence that sepsis results from an exaggerated systemic inflammatory host response induced by infecting organisms is compelling; inflammatory mediators are the key players in the pathogenesis of septic shock and multiorgan failure. Sepsis and its sequelae represent a continuum of clinical syndrome encompassing systemic inflammation, coagulopathy, and hemodynamic abnormalities. Severe sepsis and septic shock continue to be the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States; sepsis deaths currently match mortality from myocardial infarction. Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology and technological innovations in the supportive management, mortality from septic shock remains excessive. After many disappointments with strategies to manipulate the inflammatory response, modulation of coagulation cascade to decrease sepsis mortality has become a clinical reality. This review will highlight and discuss recent advances in the pathophysiology and management of sepsis.

### Year in review 2013: critical care – sepsis [^b3848e93]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite intense experimental and clinical research activity over the past decades, sepsis still remains an elusive syndrome. Actual understanding has led to international recommendations on diagnosis and treatment, but management of severe sepsis and septic shock in the ICU still represents a major challenge for clinicians in 2014, with high mortality rates. The past year's contribution to the field of sepsis research was quite prolific, and the aim of this review is to summarise the relevant findings of research articles that were published in 2013 in Critical Care and other relevant journals. We focus on advances in the understanding of sepsis physiopathology, diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, potential new therapies, and epidemiologic and outcome studies.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in sepsis: mechanisms and therapeutic perspectives [^95b3fa0a]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Damaged mitochondria are potent triggers of immune response and metabolic reprogramming

The innate immune response plays a key role in the pathophysiology of sepsis. Upon activation, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) initiate signaling cascades, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), and other transcription factors. These transcription factors initiate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, type I interferons (IFNs), etc. In the past few decades, damaged mitochondria have been widely demonstrated as a crucial regulator of innate immunity, particularly through the NLRP3, TLR9, and cGAS pathways. Thus, mitochondria damage is not simply a passive outcome under stress conditions, but actively contributes to the inflammatory response that is essential for the defense of pathogens. However, in the context of sepsis, excessive or persistent inflammation can cause a fatal inflammatory imbalance in the body, which ultimately leads to tissue and organ damage. In this section, we will highlight the roles of mitochondria in regulating inflammatory pathways.

### SARS-CoV-2 and viral sepsis: observations and hypotheses [^29f26b23]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), clinicians have tried every effort to understand the disease, and a brief portrait of its clinical features have been identified. In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment.

### Bench-to-bedside review: angiopoietin signalling in critical illness-a future target? [^8b534169]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs in response to major insults such as sepsis, severe haemorrhage, trauma, major surgery and pancreatitis. The mortality rate is high despite intensive supportive care. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying MODS are not entirely clear, although several have been proposed. Overwhelming inflammation, immunoparesis, occult oxygen debt and other mechanisms have been investigated, and - despite many unanswered questions - therapies targeting these mechanisms have been developed. Unfortunately, only a few interventions, usually those targeting multiple mechanisms at the same time, have appeared to be beneficial. We clearly need to understand better the mechanisms that underlie MODS. The endothelium certainly plays an active role in MODS. It functions at the intersection of several systems, including inflammation, coagulation, haemodynamics, fluid and electrolyte balance, and cell migration. An important regulator of these systems is the angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling system. In this review we describe this signalling system, giving special attention to what is known about it in critically ill patients and its potential as a target for therapy.

### Identification and characterization of neutrophil heterogeneity in sepsis [^2f40344d]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis is a condition with high mortality and morbidity rates and is severe in bacterial infections, epidemic virus infections (such as severe COVID-19 infection), especially in intensive care patients. Many factors, such as genetics, age, sex, ethnicity, the number of dysfunctional organs, immune status and therapeutic efficacy, have been linked to survival outcomes in severe sepsis. With further research, the pathophysiology of sepsis has been gradually unveiled. However, the lack of effective clinical treatments leads to high mortality.

Immunosuppression may occur for a number of reasons related to an individual's frailty, disease or an inadequate response to infectious agents and a markedly increased prevalence of acute inflammatory-, sepsis- and infection-related death. Therefore, the balance of the immune system is essential for bacterial clearance and timely resolution of sepsis. At the early stage of infection, the immune system is activated and can effectively defend against various pathogenic factors, including microorganisms. However, dysfunction of the immune system gradually appears with the progression of the disease and causes immunosuppression. Immunosuppression is rather complicated and occurs in both cellular and humoral immunity. At present, understanding of the innate immune system in the occurrence and development of sepsis is further deepening, but many questions regarding the pathological mechanism remain.

### Immunity, inflammation and sepsis: new insights and persistent questions [^d2faf234]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Sepsis is now understood to affect a variety of changes in the host, chief among them being alterations in immune system function. Proper immune function involves a competent proinflammatory response to stimuli as well as a regulated counteracting force to restore homeostasis and prevent systemic inflammation and organ dysfunction. Broad-spectrum suppression of the inflammatory response has not been shown to be beneficial for patients suffering from septic disease. In fact, sepsis-related immune suppression has become increasingly recognized as an important contributor to late morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. Giamarellos-Bourboulis and colleagues detail the impaired ability of septic patients to produce proinflammatory cytokines upon ex vivo stimulation, and introduce altered caspase-1 activity as potentially contributory to this process. Proper understanding of the cellular and molecular events resulting in immune suppression following sepsis is important in the identification of new strategies for treatment and the ideal timing of therapy.

### The Surviving Sepsis Campaign: basic / translational science research priorities [^8895ee6f]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What Is Not Known — Gaps in Our Understanding — Directions for Future Research.

Sepsis is associated with impairment in a number of processes that contribute to resolution of normal/balanced inflammation. Does resolution of this defect contribute to recovery from sepsis? Or, conversely, does recovery from sepsis lead to resolution of these abnormalities?
Does the PD-1 pathway exacerbate sepsis pathobiology or does it enhance recovery?
Do lipid mediators, autophagy, or miRNA, which contribute to resolution of balanced inflammation, also contribute to recovery from sepsis?
Resolution of inflammation in states other than sepsis involves specific intracellular pathways and/or events in immune cells. Which of these events/intracellular pathways also contribute to resolution of sepsis? What pathways/events not involved in other states are important for resolution of inflammation in sepsis?
What events in immune cells that contribute to resolution of nonseptic inflammation promote sepsis-induced immunosuppression, thereby delaying the resolution of sepsis?

B) What processes related to metabolism and/or bioenergetics contribute to recovery from cellular and subcellular dysfunction?

What Is Known.

The catabolic state produced by sepsis causes alterations in protein breakdown and is characterized by a reduction in body weight, lean body mass, skeletal muscle mass, and fat mass. Metabolism, in general, is impaired, but compensatory mechanisms such as endocrine activity and enhanced substrate availability mask these abnormalities. For example, while global hepatic glucose production is higher than that observed under nonseptic conditions, this increase reflects high levels of catecholamines, corticosteroids, and glucagon. The response of the liver in the absence of sepsis to equivalent levels of hormonal stimulation far exceeds that observed during sepsis. Hepatic inefficiency at least in part reflects impairment of intracellular signal transduction pathways for hormones and other mediators. Although it is likely that the recovery mechanisms that restore the balance between catabolism and anabolism differ from those that initiated the imbalance, the actual process is poorly described. Importantly, lean body mass may be depleted in sepsis but cell death is not a significant feature in most organs and functional recovery does not appear to be limited by the regenerative capacity of the tissue, perhaps because solid organ mass does not appear to be affected. It is essential to note that metabolic changes during sepsis recovery may be linked to other subcellular mechanisms, including autophagy, apoptosis, and proteasome activity (,–).

### Hemoperfusion in the intensive care unit [^b12ca5f8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Pathophysiology of sepsis

Sepsis is a complex clinical and biological syndrome defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. It begins as an infection that produces an inflammatory response in the host, triggered by the interaction between multiple soluble mediators. The inflammatory response to infection by innate immunity is usually controlled, localized, and protective. The interaction between resistance (inflammatory response) and resilience (limiting inflammation by the adaptive immunity) is the key to survival, but in some circumstances not completely understood, this complex and delicate balance is lost, and sepsis syndrome may develop. In this process of dysregulated response, both the infected and distal organs may be injured, leading to a life-threatening clinical condition. Such a process tends to cause excessive production or suppression of cytokines and other mediators that affect vital organ function and triggers further inflammatory and counter-inflammatory pathways. The dominant clinical phenotypes of these biological events are sepsis and septic shock where patients may die due to intractable inflammation or persistent immunoparalysis.

### Platelet granule secretion mechanisms: are they modified in sepsis? [^6549e900]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a progressive systemic inflammatory response syndrome associated with multi-organ dysfunction caused by overwhelming infection. In sepsis, platelet factor 4, β-thromboglobulin, and other inflammatory mediators are secreted from platelet granules to participate in the inflammatory response and increase sepsis-related impairments. Recently, an increasing number of studies showed a critical role of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) complexes in the platelet granule secretion. However, whether SNARE complex-regulated platelet granule secretion is involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis is unclear. Thus, in this review, we discussed the recent advances of SNARE complexes and their regulators in platelets as well as the mechanism of SNARE complexes on mediating platelet granule secretion.

### NKT cells: the culprits of sepsis? [^4e2f1ba5]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Sepsis is currently a leading cause of death in hospital intensive care units. Previous studies suggest that the pathophysiology of sepsis involves the hyperactivation of complex pro-inflammatory cascades that include the activation of various immune cells and the exuberant secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells. Natural killer T-cells (NKT) are a sub-lineage of T cells that share characteristics of conventional T cells and NK cells, and bridge innate and adaptive immunity. More recently, NKT cells have been implicated in microbial immunity, including the onset of sepsis. Moreover, apolipoprotein E (apoE), a component of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, has been shown to be protective in endotoxemia and gram-negative infections in addition to its well-known role in lipid metabolism. Here, we will review the role of NKT cells in sepsis and septic shock, the immunoregulatory role of apoE in the host immune response to infection, and propose a mechanism for this immunoregulation.

### The function of neutrophils in sepsis [^a57192df]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neutrophils are an essential arm of the innate immune response. In patients with sepsis, reprogramming of neutrophil occurs, manifest by impaired recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection, abnormal accumulation of neutrophils to remote sites, and dysregulation of neutrophil effector responses. This review examines the mechanisms underlying dysregulated neutrophil trafficking and function during sepsis.

Recent Findings

Mechanisms governing neutrophil function in sepsis are complex. Bacterial products, cytokines/chemokines, leukotrienes, and immunomodulatory hormones can modulate neutrophil migratory responses during sepsis via induction of cytoskeletal changes, disruption of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)-endothelial cell interactions, and alterations in G-protein-coupled receptor expression or signaling. Impaired chemotactic responses and alterations in neutrophil function can occur as a result of dysregulated PMN G-protein-coupled receptor and Toll-like receptor expression and/or signaling. As sepsis evolves, neutrophil gene expression is altered, leading to suppression of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory genes, as well as decreased production of reactive oxygen species. Neutrophil extracellular traps are produced to contain and kill invading pathogens, but can paradoxically promote further tissue damage.

Summary

Neutrophil migration is a coordinated process that is altered at multiple stages during sepsis. In combination with impaired neutrophil function, these alterations culminate in defective innate immunity in septic patients. Defining the mechanisms involved and strategies to interrupt these deleterious responses requires further investigation.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^a2907bde]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sepsis and septic shock:

- **Definition**: According to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction (defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline in the SOFA score) caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is no longer included in the definition of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: The most common infectious pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis are S. aureus (20.5%), Pseudomonas species (19.9%), fungi (19%), E. coli (16.0%), Klebsiella species (12.7%), and Acinetobacter (9%).
- **Epidemiology**: In hospitalized adult patients, the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 6.0%.
- **Disease course**: In patients with sepsis, continued activation of immune cells in response to an infection result in a dysregulated inflammatory response. The coagulation system is closely tied to the inflammatory response, with cross talk between the two systems. These pathophysiological changes cause the clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction, which may progress to multiple organ failure, and death.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock is 10–20%, 20–50%, and 40–80%, respectively.

### The systemic inflammatory response syndrome [^b0244ec6]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is the body's response to an infectious or noninfectious insult.

### The endothelium in sepsis: source of and a target for inflammation [^a3f2fbf6]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To discuss a possible role of the endothelium in sepsis.

Data Sources

Studies published in biomedical journals and our own experimental results.

Study Selection

Studies on endothelial mechanisms in the context of sepsis.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Changes in endothelial cells on activation by inflammatory stimuli are reviewed briefly; potential mechanisms that lead to endothelial damage during sepsis are discussed.

Conclusions

The endothelium is a key organ involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Dysfunction of or injury to the endothelium may be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple organ failure and should be discriminated from activation resulting from stimulation with inflammatory stimuli. Identification of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to endothelial dysfunction or damage is likely to provide novel targets for the treatment of sepsis.

### Mechanisms of sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction [^fdc19992]. Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction in general and intrinsic myocardial depression in particular.

Data Source

MEDLINE database.

Data Synthesis

Myocardial depression is a well-recognized manifestation of organ dysfunction in sepsis. Due to the lack of a generally accepted definition and the absence of large epidemiologic studies, its frequency is uncertain. Echocardiographic studies suggest that 40% to 50% of patients with prolonged septic shock develop myocardial depression, as defined by a reduced ejection fraction. Sepsis-related changes in circulating volume and vessel tone inevitably affect cardiac performance. Although the coronary circulation during sepsis is maintained or even increased, alterations in the microcirculation are likely. Mitochondrial dysfunction, another feature of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction, will also place the cardiomyocytes at risk of adenosine triphosphate depletion. However, clinical studies have demonstrated that myocardial cell death is rare and that cardiac function is fully reversible in survivors. Hence, functional rather than structural changes seem to be responsible for intrinsic myocardial depression during sepsis. The underlying mechanisms include down-regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors, depressed postreceptor signaling pathways, impaired calcium liberation from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and impaired electromechanical coupling at the myofibrillar level. Most, if not all, of these changes are regulated by cytokines and nitric oxide.

Conclusions

Integrative studies are needed to distinguish the hierarchy of the various mechanisms underlying septic cardiac dysfunction. As many of these changes are related to severe inflammation and not to infection per se, a better understanding of septic myocardial dysfunction may be usefully extended to other systemic inflammatory conditions encountered in the critically ill. Myocardial depression may be arguably viewed as an adaptive event by reducing energy expenditure in a situation when energy generation is limited, thereby preventing activation of cell death pathways and allowing the potential for full functional recovery.

### The role of increased body mass index in outcomes of sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ab2f6f48]. BMC Anesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Compared with normal-weight patients, patients with BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² exhibited decreased mortality. Overweight BMI is associated with lower mortality in patients with sepsis; moreover, obesity and morbid obesity were not associated with increased mortality. Further research is warranted to determine the pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this observation. Moreover, more large studies, particularly well-designed prospective studies, are needed to further elucidate the precise roles of obesity in patients with sepsis. An understanding of the impact of obesity in septic patients may allow for accurate risk stratification and has implications for the development of prevention and treatment strategies.

### Inflammation, coagulopathy, and the pathogenesis of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^df4488b7]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

An improved understanding of the mechanisms through which infecting pathogens harm the host is leading to new formulations of the concept of sepsis. We review the roles of inflammation and coagulation in the pathogenesis of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, and explore the potential of new therapies to restore the fine biological balance between procoagulant and anticoagulant mechanisms that are disrupted during the life-threatening processes that lead to organ dysfunction.

Data Sources

Narrative review of published primary sources in the basic and clinical literature.

Data Summary

Traditional models of host-pathogen interactions ascribe the morbidity of infection to the direct cytotoxic effects of micro-organisms on host tissues. However, abundant experimental and clinical evidence has revealed that it is the response of the host, rather than the trigger that elicited it, that is the more potent determinant of outcome. The elucidation of a complex network of host-derived inflammatory mediators raised the possibility that targeting these individually could improve patient outcomes, and some modest successes with this approach have been achieved. More recently, it is becoming evident that the inflammatory response, in turn, mediates its deleterious effects by inducing tissue hypoxia, and cellular injury, either through tissue necrosis or through the induction of programmed cell death or apoptosis. Thus, treatment strategies that target the downstream consequences of the activation of inflammation, for example, microvascular coagulation or acute adrenal insufficiency, represent the latest, and some of the most promising approaches to attenuation of the septic response to improve survival, and minimize organ dysfunction. The maladaptive sequelae of systemic inflammation, embodied in the concept of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, comprise the leading obstacle to survival for patients admitted to a contemporary intensive care unit. Further insights into this intimidatingly complex process will not only provide potent new therapeutic options, but promise to transform critical illness from a biological standoff, during which the clinician merely supports failing organs, to a disease that can be successfully treated.

### "The NET effect": neutrophil extracellular traps-a potential key component of the dysregulated host immune response in sepsis [^471282a9]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) as part of a healthy host immune response. NETs physically trap and kill pathogens as well as activating and facilitating crosstalk between immune cells and complement. Excessive or inadequately resolved NETs are implicated in the underlying pathophysiology of sepsis and other inflammatory diseases, including amplification of the inflammatory response and inducing thrombotic complications. Here, we review the growing evidence implicating neutrophils and NETs as central players in the dysregulated host immune response. We discuss potential strategies for modifying NETs to improve patient outcomes and the need for careful patient selection.

### Update in sepsis guidelines: what is really new? [^533e5f23]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The last few decades of sepsis research have helped clinicians better understand the importance of identifying sepsis early and treating aggressively. Nonetheless, there is still much debate about how to identify these patients and which criteria are most predictive for the development of sepsis and septic shock. The recent updates, particularly the recommendations regarding SOFA and qSOFA scores, operationalize the definitions of sepsis into a clinically useful model that can be used by clinicians to identify the patients most at risk of deterioration. The lack of progress in mortality reduction in sepsis treatment despite extraordinary investment of research resources underscores the variability in patients with sepsis. No single solution is likely to be universally beneficial and sepsis continues to be an entity that should receive high priority for the development of precision health approaches for treatment.

### Exosomes from patients with septic shock convey miRNAs related to inflammation and cell cycle regulation: new signaling pathways in sepsis? [^400328fe]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. It represents a difficult challenge to the intensivist because this condition lacks good diagnostic tools and adequate evidence-based treatments. The incidence of sepsis has increased considerably in recent years, and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with the syndrome are extremely high, especially for septic shock, in which mortality ranges from 40% to 60% in different populations.

The molecular basis underlying sepsis mechanisms are complex and still only partially understood. Studies have demonstrated that the pathophysiology of sepsis is related to a dysregulated inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Recently, the presence of circulating extracellular vesicles (EV) shed from different cell types during sepsis and their relationship with sepsis pathophysiology was established. Previous studies demonstrated that a special type of EV, named exosomes and mostly originated from platelets, induce superoxide production and apoptosis in vascular cells during sepsis by inflammatory and redox mechanisms. Also, our group established a correlation between exosomes and organ dysfunction by demonstrating exosome-induced myocardial depression in isolated heart and papillary muscle preparations. This dysfunction was mediated by a mechanism associated with myocardial nitric oxide production.

Recent studies demonstrated that exosomes may play a role in cell-to-cell communication in normal physiology and several diseases, including cancer, through carriage of functional messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs). Even though the presence of miRNAs in plasma during sepsis was previously demonstrated, the genetic content of exosomes during sepsis was evaluated in very few studies.

In the present pilot study, we isolated exosomes from plasma of patients with septic shock and analyzed their entire miRNA content. We also assessed mRNAs, specifically looking for those related to inflammatory response and oxidative stress, because previous studies by our group and others demonstrated that these mechanisms mediate the effect of exosomes during sepsis. In addition, we correlated the differential expression of miRNA to outcomes and used pathway enrichment analysis to elucidate their most important possible biological mechanisms. miRNA profiling revealed that the genetic material contained in exosomes from patients with sepsis is related to modulation of immune system and cell cycle regulation. The data presented in this article may help to generate new insights into sepsis pathophysiology and ultimately provide research windows to development of novel therapies.

### Cardiac dysfunction in survivors of sepsis: a scoping review [^0f9dbe29]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis is one of the most common reasons for admission to intensive care and one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The impact of critical illnesses such as sepsis are profound, with up to two-thirds of intensive care survivors experiencing either cognitive, psychological or functional impairments now collectively known as postintensive care syndrome. There is an increasing recognition that, like the index episode of sepsis itself, these lingering impairments are likely complex and heterogeneous in nature and a result in interactions between patient characteristics, specific pathophysiological processes and factors related to treatments. Nonetheless, mechanisms by which these functional impairments are mediated following admission are unclear.

One potential mechanism of functional impairment may be chronic cardiac dysfunction. In recent years, several large cohort studies and a systematic review have demonstrated that admission with sepsis is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and heart failure, with rates that are comparable to other established cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or dyslipidaemia.

Given the association of sepsis with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, it is logical then that chronic cardiovascular dysfunction may be common following critical illness and may play a role in the functional impairments observed following admission. Furthermore, the association of sepsis admission and adverse cardiovascular events potentially points towards a plausible mechanism by which critical illness such as sepsis, might accelerate or even mediate chronic cardiovascular disease. Dysregulated inflammation that is the basis of contemporary definitions of sepsis may provide a logical pathway by which cardiovascular events are accelerated or might even occur de novo. However, while the literature to date has demonstrated an association with sepsis and adverse risk of cardiovascular outcomes, evidence is lacking regarding mechanisms of chronic cardiac dysfunction following acute illness, its relationship to functional impairments seen in survivors of sepsis and how we might screen for and manage at risk patient groups. We were keen to identify available types of evidence, clarify key concepts and examine how research has been conducted in the field to date. As such, we conducted a scoping review on the topic.

### Targeting the host response in sepsis: current approaches and future evidence [^dd80e3f1]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Sepsis remains a leading cause of death worldwide, despite our advances in critical care medicine. First immunotherapeutic approaches that aimed at controlling the early hyperinflammatory phase were not successful in clinical trials. Subsequent deeper insight into the pathophysiology revealed that systemic hyperinflammation, characterized by high levels of circulating pro-inflammatory markers such as cytokines or ferritin and the concomitant presence of organ dysfunction, does not necessarily characterize all sepsis patients. Instead, some patients are found to be rather systemically immunosuppressed. The common denominator infection-associated organ dysfunction can also occur independently of these two extremes and local immune responses may vary from the blood compartment (Fig. 1). As a consequence, sepsis was redefined as a dysregulated host response to infection. In medicine, the field of immunotherapeutics for other disease has rapidly evolved, leading to countless effective treatment strategies, e.g. to control tumor growth or limit autoimmunity. As an analogy, the development of specific adapted therapies targeting the dysregulated host response in sepsis may improve the outcome of some of our patients. Potentially, it is the heterogeneity of the syndrome and the associated difficulties in matching the right patient to a given treatment that resulted in little success in the clinical setting so far. Here, we provide an overview of current approaches to target the many facets of the host response and discuss future perspectives in the field of precision immunotherapy.
