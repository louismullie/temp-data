## Question

can you provide patient information regarding long term PPI use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for patient information regarding long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use, including benefits, risks, who needs long-term therapy, who does not, how to deprescribe safely, and practical monitoring advice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining what "long-term" means in clinical practice. Then, I should verify the proven benefits and appropriate indications. Next, I will examine the evidence for potential harms and separate signal from noise. After that, I need to identify patients who truly require chronic PPIs versus those who can deprescribe. Finally, I will outline deprescribing strategies, address rebound, and provide a concise monitoring and counseling plan, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition of "long-term" PPI use, because this frames everything else. Clinically, many experts and guidelines consider use beyond 4–8 weeks for dyspepsia or GERD as "long-term", whereas for research, ≥ 6 months is often used. Importantly, there is no universal consensus, and definitions vary widely across studies, which complicates interpretation and deprescribing conversations [^111YjkDo] [^115i638H] [^116ArBBA].

> Now, I should review the proven benefits and appropriate indications, and I need to ensure I anchor these to guidelines. PPIs are the most effective therapy for GERD with erosive esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori eradication regimens, NSAID-related ulcer prevention in high-risk patients, and Barrett's esophagus; they also reduce upper GI bleeding in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy, and in these settings the benefits generally outweigh risks when used appropriately [^1164rfAk] [^111YisHb] [^112QZmP1]. Hold on, I should verify the Barrett's point: yes, long-term PPIs are recommended in Barrett's esophagus for symptom control and potential chemoprevention, though the magnitude of cancer risk reduction remains debated and is largely observational, so I should not overstate it [^111YisHb] [^114TQX8u].

> Next, I will examine potential harms, but I need to be careful to distinguish association from causation. The most consistent prospective signal is a modest increase in enteric infections, including C. difficile, observed in a large randomized trial of pantoprazole versus placebo in older adults; the absolute risk was low, but real, and this is the clearest adverse signal to date [^116xEDfX]. Observational data have linked long-term PPI use to community-acquired pneumonia, hip fracture, chronic kidney disease, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, and gastric cancer, but these associations are generally small, heterogeneous, and vulnerable to confounding; causality remains unproven for most, so I should not jump to conclusions here [^112SRJGs] [^115NAEHa] [^113FTRdk]. Wait, let me verify the gastric cancer concern: multiple observational studies suggest a possible increased risk, particularly in the setting of H. pylori and corpus-predominant gastritis, but confounding by indication is substantial and randomized data are lacking, so this remains a cautious signal rather than a directive to stop indicated therapy [^114N6LMM] [^1115S72T] [^113u78e6].

> I will now identify who truly needs long-term PPI therapy, and I should double-check that I align with guideline-backed indications. Indications include severe erosive esophagitis or peptic stricture, Barrett's esophagus, high-risk NSAID users with prior GI bleeding or those requiring dual antiplatelet therapy, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and selected cases of refractory GERD with objective acid exposure; conversely, many patients without these indications are on chronic PPIs unnecessarily, and deprescribing should be considered [^111YisHb] [^1164rfAk] [^1166jz4m]. Hold on, I should verify the dual antiplatelet point: yes, co-therapy with a PPI reduces GI bleeding without a clear increase in cardiovascular events in randomized data, supporting continuation when the GI risk is high [^112QZmP1].

> For patients without a definitive indication, I need to ensure we have a clear deprescribing plan. The AGA advises that decisions to discontinue should be based on the absence of a valid indication, not on fear of unproven adverse events; abrupt discontinuation can cause rebound acid hypersecretion and symptom recurrence, so tapering or on-demand strategies are reasonable, and either abrupt cessation or tapering can be used with counseling about transient symptoms [^1173mGcG] [^1166jz4m]. Let me consider the rebound issue: rebound hypersecretion is common after 4–12 weeks of daily PPIs and can persist 2–4 months, which explains why many patients relapse quickly after stopping; anticipating this improves success and adherence to deprescribing [^112r4kzA] [^113rRwk4].

> I should confirm practical deprescribing tactics. Options include step-down to the lowest effective dose, on-demand use for mild GERD, or complete discontinuation with H2RA bridging if needed. Weight loss, head-of-bed elevation, and meal timing can reduce symptoms and facilitate deprescribing, and shared decision-making is essential to set expectations about transient rebound symptoms [^1166jz4m] [^112DQEkz]. Wait, let me verify the evidence base: randomized deprescribing trials show that on-demand use reduces pill burden but may increase symptoms compared with continuous therapy, so patient selection and follow-up are key to success [^112DQEkz].

> Next, I should review monitoring and special situations, and I need to ensure I do not over-medicalize routine care. Routine screening of calcium, vitamin B12, magnesium, kidney function, or bone density is not recommended for all long-term PPI users without specific risk factors; instead, target testing to patients with symptoms, high-risk medications, or comorbidities, and consider H. pylori testing and eradication in those with gastric risk or planned long-term PPIs, as this may mitigate atrophy-related concerns [^111YisHb] [^1164rfAk]. But wait, what if the patient is on loop diuretics or has arrhythmias? In that case, checking magnesium is reasonable given the higher observed risk of hypomagnesemia in such combinations, so I should individualize based on risk [^112YncNM].

> I should double-check drug–drug interaction concerns, especially with clopidogrel. Although in vitro and mechanistic data suggested increased cardiovascular events with PPIs that inhibit CYP2C19, randomized trials have not shown increased adverse cardiovascular outcomes with omeprazole plus clopidogrel, and the GI bleeding prevention benefit remains important; if interaction is a concern, pantoprazole or rabeprazole have less CYP2C19 inhibition, but I should avoid denying necessary gastroprotection solely due to theoretical interactions [^112QZmP1] [^1161VuS7]. Hold on, I should verify that this stance aligns with guidelines: yes, major societies prioritize GI bleeding prevention in high-risk patients rather than withholding PPIs due to unproven cardiovascular harm [^111YisHb].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit message so it is actionable. For patients with clear indications, the benefits of PPIs generally outweigh potential risks when used at the lowest effective dose. For patients without clear indications, the balance favors deprescribing because potential harms, even if small and uncertain, are unjustified. I need to ensure I communicate that most reported associations are observational and likely inflated by confounding, while acknowledging the real but modest increase in enteric infections seen in prospective data [^1164rfAk] [^116xEDfX] [^112SRJGs].

> Finally, I should confirm a practical patient-facing summary. Use PPIs for the shortest time and lowest dose that controls symptoms. If you have been on a PPI for more than 6 months, ask your clinician whether you still need it. If stopping, expect possible temporary rebound symptoms and consider tapering or on-demand use. Discuss lifestyle measures and alternatives like H2RAs. And do not stop a PPI on your own if you have Barrett's esophagus, a history of severe esophagitis or ulcer bleeding, or are on dual antiplatelet therapy, as the risks of stopping outweigh potential harms in these settings [^1166jz4m] [^111YisHb] [^1164rfAk].

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are highly effective for acid-related disorders, but **long-term use should be minimized** [^1164rfAk] to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration because of potential risks. The most consistent risk is a **modest increase in enteric infections** (e.g. C. difficile, pneumonia) [^116xEDfX]; other concerns — such as fractures, kidney disease, micronutrient deficiencies, and gastric cancer — are less certain and largely observational [^115NAEHa] [^113FTRdk]. Patients with clear indications (e.g. Barrett's esophagus, NSAID bleeding prophylaxis) should continue PPIs, while those without a firm indication should attempt deprescribing [^111YisHb] with tapering to mitigate rebound symptoms [^114TQX8u]. Routine monitoring is not required for all users, but clinicians should periodically reassess the need and counsel on lifestyle measures [^111YisHb].

---

## Indications for long-term PPI therapy

Long-term PPI therapy is **appropriate for specific conditions**, including:

- **Barrett's esophagus**: Long-term PPIs reduce acid exposure and may lower progression risk [^114TQX8u].

- **NSAID bleeding prophylaxis**: High-risk patients on NSAIDs or antiplatelets benefit from PPI gastroprotection [^111YisHb] [^116marXN].

- **Severe GERD with complications**: Erosive esophagitis, peptic strictures, or recurrent symptoms despite lifestyle measures [^111YisHb].

- **Zollinger-Ellison syndrome**: Lifelong PPIs are standard due to profound acid hypersecretion [^notfound].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of long-term PPI use

While PPIs are generally well tolerated, **long-term use has been associated with several potential risks**:

| **Adverse effect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Enteric infections (C. difficile, pneumonia) | Consistent modest increase in risk [^116xEDfX] [^112wrmgK] |
| Bone fractures (hip, vertebral, wrist) | Weak association; likely confounded by comorbidities [^116gvGSn] [^112QZmP1] |
| Chronic kidney disease | Observational associations; causality uncertain [^115NAEHa] [^115KRWKg] |
| Hypomagnesemia | Rare; monitor in high-risk patients [^112QZmP1] |
| Vitamin B12 deficiency | Rare; consider in prolonged use or malnutrition [^112kiSgM] |
| Gastric cancer | Observational association; confounding likely; test and eradicate H. pylori if present [^1115S72T] [^111sJaPf] [^113u78e6] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **judicious PPI use**:

- **Lowest effective dose**: Use the minimal dose to control symptoms [^111YisHb].

- **Shortest duration**: Reassess need regularly; avoid indefinite use without indication [^111YisHb].

- **Deprescribing**: Attempt in patients without clear indications; taper to reduce rebound [^1166jz4m] [^114TQX8u].

- **H. pylori testing**: Test and eradicate in patients requiring long-term PPIs to reduce atrophy risk [^114Uyy6d].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients warrant **extra caution** with long-term PPIs:

- **Elderly**: Higher risk of infections, fractures, and polypharmacy [^112wrmgK] [^116USVrk].

- **Patients with chronic kidney disease**: Monitor renal function and electrolytes [^112QZmP1] [^115KRWKg].

- **Patients on multiple medications**: Increased risk of drug interactions [^115tHJYi] [^1161VuS7].

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

Routine monitoring is **not universally required**, but targeted assessment is reasonable:

- **Clinical review**: Reassess indication and dose every 6–12 months [^116wRfmw].

- **Electrolytes**: Consider magnesium in high-risk patients (e.g. diuretics, CKD) [^112YncNM] [^112QZmP1].

- **Bone health**: Address fracture risk factors; no routine BMD testing unless other risks exist [^1164rfAk].

- **Lifestyle measures**: Weight loss, dietary changes, and smoking cessation can reduce PPI need [^114TQX8u].

---

## Deprescribing and alternative therapies

Deprescribing should be guided by **indication and patient preference**:

- **Tapering**: Gradual dose reduction reduces rebound acid hypersecretion [^114TQX8u] [^112r4kzA].

- **On-demand use**: Effective for mild GERD or nonerosive disease [^116Rx1XL].

- **Alternatives**: H2 receptor antagonists, antacids, and lifestyle changes can substitute or reduce PPI use [^114Uyy6d] [^113x8Hi9].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patients should be **informed about**:

- **Indications**: Why the PPI is needed and for how long [^113xdH3s].

- **Risks**: Potential adverse effects and their likelihood [^116xEDfX].

- **Symptom tracking**: Encourage reporting of new or worsening symptoms [^115tHJYi].

- **Lifestyle**: Emphasize weight loss, dietary changes, and smoking cessation [^113x8Hi9].

---

Long-term PPI therapy is effective for specific indications but carries a modest increase in enteric infections and uncertain risks for other outcomes. Use the **lowest effective dose**, reassess regularly, and deprescribe when possible; reserve chronic therapy for those with clear indications and counsel on lifestyle measures.

Potential carcinogenic mechanisms of proton-pump inhibitors

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) have become one of the most commonly prescribed medications worldwide since their introduction in 1980s, and have been the cornerstone of the management of upper gastrointestinal diseases including peptic ulcer disease (PUD), H. pylori infection, dyspepsia, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, emerging data have shown that long-term PPIs are associated with a number of side effects, including bone fracture, Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia, myocardial infarction and stroke, although a causality has not yet been confirmed.

Potent acid suppression has long been suspected a risk factor of gastric cancer by worsening gastric atrophy with ensuing hypergastrinemia and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. Animal studies have shown that acid suppression by omeprazoleand the insurmountable histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) loxtidineinduce gastric mucosa neoplasia in rodents. However, evidence on human subjects remains controversial. Herein, we summarize the postulated mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of PPIs on gastric cancer development (Figure 1).

Figure 1.
Postulated mechanisms underlying the carcinogenic effects of proton-pump inhibitors on gastric cancer development.

ECL, enterochromaffin like; H. pylori, Helicobacter pylori; PPIs, proton-pump inhibitors.

Interaction with Helicobacter pylori infection

H. pylori typically colonizes the gastric antrum, and cause an antrum-predominant gastritis in most infected subjects. Antral mucosal inflammation in turn stimulates gastric secretion, maintaining a normal- or high-acidic environment. However, when the acid production is suppressed by PPIs, the pattern of gastritis shifts to a corpus-predominant gastritis with resultant impairment of parietal cell function; a phenomenon that does not occur in H. pylori -negative patients. As such, the acid-suppressive effect of PPIs is further enhanced by H. pylori- induced corpus gastritis. In a cohort study of 177 patients, atrophic gastritis only developed in H. pylori -infected but not H. pylori -negative patients with long-term PPI use during a mean follow up of 5 years. A systematic review also showed that the risk of corpus atrophy was more pronounced in H. pylori -infected than H. pylori -negative PPI users [odds ratio (OR) 11.45; 95% CI: 6.25–20.99].

### Latest insights into the hot question of proton pump inhibitor safety-a narrative review [^114BmRsW]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and their use is continuously increasing. Although they have been shown to combine high therapeutic efficacy and good safety profile in many studies, in last years we have witnessed the publication of many articles reporting the possible association of long-term PPI therapy with important unexpected adverse events and these observations have created alarmism in both patients and physicians. However, the majority of these studies are observational, retrospective and prone to residual confounding. Also, the odds ratio values are generally comprised between 1 and 2 and therefore devoid of strong clinical relevance. As it is unlikely that prospective randomized trials will be ever done to reinforce these associations, we can only attempt to distinguish clear- from unclear-defined adverse events from the available literature. Nowadays we can reasonably exclude cardiovascular diseases, community-acquired pneumonia, all-cause mortality, dementia and bone fractures from PPI-related adverse events. However, physicians should be aware of the existence of possible risks when treating their patients, especially the elderly and frail ones, with long-term PPIs, which should be prescribed only to persons with defined indications and at lowest dose and duration.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors: whole-of-population patterns in Australia 2013–2016 [^116C3mMv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

A growing body of studies have detected possible harms associated with long-term use of PPIs.– The risk of PPI-related adverse events can be minimized by stepping down the PPI dose or discontinuing treatment altogether. However, it is not clear what proportion of PPI-treated people are receiving long-term treatment and to what extent long-term treated people are in fact attempting lower treatment strengths or discontinuation during the course of their therapy.

Previous studies have described contemporary real-world patterns of treatment with PPIs and how well this treatment adheres to recommended guidelines, but questions remain around the typical duration of PPI treatment, the patterns of PPI use over extended periods and the proportion of people who initiate PPIs and continue on maintenance and longer-term therapy. Therefore, in this study we used dispensing claims for every person in Australia dispensed publicly subsidized PPIs between 2013 and 2016 to determine the incidence and prevalence of PPI use and what other medicines people are using concomitant with PPIs. We further examine the patterns and durations of PPI treatment among individuals continuing treatment beyond 12 weeks after initiation.

### Complications of proton pump inhibitor therapy [^1144tdE6]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Safety issues associated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have recently attracted widespread media and lay attention. Gastroenterologists are frequently asked about the appropriateness of PPI therapy for specific patients. Furthermore, some patients may have had PPI therapy discontinued abruptly or inappropriately due to safety concerns. Faced with such a wide variety of potentially serious adverse consequences, prescribers need to evaluate the evidence objectively to discern the likelihood that any reported association might actually be causal. Here, we review many of the proposed adverse consequences of PPI therapy and apply established criteria for the determination of causation. We also consider the potential contribution of residual confounding in many of the reported studies. Evidence is inadequate to establish causal relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations. Residual confounding related to study design and the overextrapolation of quantitatively small estimates of effect size have probably led to much of the current controversy about PPI safety. In turn, this has caused unnecessary concern among patients and prescribers. The benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications need to be considered, along with the likelihood of the proposed risks. Patients with a proven indication for a PPI should continue to receive it in the lowest effective dose. PPI dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in those unresponsive to initial empiric therapy is discouraged.

### The risks of PPI therapy [^112SRJGs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

PPIs have become one of the most commonly used medications worldwide, as they are the treatment of choice for several acid-related gastrointestinal disorders. However, concerns have been raised about PPI therapy, including the risk of pneumonia, bone fractures and enteric infections, and a possible interaction with clopidogrel that could increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Observational studies have shown very modest associations between PPI therapy and these risks, although the association between PPI treatment and the risk of enteric infections seems to be stronger than the association with other risk factors. However, given the inherent limitations of observational studies, these associations could be attributable to bias and/or confounding factors. In addition, evidence from randomized, controlled trials does not support a clinically significant effect of PPI therapy on the risk of cardiovascular events in patients taking clopidogrel or the risk of pneumonia. Nevertheless, it is impossible to exclude the possibility that some of these associations might be causal or indeed that PPI therapy has an as yet unknown long-term adverse effect. As with any therapy, therefore, it is advisable to prescribe PPIs only to patients for whom these drugs have been proven beneficial.

Appropriate use of PPIs: recommendations from international guidelines

There are several guidelines that provide recommendations on the use of PPIs when NSAIDs are used.

2016 Position paper on safe PPI use

Standard-dose PPIs are recommended for patients taking ns-NSAIDs at risk for upper-GI complications (bleeding and perforation) and for those having had an episode of previous GI bleeding and prescribed selective COX2 inhibitors. In both ns-NSAID and COX2-selective NSAID users, PPI therapy reduces upper-GI symptoms, in particular dyspepsia. However, NSAID-induced adverse events in the lower GI tract are not prevented by PPIs.

American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice updates 2017

The 2017 update recommends that patients take long-term PPIs for NSAID bleeding prophylaxis if at high risk.

American College of Gastroenterology guidelines on management of bleeding ulcers

In patients with NSAID-associated bleeding ulcers who must resume NSAIDs, it is recommended to give a daily PPI together with a COX2-selective NSAID at the lowest effective dose. In patients with low-dose aspirin-associated bleeding ulcers that have been resumed on aspirin for secondary prevention, long-term daily PPI therapy should also be provided.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2014 guidelines on the investigation and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease and dyspepsia in adults

In patients using NSAIDs with diagnosed peptic ulcers, a full-dose PPI or H 2 RA for 8 weeks should be offered, and NSAIDs should be stopped where possible. Further, H. pylori -eradication therapy should be offered if bacteria are present. In high-risk patients (previous ulceration) for whom NSAID continuation is necessary, a PPI together with the NSAID should be prescribed. A COX2-selective NSAID is preferred over a standard NSAID.

### Proton pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a population-based cohort study [^111sJaPf]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

The increased incidence of gastric cancer associated with PPI use observed in this and earlier studies is likely to result from confounding by indication; nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility of a causal association between long-term PPI use and risk of gastric cancer. Larger studies of long-term PPI use would be required to clarify this issue.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^115u4t2H]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Results

The literature search identified a total of 742 studies in PubMed and Cochrane Library, of which 59 met the final eligibility criteria. By searching ClinicalTrials.gov we identified two ongoing studies, resulting in a total of 61 studies.

The selected studies concerned various aspects of long-term PPI use: adverse effects (n = 35), treatment effects (n = 13), pharmacoepidemiological studies (n = 5) and discontinuation or dosage reduction (n = 8). Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the included studies, which contained 28 different definitions of long-term use.

Table 1
Overview of the included studies

The threshold for defining long-term PPI use varied from > 2 weeks to > 7 years of PPI use. The most common definition was ≥ 1 year (10 studies) or ≥ 6 months (10 studies). Nine studies defined long-term use as ≥ 8 weeks. A total of 10 studies used number of prescriptions, number of tablets or defined daily dose (DDD) in their definition. However, there was substantial variability in DDD/unit of time to define long-term use. Four studies used repeat prescriptions to define long-term use.

A total of 12 out of 61 studies (20%) stated a specific explanation for their choice of long-term definition. Most studies rationalised their choice by referring to previous studies, guidelines or policy papers.

The definition of long-term use also varied within publications by the same author. In a study by Lundell et al from 2009, long-term treatment was defined as > 8 weeks when examining treatment failure in the follow-up of treatment effect. Six years later, Lundell et al defined long-term use as > 3 years when studying the effects of long-term PPI use on serum gastrin levels and gastric histology.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^1173mGcG]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — best practice advice on discontinuing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) states that the decision to discontinue PPIs should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use, and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs). It further specifies that the presence of a PAAE or a history of a PAAE in a current PPI user is not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal, and that the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of an adverse event associated with PPI use should also not be an independent indication for PPI withdrawal. Supporting context notes that reported associations between PPIs and PAAEs are not necessarily causal and that no RCT has yet demonstrated that PPI users have an increased incidence of any of the PAAEs.

### Individualized prevention of proton pump inhibitor related adverse events by risk stratification [^112RYrcB]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently the first-line treatment for acid-related disorders such as gastroesophageal reflux disease. PPIs are one of the top ten most prescribed drugs worldwide. The global PPI market was evaluated at $2.9 billion in 2020 and is anticipated to grow by 6.9% annually from 2023 to 2030.

Although the pharmaceutical industry has made remarkable progress in novel drug discovery for safer and better PPIs, there has been a growing concern over the potential adverse effects of long-term PPI usage. In 2021, an umbrella review of 42 meta-analyses showed that long-term use of PPIs was associated with a variety of diseases, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) and enteric infection. Moreover, the reporting of new PPI-associated adverse effects continues. In the past 2 years alone, epidemiological studies, for the first time, linked PPI use to increased risk of biliary tract cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, type-2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cholelithiasis. The evidence for these associations was generally observational. Reporting of these adverse events attracted increasing attention to the appropriate use of PPIs, while it also resulted in fears and reduced adherence to PPI treatment in patients. The need for personalized strategies for reducing unnecessary PPI use has become an urgent subject to be addressed.

There are several weaknesses in existing studies. First, most of the previous studies only evaluated single outcomes within one population. Some studies might be limited by selective reporting or lack of validation in different populations. Second, a comprehensive evaluation of the overall safety profile and dose–response effects, particularly for major diseases with top global disease burden remains lacking. Finally, and more importantly, there exists a major knowledge gap on which group of people are more vulnerable to PPI-related adverse events. Thus, individualized treatment based on patients' underlying risk may confer benefits and reduce harms. Such a risk stratification approach, successfully implemented in selecting patients for antihypertensive and statin therapy, has also been applied to individuate avoidance of additional risks related to PPI use, such as type-2 diabetes, stroke, and cholelithiasis. However, its application for other PPI-associated adverse events remains unclear. To address these concerns and improve decision-making for the appropriate use of PPIs in the public, patients, clinicians, and industry, we comprehensively evaluated the overall safety profile, dose–response relationships, and individual risk stratification for PPI use and the top 30 causes of global disease burden based on five large cohorts from the US, the UK, and China.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^114qE8Up]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is commonly used outside of Food and Drug Administration indication for a broad range of conditions such as extra-esophageal reflux and PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia. While this may be appropriate in some scenarios, it has also resulted in widespread inappropriate PPI use. At the same time, data suggesting adverse effects of long-term PPI therapy are multiplying, albeit mainly from low quality studies. The systematic review by Scarpignato et al. (BMC Med 14:179, 2016) addresses this dilemma with a comprehensive analysis of the risks and benefits of PPI use. The authors concluded that, while PPIs are highly efficacious in erosive acid-peptic disorders, efficacy is not equaled in other conditions. In some instances, they found no supportive evidence of benefit. With respect to side effects, they indicated that the questionable harms associated with PPI therapy do not outweigh the benefits afforded by appropriate PPI use. However, inappropriate PPI use results in increased healthcare costs and unnecessary exposure to potential adverse effects. Ideally, PPI therapy should be personalized, based on indication, effectiveness, patient preference, and risk assessment.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^117GpDiJ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — typical PPI treatment durations and risks of unintended continuation: The vast majority of trials demonstrating efficacy have tested durations of 4–12 weeks, or no more than 6–12 months for maintenance therapy, yet investigations have found that patients often take PPIs in the absence of a continuing indication. Chronic PPI use may be unintended; for example, a PPI initiated in the hospital for an acute indication (eg, stress ulcer prophylaxis) may be continued at discharge without review of indication and ongoing need, and PPIs are frequently initiated for empiric treatment of laryngopharyngeal symptoms for which an RCT has definitively demonstrated that PPIs have no benefit in the empiric management and these patients should be considered for de-prescribing.

### Strategies for discontinuation of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients with long-term PPI administration: a randomized controlled trial [^1166CBXL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including potassium ion-competitive acid blocker, are widely used worldwide and are often used for long periods of time. However, in recent years, potential side effects associated with long-term PPI use have been reported. Many patients take PPI for a long period of time, even though it is unnecessary, and it is necessary to discontinue PPI administration in such patients. However, sudden discontinuation may cause symptoms to recur and discontinuation may be unsuccessful. A strategy for safe and secure PPI discontinuation has not yet been established. The purpose of this study is to determine whether PPI can be safely discontinued by tapering the PPI dose or by abrupt discontinuation of PPI, and to establish a strategy for safe and secure PPI discontinuation.

Methods

The evaluation will be conducted as a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group clinical trial with five assessment points at the start of the study and 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the start of the study. One intervention group is the group in which PPI administration is abruptly discontinued (Group A), and the second group is the group in which the PPI dose is gradually tapered and then PPI administration is discontinued (Group B). The primary outcome and secondary outcome are the proportion of patients who successfully discontinued the PPI at 6 months and at 12 months after the start of the study in groups A and B, respectively.

Discussion

We predict that the proportion of patients who successfully discontinue PPI will be higher in the group in which PPI administration was gradually tapered than in the group in which PPI administration was abruptly discontinued. On the other hand, we expect that many participants will succeed in discontinuing PPI regardless of the discontinuation strategy due to the explanation that discontinuation is necessary.

### Proton pump inhibitors: the good, bad, and ugly [^112gFx5y]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) continue to be the medication of choice for treatment of acid-related disease, with few if any overt side effects seen with daily use. They are often prescribed empirically, often in high doses and with many patients being treated with multiple PPIs without an objective diagnosis. Therefore, they are believed to be overprescribed and used without indication. In this article we discuss the appropriate clinical indications for PPIs, review in detail the major associated adverse events, and put in perspective key issues in balancing benefits and risk of this exceptional (and safe) class of drug.

### Do proton pump inhibitors decrease calcium absorption? [^113g5r5Q]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were identified recently as an independent risk factor for osteoporotic fracture. Millions of American adults take PPIs to treat or prevent gastrointestinal conditions. Indeed, PPIs rank second only to statins in drug sales. Moreover, postmenopausal women account for over half of long-term PPI users and represent the subset of individuals at greatest risk for osteoporotic fracture. Therefore, this newly identified fracture risk factor has important public health ramifications.

Three large case-control studies and one retrospective cohort study reported that PPI therapy increased the relative risk of fracture by 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.20] to 1.92 (95% CI 1.16–3.18). Subsequently, three prospective studies designed to identify risk factors for osteoporotic fracture also found that PPI therapy was an independent risk factor for fracture. Among 5339 women enrolled in the Study for Osteoporotic Fractures, those reporting PPI use at the sixth visit (n = 234) had a higher risk of nonvertebral fracture (relative hazard = 1.34, 95% CI 1.10–1.64) during an average follow-up of 5 years. Among 5775 men enrolled in the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, PPI use was associated with a higher risk of fracture, but only in men not taking calcium supplements (relative hazard = 1.49, 95% CI 1.04–2.14). In a third prospective study, 5% of 1211 women were taking omeprazole at study entry. Omeprazole therapy was an independent risk factor for vertebral fracture (relative risk = 3.50, 95% CI 1.14–8.44) during 6 years of follow-up.

### Adverse outcomes of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112wjtRF]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

The association between the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and the risks of various diseases remains controversial. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to quantify the associations as presented in the literature and to also provide this information to healthcare professionals and patients about their potentially adverse effects. In July 2016, we searched through Medline (PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Library from inception using common keywords. We included observational studies that provided risk estimates on the long-term use of PPIs and their adverse effects. Overall, 43 studies were included in the systematic review, of which 28 studies were also included in the random effect meta-analysis. Odds of community-acquired pneumonia, hip fracture, and colorectal cancer were 67% [odds ratio (OR) = 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.04–2.67], 42% (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.33–1.53), and 55% (OR = 1.55; 95% CI: 0.88–2.73) higher in patients with long-term PPIs use compared with patients who did not use PPIs. Although the use of PPIs provides short-term health benefits, their prolonged use is associated with minor and also potentially major adverse health outcomes. Hence, we strongly recommend that the prescription of PPIs should be done with caution to improve the medication's efficacy and patients' safety.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment – as any kind of drug therapy – is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to an effective and safe PPI therapy.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114keugp]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of acid-related diseases. Pharmacological acid suppression has been so successful in healing peptic ulcer (PU) and managing patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that elective surgery for ulcer disease has been virtually abolished and anti-reflux operations are today performed only in selected patients. Along the same lines, the incidence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated gastropathy has largely been reduced, despite the increased use of these medications in the aging population.

Despite the fact that PPIs are far from being the ideal antisecretory drugs and that new longer-acting compounds with extended acid suppression are being developed, they remain, no doubt, the most effective currently available medications and are widely prescribed in all age populations. Healthcare providers are increasingly prescribing PPIs for prolonged, sometimes lifetime, use and there is growing concern for the potential adverse effects resulting from such long-term therapy. Soon after the introduction of omeprazole, the first PPI, into the market, Jean Paul Galmiche, a leading French gastroenterologist, wrote a thoughtful article anticipating that the unprecedented clinical efficacy of these drugs would have lead (patients and physicians alike) to addiction, and indeed, this is the case. Once on a PPI, the majority of patients stay on long-term PPIs, often indefinitely, especially the elderly.

Studies in primary care and emergency settings suggest that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Patients admitted to hospital frequently are started on PPIs, often inappropriately, and these medications are continued, following discharge, by primary care physicians. Indeed, inadequate recommendations for PPIs in discharge letters are quite frequent. This prescription habit may lead to a continuation of PPI therapy in primary care, thereby unnecessarily increasing polypharmacy and the risk of adverse events as well as burdening the public health budget. In this connection, an Italian study found that the persistence rate of PPI therapy is fairly high, after both appropriate and inappropriate prescriptions (62% and 71%, respectively). The general practitioners' attitude to continuing or discontinuing PPIs depends on their level of knowledge and their perceptions of hospital physicians' competence as well as the threshold to prescribing in hospitals.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^111FrojA]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Use of PPIs

Coincident with PPI usage, the literature surrounding PPI safety and efficacy is growing exponentially, making it difficult to delineate an evidence-based guideline on their use. In the study by Scarpignato et al. committees on behalf of three Italian scientific societies collaborated with impressive panels of expert international reviewers to address 13 clinical scenarios in which uncertainty exists about how to prescribe PPIs and where drug misuse is common. They performed a systematic literature review inclusive of almost 500 papers and present a narrative review of the safety and appropriateness of PPI therapy in each scenario. Table 1 summarizes the key messages regarding appropriate PPI use in the 13 scenarios, organized into those appropriate for long-term or short-term PPI use, or not at all. Examining this compendium, one is immediately struck by the fact that the table includes many usages for which there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indications. Apparently, the world literature provides ample evidence for the efficacy of PPIs outside of FDA indications.

### Sex-specific association of chronic proton pump inhibitor use with reduced bone density and quality [^115RsHbJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) represent a class of drugs widely used in clinical practice for their antacid action. Their use has increased rapidly worldwide because they generally are well tolerated and have few side effects. However, recent investigations have raised concerns regarding the potential long-term adverse effects associated with chronic PPI use, such as an increased risk of enteric infections, community-acquired pneumonia, and possibly some forms of gastric cancer.

Another possible side effect of chronic PPI intake is an increase in bone fragility. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration updated the list of potential side effects for PPIs to include an increased risk of hip, wrist, and vertebral fractures following reports from multiple epidemiological studies conducted in preceding years. Subsequently, this association between PPI use and fracture risk has been further corroborated by numerous additional studies and meta-analyses.

Although the evidence regarding increased fracture risk is relatively concordant, studies regarding the effect of PPI use on bone mineral density (BMD) have reported conflicting results, with most of them showing either modest or no effect on BMD during PPI use. A frequent limitation of these studies is that, despite the well-known differences in the pathophysiology of bone metabolism between males and females, the possible presence of sex-specific differences in the association between PPI use and BMD has only rarely been explored. Moreover, although bone density is the gold standard for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and the most reliable noninvasive predictor of fracture risk, skeletal fragility can also be determined by alterations in bone quality, with subtler changes in bone microarchitecture that are not captured by BMD.

In recent years, various noninvasive methods for assessing bone quality have been developed, with the trabecular bone score (TBS) emerging as one of the simplest and most accessible. TBS is a texture-based metric that measures the rate of gray-level changes in lumbar spine dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) images, providing an indirect estimation of bone microarchitectural health. Numerous studies have shown that TBS can predict osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women independently of bone density; in addition, the evaluation of TBS is of particular relevance in various settings of secondary osteoporosis, in which the risk of fractures is often less associated with BMD, but rather related to changes in bone microstructure and quality.

### Nutritional consequences of long-term acid suppression; are they clinically important? [^112kiSgM]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

As acid suppression therapies with proton pump inhibitors are an extremely common practice for common acid-related diseases, there has been increased scrutiny on the safety of this class of therapy.

Recent Findings

There have been increasing reports of allegation of harm with the sustained use of proton pump inhibitors, in particular with potential adverse effects on vitamin and mineral absorption. This has prompted a number of product label changes directed by the US Food and Drug Administration, raising concerns for ongoing continued use among clinicians and patients.

Summary

This review highlights the most recent information around these controversies and provides evidence summaries to help guide care providers in their care plans as well as discussions with patients.

The introduction of generic PPIs into the market has been followed by an increasing rate of PPI prescribing related to chronic treatments, unlicensed indications, and therapeutic substitutions. Furthermore, since PPIs are now available over-the-counter, patients can have free access to them and for long periods of time, without seeking medical attention. Counseling is therefore important to ensure that patients understand that failure of symptoms to resolve or a rapid symptom relapse while taking a PPI is an indication to consult a physician. Furthermore, concerns about potential masking of a more serious pathology, such as malignancy, should not be overlooked.

Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes and drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs). There is indeed a strong relationship between the number of administered drugs and potential, clinically relevant DDIs, particularly in older adults. As a consequence, the number of yearly papers reporting PPI-related adverse events and/or PPI-drug interactions has steadily increased over the past decade.

Long-term (> 5 years) proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use — Across three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing medical versus surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), patients allocated to medical therapy (n = 363) versus surgery (n = 308) were significantly more likely to require prolonged PPI use (RR = 2.57, 95%CI = 1.31, 5.02) with significant heterogeneity (I² = 92%); notably, 86 of the 308 patients (28%) randomized to surgery still reported prolonged PPI use, and a retrospective cohort study at high risk of bias reported higher rates of long-term PPI use with medical versus surgical management.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors: whole-of-population patterns in Australia 2013–2016 [^1117ZpRA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study shows that the proportion of people continuing PPIs beyond the guideline-recommended maximum of 12 weeks is greater than that which might be expected to have conditions indicated for longer-term PPI treatment. Around one third of people continuing on longer-term treatment step-down treatment to a lower strength PPI, however, most individuals do not deviate from their initiation strength. In light of this, prescribers may wish to consider the strength prescribed at initiation, as well as routine medicine reviews to ensure long-term treatment is indeed indicated. Given the many adverse events potentially associated with long-term PPI treatment, increased regulation of these medicines, such as the restrictions recently implemented in Australia, are warranted.

About Patient Preference Information Patient-preference information captures the value patients place on features of medical devices. PPI includes different patient perspectives on the benefits and risks of using medical devices and treating medical conditions. PPI is different from patient-reported outcomes which are part of a clinical trial and measure how patients feel and function. Well designed and conducted PPI studies elicit which attributes are important to patients, how important they are, and what tradeoffs patients are willing to make amongst them. PPI is also referred to as health-preference assessment, stated-preference health survey, health-preference research, and patient-centered research in the scientific literature.

Patient Preference Information to Help CDRH Understand Medical Device Benefits and Risks PPI can inform the design of a medical device, impact how a clinical study is designed, and be used to understand the impact of the clinical study results on patients. PPI helps to:

- Find unmet patient needs early in medical device development.
- Identify the most important benefits and risks of a technology from a patient's perspective.
- Assess patients' views on different clinical study outcomes.
- Determine a meaningful change in clinical study outcomes.
- Clarify what patients think about the tradeoffs of the benefits and risks for a treatment or diagnostic.
- Clarify how patient preferences on benefits and risks vary among diverse groups and their willingness to accept uncertainty about the benefits and risks.

PPI has been used in multiple submissions for Premarket Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption Applications, and De Novo Requests which has informed CDRH's regulatory decision making. For example:

- An FDA-sponsored PPI survey related to obesity devices informed an approval for a medical device to treat obesity.
- Ear infections are common in children and are often treated with antibiotics. Children who experience multiple ear infections may need ear tubes to prevent ear infections. These tubes are often placed in the operating room. A medical device company developed a product that allows doctors to place ear tubes in pediatric patients in their office. The company used a PPI study to help inform the design of the clinical trial for the product.
- Home hemodialysis has rare but serious adverse events so a caregiver or trained partner must be present.

However, a medical device company conducted a PPI study that showed some patients were willing to accept risks so they could do dialysis at home alone. This PPI study informed CDRH's decision to expand the labeled indications for the home hemodialysis device.

GI symptoms usually develop within the first few days of starting a NSAID therapy and can actually occur with the first dose of the drug. Although some studies have suggested that the first 2 months of treatment represent the period of greatest risk for complications with a relative risk of 4.5%, available evidence (from both RCTs and observational studies) shows that the risk of GI complications is constant over time, either during short-term or long-term NSAID use. Therefore, even a short course of NSAID therapy (e.g. for postoperative pain or acute musculoskeletal injury) carries a risk of GI complications similar to that of long-term treatment. As a consequence, prevention strategies should be implemented regardless of the duration of therapy, especially in patients with more than one risk factor (i.e. at high GI risk).

All RCTs have shown that PPIs are more effective than H 2 RAs in both preventing and treating gastroduodenal lesions. The reasons underlying the superiority of this class of antisecretory drugs have been clarified by preclinical and clinical pharmacological studies indicating that degree and duration of acid inhibition are both important factors in determining their efficacy in the prevention of NSAID injury. They also reduce upper GI symptoms associated with both COX-2 selective and non-selective NSAID use. Due to the long half-life and entero-hepatic circulation of several NSAIDs, a split dose PPI might be useful; there is, however, no evidence for the clinical usefulness of this regimen.

COX-2 selective NSAIDs (often incorrectly referred to as coxibs 1) have an improved upper GI safety profile compared to traditional (non-selective) compounds, as extensively shown in endoscopy and clinical outcome studies. The evidence is strong, with consistent reductions in events of about 50% in large RCTs, meta-analyses of RCTs, and large observational studies in clinical practice. Among patients with a prior ulcer bleed, treatment with a COX-2 inhibitor or an NSAID plus PPI is still associated with a clinically important risk of recurrent ulcer bleed (some 10%). In these patients, the combination of a PPI and a COX-2 inhibitor reduces the risk of upper GI bleeding compared to that of COX-2 inhibitor alone. A very recent network meta-analysis indeed found that this drug combination represents the best strategy to prevent ulcer complications.

### Community-dwelling older adults' awareness of the inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors [^1113XES4]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are effective in treating gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcers, and esophagitis. However, the long-term use of PPIs by older adults is associated with adverse health outcomes. There is limited evidence about older adults' awareness of long-term PPI use and its associated adverse effects. This study aimed to assess older adults' awareness of the adverse effects of the long-term use of PPIs, and their willingness to stop PPI use given of the risks and benefits of PPI use.

Methods

this cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 120 older adults from three local healthcare centers located in Irbid, Jordan. Older adults' awareness of PPI use was measured using the Patients' Perceptions of Proton Pump Inhibitor Risks and Attempts at Discontinuation Survey.

Results

the majority of the participating older adults were not familiar with any reports linking long-term PPI use with adverse effects, reported no concerns related to the chronic use of PPIs, and reported that they had not discussed the benefits and risks of PPI use with their primary care providers (PCPs). Although the majority of the participants had not previously attempted to stop using PPIs, the majority expressed a willingness to stop PPIs due to their adverse effects, especially if advised to do so by a PCP. The factors associated with the long-term use of PPIs included age, indications for gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD), improvement of GERD symptoms, and the willingness to reduce or stop PPIs. Being advised by a PCP to stop PPIs (p = 0.049) and having increased concerns about the adverse effects of long-term PPI use (p < 0.0001) were the only two statistically significant predictors of previous attempts to stop PPIs.

Conclusions

concerns regarding the adverse effects of long-term PPI use were associated with attempts to stop PPIs, especially in cases where this was recommended by a PCP. Discussions between PCPs and patients regarding the risks and benefits of PPIs are necessary in order to ensure that patients do not make inappropriate decisions regarding ongoing PPI therapy. Careful evaluation of the long-term use of PPIs among older adults is required.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1161VuS7]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPI-related adverse events involve the GI tract as well as other organs and systems. The majority of these events have been summarized in comprehensive reviews, to which the reader is referred. The potential risks of long-term PPI therapy, along with the respective evidence summary, are outlined in Tables 1 and 2.

Table 1
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Digestive System

Table 2
Concerns about long-term therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs): Extra-digestive effects

Gastric pH is relevant for the absorption of several drugs and its modification by antisecretory therapy may significantly modify their pharmacokinetics. PPIs also influence drug absorption and metabolism by interacting with adenosine triphosphate-dependent P-glycoprotein (e.g. inhibiting digoxin efflux) or with the CYP P450 enzyme system (e.g. decreasing simvastatin metabolism), thereby affecting both intestinal first-pass metabolism and hepatic clearance. A number of studies have shown that omeprazole (and, to a lesser extent, lansoprazole) carries a considerable potential for DDIs, since it has a high affinity for CYP2C19 and a somewhat lower affinity for CYP3A4. In contrast, pantoprazole and rabeprazole display a lower potential for DDIs. DDIs therefore represent a molecule-related effect rather than a class-effect.

These interactions are clinically relevant mostly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. diazepam, warfarin, antipsychotics, etc.). In addition, PPI metabolism is very rapid in most Caucasian subjects (extensive metabolizers), so that their half-life ranges from only 0.5 to 2.1 hours. Indeed, the prevalence of poor metabolizers, potentially at increased risk of drug interactions, is as low as 1.2–3.8% in Europe as compared to 23% in Asia. This could explain why only few of the reported DDIs involving PPIs have been shown to be of clinical significance.

Recent studies have raised concerns about a possible adverse interaction between clopidogrel and PPIs (currently prescribed to patients who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent upper GI bleeding) that could reduce the antithrombotic effect of the former and, therefore, lessen protection against CV events in high-risk patients. However, current evidence shows that, while concomitant use of some PPIs with clopidogrel does attenuate the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel, this effect is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Conversely, denying PPIs to patients at GI risk would result in increased life-threatening GI bleeding.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite PPIs carrying – like any other classes of drugs – some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some (if not all) safety concerns in order to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this Position Paper, we have reviewed the current available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements (i.e. Summaries of the current evidence) and in Table 3.

Table 3
Current indications of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy

Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. They do, however, go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances. Despite guidelines being developed to improve quality of care received by patients, they have been criticized for recommending too little or too much, and even for providing reasons for national health systems or insurance payers to deny coverage. Guidelines are often inflexible and can actually harm by leaving insufficient room for clinicians to tailor care to individual patient circumstances and medical history. What is best for patients overall, as recommended by guidelines, may be inappropriate for individuals. Only evidence-based recommendations, which consider the balance between benefits and harms, and weigh these considerations using patient (rather than expert and societal) value, should be followed in everyday clinical practice. Taking these considerations into account, we have tried to distill the current evidence and provide physicians with clear patient-oriented recommendations, beyond cost and reimbursement issues. Medicine is a rapidly evolving field, however, and the validity of guidelines will not necessarily stand the test of time: indeed, today's assumptions may no longer be valid tomorrow. Healthcare providers should therefore stay tuned and constantly update their knowledge.

### The clinician's guide to proton-pump inhibitor discontinuation [^1131cXSG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

There is increasing concern among patients and health care providers about the associations between PPI use and a multitude of potential adverse outcomes. Therefore, clinicians need to have a rational approach both to identifying PPI users who may not have an ongoing indication for their use and on how to encourage discontinuation of unnecessary PPI use. In this paper, we will provide a detailed review of the specific indications where the benefits of ongoing PPI use is of questionable value and will review the evidence on how to maximize the likelihood of being able to successfully discontinue PPI use while minimizing symptom recurrence.

### Prescribing PPIs [^116Nwu91]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and many people remain on them for years. In some, there may be good justification for long-term use; for example, in those with oesophageal stricture, Barrett's oesophagus or a history of a bleeding gastrointestinal ulcer, or to provide gastroprotection in those at high risk of gastrointestinal complications from taking NSAIDs. However, PPIs are often not used in line with clinical guidelines. 1,2 In addition, there are concerns that many people take them for long periods to manage less serious conditions (e.g. indigestion) and may prefer taking them to addressing factors such as diet, obesity or alcohol that may be contributing to their symptoms. Although PPIs are well-tolerated, there is increasing evidence that they may be associated with a range of long-term adverse effects. Here, we review the safety of PPIs and consider whether long-term prescribing needs to be reassessed.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a review of the current evidence [^112bZZyN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Gastric cancer remains one of the leading cancers in the world with a high mortality, particularly in East Asia. Helicobacter pylori infection accounts for the majority of the noncardia gastric cancers by triggering gastric inflammation and subsequent neoplastic progression. Eradication of H. pylori can reduce, but not totally eliminate, subsequent risk of developing gastric cancer. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. With their profound gastric-acid suppression, there are concerns about a possible carcinogenic role in gastric cancer, due to induced hypergastrinemia, gastric atrophy and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. While randomized clinical trials to establish causality between long-term PPI use and gastric cancer are lacking, current evidence based on observational studies suggests PPIs are associated with an increased gastric cancer risk. However, opinions on causality remain divergent due to unmeasured and possible residual confounding in various studies. Our recent study has showed that even after H. pylori eradication, long-term PPI use is still associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer by more than twofold. Hence, long-term PPIs should be used judiciously after considering individual's risk-benefit profile, particularly among those with history of H. pylori infection. Further well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm the potential role of PPIs in gastric cancer according to baseline gastric histology and its interaction with other chemopreventive agents like aspirin, statins and metformin.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^116qZweR]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — patient and clinician behavior regarding proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reports that concern about PPI-related complications is common, with nearly 40% having made an attempt at discontinuing PPIs, of whom 83% did so without being advised to by a physician. It also states that three-quarters of physicians reported that they have altered treatment plans because of concerns about PPIs, and approximately 80% state that they would discontinue PPIs after being presented with a clinical scenario of a patient at high risk of upper GI bleeding. The document cautions that the discontinuation of PPIs in patients with definite indications on the basis of concern about the unproven risk may lead to both recurrent symptoms and serious complications, and concludes, Therefore, physicians should not use concern about unproven complications of PPI use as a justification for PPI de-prescribing if there remain ongoing valid indications for PPI use.

### Proton-pump inhibitors: understanding the complications and risks [^115NAEHa]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective therapy for the full spectrum of gastric-acid-related diseases. However, in the past decade, a steadily increasing list of complications following long-term use of PPIs has been reported. Their potent acid-suppressive action induces several structural and functional changes within the gastric mucosa, including fundic gland polyps, enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and hypergastrinaemia, which can be exaggerated in the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection. As discussed in this Review, most associations of PPIs with severe adverse events are not based on sufficient evidence because of confounding factors and a lack of plausible mechanisms. Thus, a causal relationship remains unproven in most associations, and further studies are needed. Awareness of PPI-associated risks should not lead to anxiety in patients but rather should induce the physician to consider the appropriate dosing and duration of PPI therapy, including long-term monitoring strategies in selected groups of patients because of their individual comorbidities and risk factors.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, more specifically with respect to indications for discontinuation, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend to decide on discontinuing PPIs solely based on the lack of an indication for PPI therapy and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events. Do not use the presence of a PPI-associated adverse event, history of a PPI-associated adverse event in a current PPI user, or the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of a PPI-associated adverse event as independent indications for PPI withdrawal.

### Discontinuing long-term PPI therapy: why, with whom, and how? [^114fPPGc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely used class of drugs prescribed over the long term in all of clinical medicine with 8–10% of ambulatory adults have been prescribed a PPI in the past 30 days. However, numerous studies have raised doubts about the long term safety of PPI use. The purpose of this review is threefold: (i) To provide an overview of the current evidence demonstrating associations between PPI use and adverse health outcomes and the likelihood of the associations being causal (Why?); (ii) To be able to identify long-term PPI users in whom the intensity of PPI therapy could be reduced or in whom PPIs could be eliminated outright (Who?); and (iii) To provide strategies on how to reduce or stop chronic PPI therapy while maintaining symptom control and reducing the risk for symptom or upper GI disease recurrence (How?).

Potential chemopreventive agents to reduce proton-pump-inhibitor-associated gastric cancer risk

Meta-analyses have shown that aspirin reduces gastric cancer risk without stratification according to H. pylori status. To address this issue, we conducted another study on the effect of aspirin specifically on H. pylori -eradicated subjects. Aspirin was shown to be associated with a lower gastric cancer risk among H. pylori -eradicated subjects (HR 0.30; 95% CI 0.15–0.61), with a frequency–, duration–, and dose–response relationship being observed. A subsequent post hoc analysisshowed that the harmful effect of PPIs was higher (HR 3.73; 95% CI 2.11–6.60) among nonaspirin users, while PPIs were not associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer among aspirin users (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.04–2.74). The potential detrimental effect of PPIs on gastric cancer appears to be negated by aspirin use, although this observation necessitates validation by studies from other centers. Nevertheless, our study finding prompts the investigation of the role of other potential chemopreventive agents, such as metforminand statins, in reducing gastric cancer risk among PPI users should be further explored.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^111YjkDo]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Objective

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use has risen substantially, primarily driven by ongoing use over months to years. However, there is no consensus on how to define long-term PPI use. Our objectives were to review and compare definitions of long-term PPI use in existing literature and describe the rationale for each definition. Moreover, we aimed to suggest generally applicable definitions for research and clinical use.

Design

The databases PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched for publications concerning long-term use of PPIs and ClinicalTrials.gov was searched for registered studies. Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts in two series and subsequently extracted data.

Results

A total of 742 studies were identified, and 59 met the eligibility criteria. In addition, two ongoing studies were identified. The definition of long-term PPI use varied from > 2 weeks to > 7 years. The most common definition was ≥ 1 year or ≥ 6 months. A total of 12/61 (20%) of the studies rationalised their definition.

Conclusion

The definitions of long-term PPI treatment varied substantially between studies and were seldom rationalised. In a clinical context, use of PPI for more than 8weeks could be a reasonable definition of long-term use in patients with reflux symptoms and more than 4weeks in patients with dyspepsia or peptic ulcer. For research purposes, 6months could be a possible definition in pharmacoepidemiological studies, whereas studies of adverse effects may require a tailored definition depending on the necessary exposure time. We recommend to always rationalise the choice of definition.

### Recent safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^112QZmP1]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

There have been recent concerns about the safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). We focus here on 3 specific concerns-the possible interaction between PPIs and clopidogrel, the postulated link between PPI use and fractures, and the possibility that long-term PPI use might lead to hypomagnesemia. There is evidence for an in vitro interaction between clopidogrel and at least some PPIs. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned against the use of certain PPIs by patients on clopidogrel. However, a randomized controlled trial that compared clopidogrel alone with the combination of clopidogrel and omeprazole found no increase in adverse cardiovascular outcomes and a reduction in the rate of adverse gastrointestinal outcomes attributable to omeprazole. PPI use may be a weak risk factor for certain fractures, but the quality of evidence is relatively poor and there is a strong possibility of confounding. The mechanism whereby PPI use might increase fracture risk is unknown. Currently, no additional measures concerning calcium supplementation or bone mineral density monitoring are recommended for patients on a PPI. The FDA has suggested monitoring serum magnesium levels in patients on PPI therapy. The mechanism and frequency of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia are unclear. PPI treatment should not be withheld from patients who genuinely require it, but the PPI should be taken in the lowest effective dose and only for as long as clinically indicated. The same is, of course, true for all medicines. The benefits of PPI therapy greatly outweigh the risks.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors: whole-of-population patterns in Australia 2013–2016 [^116USVrk]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

These previous European studies also found that while prevalence of PPI use increased dramatically to the early 2010s, incidence did not increase at the same rate. This suggests that people are remaining on PPIs for longer periods of time and our results support this contention. Currently, there is no consistent definition of 'long-term' PPI use meaning that characterizing the phenomenon is somewhat problematic. One review noted 11 distinct definitions from 19 different studies. We attempted to negotiate this heterogeneity in definitions by examining several groups of people using PPIs beyond the 12 weeks of treatment recommended for the most common indications. The proportion of Australians continuing on long-term PPI treatment was below that reported in a UK study, which also used 12 months of treatment to indicate long-term use, but markedly higher than proportions reported in several studies conducted prior to 2005.

The people on long-term treatment in our study were older than all people initiating PPI treatment in Australia. There are growing concerns around potential harms of long-term PPI use, particularly risk of fracture, for which older individuals are already at greater risk. Multiple medicine use is also more widespread among older individuals. The high proportion of longer-term PPI treatment with concomitant NSAIDs or anticoagulants suggests that they may be frequently prescribed for prevention rather than treatment. The evidence for use with NSAIDs was generated for 'high-risk' patients, who had previously had GI bleeding. The use of PPIs for lower risk patients may increase risks of other NSAID complications. It has been noted in many other settings that 'preventative' use of PPIs with these medicines is a major driver of excessive long-term use. While we observed attempts to step-down treatment in people on maintenance and long-term therapy, low strength PPI dispensing comprises a very small component of overall PPI use in Australia. It is worth noting that the low strength formulation of the most commonly dispensed PPI medicine in Australia, esomeprazole, is not publicly subsidized in Australia (see Table 1), meaning stepping down would require either a change of medication or patients bearing the cost of treatment. Most of the step-down treatment we observed was from high strength to standard strength esomeprazole.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a review of the current evidence [^114Uyy6d]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations on proton-pump inhibitor use in clinical practice

Despite the potential harmful effects of PPIs, they are so far the most effective therapy for PUD, GERD and in preventing aspirin-/NSAID-related upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB). Indeed, the rational use of PPIs should be promoted to minimize any potential side effects associated with long-term use, rather than irrational avoidance. Physicians should consider the lowest effective dose of PPIs with a finite treatment period, particularly for nonerosive GERD and nonulcer dyspepsia. A stepdown approach to less potent acid-suppressive agents such as H2RAs should also be considered in appropriate settings.

However, certain clinical conditions may mandate long-term PPI use. For instance, individuals who are at high risk of aspirin-/NSAID-related UGIB should be given long-term PPIs. Barrett's esophagus is another condition in which long-term use of PPIs is recommended. If long-term PPI use is necessary, it is advisable to have H. pylori tested and eradicated if present so as to prevent the development of corpus atrophy, hence reducing gastric cancer risk. It has also been proposed that nonfasting chromogranin A be used as a serological marker in long-term PPI users to monitor the degree of ECL-cell hyperplasia. The effectiveness of this approach, however, has not yet been studied by prospective clinical studies and cost-effectiveness studies according to local gastric cancer incidence and different subgroups.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111uKFZD]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

PPIs remain the leading evidence-based therapy for acid-related diseases, including GERD, PU disease, dyspepsia, NSAID-induced ulcer, H. pylori infection, and hypersecretory disorders such as ZES.

The strong evidence supporting PPI efficacy and a favorable safety profile has led to overuse of these drugs in many treatment arenas. Surprisingly, despite more than 25 years of extensive literature addressing PPI therapy in upper GI disorders, inappropriate use remains consistently high both in hospital and in primary care. In a recent US study, only 39% of inpatients' prescriptions were compliant to guidelines, with a difference between academic and non-academic hospitals (compliance being 50% vs. 29%, respectively). Prophylaxis of upper GI bleeding in low risk patients was the most common indication for non-compliant prescriptions, while that of guideline compliant prescriptions was treatment of dyspepsia.

The questionable and inappropriate PPI use in the absence of documented evidence, supporting clear indications, is likely due to the perception that many physicians have about PPI safety, which makes them forget to assess the harms and benefits of (especially long-term) therapy. Several studies (for a review see) have shown that physicians frequently do not review and document PPI indications, which often results in their long-term or even indefinite continuation.

There are two main concerns pertaining to PPI overuse and misuse: drug expenditure, which has risen dramatically in recent years, even after the introduction of cheaper generic formulations, and growing safety concerns. Despite their concentration within the secretory canaliculi of the parietal cell and their pharmacologic selectivity, PPIs also have a "dark side". Sir William Osler once famously commented that no drug has a single effect and these secondary actions range from mildly inconvenient to frankly dangerous – PPIs are no exception.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^116qwspC]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often coadministered with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) to reduce NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. This coadministration is generally regarded as safe, and is included in many of the guidelines on NSAID prescription. However, recent evidence indicates that the GI risks associated with NSAIDs can be potentiated when they are combined with PPIs. This review discusses the GI effects and complications of NSAIDs and how PPIs may potentiate these effects, options for prevention of GI side effects, and appropriate use of PPIs in combination with NSAIDs.

### Proton-pump inhibitors and long-term risk of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults [^115hXZBN]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate associations between long‐term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and pneumonia incidence in older adults in primary care.

Design

Longitudinal analyses of electronic medical records.

Setting

England

Participants

Individuals aged 60 and older in primary care receiving PPIs for 1 year or longer (N = 75,050) and age‐ and sex‐matched controls (N = 75,050).

Measurements

Net hazard ratios for pneumonia incidence in Year 2 of treatment were estimated using the prior event rate ratio (PERR), which adjusts for pneumonia incidence differences before initiation of treatment. Inverse probability weighted models adjusted for 78 demographic, disease, medication, and healthcare usage measures.

Results

During the second year after initiating treatment, PPIs were associated with greater hazard of incident pneumonia (PERR‐adjusted hazard ratio = 1.82, 95% confidence interval = 1.27–2.54), accounting for pretreatment pneumonia rates. Estimates were similar across age and comorbidity subgroups. Similar results were also obtained from propensity score– and inverse probability–weighted models.

Conclusion

In a large cohort of older adults in primary care, PPI prescription was associated with greater risk of pneumonia in the second year of treatment. Results were robust across alternative analysis approaches. Controversies about the validity of reported short‐term harms of PPIs should not divert attention from potential long‐term effects of PPI prescriptions on older adults.

### Safety of proton pump inhibitor exposure [^116GJ4zc]. Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Proton pump (H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase) inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used to treat patients with acid-related disorders because they are generally perceived to be safe and effective. However, as with any pharmacologic agent, they have the potential for side effects. Many studies have examined the side effects of long-term or short-term PPI exposure. We review the mechanism of action of PPIs, focusing on recently released products that might have greater risks of adverse effects than older products because of increased potency and/or duration of action. We summarize the data available on the putative adverse effects of PPI therapy and propose guidelines for clinicians who prescribe these agents to limit the potential for adverse outcomes in users of these effective therapeutic agents.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a review of the current evidence [^114N6LMM]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical studies on the association between proton-pump inhibitors and gastric cancer

The incidence of gastric cancer indeed has been gradually declining in the past 50 years with an average estimated annual percentage decrease of 2.5% per year. This observation has therefore been used as an argument against the potential carcinogenic role of PPIs, which has been available only since 1989. However, it could not be over-emphasized that reduction in the prevalence of H. pylori and improvement in food processing actually contribute to this observed decline in gastric cancer incidence, hence masking the possible effect of PPIs on increasing gastric cancer incidence.

As gastric cancer is a relatively rare disease which requires a long-time lag to develop, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrating the potential carcinogenic effects of PPIs are both resource and labor intensive. More importantly, there may be an ethical issue in randomizing patients to receive intervention to observe primary adverse outcome. As such, the determination of the causal relationship could, at best, be determined by well-designed observational studies controlling for known confounding factors, with minimization of biases.

### When is proton pump inhibitor use appropriate? [^112YncNM]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The role of PPI therapy for managing extra-esophageal symptoms that are potentially from gastroesophageal reflux is even more perplexing. Scarpignato et al. highlight the paucity of high-quality data regarding PPI therapy for non-cardiac chest pain, laryngeal complaints, asthma, dental erosions, and chronic cough. Paradoxically, this has led to the widespread practice of treating these conditions with high doses of PPIs for extended periods of time. Furthermore, with no specified alternative management strategy, this frequently leads to long-term high-dose PPI usage in these conditions regardless of effectiveness. More than any, these patients benefit from further physiological investigation (manometry, reflux monitoring) to either implicate PPI-refractory GERD as a cause of their symptoms or to justify PPI discontinuation. Based on personal experience, the appropriate intervention is often PPI discontinuation in patients with isolated extra-esophageal symptoms that have not responded to a PPI trial. Continuing PPI therapy in such circumstances provides no benefit and simply exposes patients to the risk of therapy, the other focus to the Scarpignato review.

The list of safety concerns related to long-term PPI use is growing, both in number and in public visibility. Although largely based on low quality data and, in many instances, refuted by higher quality data, the warnings are out there on the TV, the internet, and the package inserts. This has resulted in widespread PPI angst among patients and not a day goes by that this is not the topic of a patient consultation in a specialty gastrointestinal disorders practice. Scarpignato et al. comprehensively review both the digestive and extra-digestive concerns about PPI usage, but ultimately reiterate that PPIs are well tolerated and that the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh potential risks when PPIs are used for an appropriate indication. Table 2 summarizes available safety information on long-term PPI use with the concerns grouped by the strength of substantiating data and significance. Evident in the table, there is little there of sufficient concern to alter practice, providing that PPI use is appropriate.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^115byt67]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Appropriate use of PPIs in patients on NSAIDs: when and why?

Managing upper-GI damage

According to the guidelines available, PPIs are still essential in the treatment and prophylaxis of NSAID-induced upper-GI injury. However, their prescription for this indication should be based on appropriate recommendations from worldwide published guidelines. Also, it is essential to reduce their continuation after the patient's discharge from hospital by assessing the true need on a case-by-case basis and periodically reviewing the long-term intake. Table 4 summarizes some risks and benefits of using PPIs.

Managing lower-GI damage

Much of the data available are catered toward upper-GI protection. Scarpignato et alprovided general guidance on prescription of NSAIDs and PPIs based on cardiovascular and GI risk of the patient. However, this was based only on upper-GI risk. At present, there are no comprehensive guidelines on how and when to prescribe PPIs for the prophylaxis of both upper- and lower-GI injury in NSAID users. Although several international guidelines touch on this issue, they do not explicitly state what to do in the event that a low-GI-risk patient becomes a high-risk one or what to do in the event that the first-line decision fails. Perhaps it is time to reconsider the use of PPIs together with NSAIDs.

### Does long-term proton pump inhibitor use increase risk of dementia? Not really! results of the group-based trajectory analysis [^115hChyC]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Conflicting data of the potential association between proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and risk of dementia have been reported. This study aimed to examine the subsequent risk of incident dementia in older adults by categorizing subjects into different trajectories of longitudinal PPI use. A group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify distinct groups with regard to longitudinal PPI use over 3 years and to further examine the association between the trajectories of PPI use and dementia in a 5-year follow-up. Among 10,533 older adults who initiated PPIs, three distinct trajectories of longitudinal PPI use were identified: short-term (n = 7,406, 70.3%), intermittent (n = 1,528, 14.5%), and long-term users (n = 1,599, 15.2%). Long-term (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93–1.17)) and intermittent PPI users (HR = 0.91 (95% CI, 0.76–1.09)) were not associated with an increased risk of incident dementia compared with short-term users. Regardless of pattern of use, PPIs did not appear to significantly increase the risk of dementia over a mean follow-up period of 4 years.

### Community-dwelling older adults' awareness of the inappropriate use of proton pump inhibitors [^111N5yuV]. BMC Geriatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

PPIs are one of the most commonly used medications among community-dwelling older adults. The current study reported findings on the long-term use or inappropriate prescribing of PPIs. An association was found between patients' concerns regarding the adverse effects of PPIs and their attempts to stop PPIs, especially if advised to do so by a PCP. Despite the potential adverse effects of the long-term use of PPIs by older adults, PPI discontinuation may not be appropriate for patients who need long-term acid suppression. Therefore, PCPs should discuss the risks and benefits of PPI use with their patients in order to prevent them from making inappropriate decisions related to PPI therapy. The long-term use of PPIs should be carefully evaluated, especially in the case of older adults who take PPIs for uncertain indications. Future studies with more well-controlled designs and samples of older populations are recommended. Also, future studies which focus on older adults' awareness of the benefits of PPI use as well as the risks are recommended.

### Long-term use of proton-pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a review of the current evidence [^1115S72T]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Emerging evidence from multiple observational studies suggests long-term use of PPIs is associated with a higher risk of gastric cancer development. However, the risk is likely limited to individuals with current or past history of H. pylori infection, particularly those with underlying precancerous gastric lesions. Physicians should prescribe PPIs according to individual's risk–benefit profile rather than withholding PPIs from those with genuine indications, such as Barrett's esophagus or high risk of UGIB. This is particularly important for aspirin users at high risk of UGIB, as aspirin may negate the potential harmful effects of PPIs on gastric cancer development. Further well-designed prospective studies are warranted to confirm the potential role of PPIs in gastric cancer according to baseline gastric histology and its interaction with other chemopreventive agents like aspirin, statins, and metformin.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114TQX8u]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Before embarking on long-term treatment, an attempt to stop acid suppression must always be considered. Of the various interventions (patient's education, life-style modifications, abrupt withdrawal, and tapering), tapering is the more effective discontinuation strategy. Abrupt withdrawal might be followed by rebound acid hypersecretion and exacerbation of symptoms. Weight loss appears to be another strategy in obese/overweight patients. Indeed, in one study, up to 54% of subjects compliant to a hypocaloric diet were able to stop PPI therapy, with an additional 32% being able to halve the dose. All the above attempts should be considered also in patients who are already on long-term acid suppression.

Continuous maintenance therapy is indicated in patients with Barrett's esophagus of any mucosal length, owing to the potential chemopreventive activity of PPIs against neoplastic transformation, a property advocated by the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and American Gastroenterological Association, but denied by the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis of observational studies showed that PPI use is associated with a 71% reduction in risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma and/or high-grade dysplasia in this patient population (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.29). Despite a contrary opinion of the American Gastroenterological Association, current evidence suggests that standard PPI therapy is unable to normalize esophageal exposure to acid in the vast majority of patients with Barrett's esophagus. Profound and individually tailored maximal acid suppression is needed not only to control GER, but also in the hope to achieve a better chemopreventive effect.

### AGA clinical practice update on De-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: expert review [^1166jz4m]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update on de-prescribing proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) — best practice advice statements specify that all patients taking a PPI should have a regular review of the ongoing indications for use and documentation of that indication, and this review should be the responsibility of the patient's primary care provider; all patients without a definitive indication for chronic PPI should be considered for trial of de-prescribing; most patients with an indication for chronic PPI use who take twice-daily dosing should be considered for step down to once-daily PPI; and patients with complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease, such as those with a history of severe erosive esophagitis, esophageal ulcer, or peptic stricture, should generally not be considered for PPI discontinuation. Additional advice states that patients with known Barrett's esophagus, eosinophilic esophagitis, or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis should generally not be considered for a trial of de-prescribing; PPI users should be assessed for upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk using an evidence-based strategy before de-prescribing; patients at high risk for upper gastrointestinal bleeding should not be considered for PPI de-prescribing; patients who discontinue long-term PPI therapy should be advised that they may develop transient upper gastrointestinal symptoms due to rebound acid hypersecretion; when de-prescribing PPIs, either dose tapering or abrupt discontinuation can be considered; and the decision to discontinue PPI should be based solely on the lack of an indication for PPI use and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events (PAAEs), with the presence of a PAAE or underlying risk factors not an independent indication for PPI withdrawal.

Certainty of the evidence

Overall quality of evidence was very low when considering all of the outcomes together. This was due to either one or combinations of the following: risk of bias, imprecision (low sample size, varying CIs), indirectness, and inability to pool the data because of varying outcome definitions.

Discussion

Overall, the certainty in evidence was very low. The panel acknowledged that while there is lack of robust data, there is benefit of weight loss and smoking cessation from overall health improvement and cancer reduction. Data regarding other dietary interventions may be weak but these are low-risk interventions that can be incorporated as GERD-related lifestyle measures. Given the low cost to these interventions as well as the potential for other health benefits of these lifestyle interventions, the panel agreed that these lifestyle modifications should be recommended to decrease GERD symptoms based on the evidence available.

Question 4: In patients with GERD, does proton pump inhibitor compared with placebo reduce symptoms?

Recommendation 4:
- In patients with symptomatic and confirmed GERD with predominant heartburn symptoms, the ASGE recommends medical management with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible period of time while initiating discussion about long-term management options. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence)
- In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and selection accordingly. (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence)

Best practice advice:

- Patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management.
- Providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use for patients with GERD.
- Providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is a need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^111ofaxZ]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

PPIs are among the safest class of drugs. Although concerns have been raised on their long-term safety, the preponderance of evidence does not strongly support the concerns, publicized over the last few years, and the absolute risk is probably low. Some adverse effects are plausible and predictable; others are idiosyncratic, unpredictable, and rare. Based on the quality of the existing evidence, the benefits of PPI treatment outweigh the potential risks in most patients, especially if PPI use is based on a relevant and appropriate indication. Conversely, patients treated without an appropriate therapeutic indication are only exposed to potential risks and the benefit-to-harm balance becomes very low. Consequently, the overall focus should be on the appropriateness of PPI therapy and on a regular assessment of the need for continued PPI treatment.

Nearly all the adverse outcomes associated with PPIs occur among patients who receive long-term therapy; minimizing the duration of treatment by periodically reviewing a patient's need for acid-suppressive therapy could eliminate or substantially reduce the risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, during continued long-term use, the clinical effects should always be reviewed and attempts be made to stop any therapy that may not be needed. It is imperative to use the lowest dose of drug required to achieve the desired therapeutic goals. This may entail implementing discontinuation of treatment in asymptomatic patients as well as step-down, intermittent, or on-demand PPI therapy for maintenance of GERD. It should be emphasized, however, that PPI treatment in GERD is merely palliative in nature, since it does not address the underlying pathophysiology, something only ARS is able to achieve. Therefore, in young fit patients needing continuous acid suppression, fundoplication should be considered. Intermittent or on-demand PPI therapy is not suitable for NSAID users, since the risk of serious GI events is constant in those patients with GI risk factors and can persist for some time after stopping therapy.

### Toxicity of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors in children [^111Zh9Z9]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2018). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is becoming increasingly common. Although the toxicity profiles of PPIs are not well understood particularly in children, PPIs have been associated with increased risks of gastrointestinal and respiratory tract infection, vitamin B 12 deficiency, hypomagnesaemia, bone fractures, and rebound hyperacidity after discontinuation. Prescribers should take into account that PPI uses pose toxicity risks, which remain to be fully characterised in infants and children.

### Is empiric proton pump inhibition in patients with symptoms of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux justified? [^112r4kzA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In addition to the imprecision of a PPI trial as a diagnostic test, the potential side effects of PPIs should also be kept in mind. While the absolute risk of side effects caused by a PPI trial is low, long-term use in larger populations may significantly increase gastrointestinal infections, alter the gastrointestinal microbiome and increase the risk of gastric cancer. Rebound acid hypersecretion after cessation of PPI use is especially of concern when treating individuals with poor indication of PPI use as it may lead to long-term use with risks that will necessarily outweigh benefits. Symptomatic rebound hypersecretion is likely to be common after a 12-week PPI trial. After eight weeks of esomeprazole 40 mg once daily 44% of healthy volunteers reported symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux versus 15% in the placebo group. Similarly, after cessation of four weeks of pantoprazole 40 mg once daily as many as 44% versus 9% in the placebo group had dyspeptic symptoms. After long-term PPI use, rebound acid hypersecretion lasts between two and four months, which may prevent patients from stopping PPI once started. The use of PPI has almost doubled over the past decade in Norway as well as in other countries and the costs are high. Although many patients have good indications for long-term PPI use that clearly outweighs risks of side effects, the concern is obvious when patients without indication or benefit of PPI use starts life-long acid inhibition.

### Cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular concerns with proton pump inhibitors: are they safe? [^115KRWKg]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) has been a cornerstone in the treatment of acid-related disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer, and their use has increased rapidly during the last decades. Being highly lipophilic drugs, they may potentially affect several pathophysiological pathways involved in cardiovascular and kidney morbidity, immune response and infections, absorption of selected nutrients, bone metabolism and cognitive function. Clinical epidemiology evidence coming from well-designed analyses of observational data consistently reported that long-term use of PPIs may increase the risk of cardiovascular events among patients treated with thienopyridines, tubular-interstitial nephritis and chronic kidney disease, hypomagnesemia, and fractures. Conversely, currently available evidence about the impact of PPIs on cardiovascular risk among patients not treated with thienopyridines, infections, nutritional disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia is limited by confounding. Given that randomized controlled trials investigating these issues are unlikely to be realized, the application of modern pharmacoepidemiology principles is expected to mitigate limitations of observational studies while addressing these relevant knowledge gaps. Meanwhile, physicians should be aware of potential issues related to long-term use of PPIs and weigh benefits of PPI therapy for appropriate indications along with the likelihood of the potential risks. A deprescription trial should be considered for all PPI users who do not have definite indications for long-term therapy.

### Deprescribing versus continuation of chronic proton pump inhibitor use in adults [^112DQEkz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications that reduce acid secretion and are used for treating many conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease, and hypersecretory conditions (e.g. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), and as part of the eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori bacteria. However, approximately 25% to 70% of people are prescribed a PPI inappropriately. Chronic PPI use without reassessment contributes to polypharmacy and puts people at risk of experiencing drug interactions and adverse events (e.g. Clostridium difficile infection, pneumonia, hypomagnesaemia, and fractures).

Objectives

To determine the effects (benefits and harms) associated with deprescribing long-term PPI therapy in adults, compared to chronic daily use (28 days or greater).

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 10), MEDLINE, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP). The last date of search was November 2016. We handsearched the reference lists of relevant studies. We screened 2357 articles (2317 identified through search strategy, 40 through other resources). Of these articles, we assessed 89 for eligibility.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized trials comparing at least one deprescribing modality (e.g. stopping PPI or reducing PPI) with a control consisting of no change in continuous daily PPI use in adult chronic users. Outcomes of interest were: change in gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, drug burden/PPI use, cost/resource use, negative and positive drug withdrawal events, and participant satisfaction.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed and extracted data and completed the risk of bias assessment. A third review author independently confirmed risk of bias assessment. We used Review Manager 5 software for data analysis. We contacted study authors if there was missing information.

Main Results

The review included six trials (n = 1758). Trial participants were aged 48 to 57 years, except for one trial that had a mean age of 73 years. All participants were from the outpatient setting and had either nonerosive reflux disease or milder grades of esophagitis (LA grade A or B). Five trials investigated on-demand deprescribing and one trial examined abrupt discontinuation. There was low quality evidence that on-demand use of PPI may increase risk of 'lack of symptom control' compared with continuous PPI use (risk ratio (RR) 1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31 to 2.21), thereby favoring continuous PPI use (five trials, n = 1653). There was a clinically significant reduction in 'drug burden', measured as PPI pill use per week with on-demand therapy (mean difference (MD) -3.79, 95% CI -4.73 to -2.84), favoring deprescribing based on moderate quality evidence (four trials, n = 1152). There was also low quality evidence that on-demand PPI use may be associated with reduced participant satisfaction compared with continuous PPI use. None of the included studies reported cost/resource use or positive drug withdrawal effects.

Authors' Conclusions

In people with mild GERD, on-demand deprescribing may lead to an increase in GI symptoms (e.g. dyspepsia, regurgitation) and probably a reduction in pill burden. There was a decline in participant satisfaction, although heterogeneity was high. There were insufficient data to make a conclusion regarding long-term benefits and harms of PPI discontinuation, although two trials (one on-demand trial and one abrupt discontinuation trial) reported endoscopic findings in their intervention groups at study end.

Best practice advice states that patients who have been on long-term PPI therapy (> 6 mo) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation of medical management, providers should carefully consider the risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use with the patient with GERD, and providers prescribing PPI therapy should be aware that adverse events from PPI in prospective data have been limited to increased risk of enteric infections; however, there is need for robust long-term data to prove or disprove any other putative adverse events.

Results

PPIs for GERD

Summary of the current evidence

PPIs represent the mainstay of medical treatment of esophageal manifestations of GERD; however, their benefits (if any) in extra-digestive GERD are still uncertain. Eight-week therapy with standard (once daily) dose PPIs can achieve healing of reflux esophagitis and symptom relief in more than 80% of patients with typical symptoms. When a functional investigation is added to a negative endoscopy in making the diagnosis, PPI efficacy in GERD and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD) appears comparable. Being a chronic, relapsing disease, GERD (as well as NERD) requires long-term PPI treatment, which can be continuous, intermittent or on-demand. Profound and individually tailored maximal acid suppression is needed in patients with Barrett's esophagus not only to control gastroesophageal reflux (GER) but also in the hope to achieve a chemopreventive effect against neoplastic transformation.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^115i638H]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

If the aim is to study side effects related to long-term use, the definition of long term might need to be shorter or longer than 6 months depending on the length of exposure time needed for the side effect to occur.

In conclusion, we observed substantial variability in definitions of long-term PPI treatment. The majority of definitions did not include a rationale for the choice of definition. The variety of definitions complicates the comparison of research results and raises challenges in clinical practice, such as identifying an appropriate timeframe for discussing deprescribing. We suggest that long-term use could be defined as more than 4–8 weeks of PPI use in a clinical context depending on the indication for PPI therapy. One definition does not fit all research purposes. Thus, we suggest more than 6 months of PPI use as a possible definition for long-term use in pharmacoepidemiological studies and for studies of adverse effects the definition should be tailored the exposure time needed for the side effect in question to occur. When studying long-term use of PPIs, we suggest always giving well-argued choices of definitions.

### Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of gastric cancer: a systematic review, evidence synthesis and life course epidemiology perspective [^113u78e6]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

The first proton pump inhibitor (PPI), omeprazole, was discovered during the late 1970s and soon commercialised in Europe (first in Sweden in 1988) and the USA (1990).PPIs are now among the most commonly used drugs worldwide, often as maintenance therapy (up to 10%–30% of adults), although the main indications warrant short-term treatment (< 4–8 weeks). Up to 25%–70% of long-term PPI use is insufficiently justified, with a large cost to the patient and society.PPIs are even available over-the-counter in many countries (first in Sweden in 1999), although the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advised against this in 2000, based on concerns about the long-term benefits and risks.

Already in 1985, rat studies showed gastric carcinoids, 'attributable to pronounced hypergastrinaemia produced as a secondary effect of almost complete inhibition of acid secretion by the large omeprazole doses'. During the 1980–1990s, there were fierce warnings regarding the potential carcinogenic effects of long-term acid suppression. In the 1990s, potential genotoxic effects were suggested, and case series described gastric glandular cysts in association with omeprazole exposure (1–5 years), with no sex predilection. Fundic gland polyps were reported to disappear after PPI cessation.

The potential pathophysiological mechanisms have been discussed and disputed regularly. In short, the PPI-induced prolonged and absolute gastric suppression could lead to secondary hypergastrinaemia, change the gastric pHand also harm our 'gastric barrier' against microbes. Gastric bacterial overgrowth may influence gastric carcinogenesis, as already discussed during the early 1990s in relation to PPIs, and even suggested in 1895. Gastric cancer is now considered a multifactorial disease with Helicobacter pylori as the most established risk factor, discovered in 1984, and formally recognised as a definite (gastric) carcinogen by the World Health Organization since 1994. To complicate population-based association studies on PPIs and gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication has been increasingly implemented around the same period as PPIs were introduced. Long-term PPIs have been associated with increased gastric inflammation and development of atrophy among those with active H. pylori infections. This risk could however be reduced or eliminated by testing and eradicating H. pylori, through a combination of antibiotics and PPIs. More recently, PPIs have been described to affect the oral, gastric, gut and even lung microbiota, with stronger population-based effects than antibiotics.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^1164rfAk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Long-term PPI issues — regarding the safety of long-term PPI usage for GERD, we suggest that patients should be advised as follows: PPIs are the most effective medical treatment for GERD. High-quality studies have found that PPIs do not significantly increase the risk of any of these conditions except intestinal infections, and for GERD the well-established benefits of PPIs far outweigh their theoretical risks. For tolerability, switching PPIs can be considered for minor side effects. For bone health, in patients with GERD on PPIs who have no other risk factors for bone disease, we do not recommend raising intake of calcium or vitamin D or routine bone mineral density monitoring.

### Proton-pump inhibitors and long-term risk of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults [^112PMLtf]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Pneumonia risk is greater with long‐term PPI therapy in older adults in primary care, independent of excess pneumonia rates immediately before first PPI receipt. In our cohort, the excess risk was statistically similar across age and comorbidity groups, but more work is needed to identify individuals at highest risk.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) safety — randomized trial outcomes: In a large placebo-controlled trial, "17,598 patients aged 65 years or older" with vascular disease were randomized to pantoprazole "(40 mg daily, n = 8,791) or placebo (n = 8,807)", with data collected "at 6-month intervals over a period of 3 years" to assess predefined adverse events. Investigators "found no significant differences between the PPI and placebo groups" for potential side effects "except for enteric infections (1.4% vs 1.0% in the PPI and placebo groups, respectively; OR 1.33; 95% CI, 1.01–1.75)", and "Pantoprazole for 3 years was not associated with any adverse event other than a modestly increased risk of developing enteric infections". Caveats noted include that "the trial had a maximum follow-up of 5 years" and that it "cannot exclude the possibility that PPIs confer a modest risk of any of these adverse events (i.e., the upper limit of the 95% CIs all are > 1)".

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^1167ivS5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Under the current situation of PPI misuse, opportunities do exist to increase appropriateness in order to enhance effectiveness and safety of drug therapy as well as minimize overall healthcare costs. As always, education is the key. Issuing guidelines and implementing them represent the most rational approach to the problem. Judicious surveillance of hospital use and prescription refills in the outpatient settings, with re-evaluation and justification for continued treatment, can minimize the potential for adverse effects and achieve cost saving. However, surveillance must be close and continuous since the attained benefits could be short lasting. Indeed, in a recent Canadian study, de-prescribing guidelines were associated with a decline in PPI use during the initial 6 months, but prescription patterns began to climb back to baseline afterwards.

### Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors: fact or fake news? [^1133Mmgt]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors.

Recent Findings

Proton pump inhibitors are amongst the most widely prescribed and overprescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies mining large databases have reported a panoply of purported serious adverse effects associated with proton pump inhibitors, including chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, myocardial infarction, stroke, bone fracture and even death. It should be noted that the quality of the evidence underlying these associations is very low and these studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. Nonetheless, these associations have been sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by patients and providers. Unintended consequences of the fake news are that patients are not being prescribed and/or taking clinical guideline-recommended proton pump inhibitors to prevent and treat complications from gastroesophageal reflux disease and upper gastrointestinal bleeding precipitated by NSAIDs and dual antiplatelet therapies. In addition, physicians, who already have limited time to interact with their patients, are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective and reassuring their patients when initiating treatment as well as on every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent highly publicized serious adverse effects ascribed to proton pump inhibitors are not based on demonstrable evidence. Nevertheless, when proton pump inhibitors are prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Proton pump inhibitors and osteoporosis [^112rwz5A]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of the review is to provide an update on recent advances in the evidence based on proton pump inhibitors (PPI) as a possible cause of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. This review focuses, in particular, on new studies published in the last 18 months and a discussion of these findings and how this has influenced our understanding of this association, the clinical impact and the underlying pathophysiology.

Recent Findings

New studies have further strengthened existing evidence linking use of PPIs to osteoporosis. Short-term use does not appear to pose a lower risk than long-term use. There is a continued lack of conclusive studies identifying the pathogenesis. Direct effects on calcium absorption or on osteoblast or osteoclast action cannot at present plausibly explain the mechanism.

Summary

The use of PPIs is a risk factor for development of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures. However, as the direct pathogenesis remains unclear, specific points of intervention are lacking, other than being vigilant in regard to the indication for prescribing PPIs and to use the lowest effective dose where PPIs cannot be avoided.

### Proton pump inhibitor prescribing and monitoring patterns among gastroenterology practitioners [^115u4bvV]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Goals

The aim was to quantify proton pump inhibitor (PPI) practice habits among gastroenterology (GI) practitioners.

Background

Reports of side effects have prompted patients and practitioners alike to discontinue PPI use. Emerging evidence-based literature on PPI risks and safety seek to guide practitioners, but the impact of this literature on PPI prescribing patterns has not been evaluated.

Study

We performed an anonymous online survey of US GI practitioners across 6 academic and community affiliated medical centers. Demographic data including practice type and number of weekly gastroesophageal reflux disease patients seen were obtained. Survey questions evaluated practitioners' monitoring for PPI side effects, dose adjustments, and sources of information about PPI risks.

Results

The survey response rate was 60% (256/429). The majority of respondents were male (169, 66%) attending physicians (178, 70%) practicing general GI (63, 25%). There were 92 (36%) respondents who reported testing for PPI side effects at least once a year. Most respondents (143, 56%) reported discontinuing PPIs at least 50% of the time because of patients' concerns about PPI side effects. The majority of respondents reported getting their information regarding PPI safety from published journals (239, 98%) as well as colleagues (222, 91%).

Conclusions

Despite best available evidence suggesting safety of long-term PPI use without routine monitoring, stopping PPIs and monitoring for potential side effects occurs frequently, even within a cohort of mostly academic GI practitioners. Alternative strategies are needed to improve adherence to best practices, especially since gastroenterologists often serve as PPI experts.

### Long-term safety concerns with proton pump inhibitors [^113hh6JM]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most widely prescribed medications worldwide. Their use has resulted in dramatic improvements in treatment of peptic ulcer disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Despite an acceptable safety profile, mounting data demonstrate concerns about the long-term use of PPIs. To provide a comprehensive review regarding the concerns of long-term PPI use, a literature search was performed to identify pertinent original and review articles. Despite study shortcomings, the collective body of information overwhelmingly suggests an increased risk of infectious complications and nutritional deficiencies. Data regarding any increased risk in gastric or colon malignancy are less convincing. PPIs have revolutionized the management and complications of acid-related disorders with a high margin of safety; however, with the data available, efforts to reduce the dosing of or discontinue the use of PPIs must be reassessed frequently.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^113rRwk4]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used drugs worldwide. In Denmark, PPI prescriptions are redeemed by more than 10% of the population each year. Incident and prevalent PPI use are rising, the latter driven primarily by ongoing use over months to years. This has raised questions about whether continuous PPI therapy is actually needed in many patients. Around 40% of PPI users may be treated without an ongoing registered indicationand concerns have been raised about possible adverse effects, specifically related to use of PPIs over months to years. Only 4–8 weeks of treatment with PPIs can cause rebound acid hypersecretion and acid-related symptoms in previously asymptomatic individuals, potentially contributing to continued use of PPIs.

Trends in PPI use have been intensely investigated in recent years, with studies consistently referring to long-term PPI use. However, there is no consensus on how to define long-term PPI useand the definitions of long-term use vary between studies. Substantial discrepancies in definitions of long-term use make it difficult to draw firm overall conclusions about the prevalence and impact of extended continuous PPI therapy and about discontinuation of long-term PPI therapy.

An appropriate uniform definition of long-term use of PPIs is relevant in a clinical context. Position statements or guidelines have provided comprehensive and rational clinical advice concerning long-term use but have not provided a clear definition of what long-term use is. This makes it challenging in clinical practice to determine whether and when a patient is considered a long-term user and to decide when deprescribing can be discussed.

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to review and compare definitions of long-term PPI use which have been used in the literature and explore the rationale for each definition. Furthermore, we aim to suggest a generally applicable definition of long-term use of PPIs for research and clinical use.

### When does proton pump inhibitor treatment become long term? A scoping review [^116ArBBA]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In our review we were able to identify 61 studies on different aspects related to long-term use of PPIs. The definitions of long-term use varied substantially between studies and consensus in the literature on how to define long-term use of PPIs is lacking. One in five studies stated an explanation for their choice of definition.

Comparison with previous literature

To our knowledge this is the first study systematically assessing the different definitions used in studies of long-term use of PPIs. In a review from 2005, Raghunath et al mention that there is no consensus on how to define long-term use and state the definitions used in some previous studies without attempting to establish a consensus-based definition. Additionally, a substantial amount of studies have emerged since 2005 and a new evaluation was required.

Implications

The substantial variability in definitions of long-term use makes it challenging to compare studies in this area. For example, it is difficult to compare the range, burden and magnitude of extended continuous PPI therapy when definitions of 'long-term' use vary widely. More uniform definitions could improve these aspects and allow for more reliable conclusions to be drawn across available studies.

In a clinical context, several guidelines on PPI prescribing exist, but definitions of long-term use are often lacking. An appropriate time to discuss ongoing use may be after an initial course of PPI is finished (eg, at 2–4 weeks for uninvestigated dyspepsia) to avoid ongoing use without indication. For several studies of patients with non-erosive reflux disease/gastro-oesophageal reflux disease identified in this review, long-term use was defined as using > 4 or > 8 weeks. This may reflect the fact that efficacy trials demonstrate healing of oesophagitis with 4–8 weeks of PPI, which is also reflected in guideline recommendations.

In patients with suboptimal clinical response to PPI therapy, the ASGE suggests testing CYP2C19 polymorphism and adjusting PPI dosage and/or selection accordingly (conditional recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). Best practice advice includes that patients on chronic PPI therapy (> 6 months) should be considered for optimization and de-escalation, providers should carefully consider risks, benefits, and alternatives of PPI use, and prescribers should be aware that adverse events in prospective data have been limited to a modest increased risk of enteric infections with a need for robust long-term data to confirm or refute other putative adverse events.

### Coprescribing proton-pump inhibitors with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: risks versus benefits [^115NkLqz]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Deprescribing PPIs

Coadministration of NSAIDs–PPIs is widely used and still regarded as safe and standard medical practice. Use of PPIs for ulcer prophylaxis in low-risk patients is often perceived by doctors as a harmless and relatively inexpensive remedy. Also, many patients continue to take PPIs beyond the recommended course of treatment. This of course has potential for harm, as well as large economic implications. Deprescribing PPIs, however, may be important and clinically relevant in many patients taking NSAIDs. For example, patients who require chronic pain medication tend to be older (≥ 65 years), and thus more likely to have comorbidities. Hence, NSAID–PPI coprescription will likely contribute to polypharmacy and increase risks along with additive side effects, especially those affecting the lower GI.

Benefits of deprescribing

Prescribing a PPI together with an NSAID as ulcer prophylaxis is an example of a prescribing cascade. It can result in further harm to the patient. As seen from evidence on the effects of PPIs on gut microbiota, we see how a prescribing cascade exacerbates the adverse events of NSAIDs. Deprescribing will reduce the risk of adverse events of NSAIDs. Deprescribing will also decrease risks of nonadherence. A cohort study in Italy found that among the 100 patients recruited, nonadherence was reported for 49 (55.1%) at the first follow-up and 55 (69.6%) at the second follow-up. The number of drugs prescribed at discharge was related to patient lack of adherence at follow-up. This may have had a negative impact on the clinical and economic outcomes of patients' various conditions.

Despite the numerous guidelines on prescribing PPIs and NSAIDs, there is only one on the deprescription of PPIs. Recently, the College of Family Physicians of Canada developed a set of guidelines after a systematic review of PPI-deprescribing trials and examination of reviews of harm from long-term PPI use.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases – A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114CQRS2]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The introduction of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) into clinical practice has revolutionized the management of acid-related diseases. Studies in primary care and emergency settings suggest that PPIs are frequently prescribed for inappropriate indications or for indications where their use offers little benefit. Inappropriate PPI use is a matter of great concern, especially in the elderly, who are often affected by multiple comorbidities and are taking multiple medications, and are thus at an increased risk of long-term PPI-related adverse outcomes as well as drug-to-drug interactions. Herein, we aim to review the current literature on PPI use and develop a position paper addressing the benefits and potential harms of acid suppression with the purpose of providing evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate use of these medications.

Methods

The topics, identified by a Scientific Committee, were assigned to experts selected by three Italian Scientific Societies, who independently performed a systematic search of the relevant literature using Medline/PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane databases. Search outputs were distilled, paying more attention to systematic reviews and meta-analyses (where available) representing the best evidence. The draft prepared on each topic was circulated amongst all the members of the Scientific Committee. Each expert then provided her/his input to the writing, suggesting changes and the inclusion of new material and/or additional relevant references. The global recommendations were then thoroughly discussed in a specific meeting, refined with regard to both content and wording, and approved to obtain a summary of current evidence.

Results

Twenty-five years after their introduction into clinical practice, PPIs remain the mainstay of the treatment of acid-related diseases, where their use in gastroesophageal reflux disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, Helicobacter pylori infection, peptic ulcer disease and bleeding as well as, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is appropriate. Prevention of gastroduodenal mucosal lesions (and symptoms) in patients taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or antiplatelet therapies and carrying gastrointestinal risk factors also represents an appropriate indication. On the contrary, steroid use does not need any gastroprotection, unless combined with NSAID therapy. In dyspeptic patients with persisting symptoms, despite successful H. pylori eradication, short-term PPI treatment could be attempted. Finally, addition of PPIs to pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with refractory steatorrhea may be worthwhile.

Conclusions

Overall, PPIs are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, as any kind of drug therapy, is not without risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential harms in most patients, but those without clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering with evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to effective and safe PPI therapy. Please see related Commentary: doi: 10.1186/s12916-016-0724-1.

### Proton pump inhibitors: placing putative adverse effects in proper perspective [^113FTRdk]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes the past year's literature, both clinical and basic science, regarding potential adverse effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).

Recent Findings

PPIs are amongst the most widely prescribed and over-prescribed medications worldwide. Although generally considered well tolerated, epidemiologic studies that mine large databases have reported a panoply of putative adverse effects associated with PPIs. It should be emphasized that the quality of the evidence underlying most of these associations is very low and the studies, by design, cannot ascribe cause and effect. These associations continue to be sensationalized in the media and misinterpreted by providers and patients. The unintended consequences are that patients who require PPIs, such as those taking dual antiplatelet agents, are not being prescribed or taking these necessary medications. In addition, physicians are spending an inordinate amount of additional time placing these findings into proper perspective for their patients and reassuring them upon initiating PPI treatment as well as at every follow-up visit.

Summary

Most of the recent publicized putative serious adverse effects attributed to PPIs rely on observational data and have not been confirmed in prospective randomized trials. Nevertheless, PPIs should be prescribed for valid indications and when prescribed long-term, they should be used at the lowest effective dose and the need for their use periodically reassessed.

### Risk of stroke associated with proton pump inhibitor use among individuals with and without pre-existing cardiovascular diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112BZkBS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

A previous meta-analysis assessed the risk of stroke with PPI use from RCTs. They found An RR of 1.22 for stroke. They concluded that consistent use of proton pump inhibitors has been linked to a heightened risk of experiencing a stroke, and this risk tends to be more pronounced in those who already have a greater inherent risk of stroke. However, our results from RCTs and observational studies of patients who already had CVD did not reveal a statistical relationship between stroke and PPI use. In our analysis of the general population without CVD and people with other diseases like diabetes and CKD, we found a significant relationship between stroke and PPI use. This needs further exploration.

The clinical implications of this systematic review and meta-analysis are significant and warrant careful consideration in clinical practice. Despite the widespread use of PPIs for managing gastrointestinal disorders and their generally favorable safety profile for short-term use, our analysis indicates a potential increase in stroke risk, particularly among individuals without pre-existing CVD. In patients with a history of CVD, our analysis did not show a statistically significant relationship between PPI use and stroke risk. This suggests that for these patients, the benefits of PPIs in managing gastrointestinal risks associated with antiplatelet therapy may outweigh the potential but uncertain risk of stroke. However, given our study's heterogeneity and potential publication bias, each patient's risk profile must be individually assessed. Clinicians are advised to remain vigilant about the duration and necessity of PPI therapy, opting for the lowest effective dose and considering alternative treatments where possible. The decision to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be based on a thorough evaluation of individual patient risks and benefits, and patients should be adequately informed about the potential risks associated with long-term PPI use. In light of these findings, it is clear that more research is needed to understand the exact mechanisms by which PPIs may influence stroke risk and to identify which patient populations may be most at risk. Until then, the prescribing of PPIs, especially for individuals with risk factors for stroke, should be approached with a judicious and evidence-based perspective.

### No associations between regular use of proton pump inhibitors and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality: a population-based cohort of 0.44 million participants [^113Cdauq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the top 10 most commonly used medications worldwide. The short-term use of PPIs is generally safe, whereas the long-term use has been linked to various adverse effects, such as bone fractures and chronic kidney disease. Because the PPI-associated adverse outcomes are serious and each is independently associated with a higher risk of mortality, PPI use may have an effect on death. Many observational studies have evaluated the associations between PPI use and mortality, but the results were conflicting. For example, a cohort study of 0.21 million participants suggested that PPIs were associated with excessive risk of all-cause mortality, whereas no risk was observed in a recent analysis of 1.9 million US seniors. These analyses of administrative data have been limited by a lack of detailed information on lifestyle risk factors and general health status. Confounding effects of these factors cannot be excluded.

For acid-related conditions such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, adherence to PPI treatment is crucial to achieving therapeutic success. However, concern about potential adverse outcomes, particularly mortality, is strongly associated with attempts or recommendations for discontinuation in patients and internists. On the other hand, overprescribing of PPI has also garnered widespread attention. Thus, further evaluation of the effects of PPIs on mortality is still required. The aim of this study was to evaluate the independent associations between regular use of PPIs and risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality based on the UK Biobank.

### How to advise patients on the risk of chronic proton pump inhibitor therapy [^114yiYrC]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review therefore reviews the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs.

Recent Findings

There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely to be related to bias and residual confounding and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections.

Summary

PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.

### Adverse effects of proton pump inhibitor drugs: clues and conclusions [^116gvGSn]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review evidence relating to the strength of associations that have appeared in largely observational studies, between high-dose or long-term use of proton pump inhibitor drugs and certain possibly attributable side-effects, which emerge from studies confounded by other variables. In retrospective studies not designed to assess safety, evidence of causality is generally lacking.

Recent Findings

The associations of fractures of hip, wrist, forearm and other sites appear weak and only slightly higher than the risks in control populations matched for age. They may increase with drug exposure, but probably do so only in individuals in whom other risk factors are also operational (smoking, alcohol, poor nutrition, steroids, etc.). The risks of Clostridium difficile colitis, other enteric infections, small bowel bacterial overgrowth and possibly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis also appear increased. Impaired gastric secretion may adversely affect the absorption of various nutrients, but their clinical impact is ill defined. Potentially more important are the consequences of hypergastrinemia, including rebound hypersecretion of acid, and possible development of various cancers, including carcinoid tumors. Effects of other drugs, including clopidogrel, on metabolism are reviewed, but clouded by uncertainties.

Summary

The safety of long-term PPI administration needs serious prospective study.

### The risks and benefits of long-term use of proton pump inhibitors: expert review and best practice advice from the American Gastroenterological Association [^111YisHb]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The purpose of this review is to evaluate the risks associated with long-term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), focusing on long-term use of PPIs for three common indications: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's esophagus (BE), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) bleeding prophylaxis.

Methods

The recommendations outlined in this review are based on expert opinion and on relevant publications from PubMed, EMbase, and the Cochrane library (through July 2016). To identify relevant ongoing trials, we queried clinicaltrials.gov. To assess the quality of evidence, we used a modified approach based on the GRADE Working Group. The Clinical Practice Updates Committee of the American Gastroenterological Association has reviewed these recommendations. Best Practice Advice 1: Patients with GERD and acid-related complications (ie, erosive esophagitis or peptic stricture) should take a PPI for short-term healing, maintenance of healing, and long-term symptom control. Best Practice Advice 2: Patients with uncomplicated GERD who respond to short-term PPIs should subsequently attempt to stop or reduce them. Patients who cannot reduce PPIs should consider ambulatory esophageal pH/impedance monitoring before committing to lifelong PPIs to help distinguish GERD from a functional syndrome. The best candidates for this strategy may be patients with predominantly atypical symptoms or those who lack an obvious predisposition to GERD (eg, central obesity, large hiatal hernia). Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with Barrett's esophagus and symptomatic GERD should take a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 4: Asymptomatic patients with Barrett's esophagus should consider a long-term PPI. Best Practice Advice 5: Patients at high risk for ulcer-related bleeding from NSAIDs should take a PPI if they continue to take NSAIDs. Best Practice Advice 6: The dose of long-term PPIs should be periodically reevaluated so that the lowest effective PPI dose can be prescribed to manage the condition. Best Practice Advice 7: Long-term PPI users should not routinely use probiotics to prevent infection. Best Practice Advice 8: Long-term PPI users should not routinely raise their intake of calcium, vitamin B12, or magnesium beyond the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Best Practice Advice 9: Long-term PPI users should not routinely screen or monitor bone mineral density, serum creatinine, magnesium, or vitamin B12. Best Practice Advice 10: Specific PPI formulations should not be selected based on potential risks.

### Proton-pump inhibitors and long-term risk of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults [^112Hh169]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 40% of elderly adults receive PPIs, and appropriate clinical indications may be lacking for up to 85% of PPIs prescribed. 22, 23 Pneumonia is a major cause of death, 24, 25 costing in excess of $17 billion per year in the United States alone. 26 It is therefore important to clarify associations between PPIs and pneumonia for short‐ and long‐term exposure, especially in older adults, who may be most at risk from lack of barriers to respiratory infection. We therefore aimed to estimate long‐term associations between PPI prescription and risk of pneumonia in individuals in primary care aged 60 and older, similarly applying the PERR approach to account for prior differences between PPI‐treated individuals and controls.

### Proton pump inhibitors and risk of gastric cancer: a population-based cohort study [^113NhwZa]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

There has been some concern about the long-term safety of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). The profound reduction in gastric acid secretion induced by PPIs leads to increased secretion of gastrin, and most PPI users have moderate hypergastrinaemia. Gastrin has trophic effects on the gastrointestinal mucosa, and hypergastrinaemia has been associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoids, and gastric and colonic carcinomas, although recent results for PPI use and colorectal cancer risk are reassuring. Hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells has been seen in long-term PPI users; and in patients with Helicobacter pylori (H. Pylori) infection, long-term PPI use has been associated with an increased incidence of atrophic gastritis, a precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma.

Few epidemiological studies have evaluated the association between PPI use and gastric cancer. Two studies based on UK populations reported an increased risk of gastric cancer among users of PPI that was attributed to probable reverse causation or confounding by indication. Given the widespread use of PPI and the unresolved questions about their carcinogenic potential, we examined the association between PPI use and the risk of gastric cancer in a large population-based cohort of Danish PPI users.

### The effect of proton pump-inhibiting drugs on mineral metabolism [^116hNvwx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Two recent studies have reported increased hip fracture rates with long-term proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use raising concerns about adverse effects of this class of drugs on mineral metabolism. One plausible mechanism by which PPIs could affect calcium economy and skeletal homeostasis is by impairing intestinal calcium absorption. In the long term, this could potentially lead to a negative whole body calcium balance, resulting in higher rates of bone loss and a greater risk of fragility fractures.
