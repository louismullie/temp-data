## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether two statements about subgroups and quotients of finitely generated free abelian groups are true or false. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the structure theorem for finitely generated abelian groups. Then, I should verify the subgroup claim using a basis argument. Next, I will examine the quotient claim with concrete counterexamples. Finally, I will reconcile any apparent contradictions and select the correct option.

> Let me first confirm the algebraic context. A finitely generated free abelian group is isomorphic to ℤ^n for some finite n, and its subgroups are themselves free abelian, though not necessarily of the same rank; this is a standard result in elementary algebra and will anchor both statements.

> Now, Statement 1 claims that any nonzero subgroup K of a finitely generated free abelian group G is free abelian. Wait, let me verify this carefully. I initially thought "nonzero" might imply finite rank, but that's not correct; even infinite-rank subgroups can occur in principle, though in the finitely generated case the subgroup must still be free abelian. The correct theorem is that every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian, so K is indeed free abelian, though its rank may be less than or equal to the rank of G. Therefore, Statement 1 is true.

> Next, Statement 2 claims that the quotient G/K is free abelian. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check with examples. Let G = ℤ and K = 2ℤ; then G/K ≅ ℤ/2ℤ, which is finite and torsion, hence not free abelian. Similarly, G = ℤ^2 and K = ⟨(1,0)⟩ gives G/K ≅ ℤ, which is free abelian, so the quotient can be free in some cases but not in others. Since the statement asserts G/K is always free abelian, a single counterexample suffices to falsify it, so Statement 2 is false.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I briefly wondered if the quotient might still be free because G is free, but that would conflate free modules with their quotients; quotients of free abelian groups can introduce torsion, as the ℤ/2ℤ example shows. I should confirm that the quotient is free abelian only when K is a direct summand, which is not guaranteed for arbitrary subgroups, reinforcing that Statement 2 is false in general.

> Putting this together, Statement 1 is true and Statement 2 is false, which corresponds to option C. I should double-check that no subtlety changes this conclusion; the subgroup result is general for free abelian groups, and the quotient failure is demonstrated by simple torsion examples, so the answer is C.

The correct answer is **C. True, False**. Statement 1 is true: any nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is free abelian (though possibly of lower rank). Statement 2 is false: the quotient G/K is not necessarily free abelian; for example, ℤ/2ℤ is a quotient of ℤ by 2ℤ and is not free abelian.

## Statement 1: subgroups of finitely generated free abelian groups

### Proof and explanation

- **Structure of finitely generated free abelian groups**: A finitely generated free abelian group G is isomorphic to ℤ^n for some non-negative integer n, where ℤ denotes the integers under addition.

- **Subgroups of free abelian groups**: Any subgroup K of a free abelian group G is itself free abelian. This is a fundamental result in group theory, often proven using the Smith normal form or by constructing a basis for K from a basis of G.

- **Rank of subgroups**: The rank of K (the number of generators in a basis) is less than or equal to the rank of G. If K is nonzero, its rank is at least 1, ensuring K is nontrivial and free abelian.

Thus, **Statement 1 is true**: any nonzero subgroup K of a finitely generated free abelian group G is free abelian.

---

## Statement 2: quotient groups of finitely generated free abelian groups

### Counterexample and explanation

Consider G = ℤ (the integers under addition) and K = 2ℤ (the even integers). Then G/K ≅ ℤ/2ℤ, the cyclic group of order 2. ℤ/2ℤ is **not free abelian** because it is finite and has torsion elements, whereas free abelian groups are torsion-free. This single counterexample suffices to show that the quotient of a finitely generated free abelian group by a nonzero subgroup is not necessarily free abelian.

## Conclusion

| **Statement** | **Truth value** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| Statement 1 | True | Any nonzero subgroup of a finitely generated free abelian group is free abelian. |
| Statement 2 | False | The quotient G/K is not necessarily free abelian (e.g. ℤ/2ℤ). |

The correct answer is **C. True, False**.

Central auditory processing disorder (C)APD—test performance concepts and evidence grading are defined, including that the false positive rate is 1 minus the specificity (e.g., 1 − 80% specificity = 20% false positive rate), test efficiency combines specificity and sensitivity as the overall number of true positives and true negatives divided by the total tested, validity reflects whether evidence and theory support intended test score interpretations, and reliability refers to the stability of a test score and is essential to validity. The guideline uses a numerical level-of-evidence scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating the strongest level of support and 5 the weakest; although the model rates group studies as superior to individual case studies, case and retrospective studies (classified as level 3 or 4 evidence) can often provide appropriate evidence for an individual profile. Clinicians should take a pragmatic approach to evaluating evidence, and the guideline focuses on four areas: 1) patient history and selection criteria, 2) diagnosis, 3) intervention, and 4) professional issues, education, and training.

### A sensory signature that distinguishes true from false memories [^0714529d]. Nature Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

Human behavioral studies show that there is greater sensory/perceptual detail associated with true memories than false memories. We therefore hypothesized that true recognition of abstract shapes would elicit greater visual cortical activation than would false recognition. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), participants studied exemplar shapes and later made recognition memory decisions ("old" or "new") concerning studied exemplars (old shapes), nonstudied lures (related shapes) and new shapes. Within visual processing regions, direct contrasts between true recognition ("old" response to an old shape; old-hit) and false recognition ("old" response to a related shape; related-false alarm) revealed preferential true recognition-related activity in early visual processing regions (Brodmann area (BA)17, BA18). By comparison, both true and false recognition were associated with activity in early and late (BA19, BA37) visual processing regions, the late regions potentially supporting "old" responses, independent of accuracy. Further analyses suggested that the differential early visual processing activity reflected repetition priming, a type of implicit memory. Thus, the sensory signature that distinguishes true from false recognition may not be accessible to conscious awareness.

### True and false autobiographical memories in schizophrenia: preliminary results of a diary study [^74feef5b]. Psychiatry Research (2010). Low credibility.

The frequency of true and false autobiographical memories and associated states of conscious awareness, i.e., conscious recollection and simply knowing, as well as the respective roles of affective and cognitive processes in autobiographical memory construction, were assessed in eight patients with schizophrenia and eight control participants. A diary study methodology was used in combination with the Remember/Know procedure. The results showed a higher frequency of Know responses associated with the retrieval of both true and false memories in patients than in control participants. Whereas control participants rated higher at retrieval than at encoding the distinctiveness and personal importance of events, as well as the extent to which events furthered current personal plans, patients exhibited an opposite pattern of ratings, with ratings being lower at retrieval than at encoding. These preliminary results show a high frequency of simply knowing associated with the retrieval of true and false autobiographical memories in patients with schizophrenia and provide evidence for the interest of the diary study methodology for studying autobiographical memory in schizophrenia.

### The torino pericarditis score: a new-risk stratification tool to predict complicated pericarditis [^9cb39e0a]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Torino Pericarditis Score for prediction of complicated pericarditis" for acute pericarditis.

The Torino Pericarditis Score is a clinical calculator used for predicting the risk of complicated pericarditis in patients diagnosed with acute pericarditis. Acute pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium, the sac-like structure around the heart. The Torino Pericarditis Score helps clinicians to stratify patients based on their risk of developing complications such as cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis, or recurrence of pericarditis. 

This scoring system is applicable to patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute pericarditis. It is not suitable for patients with chronic pericarditis, or those with pericarditis due to direct injury to the heart or pericardium, such as post-cardiac surgery or trauma. 

The Torino Pericarditis Score uses various clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters to calculate the risk score. These include factors like fever, subacute onset, immunosuppression, trauma, oral anticoagulant therapy, myopericarditis, and pericardial effusion size. The higher the score, the higher the risk of developing complications. This score can guide clinicians in making decisions about hospitalization, intensive care, and aggressive therapeutic

The Torino Pericarditis Score calculator assesses the risk of developing complicated pericarditis based on five clinical indicators. Each indicator is assigned a specific numerical score, which are summed to produce a total score representing the risk level. The indicators and their respective scores are:

1. Female: 18 points
2. Fever > 38 degrees C: 20 points
3. Signs of constrictive pericarditis on echocardiography: 16 points
4. Previous use of corticosteroids: 21 points
5. Previous lack of colchicine use: 22 points

The calculator takes user inputs as boolean values (true or false) for each of the five clinical indicators. For each true response, the corresponding score is added to the total score. The computation involves summing the values from true responses only.

Based on the total score, the interpretation of the risk for complicated pericarditis is as follows:

- A score of 19 or less suggests a low risk.
- A score between 20 and 39 indicates an intermediate risk.
- A score of 40 or more signifies a high risk.

The output includes both the total score and its corresponding risk interpretation. For instance, if a patient is female (true), has a fever greater than 38 degrees C (true), and lacks previous colchicine use (true), the total score would be calculated as 18 + 20 + 22 = 60, indicating a high risk of complicated pericarditis.

### Media literacy tips promoting reliable news improve discernment and enhance trust in traditional media [^9a316ee2]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Fig. 4 
Treatment effects broken down by veracity and proportion of false news.

Estimated differences in true (red circles) and false (blue triangles) news ratings in each treatment condition compared to the control. The estimates are divided by the proportion of true and false news participants were exposed to. For instance, in the “75% False” participants were exposed to 75% of false news. The error bars represent the 95% CIs. In the Control 75% False N = 318. In the Control 50/50 N = 344. In the Control 75% True N = 320. In the Mixed 75% False N = 346. In the Mixed 50/50 N = 295. In the Mixed 75% True N = 326. In the Skepticism 75% False N = 325. In the Skepticism 50/50 N = 357. In the Skepticism 75% True N = 301. In the Trust, 75% False N = 311. In the Trust 50/50 N = 310. In the Trust 75% True N = 352.

The three-way interactions showed that (compared to the Control) the Trust Condition was most effective at increasing discernment when participants were exposed to 50% of true news compared to 75% of true news (b = 0.25[0.11, 0.40]; p = 0.001). The Mixed Condition was most effective at increasing discernment when participants were exposed to 75% of true news compared to 25% of true news (b = 0.18[0.021, 0.34]; p = 0.027). All the other contrasts are not statistically significant (see Table 4 in Supplementary Information E). Note, however, that we lack the statistical power to reliably detect small effects in such three-way interactions (despite our analysis of the data at the response level of 46,992 ratings).

### Screening for thyroid dysfunction: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^05ae4a8f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Potential harms and treatment thresholds in thyroid dysfunction emphasize that the harms of treatment have not been well-studied, with the most important potential harms being false-positive results, labeling, and overdiagnosis and overtreatment; false positives occur because TSH secretion is highly variable and sensitive to several common factors and determining true- versus false-positive results is complicated by a lack of consensus on a normal reference interval; no clinical trial data support a treatment threshold to improve outcomes, and on the basis of expert opinion, a TSH level greater than 10.0 mIU/L is generally considered the threshold for initiation of treatment.

### Reply to: false conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^fbaf3d1f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

We fully agree with Rosenbacke and colleagues that the investigation of these three errors and the performance-based sub-group analysis are highly relevant points for the introduction of (X)AI into clinical practice. They mention three types of errors that can occur: (i) false confirmation error—when the physician and the AI agree but both are wrong; (ii) false conflict error—when the physician is correct, AI is incorrect, and the physician changes diagnosis (which is a particularly difficult case from an ethical perspective); and (iii) true conflict error—when the physician is incorrect but AI is correct, and the physician overrides the correct AI diagnosis. From our point of view, those three errors are very important to investigate, but not able to provide a complete picture. Thus, we propose introducing one additional error type and four additional scenarios leading to correctly diagnosed cases. The errors Rosenbacke and colleagues did not mention are the (iv) true confirmation errors—when both the physician and the AI diagnosis are correct, but the physician subsequently switches to an incorrect diagnosis. This occurred in 3.9% of cases in our dataset and might be caused by unrealistic explanations. Furthermore, we argue that we must also consider the four correctly diagnosed cases to paint a complete picture. These are: (a) correct true confirmation cases—when both the AI and the physician are correct and the physician does not change their diagnosis; (b) correct true conflict cases—when the AI is correct and the physician is wrong, but the physician accepts the AI decision; (c) correct false confirmation cases—when both the AI and the physician’s initial diagnoses are wrong, but the physician changes their diagnosis when receiving an incorrect AI suggestion; and (d) correct false conflict cases—when the AI is wrong, the clinician is correct and the clinician overrides the incorrect AI decision. Especially when investigating the individual errors for different subgroups, it is necessary to take all eight cases into account. All the mentioned scenarios are summarized in Table 1, Subtable A) which also contains the scenario identifiers (i–iv and a–d). It should be noted that the AI’s and the clinicians’ correctness are independent, since the clinicians delivered their initial diagnosis without AI advice. To conduct the sub-group analysis, we defined the 25%-quantile in physicians’ accuracy as the threshold for the worst performers and the AI’s accuracy (80.4%) as the threshold for the best performers respectively, as suggested by Rosenbacke and colleagues. We report the absolute numbers for all 8 cases in Table 1 for the whole available dataset (Subtable B), the best performers (Subtable C) and the worst performers (Subtable D). It should be noted that the relative performance of a clinician is not trivially discernible in a clinical setting. However, it might be correlated with years of experience or the weekly load of lesions seen by the clinician.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^1f03201b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic individuals—modeled outcomes and practical considerations: With a 10% prevalence of infection, 63 true positives (95% CI: 56–69) and 37 false negatives (95% CI: 31–44) were detected, and the number of false-positive results was estimated to be 0 with a true prevalence between 1% and 10%; routine confirmation of positive Ag test results does not appear to be necessary in most cases. Additional considerations include that there are currently no treatment options approved through FDA EUA for asymptomatic COVID-19, the panel found no direct evidence that testing for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals reduces risk of transmission, postexposure monoclonal antibody prophylaxis may be an alternative to testing in high-risk asymptomatic individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 if and when EUA options exist, and education on interpretation of rapid Ag tests is important; the decision to pursue rapid Ag testing versus no testing should be individualized, and antigen testing may be useful in guiding mitigation efforts during an outbreak.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: antigen testing (January 2023) [^6b9fbe40]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Antigen testing in asymptomatic exposed individuals—benefits and harms: The panel placed high value on minimizing the number of false-negative results, especially in higher-risk healthcare settings, and found no evidence that the use of Ag tests reduces transmission of SARS-CoV-2; furthermore, treatment is not recommended for asymptomatic persons. Users of rapid Ag tests may not understand the limits of a negative test; in 1 study, two-thirds of participants believed that they were noninfectious the day following a negative rapid Ag test. Sensitivity is linked to timing of exposure; a negative result may convert to positive within hours early in infection. At 1% prevalence, the number of true-positive Ag test results was small and approximated the number of false-negative results, quantified as 6 true positives and 4 false negatives per 1000 asymptomatic individuals tested.

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^bc13d0c6]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF genital herpes—harms of serologic screening indicates that using the widely available HSV-2 serologic test, nearly 1 out of every 2 diagnoses in the general US primary care population could be false; a previous USPSTF review estimated that in a population of 10 000 persons with a HSV-2 prevalence of 15%, screening could yield approximately 1585 true-positive and 1445 false-positive results, and at the current US estimated prevalence of 12%, true positives would likely further decrease while false positives would likely further increase; the USPSTF concluded there may be potential social and emotional harms and harms of unnecessary preventive antiviral treatment associated with false-positive diagnoses.

### Risk of bias in network meta-analysis (RoB NMA) tool [^ebe9f5a8]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

How to assess this statement

When prior distributions are claimed to be non-informative, the assessor may want to assess the range of prior distributions in relation to prior expectations for the parameters and the amount of information in the network, as reported by the meta-analysts. The assessor can look at the posterior densities, if reported, to ensure that no artificial truncation is present and that they are sufficiently informed by the data. When prior distributions are informative, the assessor may consider whether they are grounded in data that are relevant to the NMA being considered. For example, informative prior distributions for heterogeneity parameters should be based on evidence from similar types of studies in terms of intervention comparisons and outcomes.

Answer not applicable if a bayesian analysis was not conducted (ie, frequentist analysis).
Answer true if prior distributions were used that were clearly non-informative across the range of possible parameter values, if informative prior distributions were used and had a clear justification, or if a sensitivity analysis with alternative appropriate prior distributions was performed and showed results similar to the main results.
Answer probably true if off-the-shelf non-informative prior distributions were used.
Answer false or probably false if informative prior distributions were used that were not clearly justified.
Answer no information when insufficient data are reported to allow a reasonable judgment to be made.

Assessors can use table 3 to decide what risk to attribute to the review (high/low/some concerns) with the quote from the manuscript, and their rationale for their choice.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of Crohn's disease [^ed30181b]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Endoscopic Healing Index (EHI) <20—performance in asymptomatic Crohn’s disease (CD) across remission-status scenarios is summarized per 1000 patients tested. For known endoscopic remission (prevalence 20%) versus unknown endoscopic remission status (prevalence 45%), EHI <20 yielded true positives of 188 and 423, false negatives of 12 and 27, true negatives of 424 and 292, and false positives of 376 and 258, respectively. Comments note that true positives would be eligible to undergo treatment adjustment, false negatives may be at higher risk of disease complications/flare due to undertreatment, true negatives would be reassured and obviate the need for invasive testing with endoscopy, and false positives may receive unnecessary testing and/or treatment adjustment. Footnotes report Sensitivity of EHI <20: 94%, 2 studies; Specificity of EHI <20: 53%, 2 studies; the reference test is colonoscopy; and the GRADE certainty of evidence is VERY LOW.

### Fact or fiction: reducing the proportion and impact of false positives [^ee68ca6c]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

False positive findings in science are inevitable, but are they particularly common in psychology and psychiatry? The evidence that we review suggests that while not restricted to our field, the problem is acute. We describe the concept of researcher 'degrees-of-freedom' to explain how many false-positive findings arise, and how the various strategies of registration, pre-specification, and reporting standards that are being adopted both reduce and make these visible. We review possible benefits and harms of proposed statistical solutions, from tougher requirements for significance, to Bayesian and machine learning approaches to analysis. Finally we consider the organisation and methods for replication and systematic review in psychology and psychiatry.

### Reply to: false conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^f5e9a0d3]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In conclusion, it is of critical importance to investigate the different errors when physicians make decisions with AI support especially with respect to the human expertise level,. But besides the different error types, it is also important to take the correctly classified cases into account to get a complete picture of the situation. Further research is needed to investigate why those errors occur, whether certain subgroups of clinicians are at particular risk of committing certain error scenarios, and how this can be prevented. One potential approach is taking AI uncertainty into account by giving clinicians AI advice. Of special interest are furthermore cases, where AI and clinician are initially correct, but the clinician overwrites both, his original diagnosis and the XAI’s advice (Table 1C ; scenario iv), which need to be investigated carefully.

### Metastable hybridization-based DNA information storage to allow rapid and permanent erasure [^61d8f2ff]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Overall scheme and design of experiments

In our method for DNA information encoding, true messages and false messages both possess a common marker binding region B (Fig. 2 a). Two separate DNA oligonucleotides, the truth marker and the false marker, both have sequences complementary to region B; thus the truth marker and the false marker are able to bind to both the true message and the false message. The false marker, unlike the truth marker, has a 3′ chemical functionalization that prevents extension by DNA polymerase. The intended (true) messages are prehybridized with the truth marker, and the noise (false) messages are prehybridized with the false marker; these two solutions are combined to form the information solution. The information solution is read through enzymatic extension and amplification of the truth markers and subsequent sequencing-by-synthesis (NGS), as shown in Fig. 2 b. Importantly, any DNA molecule with sequence satisfying our expected format can be used either as a true message or a false message, and furthermore may be used as both a true message for one information solution and as a false message for a different information solution.

### Cancers not detected in one-view breast tomosynthesis screening-characteristics and reasons for non-detection [^543332bb]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Tumor characteristics and breast density

False negatives occurred in 36% (8/22) in women with high density, compared with 58% (39/67) of true negatives and 61% (78/129) of true positives. The proportion of high breast density cases was lower in false negatives compared with true positives, p = 0.04 (Tables 3 and 4).

c Cancer detected as lymph node recurrence

The mean size of breast cancer tumors showed no difference across false negatives (13 mm, SD 8), true negatives (15 mm, SD 10), and true positives (14 mm, SD 10). There was no difference in the proportion of invasive cancers in false negatives and true positives (82% (18/22) vs. 87% (112/129), p = 0.53). The most common histological cancer type was no special type in all groups: 46% (13/22) in false negatives, 57% (38/67) in true negatives, and 55% (71/129) in true positives. The proportion of invasive lobular carcinomas was 23% (5/22) in false negatives compared with 10% (7/67) in true negatives and 18% (23/129) in true positives, whereas the proportion of ductal carcinoma in situ was 18% (4/22) in false negatives, 31% (21/67) in true negatives and 13% (17/129) in true positives (Table 4). Moreover, there was a difference in the proportion of luminal A-like cancers among invasive false-negative and true-positive cancers (24% (4/17) vs. 49% (54/111)), but the study was not powered for subgroup analyses (p = 0.053).

Antigen testing in patients having symptoms for 5 or fewer days with nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) is presented as per 1000 patients tested across 5%, 20%, and 50% pre-test probabilities. At 5%, true positives are 45 (42 to 47) and false negatives are 5 (3 to 8). At 20%, true positives are 178 (166 to 188) and false negatives are 22 (14 to 34). At 50%, true positives are 445 (415 to 465) and false negatives are 55 (35 to 85).

### Increasing yield also increases false positives and best serves to exclude GERD [^30667f15]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple diagnostic tests always improve diagnostic yield. However, with the addition of more true positives come more false positives. Therefore, positive predictive values likely decrease with additional testing. We show this is true even when no gold standard exists to verify the dual testing's sensitivity and specificity.

### How often should self-monitoring of blood pressure be repeated? A secondary analysis of data from two randomized controlled trials [^407aec92]. Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 2 
Modelled probabilities of observed SBP >135 mmHg using TASMINH4 data, stratified into true and false positives, at 3, 6 and 12 months, expressed as percentages (see text for interpretation)

Similarly, the probability of obtaining a true or a false positive result at various time intervals after a true starting SBP of 125 mmHg was estimated (Table 2). At 6 months, only 1 out of every 500 readings would represent a result that was truly above target. At 12 months, there was an 11% probability of observing a BP reading above target, with similar odds of a true or false positive result. Results for DBP can also be seen in Table 2.

Similar results were obtained when the probability of either SBP, DBP or both aspects of an individual's blood pressure rising to ≥135/85 mmHg was estimated (Table 2). For a true initial blood pressure of 130/80 mmHg, after 6 months the probability of observed hypertension was 19%, consisting of a 5% probability of being truly above threshold (true positive) and a 14% probability of a false positive, odds of 3 to 1 in favour of a false positive. After 12 months, the probability of observed hypertension rose to 25%, consisting of 16% probability of a true positive and 9% probability of a false positive, odds of 7 to 4 of a truly raised blood pressure. For an individual with true initial blood pressure of 125/75 mmHg, after 6 months the probability of observed hypertension would be 5% with odds of 1 to 13 in favour of a false positive, and after 12 months, an 11% chance of observed hypertension, with equal odds of true or false positive hypertension.

Managing an increasing CEA level—after resection should include colonoscopy; chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT scans; physical examination; and consideration of a PET/CT scan, and if imaging is normal in the face of a rising CEA, repeat CT scans are recommended every 3 months until either disease is identified or CEA level stabilizes or declines. In a retrospective review, approximately half of elevations were false positives, with most in the range of 5 to 15 ng/mL; false-positive results >15 ng/mL were rare, and all results >35 ng/mL represented true positives. For CEA at a cutoff of 10 ng/mL, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 68% (95% CI, 53%–79%) and 97% (95% CI, 90%–99%), and in the first 2 years post-resection this cutoff is estimated to detect 20 recurrences, miss 10 recurrences, and result in 29 false positives.

### Democrats are better than republicans at discerning true and false news but do not have better metacognitive awareness [^9b4aabc7]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In today’s information ecosystem, discerning between true and false information is an essential skill. Furthermore, being aware of one’s ability to discern true from false statements is equally critical. Insight into one’s own cognitive abilities is one important aspect of metacognition, and it is possible that people who have poor metacognitive insight are more likely to hold false beliefs. Metacognition has only recently received attention in misinformation studies, and whether this construct varies across groups when discerning true and false information has yet to be examined. The current study examines how political partisanship, age, education, and gender influence (i) discernment ability, (ii) metacognitive efficiency (i.e. metacognitive ability given a specific level of task performance), and (iii) response bias (i.e. the tendency to answer true or false regardless of an item’s veracity) for true and false news. Finally, we examine whether participants worse at detecting false news headlines show less insight into their discernment ability (i.e. a Dunning-Kruger effect).

### Three simple rules to ensure reasonably credible subgroup analyses [^1df8583e]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The limitations of subgroup analyses are well established—false positives due to multiple comparisons, false negatives due to inadequate power, and limited ability to inform individual treatment decisions because patients have multiple characteristics that vary simultaneously. In this article, we apply Bayes’s rule to determine the probability that a positive subgroup analysis is a true positive. From this framework, we derive simple rules to determine when subgroup analyses can be performed as hypothesis testing analyses and thus inform when subgroup analyses should influence how we practice medicine.

### Intimomedial rupture: a new CT finding to distinguish true from false lumen in aortic dissection [^75cc9cf5]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of our study is to describe a new imaging finding observed on contrast-enhanced MDCT of discontinuity in the intimomedial flap seen with aortic dissection that may identify the level of intimomedial entrance tear and distinguish true from false lumen.

Conclusion

Direct visualization of an intimomedial rupture on MDCT is a valuable cross-sectional imaging sign indicating direction of the intimomedial entrance tear from true to false lumen in cases of aortic dissection. The presence of this finding enables reliable distinction of the true lumen, where the tear is broad-based and erupts into the false lumen, which receives the evaginating tear. Improved scanning techniques through MDCT may have enabled recognition of this relatively infrequent, yet highly specific, finding.

### Statistical model for assessing the proportion of subjects with subjective sensitisations in adverse reactions to foods [^45591c07]. Allergy (2001). Low credibility.

The outcome from a Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Food Challenge is often of a subjective nature and cannot be measured directly. Reactions to placebo challenges are frequently observed, implying that some of the responses in the study are in fact 'false responses'. In order to adjust for these false responses, previous studies have used various methods, including removing subjects from the analysis who reacted to the placebo. Simply ignoring the false responses can lead to misleading estimates for the true proportion of sensitised individuals. This paper outlines two models which can account for these false responses. In the single challenge study, a simple model is developed which enables the estimation of the rate of false responses in the study, as well as the true proportion of sensitised subjects. This model is very easy to apply in practice. For a repeated challenge study, a more complicated model is developed which again enables the estimation of the rate of false responses and the true proportion of sensitised subjects.

AGA clinical practice guideline—biomarker cutoffs for diagnosing active inflammation in symptomatically active ulcerative colitis (UC) define the population as patients with established UC with typical symptoms suggestive of flare or mild symptoms in whom fecal calprotectin, fecal lactoferrin, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured, asking whether such cutoffs can accurately diagnose active inflammation, obviating routine endoscopic assessment. Intervention thresholds include fecal calprotectin >50 μg/g, >150 μg/g, or >250 μg/g, elevated fecal lactoferrin (>7.25 μg/g), and elevated CRP (>5 mg/L), compared with fecal calprotectin <50 μg/g, <150 μg/g or <250 μg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin (<7.25 μg/g), and normal CRP (<5 mg/L); outcomes are defined for detection of endoscopic inflammation including benefits (true positive [TP] rate, true negative [TN] rate) and harms (false negative [FN] rate with clinical consequences and false positive [FP] rate with treatment-related risks).

### New definition of light chain monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (...) [^298e003d]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Partitioning was determined based on the proportion of subgroups outside the whole-group reference interval. If the analysis resulted in a subgroup placed outside the central 99% reference interval with a rate of abnormal findings that exceeded 0. 8% or was below
0. 2%, the reference interval was partitioned. 19 Central 95% and 99% reference intervals were calculated for serum κ and λ FLC and the FLC ratio for the entire cohort, as well as for subgroups based on age, sex, and eGFR. After partitioning the reference intervals, the proportion of the age, sex, and eGFR subgroups with values outside the reference intervals was deemed appropriate. Data were collected from September 2016 to May 2023, and data were analyzed from June 2023 to May 2024. All statistical analysis and data visualization were performed in R version 4.
2. 0. 20-29.

The revised central 99% reference intervals for κ FLC, λ FLC, and FLC ratio are shown in Table
2. Revised central 95% reference intervals for both κ and λ FLC and the FLC ratio were also determined and are shown in eTable 3 in Supplement 1. Based on our findings, a new definition of LC-MGUS is introduced in Figure
2. This finding is in line with several recent smaller studies that have consistently demonstrated a high rate of false-positive results in individuals with slightly abnormal κ FLC levels. 8-10, 12 These results, together with our current findings, emphasize the imprecision of the standard reference intervals and the need for revised reference intervals. Discrepancies between our and the original reference intervals likely stem from a combination of different baseline populations studied and a change in κ levels of the Freelite assay over time.

9, 12 The exact cause of this upward drift in κ levels remains unknown but could possibly be linked to incremental changes in calibration over time. In conclusion, using data from, to our knowledge, the largest population-based screening study of monoclonal gammopathies to date, we have demonstrated that standard reference intervals for κ FLC, λ FLC, and the FLC ratio are inaccurate among persons with preserved kidney function, causing high rates of false-positive κ and false-negative λ monoclonal gammopathies.

### True versus false bacteremia in infants and children less than 3 years of age [^c0a0e875]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine patient history as well as clinical and laboratory features associated with true bacteremia versus false bacteremia in previously healthy febrile children ages 0 to 36 months in the era of polyvalent conjugate pneumococcal immunization.

Methods

Using retrospective chart review, we examined history, physical examination, and laboratory characteristics associated with true and false bacteremia. We included subjects under 3 years old, with a positive blood culture obtained in the emergency department or clinic from July 2011 to July 2013, and fever defined as a temperature of greater than or equal to 100.4°F by history or examination. We excluded those with a previously known underlying disease process that could increase the risk for positive blood culture, for example, immunodeficiency, cancer, cystic fibrosis, or significant skin disorders such as severe eczema, as well as patients with any indwelling central line, shunt, or other implanted device, or recent hospitalization for a febrile illness.

Results

Thirty subjects (24%) had true bacteremia, and 97 (76%) had false bacteremia. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, exposure to sick contacts (odds ratio, 0.1; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.6; P = 0.01) and increased hours to positive blood culture (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-0.9; P < 0.001) remained significant factors associated with false bacteremia. Age, maximum reported temperature, and reported days of fever were not associated with true bacteremia.

Conclusions

We found that previously healthy children with true bacteremia are more likely to grow bacteria faster on blood culture and lack exposure to sick contacts than children with false bacteremia.

### Social corrections act as a double-edged sword by reducing the perceived accuracy of false and real news in the UK, Germany, and Italy [^7842a18c]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Corrective or refutational posts from ordinary users on social media have the potential to improve the online information ecosystem. While initial evidence of these social corrections is promising, a better understanding of the effects across different topics, formats, and audiences is needed. In three pre-registered experiments (N=1944 UK, N=2467 Italy, N=2210 Germany) where respondents completed a social media post assessment task with false and true news posts on various topics (e.g., health, climate change, technology), we find that social corrections reduce perceived accuracy of and engagement with false news posts. We also find that social corrections that flag true news as false decrease perceived accuracy of and engagement with true news posts. We did not find evidence to support moderation of these effects by correction strength, anti-expert sentiments, cognitive reflection capacities, or susceptibility to social influence. While social corrections can be effective for false news, they may also undermine belief in true news.

KDIGO 2025 ADPKD guideline rating keys—Within each recommendation, the strength of recommendation is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2, and the certainty of the supporting evidence is graded as A, B, C, or D. Level 1 “We recommend” implies for patients that “Most people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not,” for clinicians that “Most patients should receive the recommended course of action,” and for policy that “The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure.” Level 2 “We suggest” implies for patients that “The majority of people in your situation would want the recommended course of action, but many would not,” for clinicians that “Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences,” and for policy that “The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined.” Certainty of evidence meanings are: A “High” — “We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect”; B “Moderate” — “The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different”; C “Low” — “The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect”; and D “Very low” — “The estimate of effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect.” Practice points are “consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded,” issued “to help readers implement the guidance from graded recommendations” or for “good practice statements,” and “should not be seen as less important or a downgrade from graded recommendations.”

### Evaluating the impact of vaping facts films on vaping harm perceptions among young adults in the UK: a randomized on-line experiment [^cbaa1dd7]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

Measure the impact of brief, academic-led, evidence-based social media videos on vaping harm perceptions among young adults.

Design

On-line between-subjects experimental study. Participants were randomized to one of two conditions: experimental (exposed to one of eight brief videos, designed for social media, with academic experts addressing vaping harms) or control. Before and after exposure to the videos, all participants answered questions about their perceptions of vaping and smoking and socio-demographics.

Setting

Qualtrics on-line survey platform.

Participants

593 young adults aged 18-30years who resided in the UK (49.7% female, 49.2% male; 8.9% exclusively smoked, 32% exclusively vaped, 28.7% did both and 30.4% did neither). Participants were randomly assigned to intervention (n=279) or control (n=314) groups.

Measurements

The primary outcome was the perception that vaping is less harmful than smoking. Secondary outcomes were perceptions that vaping is harmful, vaping is addictive and responses (true, false) to statements that were matched to the videos (e.g. vaping causes cancer, vaping causes lung injuries).

Findings

After exposure to an expert video, compared with those in the control group, participants in the intervention group had over three times the odds of perceiving vaping as less harmful than smoking [82.1% vs 57.6%; adjusted odds ratio (AOR)=3.69; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=2.49-5.47; P<0.001]. Perceptions that the following statements are false were also higher after viewing expert videos than control videos: vaping causes lung injury, vaping leads to cancer, nicotine is harmful when used in ways that does not involve smoking tobacco, pregnant women should not vape, vaping will not help you quit smoking, vaping has no place on the NHS (all P<0.05). Participants exposed to the 'vaping is as harmful as smoking' misconception video had the highest odds of accurately perceiving vaping as less harmful than smoking (AOR=13.92; 95% CI=3.26-59.37; P<0.001). Videos specifically targeting individual misconceptions (e.g. 'vaping causes lung injury' or 'vaping causes cancer') were particularly effective in improving related perceptions, indicating that the videos functioned as designed. There was little evidence of associations between condition and perceiving that vaping is not harmful (AOR=2.57; 95% CI=0.78-8.52; P=0.122) or not addictive (AOR=0.49; 95% CI=0.04-6.67; P=0.594). Findings were similar among young adults regardless of vaping and smoking status.

Conclusion

Brief, academic-led, vaping facts films appear to be effective in correcting vaping misperceptions and dispelling common misconceptions.

IDSA COVID-19 antigen (Ag) testing—false positives and confirmatory testing: Given the high specificity of EUA rapid Ag tests, routine confirmation of positive test results is not usually necessary; positive results can be used immediately to help guide treatment, isolation, and quarantine decisions. Even when the pretest probability or prevalence is low (ie, 1%), the expected number of false-positive Ag results is very small, on the order of 0–10 false-positive results per 1000 individuals tested, and confirmation of positive Ag test results may be considered rarely on a case-by-case basis when the pretest probability or prevalence of infection is very low (ie, <1%) and/or if the impact of a potential false-positive result is deemed to be significant and detrimental. Concerns about false-positive Ag results were not borne out in the medical literature.

### Chapter 9: options for summarizing medical test performance in the absence of a "gold standard" [^4e0871e5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The classical paradigm for evaluating test performance compares the results of an index test with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the "truth" adequately well (e.g. is an "imperfect" reference standard), the typical ("naïve") estimates of sensitivity and specificity are biased. One has at least four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is "imperfect": (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the index test's ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i.e., treat the index test as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether the results of the two tests (index and reference) agree or disagree (i.e., treat them as two alternative measurement methods); (c) to calculate "naïve" estimates of the index test's sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the "naïve" estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the index test to account for the imperfect reference standard. We discuss these options and illustrate some of them through examples.

### Reinforcement learning increasingly relates to memory specificity from childhood to adulthood [^23539f34]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

All trials lasted 4 s, regardless of how quickly participants made their response. Within the 4-s time limit, participants made their choice selection by pressing 1, 2, or 3 on a standard keyboard. After making their selection, participants saw their choice highlighted for 500 ms, and then the outcome of their choice for the remainder of the trial (Fig. 4C). Participants saw green checkmarks with a bouncing animation and “+1” if they won a point, and red X’s with a swinging animation and “−1” if they lost a point. Trials were separated by a 500 ms inter-trial interval in which no stimuli appeared on the screen. The positions of the choice images were randomized on every trial.

As in Experiment 1, participants completed an extensive, child-friendly tutorial prior to beginning the reinforcement-learning task. After the tutorial, participants answered three True/False comprehension questions about the task. If they answered a question incorrectly, they would see (and hear) the correct answer with an explanation. On average, participants answered 2.7 comprehension questions correctly (Age group means: Children: 2.68; Adults: 2.71). There was no significant effect of age group on the number of questions answered correctly (p = 0.71).

The memory test was identical to that used in Experiment 1. Participants completed the memory test between 6 and 9 days after they completed the reinforcement-learning task (except for one adult who completed the memory test on day 5, and one child who completed it on day 10; Mean delay = 7.1 days; SD = 1.1 days; See Supplementary Note 2 for an analysis of the effects of delay duration on memory).

### A 20-year experience with surgical management of true and false internal carotid artery aneurysms [^58e73be1]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Aim Of The Study

The aim of this study was to retrospectively analyse early and late results of surgical management of internal carotid artery (ICA) true and false aneurysms in a single-centre experience.

Materials and Methods

From January 1988 to December 2011, 50 consecutive interventions for ICA aneurismal disease were performed; interventions were performed for true ICA aneurysm in 19 cases (group 1) and for ICA post-carotid endarterectomy (CEA) pseudo-aneurysm in the remaining 31 (group 2). Early results (<30 days) were evaluated in terms of mortality, stroke and cranial nerves' injury and compared between the two groups with χ(2) test. Follow-up results (stroke free-survival, freedom from ICA thrombosis and reintervention) were analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with log-rank test.

Results

All the patients in group 1 had open repair of their ICA aneurysm; in group 2 open repair was performed in 30 cases, while three patients with post-CEA aneurysm without signs of infection had a covered stent placed. There were no perioperative deaths. Two major strokes occurred in group 1 and one major stroke occurred in group 2 (p = 0.1). The rates of postoperative cranial nerve injuries were 10.5% in group 1 and 13% in group 2 (p = 0.8). Median duration of follow-up was 60 months (range 1-276). Estimated 10-year stroke-free survival rates were 64% in group 1 and 37% in group 2 (p = 0.4, log rank 0.5); thrombosis-free survival at 10 years was 66% in group 1 and 34% in group 2 (p = 0.2, log rank 1.2), while the corresponding figures in terms of reintervention-free survival were 68% and 33%, respectively (p = 0.2, log rank 1.8).

Conclusions

Surgical treatment of ICA aneurismal disease provided in our experience satisfactory early and long-term results, without significant differences between true and false aneurysms. In carefully selected patients with non-infected false aneurysm, the endovascular option seems to be feasible.

### Mesna [^612a69b5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Laboratory Test Interferences

False-Positive Urine Tests for Ketone Bodies

A false positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (including dipstick tests). The addition of glacial acetic acid can be used to differentiate between a false positive result (cherry-red color that fades) and a true positive result (red-violet color that intensifies).

False-Negative Tests for Enzymatic CPK Activity

Mesna may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound (e.g., N-acetylcysteine) for CPK reactivation. This may result in a falsely low CPK level.

False-Positive Tests for Ascorbic Acid

Mesna may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

5.5 Use in Patients with a History of Adverse Reactions to Thiol Compounds

Mesna is a thiol compound, i.e., a sulfhydryl (SH) group-containing organic compound. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to mesna.

### Evaluating molecular biomarkers for the early detection of lung cancer: when is a biomarker ready for clinical use? An official American Thoracic Society policy statement [^3a8dde44]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Lung nodule molecular biomarker clinical utility—criteria and trade-offs emphasize that a lung nodule molecular biomarker should improve on the accuracy of clinician judgment, lung nodule risk calculators, and fludeoxyglucose F 18–PET imaging, alone or in combination, and the accuracy of the biomarker should be high enough to suggest that it could move the pretest probability of malignancy beyond a clinical decision threshold; one can categorize the probability that the nodule is malignant based on the interventions recommended in each category—surveillance imaging, additional testing (imaging or nonsurgical biopsy), and surgical resection, and the biomarker should be able to shift a patient from one category of intervention to another, with the result of this shift leading to improved clinical outcomes in the intended use population. Outcome implications are noted: true-negative results—individuals with benign lung nodules could avoid costly and/or invasive testing; false-positive results—individuals with benign lung nodules could undergo costly and/or invasive testing including surgical resection; and false-negative results—individuals with malignant lung nodules may not receive an aggressive diagnostic evaluation, potentially delaying treatment. Calculations can be performed on the basis of an estimate of the relative benefit of a true-positive (or -negative) result to that of a false-positive (or -negative) result to suffice to estimate the accuracy required for a biomarker to have clinical benefit, and the estimate of required accuracy will differ, based on whether the test will be used to rule in or rule out cancer. As an example, for an intermediate-risk lung nodule with 40% probability of malignancy the benefit/harm context is described, and an example cost–benefit valuation is 5:1 (one false-positive control to justify five true-positive cases).

### Frontotemporal dementia is the leading cause of "true" A-/ T + profiles defined with A β ratio [^71669b68]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with positive tauopathy but negative Aβ 42 (A-T+) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represent a diagnostic challenge. The Aβ 42/40 ratio supersedes Aβ 42 and reintegrates "false" A-T+ patients into the Alzheimer's disease spectrum. However, the biomarker and clinical characteristics of "true" and "false" A-T+ patients remain elusive.

Methods

Among the 509 T+N+ patients extracted from the databases of three memory clinics, we analyzed T+N+ patients with normal Aβ 42 and compared "false" A-T+ with abnormal Aβ 42/40 ratio and "true" A-T+ patients with normal Aβ 42/40 ratio, before CSF analysis and at follow-up.

Results

24.9% of T+N+ patients had normal Aβ 42 levels. Among them, 42.7% were "true" A-T+. "True" A-T+ had lower CSF tau P181 than "false" A-T+ patients. 48.0% of "true" A-T+ patients were diagnosed with frontotemporal lobar degeneration before CSF analysis and 64.0% at follow-up, as compared with 6% in the "false" A-T+ group ( P < .0001).

Discussion

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration is probably the main cause of "true" A-T+ profiles.

### Media literacy tips promoting reliable news improve discernment and enhance trust in traditional media [^e79d37fc]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Media literacy tips typically encourage people to be skeptical of the news despite the small prevalence of false news in Western democracies. Would such tips be effective if they promoted trust in true news instead? A pre-registered experiment (N = 3919, US) showed that Skepticism-enhancing tips, Trust-inducing tips, and a mix of both tips, increased participants' sharing and accuracy discernment. The Trust-inducing tips boosted true news sharing and acceptance, the Skepticism-enhancing tips hindered false news sharing and acceptance, while the Mixed tips did both. Yet, the effects of the tips were more alike than different, with very similar effect sizes across conditions for true and false news. We experimentally manipulated the proportion of true and false news participants were exposed to. The Trust and Skepticism tips were most effective when participants were exposed to equal proportions of true and false news, while the Mixed tips were most effective when exposed to 75% of true news - the most realistic proportion. Moreover, the Trust-inducing tips increased trust in traditional media. Overall, we show that to be most effective, media literacy tips should aim both to foster skepticism towards false news and to promote trust in true news.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the management of LUPUS NEPHRITIS [^90277cd1]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 lupus nephritis guideline—recommendation rating key states that recommendation strength is indicated as Level 1 or Level 2 and the certainty of supporting evidence is graded A, B, C, or D. Level 1 implies for clinicians that “Most patients should receive the recommended course of action” and for policy that “The recommendation can be evaluated as a candidate for developing a policy or a performance measure.” Level 2 implies for clinicians that “Different choices will be appropriate for different patients. Each patient needs help to arrive at a management decision consistent with her or his values and preferences,” and for policy that “The recommendation is likely to require substantial debate and involvement of stakeholders before policy can be determined.” Certainty grades are defined as A High (“We are confident that the true effect is close to the estimate of the effect.”), B Moderate (“The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.”), C Low (“The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.”), and D Very low (“The estimate of the effect is very uncertain, and often it will be far from the true effect.”). Practice points are described as “consensus-based statements representing the expert judgment of the Work Group and are not graded” and “should not be seen as less important or a downgrade from graded recommendations.”

### Research techniques made simple: sample size Estimation and power calculation [^b2b6b836]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Sample size and power calculations help determine if a study is feasible based on a priori assumptions about the study results and available resources. Trade-offs must be made between the probability of observing the true effect and the probability of type I errors (α, false positive) and type II errors (β, false negative). Calculations require specification of the null hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis, type of outcome measure and statistical test, α level, β, effect size, and variability (if applicable). Because the choice of these parameters may be quite arbitrary in some cases, one approach is to calculate the sample size or power over a range of plausible parameters before selecting the final sample size or power. Considerations that should be taken into account could include correction for nonadherence of the participants, adjustment for multiple comparisons, or innovative study designs.

### Association of environmental uncertainty with altered decision-making and learning mechanisms in youths with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^7d6b321e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Standard PRL Results

The patient and control groups were matched for age, IQ, and sex (Table 1). Analyses indicated significant interactions between group and phase on proportion of correct choices (estimated coefficient = −0.98; 95% CI, −1.31 to −0.64), proportion of switching in response to spurious (false) negative feedback (estimated coefficient = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60-1.26), and proportion of staying in response to veridical (true) positive feedback (estimated coefficient = −1.74; 95% CI, −2.17 to −1.31) (Table 2 ; eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Those results indicated that, during the reversal phase, compared with controls, patients with OCD made significantly fewer correct responses (mean [SD] proportion: 0.83 [0.16] for controls vs 0.61 [0.31] for patients), switched more following spurious (false) negative feedback (mean [SD] proportion: 0.09 [0.16] for controls vs 0.27 [0.34] for patients), and stayed less following veridical (true) positive feedback (mean [SD] proportion: 0.93 [0.17] for controls vs 0.73 [0.34] for patients; 95% CI, −2.17 to −1.31). Significant results persisted when controlling for covariates (eTable 1 in the Supplement). When stratified by medication, the unmedicated and medicated groups showed reduced proportion of correct choices (control vs unmedicated patients: estimated coefficient = 1.35 [95% CI, 0.50-2.2]; control vs medicated: estimated coefficient = 1.14 [95% CI, 0.39-1.88]; unmedicated vs medicated: estimated coefficient = −0.21 [95% CI, −1.14 to 0.72]) and proportion of staying in response to veridical (true) positive feedback (control vs unmedicated patients: estimated coefficient = 2.95 [95% CI, 0.83-5.08]; control vs medicated: estimated coefficient = 2.68 [95% CI, 0.79-4.57]; unmedicated vs medicated: estimated coefficient = −0.27, [95% CI, −2.48 to 1.93]) compared with the control group during the reversal phase, but there were no significant differences between the unmedicated and medicated subgroups. Post hoc group comparisons for proportion of switching in response to spurious (false) negative feedback were not significant (eTables 2, 3, 4, and 5 and eFigure 2 in the Supplement).

### A critique of the false-positive report probability [^0ef34eb3]. Genetic Epidemiology (2009). Low credibility.

The false positive report probability (FPRP) was proposed as a Bayesian prophylactic against false reports of significant associations. Unfortunately, the derivation of the FPRP is unsound. A heuristic derivation fails to make its point, and a formal derivation reveals a probabilistic misrepresentation of an observation. As a result, the FPRP can yield serious inferential errors. In particular, the FPRP can use an observation that is many times more likely under the null hypothesis than under the alternative to infer that the null hypothesis is far less probable than the alternative. Contrary to its intended purpose, the FPRP can promote false positive results. It should not be used. A modified FPRP is derived, but it appears to have limited application and does not address the problem of false reports of significant associations. The conditional error probability is a possible replacement for the FPRP.

### Intellectual factors in false memories of patients with schizophrenia [^f0161d78]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

The current study explored the intellectual factors in false memories of 139 patients with schizophrenia, using a recognition task and an IQ test. The full-scale IQ score of the participants ranged from 57 to 144 (M = 100, SD = 14). The full IQ score had a negative correlation with false recognition in patients with schizophrenia, and positive correlations with high-confidence true recognition and discrimination rates. Further analyses with the subtests' scores revealed that false recognition was negatively correlated with scores of performance IQ (and one of its subtests: picture arrangement), whereas true recognition was positively correlated with scores of verbal IQ (and two of its subtests: information and digit span). High-IQ patients had less false recognition (overall or high-confidence false recognition), more high-confidence true recognition, and higher discrimination abilities than those with low IQ. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanism in false memory of patients with schizophrenia, and are of practical relevance to the evaluation of memory reliability in patients with different intellectual levels.

### Correctly using sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in clinical practice: how to avoid three common pitfalls [^afbb78e8]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Radiology is the specialty of imaging-based diagnostic tests. Understanding the science behind evaluating diagnostic test performance is essential for radiologists because we provide care to patients and interact with our colleagues.

Conclusion

Here, we review the key terminology used and common pitfalls encountered in the literature and in day-to-day discussions of diagnostic test performance.

### How accurately could we screen for individual risk? Using summary data to examine discriminatory accuracy of a risk marker [^516bcdac]. Preventive Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

While much has been written on the methodology of screening for presence of preclinical disease, correspondingly less has been written on screening for future risk of disease. Given the increasing attention paid to the concept of individualized prevention within the discipline of public health, this other type of screening warrants attention. Our aim is to demonstrate one way in which the potential accuracy of risk screening can be assessed.

Method

In this paper, we derive a simple computational formula for the concordance statistic, a measure of the ability to separate individuals into two groups (will get disease, will not get disease), based on the presence or absence of a dichotomous risk factor. This computational formula is based on summary data (prevalence, absolute risk) pertaining to the risk factor alone. We also present simple computational formulas for the true positive fraction (the sensitivity of the "high risk" label to actual disease development) and the false positive fraction (1-specificity of the "high risk" label.).

Conclusion

The above quantities are rarely presented when scientists make statements about the potential usefulness of a risk factor or genetic marker in screening for future disease risk. With the simple formulas offered here, readers will be better able to evaluate the accuracy of such statements.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—evidence for testing asymptomatic individuals with known exposures notes that no direct evidence comparing testing versus no testing was found, so diagnostic accuracy data were used with a composite reference standard of more than two standard NAATs (i.e., rapid RT-PCR and laboratory-based NAAT); across five studies with 349 positive and 530 negative individuals, pooled sensitivity was 97% (95% CI: 93 to 99) and pooled specificity was 100% (95% CI: 96 to 100). Considering prevalences of 1%, 5%, and 10% in asymptomatic individuals with known exposures, there were no predicted false-positive and 0 to 3 predicted false-negative results per 1,000 individuals, and the certainty of the evidence was moderate due to down rating for indirectness.

### Syncytial knots (tenney-parker changes) in the human placenta: evidence of loss of transcriptional activity and oxidative damage [^16977e3a]. The American Journal of Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Syncytiotrophoblast is the multinucleated epithelium of the placenta. Although many nuclei are dispersed within the syncytioplasm, others are aggregated into specializations referred to as true and false syncytial knots, and syncytial sprouts. Nuclei within true knots display highly condensed chromatin and are thought to be aged and effete. True knots increase in frequency with gestational age. Excessive formation (Tenney-Parker change) is associated with placental pathology, and a knotting index is used to assess severity. However, this index is potentially confounded by the creation of artifactual appearances (false knots) through tangential sectioning. In addition, knots must be distinguished from syncytial sprouts, which are markers of trophoblast proliferation. Here, we distinguish between sprouts, true knots, and false knots using serial sections and perform IHC for proliferating cell nuclear antigen, upstream binding factor, RNA polymerase II, and 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine as markers of recent incorporation, transcriptional activity, and oxidative damage. Villous explants were exposed to hydrogen peroxide to test the relationship between transcriptional activity and oxidative damage. Sprouts and false knots were found to contain recently incorporated and transcriptionally active nuclei. By contrast, most nuclei within true knots are negative for transcriptional markers but positive for 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine. In vitro, we observed a negative correlation between transcriptional activity and oxidative damage. These findings demonstrate that true knots contain effete damaged nuclei and provide IHC markers for their identification.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of potentially malignant disorders in the oral cavity: a report of the American dental association [^64003563]. Journal of the American Dental Association (2017). Medium credibility.

Tissue reflectance and vital staining adjuncts—evaluation of clinically evident, seemingly innocuous, or nonsuspicious lesions in primary care—report test accuracy and projected effects per 100,000 patients tested at Prevalence 0.25% and Prevalence 2.0%. Sensitivity was 0.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00 to 0.60), specificity 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.84), and negative likelihood ratio 1.32 (95% CI, 1.18 to 1.48). At Prevalence 0.25%, true-positive results (patients needing a biopsy) were 0 (0-150), false-negative results (patients incorrectly classified as not needing a biopsy) were 250 (100-250), true-negative results (patients without need for a biopsy) were 75,810 (65,835-83,790), and false-positive results (patients incorrectly classified as needing a biopsy) were 23,940 (15,960-33,915); at Prevalence 2.0%, the corresponding values were 0 (0-1,200), 2,000 (800-2,000), 74,480 (64,680-82,320), and 23,520 (15,680-33,320). The positivity threshold for the reference test in regard to dysplasia was unclear.

Thoracic aortic dissection imaging—systematic review and meta-analysis reports diagnostic accuracy for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), helical computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) across 16 studies including 1,139 patients; TEE (10 studies) showed sensitivity 98% (95% CI 95% to 99%) and specificity 95% (95% CI 92% to 97%), helical CT (3 studies) showed sensitivity 100% (95% CI 96% to 100%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 87% to 99%), and MRI (7 studies) showed sensitivity 98% (95% CI 95% to 99%) and specificity 98% (95% CI 95% to 100%). Included studies were prospective with absolute counts of true-positive, false-negative, true-negative, and false-positive results and a clearly indicated reference standard, and a noted limitation was that only 3 helical CT studies included a total of 117 patients with aortic dissection (18 subacute or chronic), making sensitivity likely overly optimistic in that cohort.

### The incidence of diagnostic error in medicine [^03d4f3bf]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2013). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have proposed that measuring the incidence of diagnostic error in everyday practice is an essential requirement of a comprehensive quality management programme.Of eight methods used to study diagnostic errors, some are more suitable than others in terms of their potential for providing meaningful data on diagnostic error rates (table 1). Analysing closed malpractice claims can provide only relative data on error rates; estimating absolute rates is not possible because so few true errors actually result in claims, and not all claims reflect true errors. Diagnostic testing audits are meaningful only to the extent that audits examine true clinical impact, because many diagnostic testing errors are ultimately detected and corrected, or discarded as meaningless. Of the remaining methods, each has its own advantages and limitations. Moreover, it is probably safe to assume that each of these approaches will underestimate the actual rate of error, and may identify entirely separate cohorts of errors. This problem is compounded by the different definitions and classification systems of diagnostic error that have been applied in these various studies. The goal of knowing the diagnostic error rate in practice may, therefore, require further research to standardise definitions and other methodologic issues, and combining results from several different approaches.

### False conflict and false confirmation errors are crucial components of AI accuracy in medical decision making [^43a87e93]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Given that explainable AI can assist physicians in determining whether AI diagnoses align with evidence-based medicine and that explanations are essential for meeting the trustworthiness and transparency requirements of the EU AI Act 2024, it still potentially introduces new sources of errors, such as false conflict and false confirmation errors. One intervention could be introducing more complex diagnoses instead of simple yes/no decisions. Another promising technique is conformal predictions, which shifts the focus of the AI model from pinpointing a single accurate clinical recommendation to providing the clinician with a range of possibilities tailored to the individual patient, allowing for further investigation. Further research is needed to better understand interventions to avoid new human-AI collaboration errors.

We believe a more precise identification of these errors and in whom they occur creates tremendous potential to tap the full potential and promise of AI-supported decision-making.

### The development of clinical guidelines and guidance statements by the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians: update of methods [^e807bcaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ACP clinical guidelines—grading certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)—defines certainty levels and links them to recommendation strength. High is defined as “Confident that the true effect is close to the estimated effect,” Moderate as “Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely close to the estimated effect, but there is a sizable possibility that it is substantially different,” and Low as “Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimated effect.” The Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) “grades the strength of each recommendation as strong or conditional,” and “Strong recommendations are generally based on high or moderate certainty in evidence,” though “In rare and extenuating circumstances, a strong recommendation may be based on low-certainty evidence–for example, when the evidence indicates a substantial net benefit in a life-threatening situation.” For Strong recommendations, certainty is “High or moderate,” the balance is “Confidence that benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa,” they “Applies to most patients in most circumstances,” and “Only strong recommendations could be considered for use as performance measures.” For Conditional recommendations, certainty can be “High, moderate, or low,” benefits “probably outweigh risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty,” applicability “Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients’ values and preferences,” and policymaking “will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Performance indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place.”

### Spurious precision in meta-analysis of observational research [^8ab2ba1f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Reported precision is defined as spurious if it exceeds that in a correctly specified model with proper functional form and error term properties. Correct precision, by contrast, requires that the model yields an unbiased and consistent estimate of α 1 and that the computation of the standard error accounts for clustering or small-sample issues when present. Spurious precision thus defined is relevant at the meta-analysis level because it undermines the effectiveness of conventional methods, which use the standard error as inverse weight and also as a regressor in Egger-type regression, to identify the true mean effect beyond publication bias.

Spurious precision by itself does not bias meta-analysis if it is unrelated to the size of the estimated effect; in that case, it only reduces efficiency and distorts inference. But it becomes a more serious problem when some authors crave statistical significance and adjust the computation of precision in response to the estimated effect size—even if the corresponding estimate reported in the primary study remains unbiased (as we will see in the stylized simulation scenario). Spurious precision is particularly detrimental to meta-analysis when it co-occurs with a biased estimate (as we will see in the p -hacking simulation scenario). Note that the standard error of a biased estimate of α 1 from a misspecified model may be regarded as correct for that particular model. However, at the meta-analysis level, cross-study comparison of precision matters, and in this case a biased estimate would be paired with higher precision—and thus greater weight—than if it were unbiased.

Conventional meta-analysis models

We focus on minimizing bias in meta-analysis, though in the Supplementary Information (S1, S6) we also report and discuss results for MSE and coverage rates. Does any meta-analysis technique work well in the case of panel B of Fig. 1, or at least with a small amount of spurious precision? We examine seven current estimators: simple unweighted mean, fixed-effect model (weighted least squares, FE/WLS), precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with standard errors (PET-PEESE), endogenous kink (EK), weighted average of adequately powered estimates (WAAP), the model by Andrews and Kasy, and p -uniform *. Note that the unweighted mean can be seen as a limiting case of a random-effects model, where between-study variance is assumed to be infinite and all estimates are weighted equally.

### Four overlooked errors in ROC analysis: how to prevent and avoid [^9b7925ce]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Basic knowledge of ROC curve

The ROC curve is a graphical representation for evaluating the performance of a binary classification model or diagnostic test, plotted in a 1×1 square with: the vertical axis representing sensitivity or true positive rate (TPR), defined as the number of true positives divided by the total number of positive cases; while the horizontal axis represents 1−specificity rate or false positive rate (FPR), calculated as the ratio of false positives to the total number of negative cases.In diagnostic tests with quantitative or multiclass results, each possible test value can serve as a potential cut-off point. ROC analysis enables the evaluation of different cut-off points, calculating sensitivity and specificity for each one.Additionally, ROC curve has been characterised as ‘a two-dimensional depiction of classifier performance’.Classifiers are typically compared according to the area under the curve (AUC), which ranges between 0 and 1.0, representing the area of the unit square. The practical lower limit for the AUC of a classifier is 0.5.ROC analysis primarily focuses on comparing AUCs and determining cut-off values in diagnostics. Four overlooked errors include three in AUC comparison and one in cut-off selection.

### Role of the urinary N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase / creatinine (NAG / Cr) ratio in discriminating between true and false pyuria in sterile urine bag specimens [^c9c5a729]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Urethral catheterization (CATH) and suprapubic aspiration (SA) are reliable methods of collecting urine for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTIs), but both are invasive and difficult. Therefore, urine collection through a sterile urine bag (SUB) is commonly used for UTI screening. However, when pyuria is found in SUB specimens, it is difficult to interpret whether this result is true or false.

Objective

We aimed to determine the diagnostic performance of the urinary NAG/Cr ratio in detecting true pyuria in SUB specimens for children with suspected UTIs.

Study Design

This retrospective study included children 2-24 months of age presenting to the pediatric emergency department (PED) and in whom urinary NAG and creatinine levels were measured and a urine culture was performed between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. Children with the presence of pyuria in SUB specimens were categorized into true or false pyuria groups depending on whether pyuria was present in CATH specimens. The diagnostic performance of the urinary NAG/Cr ratio in detecting true pyuria was identified using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The optimal cutoff was calculated based on ROC curve analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were assessed for optimal cutoff values.

Results

Among 606 children with measured urinary NAG levels, 144 children with pyuria in SUB specimens were included in the analyses. Pyuria was consistently present in the CATH specimens of 67 (46.5%) children and absent in those of 77 (44.5%) children. The urinary NAG/Cr ratio was significantly higher in the true pyuria group than in the false pyuria group (21.5 IU/g; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.3-35.6; vs 9.6 IU/g; 95% CI: 6.7-16.1, P < 0.001). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the urinary NAG/Cr ratio was 0.776 (95% CI: 0.700-0.851). The optimal cutoff of 18.85 IU/g corresponded to the best combination of sensitivity (58.2, 95% CI: 46.4-70.0) and specificity (83.3, 95% CI: 74.7-91.6), with positive and negative likelihood ratios of 3.49 (95% CI: 2.04-5.97) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.37-0.68), respectively.

Conclusion

The urinary NAG/Cr ratio may be a potential indicator discriminating true pyuria from false pyuria in SUB specimens in the PED. However, large prospective studies are required to implement the NAG/Cr ratio in clinical practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for primary aldosteronism, more specifically with respect to plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio (technical considerations), ES 2025 guidelines recommend to repeat the test if the patient's initial screen is positive but they are receiving medications such as β-blockers and centrally acting α-2 agonists (clonidine and α-methyldopa) that can lower renin and cause false-positive results. Withdraw these medications for 2 weeks if it is safe and feasible. Consider potential false positives induced by β-blockers when aldosterone is 10-15 ng/dL (277-416 pmol/L) by immunoassay or 7.5-10 ng/dL (208-277 pmol/L) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Recognize that PA is likely if aldosterone is above these concentrations despite being on β-blockers.

### The harmless acute pancreatitis score: a clinical algorithm for rapid initial stratification of nonsevere disease [^1d18b35a]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS)" for acute pancreatitis.

The Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a clinical calculator used in the management of patients with acute pancreatitis. This scoring system is specifically designed to predict the likelihood of a benign course of acute pancreatitis within the first 24 hours of admission. The HAPS is calculated based on five parameters: hematocrit, age, pleural effusion, sex, and serum calcium levels. 

The clinical utility of the HAPS is to assist clinicians in identifying patients who are likely to have a mild course of acute pancreatitis, thereby aiding in decision-making regarding hospital admission, level of care, and resource allocation. 

The HAPS should not be used in patients with chronic pancreatitis or those with a known history of severe acute pancreatitis, as it is not designed to predict severity in these populations. Additionally, it may not be accurate in patients with conditions that can affect the parameters used in the score, such as chronic kidney disease (which can affect serum calcium levels) or lung disease (which can cause pleural effusion).

The Harmless Acute Pancreatitis Score (HAPS) is a tool used to evaluate the severity of acute pancreatitis based on three clinical criteria. Each criterion can contribute one point to a total score ranging from 0 to 3.

The inputs evaluated are binary, with each input being true (affirmative) or false:

- Peritonitis rebound tenderness or guarding
- Elevated creatinine levels (greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL or 177 mcmol/L)
- Elevated hematocrit levels (43% or more for males, and 39.6% or more for females)

For each criterion that returns true, a score of 1 is assigned. The total score is the sum of all affirmative inputs.

Here's how the score is interpreted:

- A total score of 0 suggests a low likelihood of needing aggressive medical interventions such as artificial ventilation, dialysis, and the patient is unlikely to experience necrosis or mortality. This indicates a less severe episode of pancreatitis.

- A score of 1 or higher suggests an increased risk of severe outcomes, including the potential necessity for artificial ventilation, dialysis, and a higher risk of necrosis or mortality. This indicates a more severe condition that might require immediate medical attention.

This scoring system helps healthcare professionals quickly assess the severity of acute pancreatitis, enabling informed decisions for patient management.

### Closing the gap: oxford nanopore technologies R10 sequencing allows comparable results to illumina sequencing for SNP-based outbreak investigation of bacterial pathogens [^f023d37c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Determining variant filtering thresholds

Plots of the variant filtering metrics for true SNPs and false SNPs, compared to the Illumina data, are shown in Fig. S2 through S5. For both ONT R9 and R10, the depth values of true and false SNPs were mostly overlapping and therefore not suitable for distinguishing true SNPs from false SNPs, although a minimum depth value of 5 was enforced to mask SNP calls based on a very small number of bases. For the R9 and R10 data sets, the allele frequency of the true SNPs was on average higher than that of the false SNPs. The variation was greater for the R9 data sets, resulting in a greater overlap between true and false SNPs. A threshold value of 66% was chosen to retain the majority of true SNPs while removing the majority of false SNPs, particularly in the R9 data sets. Notably, some of the true SNPs in the E. coli Illumina data sets had very low allele frequencies (i.e. below 50%), which is a limitation of using the unfiltered Illumina SNPs as a reference standard. For all technologies/chemistries, the SNP quality of the true SNPs peaked at the maximum value (i.e. 255). The variation was greater for the values observed in the R9 data sets, resulting in overlap between the true and false SNPs. A threshold value of 50 was selected, which removed the vast majority of false SNPs while limiting the number of true SNPs removed. Finally, the P value of the strand bias was evaluated. Interestingly, the vast majority of the false SNPs detected in the R9 data had a (near) 0 P value, indicating that the alternative bases were mostly restricted to one of the two strands. Although the observed values for the false SNPs were generally lower than those for the true SNPs, it was not possible to find a threshold value that did not exclude a substantial proportion of the true SNPs. Therefore, this metric was not used for variant filtering.

### Vaccinia immune globulin intravenous (human) (Cnj-016) [^4124e0d2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: INTERACTIONS WITH GLUCOSE MONITORING SYSTEMS

Blood glucose measurement in patients receiving VIGIV must be done with a glucose-specific method (monitor and test strips) to avoid interference by maltose contained in VIGIV. Glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinolinequinone (GDH-PQQ) or glucose-dye-oxidoreductase method (monitor and test strips) must not be used for blood glucose testing in patients receiving VIGIV, since maltose in IGIV products has been shown to give falsely high blood glucose levels in these testing systems. This could result in the inappropriate administration of insulin, resulting in life-threatening hypoglycemia. Cases of true hypoglycemia may go untreated if the hypoglycemic state is masked by falsely elevated glucose readings.

Carefully review the product information of the blood glucose testing system, including that of the test strips, to determine if the system is appropriate for use with maltose-containing parenteral products [see 5.3 Blood Glucose Monitoring].

### Clinical score for predicting recurrence after hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer: analysis of 1001 consecutive cases [^bd892442]. Annals of Surgery (1999). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Fong clinical risk score for hepatic resection in metastatic colorectal cancer" for colon cancer and rectal cancer.

The Fong Clinical Risk Score is a prognostic tool specifically designed for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who are undergoing hepatic resection. This scoring system is used to predict the survival outcome after the surgical procedure. It takes into account seven preoperative factors: node-positive primary, disease-free interval from primary to metastases of less than 12 months, more than one hepatic tumor, largest hepatic tumor greater than 5 cm, carcinoembryonic antigen level greater than 200 ng/mL, and presence of extrahepatic disease. Each factor is assigned one point, and the total score ranges from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating a worse prognosis. The Fong Clinical Risk Score does not have specific exclusion criteria, but it may not be applicable or accurate in patients with other types of cancer or in those who are not candidates for hepatic resection.

The Fong clinical risk score is a tool used to assess the risk of hepatic resection in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer by analyzing five specific medical factors. These factors are evaluated as true or false, and each true condition adds one point to the total score, which ranges from 0 to 5. The factors considered are:

- Node-positive primary
- Disease-free interval less than 12 months from diagnosis of the primary tumor to the appearance of metastasis
- More than one hepatic tumor present
- Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level greater than 200 ng/mL
- Largest hepatic tumor greater than 5 cm

Each of these factors is assigned a score of 1 if present. By summing up the scores for all factors marked true, a total score is calculated. This total is then used to interpret survival probabilities over 1-year and 5-year timeframes, offering insights into the patient's prognosis and aiding in clinical decision-making.

Here's how the interpretations align with the scores:

| Score | Probability of 1-year survival | Probability of 5-year survival |
|-------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| 0     | 93%                           | 60%                             |
| 1     | 91%                           | 44%                             |
| 2     | 89%                           | 40%                             |
| 3     | 86%                           | 20%                             |
| 4     | 70%                           | 25%                             |
| 5     | 71%                           | 14%                             |

In summary, the score reflects the cumulative impact of these risk factors, directly correlating to survival probabilities, and serves as a valuable tool in planning the treatment strategy for metastatic colorectal cancer., and serves as a valuable tool in planning the treatment strategy for metastatic colorectal cancer.

### Your evidence? Machine learning algorithms for medical diagnosis and prediction [^f5aa47e2]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

5 ASSIGNING RESPONSIBILITY

Imagine that the medical diagnosis of a system based on machine learning turned out to be mistaken. Although reliable in the past, and having achieved excellent performance in independent validations, it presented a wrong result this time. Notably, this scenario is not just possible, it will happen inevitably, as no system can achieve 100% accuracy in the real world. The drugs that were prescribed by the physician on the basis of the diagnosis provided by the algorithm did not show the intended effect and the situation of the patient declined rapidly. He comes to see the doctor again and accuses her of mistreatment. To defend herself, the doctor would normally recapitulate the evidence that initially justified her conclusion. Other medical experts could review this excuse, compare it to their own experience and established guidelines, and see whether she negligently missed or misjudged something. Eventually, the degree of responsibility for the mistreatment that we attribute to the doctor depends on the nature of the evidence that she overlooked or misinterpreted. If she missed something obvious or drew conclusions that are clearly at odds with established medical knowledge we would classify her behavior as grossly negligent. If, however, literally no expert would have noticed the crucial point or if the case represents one of the inevitable outliers of the general rule, we would probably absolve her from guilt (Figure 1).

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^b2a8ad98]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—rapid nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) in patients (i.e., those with at least one common symptom of COVID-19) had predicted false negative results ranging from 2 to 20 and false positive results from 5 to 9 per 1000 patients tested across considered prevalences; the pooled sensitivity of the rapid tests was 96%, and all rapid molecular tests had very high specificities. Positive results from rapid NAATs do not usually need to be confirmed by standard laboratory-based NAATs, and negative rapid molecular test results do not need routine confirmation. The certainty of the evidence was moderate due to risk of bias with the use of laboratory-based NAAT as the reference standard, and with some inconsistency of sensitivity results for some assays.

### Six persistent research misconceptions [^08e7ed1a]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

A surprising number of misconceptions persist in the conduct of research involving human subjects. Some persist despite teachings to the contrary, and some because of teachings that should be to the contrary. To spark discussion of these issues, I list here six persistent research misconceptions, and offer a capsule summary of the problems with each of them.

Misconception 1. There is a hierarchy of study designs; randomized trials provide the greatest validity, followed by cohort studies, with case–control studies being least reliable.

Randomized trials, though often considered the “gold standard” of study types, are not perfect, even in concept. Furthermore, the premise that the comparative validity of study results can be inferred from the type of study is wrong.

Although some believe that evidence from a randomized trial is as compelling as a logical proof, no empirical finding can provide absolute certainty. If randomized trials were perfect, how could they give divergent results? In fact, they are subject to various errors.Obviously there is random error, as one would expect from a study based on random assignment. But there is also systematic error, or bias. For example, randomized trials are usually analyzed using the “intent to treat” principle, which compares the groups that are initially assigned by randomization, regardless of any subsequent non-adherence. Non-adherence results in underestimation of any treatment effect. This bias is usually considered acceptable because it is outweighed by the advantages achieved by random assignment. Underestimation of effects, however, is not acceptable in a safety trial aimed at uncovering adverse effects of the treatment. Another important source of bias in a randomized trial comes from errors in assessing the outcome, such as undercounting of outcome events. Also, even if randomization provides a balance of risk factors between groups at the start of the trial, with extended follow-up, the study groups may become progressively imbalanced through differential attrition or changes in risk factor distributions. With long-term trials, the benefits of random assignment may therefore fade with time.

### Three simple rules to ensure reasonably credible subgroup analyses [^07d6075b]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Expensive trials can only be justified if there is a reasonable probability of success based on prior data. In contrast, subgroup analyses with low priors are commonly conducted, perhaps because they are perceived as being essentially free, but as is shown below, conducting multiple subgroup analyses is statistically costly. We can also use empirical data as a rough starting point for thinking about prior probability. Of roughly 1200 subgroup analyses of recent clinical trials published in high impact journals, 83 (7%) were reportedly positive.Assuming a 5% false positive rate, only a fraction of these analyses were likely true positives. This observation is supported by the observation that less than 15% of these subgroup analyses met four of 10 criteria for credibility. So, a high-end starting point for the prior probability for the average published subgroup analysis is probably around 5%, which can be adjusted on a case by case basis, based on the prior empirical and theoretical evidence.

As per Bayes’s rule, low prior probabilities greatly increase the chance of a positive result being a false positive finding, and low power greatly increases this problem. Back to our analogy, the same phenomenon explains why ordering insensitive diagnostic tests with a low pretest probability leads to most positive test results being false positives (table 1).

### Lyme disease overdiagnosis in a large healthcare system: a population-based, retrospective study [^89c95c5e]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the impact of false-positive IgM immunoblots on Lyme disease treatment and case reporting in a large healthcare system.

Methods

We obtained the results of all Lyme disease serological tests ordered at U.S. Air Force healthcare facilities in the USA between January 2013 and December 2017. We conducted chart reviews to adjudicate positive IgM immunoblots (from two-tier and independent testing) as true positives or false positives using established criteria, and we assessed whether these cases were reported to the U.S. Department of Defense surveillance system.

Results

Of the 18 410 serum tests (17 058 immunoassays and 1352 immunoblots) performed on 15 928 unique individuals, 249/1352 (18.4%) IgM immunoblots were positive. After excluding repeat tests, insufficiently documented cases, and participants with a history of Lyme disease, 212 positive IgM immunoblot cases were assessed. A total of 113/212 (53.3%) were determined to be false positives. Antibiotics were prescribed for Lyme disease for 97/99 (98.0%) participants with a true-positive test and 91/113 (80.5%) participants with a false-positive test. The number of false-positive cases reported to the surveillance system was identical to the number of unreported true-positive cases (n = 44).

Conclusions

Lyme disease serological tests were overused in a large healthcare system, and positive results were frequently misinterpreted, leading to misdiagnosis and widespread antibiotic misuse. Underreporting of true-positive cases was offset by overreporting of false-positive cases, suggesting that the discrepancy between the reported incidence and true incidence of Lyme disease may not be as significant as previously assumed.

### The ALT-70 cellulitis model maintains predictive value at 24 and 48 hours after presentation [^75037ff5]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "ALT-70 score for cellulitis" for cellulitis, skin abscess and animal bites.

The ALT-70 is a clinical prediction rule for cellulitis. It is used to differentiate cellulitis from pseudocellulitis in adult patients presenting with lower extremity redness. The acronym ALT-70 stands for Age (over 70), Lesion characteristics (asymmetry, well-demarcated border), Temperature (37.9°C or higher), and White blood cell count (more than 10,000 cells/mm³). Each of these four factors is assigned a score, and the total score is used to predict the likelihood of true cellulitis. This calculator is particularly useful in emergency departments and outpatient settings to guide treatment decisions and avoid unnecessary antibiotic use. It should not be used in patients with known skin infections other than cellulitis, or in patients with skin changes due to chronic conditions like venous insufficiency or lymphedema.

The ALT-70 score for cellulitis is a tool designed to assess the likelihood of cellulitis in patients by considering four key clinical factors. Each factor is rated with a specific point value, and the total score informs the probability of cellulitis.

You input four true or false answers related to these clinical factors:
- Presence of asymmetric skin abnormalities
- Age of 70 years or older
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more

The scoring for these factors is as follows:
- Asymmetric skin abnormalities contribute 3 points
- Age of 70 years or older adds 2 points
- White blood cell count of 10,000/mcL or more adds 1 point
- Heart rate of 90 beats per minute or more also adds 1 point

To compute the ALT-70 score, you sum the points of all true responses, resulting in a total score ranging from 0 to 7.

Interpreting the score:
- A score of 0 to 2 suggests a low probability of cellulitis. It’s advisable to explore other diagnoses.
- A score between 3 and 4 indicates an intermediate probability and suggests consulting a specialist for further evaluation.
- A score from 5 to 7 implies a high probability of cellulitis, for which initiating treatment may be recommended.

### Diagnostic tests: how to estimate the positive predictive value [^7ea4931e]. Neuro-Oncology Practice (2015). Low credibility.

When a patient receives a positive test result from a diagnostic test they assume they have the disease. However, the positive predictive value (PPV), ie the probability that they have the disease given a positive test result, is rarely equal to one. To assist their patients, doctors must explain the chance that they do in fact have the disease. However, physicians frequently miscalculate the PPV as the sensitivity and/or misinterpret the PPV, which results in increased anxiety in patients and generates unnecessary tests and consultations. The reasons for this miscalculation as well as three ways to calculate the PPV are reviewed here.

### The Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the diagnosis of COVID-19: molecular diagnostic testing (December 2023) [^56468237]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing—symptomatic patients summarizes that no direct patient- or population-centered outcome evidence comparing testing versus no testing was found, so the panel relied on diagnostic accuracy from five studies with 349 positive and 530 negative patients using standard nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) reference standards defined as a composite of more than two standard NAATs using nasopharyngeal or nasal swabs. Pooled performance showed sensitivity 97% (95% CI: 93 to 99) and specificity 100% (95% CI: 96 to 100). For symptomatic patients, the panel considered prevalences of 5%, 20% and 50%; across this range there were 1-15 predicted false-negative results and no predicted false-positive results per 1,000 individuals. Certainty was rated moderate due to indirectness from lack of direct comparisons of tested versus untested individuals and from studies including mixed or unspecified symptom status. Diagnostic testing for symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is stated as needed because clinical assessment alone is not accurate, and harms noted include that false-negative results could cause symptomatic individuals to spread SARS-CoV-2 and deny such patients appropriate therapy, while false-positive results can isolate individuals who do not have COVID-19, causing unnecessary anxiety and delaying additional evaluation.

### Intimate partner violence: development of a brief risk assessment for the emergency department [^94c0a5a9]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Intimate partner violence risk assessment" for intimate partner violence.

The Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Risk Assessment is a clinical tool used to evaluate the risk of violence in intimate relationships. This calculator is applicable to individuals who are currently in or have recently left an intimate relationship, and it is particularly useful in healthcare settings, social services, and legal contexts. The IPV Risk Assessment helps clinicians and other professionals identify individuals who may be at risk of experiencing violence from their intimate partners. It assesses various factors such as history of violence, threats, stalking, and controlling behavior, among others. This tool is not suitable for use in non-intimate relationships or for assessing risk of violence from non-partners. It should also not be used as the sole determinant of risk, but rather as part of a comprehensive assessment.

The intimate partner violence risk assessment tool is designed to evaluate the likelihood of severe assault based on five critical questions about an individual's experiences with their partner. Each question corresponds to an aspect of violent or threatening behavior, and the answers are provided in a true or false format.

When using this assessment, responses to each question are converted into a numerical score:

- True (Yes) = 1 point
- False (No) = 0 points

The questions cover the following concerns:

1. Has the physical violence increased in frequency or severity over the past 6 months?
2. Has he ever used a weapon or threatened you with a weapon?
3. Do you believe he is capable of killing you?
4. Have you ever been beaten by him while you were pregnant?
5. Is he violently and constantly jealous of you?

Each affirmative response contributes one point to the total score, allowing for a maximum score of 5.

The total score derived from these responses reflects the assessed risk of severe assault:

- A score between 0 and 2 signifies a low risk of severe assault by an intimate partner.
- A score of 3 or higher indicates a high risk of severe assault.

This calculation method systematically evaluates each individual's situation, providing a clear and concise assessment of potential danger in their relationship.

Histoplasmosis testing recommendations and implementation—directive statements and use cases are as follows: “We recommend the use of the Histoplasma antigen in urine or serum for rapid diagnosis of suspected disseminated and acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, in which timely diagnosis and treatment are paramount to outcome (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).” Technical remark notes that “the urine and serum antigen testing results were comparable… we would not limit the testing to either sample source. Therefore, we prefer to use urine or serum. To date, there are no convincing data for combining both.” Additionally, “We suggest the use of Histoplasma serologies in immunocompetent patients with suspected pulmonary histoplasmosis. Adding Histoplasma antigen to serological testing might improve the diagnostic yield (conditional recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).” Antigen testing “appears to be most useful in patients with high fungal burden (i.e., those with disseminated or acute pulmonary histoplasmosis), in whom antibody detection is not as reliable… and those unable to mount an antibody response due to immunosuppression,” and “Combining antibody and antigen testing further improves the diagnostic yield in pulmonary histoplasmosis.” Beyond urine and serum, “Histoplasma antigen can be detected in cerebrospinal fluid… and in BAL.” Using antigen testing in an endemic setting, “In a hypothetical population of 1,000… with a prevalence of 10%,” results would be “81 true-positive… 19 false-negative… 885 true-negative… and 15 false-positive,” with “a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 98%”; in an outbreak with prevalence “as high as 25%,” yields would be “204 true positives, 46 false negatives, 13 false positives,” and “a positive predictive value of 94% and a negative predictive value of 94%.”

### Overcoming phase 1 delays: the critical component of obstetric fistula prevention programs in resource-poor countries [^48461a44]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

How long should a normal labor last?

The formation of an obstetric fistula is a problem that originates during prolonged labor when that labor is obstructed. The critical problem in the first phase of delay is recognizing that labor is prolonged. By WHO standards, labor is prolonged if it lasts more than 24 hours and there is an old adage in tropical obstetrics that “the sun should not rise twice on a laboring woman.” If a woman is laboring under the supervision of a skilled birth attendant, the diagnosis of prolonged/obstructed labor should not be difficult to make, but in parts of the world where fistulas are common, most women deliver by themselves, in the company of family members, or using other forms of traditional birth assistance. Under these circumstances, what is regarded as the “normal” length of labor may be quite different from accepted obstetrical norms. For example, The Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network in West Africa found that in Bo, Sierra Leone, and in the Nigerian cities of Sokoto and Zaria, prolonged labor was not considered a problem of sufficient importance to seek medical care until two to five days had elapsed. As Douglas and Wildavsky have pointed out, “risk” is constructed differently in every culture, based on local perceptions and values, and “substantial disagreement remains over what is risky, how risky it is, and what to do about it”, (p 1). The concepts of “risk” and “blame” are deeply anchored in local cultural constructs and underlying assumptions about the nature of the world. Determining when labor is actually prolonged depends very much upon local notions of what the “normal” length of labor might be. Anthropologists are only just beginning to investigate cross-cultural notions of time in relation to pregnancy, labor and delivery—concepts which are critical to obstetric fistula prevention. Added to the problem of determining the “normal” length of labor is the difficulty of distinguishing “false” labor (irregular uterine contractions that may mimick labor but which do not produce cervical change) from “true” labor (uterine contractions of sufficient force, duration, and frequency to produce effacement and dilatation of the cervix)—a diagnosis that is difficult to make without performing serial cervical examinations. Distinguishing labor that is prolonged due to ineffective uterine contractions from labor that is truly obstructed, also takes obstetrical experience. Tracking the progress of labor with a partograph (a simple graphic depiction of the progress of labor) is extremely effective in determining when labor is prolonged. Intensive and ongoing community education programs that emphasize the importance of seeking skilled care if labor lasts more than 24 hours are likely to be fundamental in altering traditional attitudes about the “normal” length of labor.

### Recommendations on fecal immunochemical testing to screen for colorectal neoplasia: a consensus statement by the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^cb2b9180]. Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Comparative effectiveness—gFOBT vs FIT: Across designs, findings indicate that FIT is superior to gFOBT in sensitivity for detecting CRC and advanced neoplasia, with comparable or only slightly reduced specificity; a meta-analysis showed superiority for detection of cancer (relative risk [RR], 1.96; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2) and advanced neoplasia (RR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.68–3.10). In a German study equalizing positivity rates, the sensitivity of FIT for CRC was 2 times higher than gFOBT (FIT sensitivity, 73.3%; gFOBT sensitivity, 33.3%), with similar specificities (>95%). In a French program, 1-sample OC-Sensor (30 µg/g cut-off) had a true-positive detection rate for advanced neoplasia nearly twice that of Hemoccult II (9.7% vs 4.2%) at the same false-positive rate.

### Different patient versus provider perspectives on living with Cushing's disease [^da7247db]. Pituitary (2024). Medium credibility.

Study procedures

Through anonymous pre-program surveys distributed at the 2020 and 2022 symposia, patients and HCPs answered questions related to their own sense, or perception of their patients’ sense, of hope, choice, and loneliness in the context of living with CD. This survey was developed by a multidisciplinary team and has been reported previously. Demographic and clinical information was also assessed including year of diagnosis, prior treatments, and current medications (for patients) and specialty and practice type (for providers), as shown in Tables 1 and 2. Multiple-choice questions assessing patients’ attitudes toward their disease included possible answers of ‘I have no hope for improvement,’ ‘I have some hope for improvement,’ and ‘I have a lot of hope for improvement;’ and ‘I have no choice in my treatment,’ ‘I have some choices in my treatment,’ and ‘I have many choices in my treatment.’ Patients were also asked to respond ‘TRUE’ or ‘FALSE’ to the following statements: ‘I feel alone living with my Cushing’s,’ ‘Hearing the journeys of other patients helps me better understand my own,’ and ‘I feel anxious about my Cushing’s diagnosis.’

### 2021 the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert consensus document: surgical treatment of acute type A aortic dissection [^71f88047]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Branch vessel obstruction in aortic dissection—static versus dynamic: Aortic dissection can obstruct the branch vessel by either static or dynamic obstruction, where in static obstruction the pressurized false lumen circumferentially narrows the branch vessel to the point of complete obstruction and distal thrombosis, and in dynamic obstruction the pressurized false lumen intermittently displaces the mobile dissection flap over the orifice of the branch vessel. Although dynamic obstruction can be relieved by proximal aortic repair and restoration of true lumen flow, static obstruction may not because of resulting thrombosis.

### Scale-free networks are rare [^fc0b79f3]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Parameters for defining scale-free network

Threshold parameters for the primary evaluation criteria were selected to balance false positive and false negative rates, and to provide a consistent evaluation of evidence independent of the associated graph properties or source of data. For the Super-Weak and Weakest categories, a threshold of 50% ensures that the given property is present in a majority of simple graphs associated with a network data set. For the Weak category, a threshold of at least 50 nodes covered by the best-fitting power law in the upper tail follows standard practicesto reduce the likelihood of false positive errors due to low statistical power. For the Strong category,covers the full parameter range for which scale-free distributions have an infinite second moment but a finite first moment. For the Strongest category, the thresholds of 90% for the goodness-of-fit test and 95% for likelihood ratio tests against alternatives match the expected error rates for both tests under the null hypothesis. If every graph associated with a network data set is scale free, the goodness-of-fit test is expected to incorrectly reject the power-law model 0.1 of the time, and the likelihood ratio test will falsely favor the alternative 0.05 of the time. In the “most permissive” parameterization of the scheme (see Supplementary Note 5), we relax the threshold requirements so that if at least one graph meets the given criteria, the network is placed in this category. In this permissive parameterization, a directed network with a power-law distribution in the in-degrees should be and is classified as Strongest.

For specific networks, domain knowledge may suggest that some degree sequences are potentially scale free while others are likely not. A non-uniform weighting scheme on the set of associated degree sequences would allow such prior knowledge to be incorporated in a Bayesian fashion. However, no fixed non-uniform scheme can apply universally correctly to networks as different as, for example, directed trade networks, directed social networks, and directed biological networks. To provide a consistent treatment across all networks, regardless of their properties or source, we employ an uninformative (uniform) prior, which assigns equal weight to each associated degree sequence. In future work on specific subgroups of networks, a domain-specific weight scheme could be used with the evaluation criteria described here.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^b21ea9cd]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for contact dermatitis, more specifically with respect to patch testing, interpreting results, AAAAI/ACAAI 2015 guidelines recommend to recognize that a possible false-positive reaction can result because of the following reasons:

- using irritants or allergic substances at potentially irritating higher concentrations

- pressure reaction from the filling chamber

- "angry back syndrome"

- testing on skin with active dermatitis.
