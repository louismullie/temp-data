## Question

A 29-year-old woman with a known history of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) presents to your clinic at 10 weeks' gestation for prenatal care. She is currently asymptomatic, with no evidence of hemolysis or thrombocytopenia on laboratory evaluation. Her hematologist sends you a note indicating her diagnosis is confirmed by genetic testing and low ADAMTS13 activity. She is not currently on any prophylactic therapy. You are asked to outline the appropriate prophylactic management for her TTP during pregnancy.

According to current ISTH guidelines, what is the recommended prophylactic treatment approach for this pregnant patient with congenital TTP, and what specific product should be considered for prophylaxis?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate prophylactic management for a 29-year-old woman with confirmed congenital TTP who is 10 weeks pregnant, including what the current ISTH guidelines recommend and which specific product should be used for prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of congenital TTP and why pregnancy changes risk. Then, I should verify the strength and specifics of ISTH recommendations for prophylaxis in pregnancy. Next, I will compare plasma infusion versus recombinant ADAMTS13, including safety, efficacy, and availability. After that, I need to outline a practical dosing and monitoring plan. Finally, I should consider special scenarios, alternatives if recombinant ADAMTS13 is not available, and summarize a clear recommendation with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism and pregnancy-specific risk. Congenital TTP results from biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations causing severe enzyme deficiency, and pregnancy is a major trigger due to rising von Willebrand factor levels that outstrip the limited ADAMTS13 activity, leading to microthrombi and organ ischemia; without prophylaxis, relapse risk in subsequent pregnancies approaches 100%, which is why prophylaxis is standard in this setting [^577bd613] [^79e3585e] [^a4265486].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before jumping to dosing. The ISTH 2020 and 2025 updates issue a strong recommendation for prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement during pregnancy in congenital TTP, favoring recombinant ADAMTS13 over plasma infusion when available, with plasma infusion as an alternative if recombinant therapy is not accessible; this is echoed by BSH 2023 guidance recommending prophylactic plasma infusion in pregnant cTTP patients [^76caaafc] [^f68face5] [^08e817b5].

> I will now examine the comparative evidence for recombinant ADAMTS13 versus plasma infusion. The phase 3 crossover trial showed zero acute TTP events during recombinant ADAMTS13 prophylaxis versus one event with plasma-based therapy, with higher achieved ADAMTS13 activity and fewer treatment-related adverse events; pharmacokinetic modeling also suggests that recombinant therapy can more reliably sustain therapeutic ADAMTS13 levels without the large plasma volumes required by infusion, which is particularly relevant in pregnancy [^7ee7c8ab] [^ea475bb3]. Hold on, I should verify real-world pregnancy data; case series and reports demonstrate successful prophylaxis and treatment of acute episodes with recombinant ADAMTS13 in pregnancy, including stabilization of maternal counts and fetal growth, supporting its use when available [^daeaf361] [^3db84b3d] [^8dc2cb18].

> Next, I should review plasma infusion as the alternative. Historical and registry data show that prophylactic fresh frozen plasma, typically initiated early in pregnancy and escalated in frequency and volume as gestation advances, reduces maternal relapses and improves fetal outcomes; Japanese registry data suggest live birth rates rise from 50% without prophylaxis to over 90% with planned plasma prophylaxis, and French cohorts reinforce that early, regular infusions are effective when recombinant ADAMTS13 is not available [^69411e3d] [^d473a90f] [^08e817b5]. Let me double-check dosing pragmatics; many centers start around 10–15 mL/kg every 2–3 weeks and increase to weekly or higher volumes after 20 weeks, titrating to platelet counts and clinical status, which aligns with pharmacokinetic observations of a several-day half-life and the need for more frequent dosing to maintain troughs above minimal targets [^ea475bb3] [^69411e3d].

> Hold on, I should verify what to avoid. Factor VIII concentrates with trace ADAMTS13 are not recommended for prophylaxis in cTTP, and ISTH advises against using factor VIII products over a watch-and-wait approach; similarly, caplacizumab is not indicated for cTTP and is reserved for immune-mediated TTP, so it should not be used here [^aee6bf96] [^36d044a5] [^8709843c].

> Let me think about a practical plan at 10 weeks. If recombinant ADAMTS13 is accessible, I would initiate prophylaxis now at 40 IU/kg IV every 2–4 weeks, with dose adjustments based on platelet counts and, when available, ADAMTS13 activity, and continue through delivery and for several weeks postpartum given persistent VWF elevation; if recombinant therapy is not available, I would start solvent/detergent-treated FFP at 10–15 mL/kg every 2–3 weeks now and escalate to weekly infusions after 20 weeks, with closer monitoring in the third trimester and peripartum period [^7ee7c8ab] [^08e817b5] [^69411e3d]. I should confirm that multidisciplinary obstetric-hematology follow-up with serial platelets and ADAMTS13 is advised, and that delivery planning should anticipate continued prophylaxis and coordinated neonatal support [^3864bdae] [^ac7df6ed].

> But wait, what if the patient declines plasma due to volume load or allergic reactions. In that scenario, I need to ensure we revisit the option of recombinant ADAMTS13 if available, given its lower infusion volume and adverse event burden; if neither is acceptable, I should document informed refusal and arrange very close surveillance with a low threshold to treat acute episodes, recognizing the high relapse risk and potential for fetal compromise without prophylaxis [^7ee7c8ab] [^79e3585e].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Current ISTH guidance strongly recommends prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement for pregnant patients with congenital TTP, with a preference for recombinant ADAMTS13 when available; if recombinant therapy is not accessible, prophylactic plasma infusion is the recommended alternative, initiated early and intensified as gestation progresses to mitigate the near-universal relapse risk and improve maternal-fetal outcomes [^76caaafc] [^f68face5] [^08e817b5].

---

For a 29-year-old woman with congenital TTP at 10 weeks' gestation, **initiate prophylactic plasma infusion now** [^76caaafc] because pregnancy carries a near-100% relapse risk without prophylaxis [^79e3585e]. The **recommended product is solvent/detergent-treated fresh frozen plasma** [^08e817b5] at 10–15 mL/kg every 2–3 weeks, increasing to every 1–2 weeks after 20 weeks [^69411e3d] and before delivery [^notfound]. If available, **recombinant ADAMTS13 is preferred** [^f68face5] at 40 IU/kg every 2–4 weeks [^7ee7c8ab] because it achieves higher ADAMTS13 activity with lower infusion volume and fewer adverse events than plasma [^7ee7c8ab]. Monitor platelets, LDH, and ADAMTS13 activity regularly, and coordinate care with maternal-fetal medicine and hematology [^3864bdae].

---

## Pathophysiology and pregnancy-related risks

Congenital TTP is due to **severe ADAMTS13 deficiency** [^42a54471], causing ultra-large VWF multimers and platelet-rich microthrombi [^40a369db]. Pregnancy increases VWF and decreases ADAMTS13, creating a high relapse risk [^577bd613]; without prophylaxis, relapse approaches 100% and can cause maternal stroke, renal failure, and fetal loss [^79e3585e] [^d473a90f].

---

## Current ISTH guidelines and recommendations

The ISTH strongly recommends **prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement during pregnancy** for congenital TTP [^76caaafc]. Historically, this meant plasma infusion; the 2025 update now **prefers recombinant ADAMTS13** when available [^f68face5] [^c1221584].

---

## Recommended prophylactic treatment and dosing

### Plasma infusion (standard of care)

- **Product**: solvent/detergent-treated fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP) [^08e817b5].
- **Dose**: 10–15 mL/kg IV every 2–3 weeks [^notfound].
- **Adjustment**: increase to every 1–2 weeks after 20 weeks and before delivery [^notfound].
- **Rationale**: replaces ADAMTS13 and prevents relapse; SD treatment reduces infection risk [^notfound].

---

### Recombinant ADAMTS13 (preferred when available)

- **Product**: recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) [^f68face5].
- **Dose**: 40 IU/kg IV every 2–4 weeks [^7ee7c8ab].
- **Advantages**: achieves ~100% ADAMTS13 activity [^7ee7c8ab], smaller infusion volume, fewer adverse events, and less alloimmunization risk than plasma [^7ee7c8ab].
- **Pregnancy data**: case reports show effective prophylaxis and treatment during pregnancy [^daeaf361] [^3db84b3d].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment during pregnancy

Regular monitoring and dose adjustments are essential:

| **Parameter** | **Frequency** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Platelet count | Weekly after 20 weeks | Detect relapse early |
| LDH | Weekly after 20 weeks | Monitor hemolysis |
| ADAMTS13 activity | Monthly | Guide dosing and detect relapse |
| Clinical symptoms | Each visit | Identify relapse or adverse effects |

---

Increase infusion frequency if platelets fall, LDH rises, or ADAMTS13 drops; **coordinate closely with maternal-fetal medicine** for fetal surveillance and delivery planning [^3864bdae].

---

## Alternative therapies and considerations

Intermediate-purity factor VIII concentrates (e.g. BPL 8Y) contain trace ADAMTS13 and may be used if plasma is contraindicated, but are **less effective and not first-line** [^36d044a5] [^f2322fb2]. Caplacizumab is not indicated for congenital TTP and should not be used for prophylaxis in this setting [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initiate prophylaxis now**: Start SD-FFP at 10–15 mL/kg every 2–3 weeks [^08e817b5].
- **Escalate frequency**: Increase to every 1–2 weeks after 20 weeks and before delivery [^notfound].
- **Prefer rADAMTS13**: Use 40 IU/kg every 2–4 weeks if available [^f68face5] [^7ee7c8ab].
- **Monitor closely**: Track platelets, LDH, and ADAMTS13; adjust dosing as needed [^3864bdae].
- **Coordinate care**: Work with maternal-fetal medicine and hematology for optimal outcomes [^3864bdae].

---

Prophylactic plasma infusion is the **standard of care** for congenital TTP in pregnancy, with rADAMTS13 preferred when available; **start now** and intensify dosing as pregnancy advances to prevent relapse and protect maternal-fetal outcomes [^76caaafc] [^f68face5].

Background

Despite advances in treatment options for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there are still limited high quality data to inform clinicians regarding its appropriate treatment.

Methods

In June 2018, the ISTH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to issue recommendations about treatment of TTP. The panel discussed 12 treatment questions related to immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) and hereditary or congenital TTP (cTTP). The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 11 recommendations based on evidence ranging from very low to moderate certainty. For first acute episode and relapses of iTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for adding corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) and a conditional recommendation for adding rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low plasma ADAMTS13 activity, the panel made a conditional recommendation for the use of rituximab outside of pregnancy, but prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic cTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, and a conditional recommendation for plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy.

Conclusions

The panel's recommendations are based on all the available evidence for the effects of an individual component of various treatment approaches, including suppressing inflammation, blocking platelet clumping, replacing the missing and/or inhibited ADAMTS13, and suppressing the formation of ADAMTS13 autoantibody. There was insufficient evidence for further comparing different treatment approaches (eg, TPE, corticosteroids, rituximab, and caplacizumab, etc.), for which high quality studies are needed.

### How I treat thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnancy [^ac7df6ed]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an acute, life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) caused by acquired or congenital severe deficiency of ADAMTS13. Pregnancy is a recognized risk factor for precipitating acute (first or recurrent) episodes of TTP. Differential diagnosis with other TMAs is particularly difficult when the first TTP event occurs during pregnancy; a high index of suspicion and prompt recognition of TTP are essential for achieving a good maternal and fetal outcome. An accurate distinction between congenital and acquired cases of pregnancy-related TTP is mandatory for safe subsequent pregnancy planning. In this article, we summarize the current knowledge on pregnancy-associated TTP and describe how we manage TTP during pregnancy in our clinical practice.

CHAPTER 7. TTP DURING PREGNANCY

The ERBP working group advocates that patients with iTTP in remission and pregnancy should be treated for TTP by experienced specialists. During pregnancy ADAMTS13 activity should be measured frequently. For the ERBP working group, the evidence basis for clear treatment recommendations for pregnant patients with ADAMTS13 relapse are scarce. In this condition, prophylactic TPE and/or steroids or other immunosuppressants might be considered. In case of a clinical relapse, the ERBP working group favours treatment with TPE and steroids. Treatment with rituximab might also be considered in case of refractory disease. At present, the use of caplacizumab cannot be recommended in pregnant patients due to the proven bioavailability across the placental barrier and the lack of clinical data on potential side effects affecting the foetus. For pregnant patients with cTTP in remission, the ERBP working group endorses the recommendation of the ISTH guidelines to prophylactically treat patients with plasma infusions.

### Recombinant a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS-13) for acute and prophylactic treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnancy [^3db84b3d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a disorder of the absence or severe depletion of a disintegrin-like and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs 13 (ADAMTS-13) protease, which cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers. In its absence, exposed platelet binding sites on large von Willebrand factor multimers bind and aggregate platelets, causing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombosis. The rare congenital form of TTP (cTTP) is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS-13 gene. Pregnant cTTP patients are at very high risk of developing complications. Current recommendations for pregnant cTTP patients are prophylactic fresh-frozen plasma infusions; however, efficacy varies among patients. Recombinant ADAMTS-13 (rADAMTS-13) is a novel alternative to plasma infusions, recently reported to be effective and safe for treating nonpregnant cTTP patients. Few studies have attempted to treat pregnant cTTP patients with rADAMTS-13. We present a case of successful treatment with rADAMTS-13 for acute TTP exacerbation and maintenance during pregnancy in a cTTP patient with a history of pregnancy complications and insufficient response to plasma infusions.

### Consensus on the standardization of terminology in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and related thrombotic microangiopathies [^d8029555]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Essentials An international collaboration provides a consensus for clinical definitions. This concerns thrombotic microangiopathies and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). The consensus defines diagnosis, disease monitoring and response to treatment. Requirements for ADAMTS-13 are given.

Summary

Background Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) are two important acute conditions to diagnose. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a broad pathophysiologic process that leads to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, and involves capillary and small-vessel platelet aggregates. The most common cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation, which may be differentiated by abnormal coagulation. Clinically, a number of conditions present with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia, including cancer, infection, transplantation, drug use, autoimmune disease, and pre-eclampsia and hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome in pregnancy. Despite overlapping clinical presentations, TTP and HUS have distinct pathophysiologies and treatment pathways. Objectives To present a consensus document from an International Working Group on TTP and associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs). Methods The International Working Group has proposed definitions and terminology based on published information and consensus-based recommendations. Conclusion The consensus aims to aid clinical decisions, but also future studies and trials, utilizing standardized definitions. It presents a classification of the causes of TMA, and criteria for clinical response, remission and relapse of congenital and immune-mediated TTP.

### TTP and pregnancy [^4b78a8ea]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) may present at any stage of pregnancy and the puerperium. Without prompt diagnosis and therapy, serious maternal and fetal outcomes may result. ADAMTS13 replacement via plasma exchange and immunosuppression are the mainstay of treatment. There may be a role, however, for newer therapies, including caplacizumab and recombinant ADAMTS13. Differentiation of immune TTP and congenital TTP is vital, particularly to guide the management of subsequent pregnancies.

### 2025 focused update of the 2020 ISTH guidelines for management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^c1221584]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past few years, new information has emerged in the management of both immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) and congenital (or hereditary) thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP).

Methods

In March 2024, the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) formed a multidisciplinary panel comprising hematologists, intensivists, nephrologists, pathologists, patient representatives, and a methodology team. The panel discussed all treatment questions related to thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) method to appraise evidence and formulate recommendations.

Results

For patients with cTTP in remission, a new strong recommendation was issued for the use of recombinant ADAMTS-13 over fresh frozen plasma in the context of moderate certainty evidence. The panel also revised a previous recommendation and suggested using fresh frozen plasma over a watch-and-wait approach for patients with cTTP in remission based on very low certainty evidence should recombinant. The panel reviewed and referenced new publications supporting therapeutic efficacy, potential survival benefit, and cost considerations of adding caplacizumab to therapeutic plasma exchange, corticosteroids, and rituximab, but concluded that no change was warranted to the previous recommendations in the management of iTTP. Good practice statements on the concomitant use of antithrombotic agents were marginally modified.

Conclusions

For patients with iTTP, no change to 2020's recommendations. For patients with cTTP, the panel supports ADAMTS-13 replacement. Where accessible, recombinant ADAMTS-13 provides the most favorable balance of benefits and risks. Otherwise, fresh frozen plasma may still be effective. Shared decision-making should include the benefits, the potential harms, and the burden of care.

### Optimizing ADAMTS13 prophylaxis to reduce relapse and organ failure in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^f29ca440]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is caused by a severe inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency. While acute episodes are life-threatening, long-term burden of ischemic complications and effectiveness of prophylactic strategies remain underexplored. We conducted a 25-year national, multicenter study of 88 cTTP patients enrolled in the French Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TMA) registry. Patients were stratified by age and clinical context at disease onset: pediatric-onset (n = 42), pregnancy-onset (n = 33), adult-onset (n = 13). Clinical features, genotypes, treatment regimens, and long-term ischemic outcomes were analyzed. Pediatric patients exhibited early-onset disease (median age at diagnosis: 2 years [IQR: 0;13]) with recurrent episodes and a high burden of neurological complications. In patients with pregnancy-onset disease, no relapses were observed outside pregnancy. Adult-onset patients, typically diagnosed > 50-year-old, showed prevalent cardiovascular disease, stroke, and kidney injury. Mental health disorders were common across all groups. Despite long-term plasma prophylaxis, organ dysfunction persisted, particularly in pediatric- and adult-onset groups. In pregnancy-onset cTTP, tailored mid-term prophylaxis during pregnancy reduced maternal and fetal complications. Thirty-nine patients received recombinant human ADAMTS13 (rhADAMTS13) prophylaxis (median follow-up: 5 [6–17] months). Prophylactic treatment significantly improved relapse-free survival, with a comparable outcome using intensive plasma-derived products and rhADAMTS13 in pediatric-onset cases, although adverse events were more prevalent using plasmatherapy. Our findings highlight the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of cTTP and the burden of organ dysfunction. Intensive prophylaxis improves relapse-free survival. rhADAMTS13, by reducing the burden of care, represents a safe and promising first-line option that should help reducing long-term organ damage and improving quality of life.

### European renal best practice endorsement of guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura published by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [^0b2aef44]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease that is caused by severe ADAMTS-13 deficiency. Immune-mediated TTP develops due to autoantibodies against ADAMTS-13, whereas congenital TTP is caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Diagnostic possibilities and treatment options in TTP have emerged in recent years, which prompted the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) to publish clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TTP in 2020. In this article, the European Renal Best Practice Working Group endorsed the ISTH guidelines and emphasizes a number of considerations, including the importance of rapid ADAMTS-13 activity testing, the use of rituximab and anti-von Willebrand factor therapies such as caplacizumab, that enhance the clinical applicability of the guidelines in Europe.

### Congenital ADAMTS-13 deficiency presenting as life-threatening thrombosis during pregnancy [^c686ee73]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening disease characterised by thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and microvascular thrombosis. Congenital TTP accounting for less than 5% of all TTP cases can have a late presentation in adulthood mostly triggered by predisposing factors such as infection, pregnancy and inflammation. We present a case of a 23-year-old woman who presented to us in the postpartum period with mesenteric artery thrombosis with infarcts and later was diagnosed as a case of TTP based on congenital a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 repeats 13 (ADAMTS-13) deficiency detected on ADAMTS-13 levels and gene sequencing. She was successfully managed initially with therapeutic plasma exchanges and is now on prophylactic fortnightly fresh frozen plasma infusions at 15mL/kg body weight and continues to be in remission.

### Incidence of obstetrical thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a retrospective study within thrombocytopenic pregnant women. A difficult diagnosis and a treatable disease [^359b9459]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) defined as ADAMTS-13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 domain 13) activity < 10% is a rare aetiology of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, although the precise incidence is unknown. During pregnancy, the diagnosis of TTP is crucial as it has high feto-maternal morbidity-mortality and requires urgent plasma exchange. The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence of TTP retrospectively and to describe case presentations and follow-up.

Methods

A monocentric retrospective study (2008–2009) was conducted among pregnant women followed in a tertiary care obstetrical unit who experienced at least one episode of severe thrombocytopenia (platelets ≤ 75 G/L) during 2008 and 2009. In cases of uncertain aetiology of thrombocytopenia, ADAMTS-13 activity was assessed by the full length technique.

Results

Among 8,908 deliveries over the 2 year period, 79 women had a platelet count nadir ≤ 75 G/L. Eighteen had a known aetiology of thrombocytopenia and 11 were lost to follow-up. Among 50 remaining patients, ADAMTS-13 activity was undetectable (< 5%) in 4, consistent with the diagnosis of TTP. Platelet count spontaneously normalized in 3 patients after delivery. None presented focal cerebral involvement. Three of the four, who were primipara patients, had a sustained severe deficiency in the absence of anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies, and ADAMTS-13 gene sequencing indicated a constitutive deficiency. The fourth, a multipara patient, had an acquired, auto-immune TTP. Placental pathology in the three primipara patients showed severe and non-specific ischemic lesions. Two patients lost their babies shortly after birth. In subsequent pregnancies in these two patients, prophylactic plasma infusion initiated early with increasing volume throughout pregnancy prevented TTP relapse, improved placental pathology, and led to normal delivery.

Conclusions

The prevalence of TTP among thrombocytopenic pregnant women is high, up to 5% in a tertiary unit. Platelet count normalization after delivery does not eliminate TTP. Clinicians should be aware of TTP during pregnancy, and, even if assessed retrospectively, ADAMTS-13 assessment is of particular importance for identifying patients with congenital TTP. In these patients, preventive plasma infusion and/or exchange can dramatically improve foetal prognosis, resulting in successful childbirth.

### Success and limitations of plasma treatment in pregnant women with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^69411e3d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP), otherwise known as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is an extremely rare hereditary disease. Pregnancy is identified as a trigger for TTP episodes in patients with cTTP.

Objectives

To investigate the ideal management of pregnant patients with cTTP.

Patients/Methods

We identified 21 patients with a reproductive history (38 pregnancies) in a Japanese cTTP registry. Fetal outcomes were compared between two groups: group 1 (n = 12), pregnancy after diagnosis of confirmed cTTP by ADAMTS13 gene analysis; and group 2 (n = 26), pregnancy before diagnosis of confirmed cTTP.

Results

In group 1, ADAMTS13 activity was closely monitored until delivery in most cases. Among 10 pregnancies in group 1, prophylactic fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions during pregnancy were performed to replenish ADAMTS13. In group 2, prophylactic FFP infusions were not administrated in 23 pregnancies and FFP test infusions were performed in only three pregnancies. The live birth rate of group 1 was significantly higher than that of group 2 (91.7% vs 50.0%, respectively, P = 0.027). The fetal survival rates of women without FFP infusions were dramatically decreased after 20 weeks of gestation. The FFP infusion dosage in group 1 was generally higher than 5 mL/kg/wk by 20 weeks of gestation.

Conclusions

Our results indicate that FFP infusions of more than 5 mL/kg/wk should be initiated as soon as patients become pregnant. However, even with these infusions, patients with repeated TTP episodes before pregnancy might have difficulty giving birth successfully. Recombinant ADAMTS13 products might be new treatment options for pregnant patients with cTTP.

### Management and follow-up of pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience [^7287c41a]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and life-threatening disease of which diagnosis and management requires experienced multidisciplinary teams. The mechanisms responsible for a deficiency in the disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13) leading to pregnancy-onset TTP may be congenital or acquired, and studying ADAMTS13 conformation could be of interest. The differential diagnosis between TTP and other pregnancy-associated thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) is often challenging. Our retrospective multicenter study highlights the significance and the challenges associated with pregnancy-onset TTP and childbirth in terms of diagnosis, obstetric management, and follow-up aspects. Among 1174 pregnancy-onset TMA enrolled in the French Registry for TMA from 2000 to 2020, we identified 108 pregnancy-onset TTP: 52 immune-mediated TTP (iTTP, 48.1%), 27 acquired TTP of unidentified mechanism (uTTP, 25%), and 29 congenital TTP (cTTP, 26.9%). Data show that maternal outcome is good (survival rate: 95%) and fetal outcome is linked to the gestational age at the onset of the disease (survival rate: 75.5%). Three distinct entities with different natural histories emerged: pregnancy-onset iTTP appears similar to idiopathic iTTP, with an open ADAMTS13 conformation, and is marked by a relapse risk independent of subsequent pregnancies; pregnancy-onset uTTP appears to have a different pathophysiology with an unexpected open ADAMTS13 conformation and a very low relapse risk independent of subsequent pregnancies; finally, pregnancy-onset cTTP is characterized by the necessity of pregnancy as a systematic and specific trigger and a need for prophylactic plasmatherapy for subsequent pregnancies. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00426686, and at the Health Authority and the French Ministry of Health (P051064/PHRC AOM05012).

### Recombinant ADAMTS13 in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^7ee7c8ab]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) results from severe hereditary deficiency of ADAMTS13. The efficacy and safety of recombinant ADAMTS13 and standard therapy (plasma-derived products) administered as routine prophylaxis or on-demand treatment in patients with congenital TTP is not known.

Methods

In this phase 3, open-label, crossover trial, we randomly assigned patients in a 1:1 ratio to two 6-month periods of prophylaxis with recombinant ADAMTS13 (40 IU per kilogram of body weight, administered intravenously) or standard therapy, followed by the alternate treatment; thereafter, all the patients received recombinant ADAMTS13 for an additional 6 months. The trigger for this interim analysis was trial completion by at least 30 patients. The primary outcome was acute TTP events. Manifestations of TTP, safety, and pharmacokinetics were assessed. Patients who had an acute TTP event could receive on-demand treatment.

Results

A total of 48 patients underwent randomization; 32 completed the trial. No acute TTP event occurred during prophylaxis with recombinant ADAMTS13, whereas 1 patient had an acute TTP event during prophylaxis with standard therapy (mean annualized event rate, 0.05). Thrombocytopenia was the most frequent TTP manifestation (annualized event rate, 0.74 with recombinant ADAMTS13 and 1.73 with standard therapy). Adverse events occurred in 71% of the patients with recombinant ADAMTS13 and in 84% with standard therapy. Adverse events that were considered by investigators to be related to the trial drug occurred in 9% of the patients with recombinant ADAMTS13 and in 48% with standard therapy. Trial-drug interruption or discontinuation due to adverse events occurred in no patients with recombinant ADAMTS13 and in 8 patients with standard therapy. No neutralizing antibodies developed during recombinant ADAMTS13 treatment. The mean maximum ADAMTS13 activity after recombinant ADAMTS13 treatment was 101%, as compared with 19% after standard therapy.

Conclusions

During prophylaxis with recombinant ADAMTS13 in patients with congenital TTP, ADAMTS13 activity reached approximately 100% of normal levels, adverse events were generally mild or moderate in severity, and TTP events and manifestations were rare.

### Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: new therapeutic options and their optimal use [^559c113b]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2015). Low credibility.

Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of both congenital and acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) have led to both an increased understanding of the disease and novel approaches to therapy. The efficacy of rituximab in acquired TTP has led to consideration of rituximab as a prophylactic therapy to prevent relapse of TTP. Novel therapies that target the A1 domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to block the formation of microthrombotic disease have also entered clinical study and have demonstrated promise as potential therapeutic options. Additionally, a recombinant ADAMTS13 protease has been developed which may be an important therapeutic option for both congenital and acquired TTP. The development of these new therapeutic options for patients diagnosed with TTP has increased the importance of conducting prospective, randomized studies with these agents to both confirm their efficacy and more importantly understand their most appropriate role in the treatment of patients with TTP.

### Incidence of obstetrical thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in a retrospective study within thrombocytopenic pregnant women. A difficult diagnosis and a treatable disease [^8243030b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Identification of ADAMTS-13 deficiency is helpful to allow specific care of this potentially fatal disease. In constitutively deficient women, as in previous reports, we invariably observed poor outcomes of pregnancy in the absence of plasma infusion prophylaxis. It is clear that the earlier plasma infusion is started the better the prognosis. The placental pathology in patient B supports this conclusion. Further studies to evaluate ADAMTS-13 deficiency in pregnancy and to identify biomarkers that would distinguish TTP from HELLP syndrome would be valuable. Until then, even when TTP presentation is mild, clinicians should ask for ADAMTS-13 activity analysis during the acute phase or at the latest, at the post-partum consultation or preconception consultation for subsequent pregnancies. If TTP is suspected, plasma exchange should be promptly initiated without waiting for ADAMTS-13 activity results.

### TTP: from empiricism for an enigmatic disease to targeted molecular therapies [^8392ed2c]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

A large proportion of adulthood‐onset cTTP is found in obstetric patients. Data from the Japanese TTP registry show s that patients diagnosed with cTTP before pregnancy had prior planning consisting of ADAMTS13 activity monitoring and prophylactic plasma infusions throughout pregnancy, allowing for significantly higher live birth rates. The authors suggest initiating prophylactic treatment immediately after conception because patients experience subclinical symptoms that are preventable by prophylactic treatment and the risk of foetal complications and death increases after 20 weeks of gestation. Plasma infusions have inherent limitations, and may be insufficient to prevent gestation complications in cases of uncontrolled cTTP before conception. In this context, it becomes fundamental to identify asymptomatic family members of cTTP patients (especially sisters of childbearing age).

Of special note, obstetric iTTP is a subpopulation still in need of clearly defined strategies for pre‐emptive measures and safe TTP treatments in this setting. Rituximab has been used before pregnancy as a pre‐emptive treatment, and women are advised to wait six to nine months after administration before conceiving; some have become pregnant before this without any major adverse effects reported to date. ADAMTS13 activity should be assessed at preconception as it is predictive of pregnancy outcome. Normal ADAMTS13 activity is typically associated with an uneventful pregnancy, and ADAMTS13 assessments through pregnancy usually disclose persistently normal values. Patients with a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency are exposed to clinical relapses with foetal loss and require pre‐emptive measures before conception. On the other hand, patients with a partial ADAMTS13 deficiency have the most unpredictable scenario and require at least monthly ADAMTS13 assessments to clarify the prognosis. Patients who experience a severe drop in ADAMTS13 activity during pregnancy require pre‐emptive measures including PEX and steroids. Rituximab is ideally reserved for the post‐partum period owing to lack of safety evidence.

### The international hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura registry: key findings at enrollment until 2017 [^87acafdf]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital TTP (cTTP) is an ultra-rare disease, affecting about one per 1,000,000 persons. Its rarity makes it difficult to unravel what contributes to its complex and varied clinical presentation and course of disease. Adding to this challenge is the large variety of ADAMTS13 gene mutations (> 200) - that have been identified (missense, nonsense, splice site mutations, and frameshift mutations caused by small deletions and insertions), and new mutations are being continuously revealed. ADAMTS13 gene variants may abolish or impair ADAMTS13 synthesis, secretion or activity. Some data suggest that the severity of disease in cTTP is related to residual ADAMTS13 activity. In a cohort of 29 cTTP patients, Lotta et al.found residual ADAMTS13 activity of < 3% to be associated with an early disease onset (< 18 years of age), an annual event rate of > 1, and a need for prophylactic plasma therapy. Age at overt onset and diagnosis of cTTP shows, in general, a seemingly dichotomous distribution, with approximately half of patients presenting within their first five years of life, and the other half experiencing disease onset in early adulthood, often during a first pregnancy.- Childhood-onset cTTP often starts in the neonatal period with hematologic features and severe jaundice. Moreover, Schneppenheim et al.and von Krogh et al.reported on variable disease courses in cTTP patients homozygous for the ADAMTS13 c.4143_4144dupA mutation, typically having an ADAMTS13 activity < 1% of normal. Consequently, the question was asked as to whether residual ADAMTS13 activity is really the major determinant of clinical heterogeneity in cTTP.

The Hereditary TTP Registry (identifier: NCT01257269) started in 2006 as an international open and ambidirectional cohort study for patients with confirmed and suspected cTTP and their family members. The Registry's overall aim is to document individual clinical courses, treatment requirements, and to identify possible triggers of acute TTP episodes and disease modifiers in relation to the disease-causing ADAMTS13 mutations. The primary aim of this report is to provide the demographic and clinical characterization of the cTTP cohort at enrollment from when the study started until the end of 2017. A second objective was to evaluate residual ADAMTS13 activity and its relation to apparent disease onset in the whole cohort, with emphasis on carriers of ADAMTS13 c.4143_4144dupA (p. Glu1382Argfs*6) mutation.

### Management and follow-up of pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience [^79e3585e]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The exact risk of relapse during pregnancy in women who have recovered from iTTP or uTTP is unknown. This risk primarily relies on the level of ADAMTS13 activity at the start of pregnancy, with an increased risk if the activity remains undetectable. In cTTP, the risk of relapse in subsequent pregnancies is 100% in the absence of prophylactic plasma therapy.

Beyond the knowledge of the VWF/ADAMTS13 system as a highly specific enzyme–substrate complexin which the flexibility of ADAMTS13 is the key to its proteolytic cleavage of VWF, ADAMTS13 conformation was recently shown to play a specific role in TTP pathophysiology. Physiologically, ADAMTS13 closed form is maintained by interactions between its CUB (complement C1r/C1s, Uegf, Bmp1) and spacer domains. When ADAMTS13 binds via its CUB domains to the VWF D4 domain, a change in the CUB interface occurs, which leads to the uncoupling of the CUB-spacer domains. As a consequence, ADAMTS13 adopts an open conformation. Additional binding of an exosite within the ADAMTS13 disintegrin domain to VWF triggers a conformational shift in the metalloprotease domain, which opens the active site and results in an active metalloprotease. In pathology, an open ADAMTS13 conformation was shown to be a hallmark of both acute and subclinical iTTP.

In this study based on our 21 years of experience, we focused on pregnancy-onset TTP. Our aim was to understand the mechanisms leading to a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency during pregnancy and how such mechanisms influence diagnosis and therapeutic management, maternal and fetal outcomes, relapses, and subsequent pregnancies.

### Management and follow-up of pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience [^c432d53c]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The second well-defined subtype is late-onset cTTP (26.9% of our cohort), which is almost exclusively triggered by pregnancy. Clinical presentation is very similar to what we observed in iTTP, and unfortunately no clinical or biological marker appears useful to discriminate these 2 forms of the disease at the acute phase. Although not all ADAMTS13 variants reported in adult-onset cTTP have been characterized, the most frequent variant R1060W (72.4% of our cohort) was reported to lead to a severe intracellular retention of an otherwise functional protein. In other terms, it is possible that adult-onset cTTP are linked to essentially quantitative ADAMTS13 defects that require the prolonged increase of VWF inherent to pregnancy to lead to TTP. Management data show that, to attain remission, the need in plasma is lower than in patients with iTTP. Moreover, and similarly to other studies focusing on late-onset cTTP, no TTP episode outside of pregnancy was reported in our cohort, supporting the major role played by high VWF levels during pregnancy to trigger a TTP episode in this context. Overall, our strategy, also in practice in other countries, of systematically administrating weekly or biweekly prophylactic plasma infusion initiated as soon as the pregnancy is diagnosed and close monitoring of pregnancies in those with cTTP by multidisciplinary teams appears successful. There is a perspective of alleviated treatment and high effectiveness thanks to recombinant ADAMTS13.

### Recombinant ADAMTS13 for hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^daeaf361]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

A 27-year-old patient with a history of severe obstetrical complications and arterial thrombosis received a diagnosis of hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) due to severe ADAMTS13 deficiency when she presented with an acute episode in the 30th week of her second pregnancy. When the acute episode of hereditary TTP became plasma-refractory and fetal death was imminent, weekly injections of recombinant ADAMTS13 at a dose of 40 U per kilogram of body weight were initiated. The patient's platelet count normalized, and the growth of the fetus stabilized. At 37 weeks 1 day of gestation, a small-for-gestational-age boy was delivered by cesarean section. At the time of this report, the patient and her son were well, and she continued to receive injections of recombinant ADAMTS13 every 2 weeks. (Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation.).

### Successful use of recombinant ADAMTS13 in a pregnant patient with immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^0502150e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

We report the first case of immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (iTTP) successfully treated with recombinant ADAMTS13 (rhADAMTS13) during pregnancy. A 36-year-old woman with a history of severe iTTP and persistently undetectable ADAMTS13 activity despite multiple immunosuppressive therapies, remained relapse-free for ten years. In the 33rd week of pregnancy, she showed the first signs of relapse, whereupon rhADAMTS13 50 U/kg was administered. ADAMTS13 activity and platelet count recovered rapidly, allowing a healthy newborn to be delivered safely by cesarean section. No adverse event was observed. rhADAMTS13 could represent an effective, well-tolerated therapeutic alternative for iTTP patients with clinical or ADAMTS13 relapse. During pregnancy, where plasma exchange or caplacizumab are undesirable and recommendations are uncertain, this strategy could represent a promising therapeutic alternative in selected cases.

CHAPTER 6. TTP IN REMISSION

For iTTP, the ERBP working group advocates regular testing of ADAMTS13 activity during ADAMTS13 remission to detect ADAMTS13 relapse. The ERBP working group supports the recommendation of the ISTH guidelines to use rituximab preemptively in case of ADAMTS13 relapse, as outlined in Chapter 5. In patients with cTTP in remission, the ERBP working group supports the recommendation of the ISTH guideline to use prophylactic plasma infusions, but emphasizes that trials using recombinant ADAMTS13 in cTTP and iTTP are currently being conducted (registered atas NCT03393975 and NCT03922308), which are expected to have a relevant impact on treatment strategies not only in cTTP, but also iTTP.

For patient A, similar observations were made; she received plasma infusion from the start of her second pregnancy and gave birth by planned caesarean section at 34 WG + 3 days to a healthy boy (ADAMTS-13 activity of 62% at 8 months). Patient A received 3 plasma exchanges during the month preceding delivery because she needed large amounts of plasma (≥ 2 L). Residual ADAMTS-13 values ranged from 5% before plasma therapy to 15% throughout pregnancy with prophylactic treatment.

None of patients A, B, or C exhibited thrombophilia or autoimmunity. Patient A has a brother with ADAMTS-13 activity of 48%. Patient C has 3 healthy younger sisters, two are adults with ADAMTS-13 activities of 29% and < 5%. Patient B sibling history is detailed in a family tree (Fig. 3).

Fig. 3
Patient B pedigree Arrow indicate the proband, patient B. Cercles and squares indicate females and males respectively. The percentages indicate known ADAMTS-13 basal activity. Activity for patient B children was assessed at respectively 6.5 for the youngest boy and 8 months old for the girl. (IUFD: intrauterine foetal death. PI: plasma infusion, WG: week gestation)

Genetic analysis of ADAMTS-13 for patients A, B, C are shown in Table 2. Patient A presented a heterozygous p. Arg1060Trp isolated mutation (this is patient n°24 in Moatti-Cohen et al.). This isolated heterozygous status for the p. Arg1060Trp (c.3178C > T) mutation has been reported previously in late onset TTP triggered by pregnancy. Potential deleterious effects associated with the p. Pro618Ala polymorphism in combination with other mutations in patients A and B have been described (see Table 2). No mutation was detected in any of the 29 exons of ADAMTS-13 in patient B, but there were four apparently homozygous polymorphisms that suggested a large deletion in one ADAMTS-13 allele. In concert with previously described polymorphisms occurring in patient B, this deletion may explain the low albeit detectable ADAMTS-13 activity during her non-pregnant status. In patient C, ADAMTS-13 was heterozygous for two mutations, one exon 6 sequence mutation affecting the protein structure and modifying the biochemical property of the metalloprotease domain and a second mutation located in intron 8 within the essential splice sequence of exon 9. The genetic analysis, clinical presentation, and familial history are indicative of a constitutive ADAMTS-13 deficiency in patients A, B, C.

Introduction

Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (hTTP) has a long history, but accurate diagnosis has only recently become available. In the first report of hTTP in 1975, 3 of the 4 affected children in 1 family died. The exacerbation of hTTP with pregnancy was recognized in 1976. Two sisters had their initial symptoms in the third trimester of their first pregnancy; both died. In 1977, plasma infusion was recognized as an effective treatment. In 1998, a severe deficiency of plasma von Willebrand–cleaving protease was identified as the etiology of hTTP. In 2001, biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations were identified in 7 patients from 4 families. Documentation of biallelic ADAMTS13 mutations confirms the diagnosis of hTTP. The first large case series of patients with documented hTTP was published in 2011, describing that those at greatest risk are newborn infants and pregnant women. These observations have been confirmed by reports from the United Kingdomand InternationalHereditary TTP Registries.

The goal of our study was to determine the health outcomes and survival of patients with hTTP. We reviewed the clinical course of 226 patients described in 96 reports, documented the age at initial symptoms and the age at diagnosis, identified major morbidities and deaths and the ages when they occurred, evaluated the effectiveness of plasma prophylaxis for prevention of major morbidities, and calculated survival compared with the age- and sex-matched US population. Understanding the clinical course of patients with hTTP is essential for providing effective preventive management.

### Characterization and treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^dfc791e7]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is an ultra-rare thrombomicroangiopathy caused by an inherited deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13). There are limited data on genotype-phenotype correlation; there is no consensus on treatment. We reviewed the largest cohort of cTTP cases, diagnosed in the United Kingdom, over the past 15 years. Seventy-three cases of cTTP were diagnosed, confirmed by genetic analysis. Ninety-three percent were alive at the time of review. Thirty-six percent had homozygous mutations; 64% had compound heterozygous mutations. Two presentation peaks were seen: childhood (median diagnosis age, 3.5 years) and adulthood, typically related to pregnancy (median diagnosis age, 31 years). Genetic mutations differed by age of onset with prespacer mutations more likely to be associated with childhood onset (P = 0.0011). Sixty-nine percent of adult presentations were associated with pregnancy. Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) and intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate were used as treatment. Eighty-eight percent of patients with normal blood counts, but with headaches, lethargy, or abdominal pain, reported symptom resolution with prophylactic therapy. The most common currently used regimen of 3-weekly FFP proved insufficient for 70% of patients and weekly or fortnightly infusions were required. Stroke incidence was significantly reduced in patients receiving prophylactic therapy (2% vs 17%; P = 0.04). Long-term, there is a risk of end-organ damage, seen in 75% of patients with late diagnosis of cTTP. In conclusion, prespacer mutations are associated with earlier development of cTTP symptoms. Prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement decreases the risk of end-organ damage such as ischemic stroke and resolved previously unrecognized symptoms in patients with nonovert disease.

TO THE EDITOR:

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, and end-organ ischemia, which is fatal without prompt recognition and treatment.TTP arises from a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving von Willebrand Factor, allowing the accumulation of ultra-large von Willebrand Factor multimers that precipitate disseminated platelet-rich microthrombi. ADAMTS13 deficiency can either be immune-mediated TTP due to autoantibodies or congenital arising from biallelic mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene (cTTP). Pregnancy is a well-known precipitant for acute TTP episodes, particularly cTTP, in some cohorts; 25% to 30% of all obstetrical TTP cases are due to the congenital form.

TTP during pregnancy is fraught with substantial difficulties. It must be rapidly distinguished from other pregnancy-related TMAs, such as preeclampsia or HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) syndrome, which may also coexist in cTTP presentation, because maternal and fetal morbidity/mortality are high with delays in therapy. Acute cTTP episodes during pregnancy confer a maternal mortality risk of 10%, and the rates of fetal demise are > 50% with suboptimal management. The mainstay of therapy for acute cTTP is the administration of fresh frozen plasma, either by plasma infusion, typically 10 to 15 mL/kg given once daily until normalization of platelet counts, or plasma exchange. In populations that cannot receive plasma products, such as Jehovah's Witnesses or those with anaphylaxis to plasma, cTTP management presents a unique challenge. Previously, plasma–derived factor VIII concentrates, which contain trace amounts of ADAMTS13, have been used. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) for the treatment of cTTP. It's use has been described in pregnancy-associated cTTP, refractory to initial plasma infusion therapy. Here, we describe the first use of rADAMTS13 for acute rescue therapy in a critically ill pregnant patient with cTTP treated without plasma infusion.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) published clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura (TTP) in 2020. These guidelines were necessary due to the important innovations made in the field of TTP, including diagnostics using ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) as well as therapy with caplacizumab. TTP can be differentiated into immune-mediated TTP (iTTP), caused by autoantibody-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS13, and congenital TTP, caused by mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. ADAMTS13 cleaves the ultralarge multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF). In the absence of ADAMTS13, the ultralarge vWF multimers persist in the circulation, unfold and expose their A1 domains upon enhanced blood flow shear forces, thereby becoming hyperadhesive for platelets, which results in microthrombi obstructing microcirculation, leading to thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) with ischaemic organ injury. Important improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of TTP have been made in recent years. First, ADAMTS13 activity measurement is available not only for the diagnosis of TTP, but also for the response to therapy as well as the risk for recurrence of the disease. Second, immunosuppressive medications, especially rituximab, have been successful in reducing anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, which shortens the time to remission and limits the risk for exacerbation and relapse. Third, caplacizumab, a nanobody directed against A1 binding domains of vWF, has been approved for the treatment of iTTP together with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE).

The 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP have now been evaluated by the European Renal Best Practice (ERBP) Working Group and are herewith endorsed. Recommendations of the 2020 ISTH guidelines on TTP are summarized in Table 1. However, the working group argued that some recommendations need refinement from a European perspective. This endorsement highlights and expands on certain elements of the rationale following each recommendation. It also includes some comments on the treatment, while not based on randomized controlled trials, which may still be relevant for the treatment of patients with TTP.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, more specifically with respect to ADAMTS13 activity and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies, BSH 2023 guidelines recommend to consider confirming a low ADAMTS13 activity level based on a fully automated assay/semi-quantitative assay (by a FRET-based assay), depending on the index of clinical suspicion for TTP.

### Use of popPK and E-R analyses toward explaining causal link between ADAMTS13 in recombinant vs. plasma-based therapies and clinical effects in cTTP [^42a54471]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is a severe, ultra‐rare genetic deficiency of "a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13" (ADAMTS13) enzyme. The diagnosis of cTTP is typically confirmed by ADAMTS13 activity < 10% of normal in the absence of an acquired inhibitor, and has an estimated prevalence ranging between 0.5 and 2 cases per million population, although the prevalence may be considerably higher in certain regions. While disease onset can occur anytime, two incidence peaks have been reported at birth and during pregnancy. ADAMTS13 is secreted into the blood and cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimers into smaller and less biologically active units. Deficiency of ADAMTS13 can cause accumulation of large and ultra‐large VWF multimers with high platelet‐binding activity, leading to platelet aggregation and thrombi formation in the microvasculature. In line with this, acute exacerbations of TTP are often complicated by organ ischemia that can be life‐threatening in the absence of treatment.

Conclusion

Clinicians should be aware of TTP in cases of early onset or severe thrombocytopenia during pregnancy, even if platelets normalize after delivery or if there is only mild haemolysis. In a tertiary obstetrical unit, The TTP incidence was more frequent than expected, approaching 1/2000 deliveries, and 1 per 20 thrombocytopenic patients ≤ 75 G/L. With respect to constitutive TTP, this study supports ADAMTS-13 activity assessment in the setting of HELLP syndrome, even done retrospectively, as this can clarify diagnosis, allowing prevention of maternal morbidity/mortality and leading to successful childbirth.

### Current insights into thrombotic microangiopathies: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy [^259c2105]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

The complex relation between thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and pregnancy is concisely reviewed. Pregnancy is a very strong trigger for acute disease manifestation in patients with hereditary TTP caused by double heterozygous or homozygous mutations of ADAMTS13 (ADisintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 domains, no. 13). In several affected women disease onset during their first pregnancy leads to the diagnosis of hereditary TTP. Without plasma treatment mother and especially fetus are at high risk of dying. The relapse risk during a next pregnancy is almost 100% but regular plasma transfusion starting in early pregnancy will prevent acute TTP flare-up and may result in successful pregnancy outcome. Pregnancy may also constitute a mild risk factor for the onset of acute acquired TTP caused by autoantibody-mediated severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. Women having survived acute acquired TTP may not be at very high risk of TTP relapse during an ensuing next pregnancy but seem to have an elevated risk of preeclampsia. Monitoring of ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor titre during pregnancy may help to guide management and to avoid disease recurrence. Finally, TTP needs to be distinguished from the much more frequent hypertensive pregnancy complications, preeclampsia and especially HELLP (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver Enzymes, Low Platelet count) syndrome.

CHAPTER 3. DIAGNOSIS OF TTP

The ERBP working group urges the availability of rapid ADAMTS13 activity testing across Europe since it is not only necessary for diagnosing TTP, but also to guide therapy and to monitor clinical remission. In all European countries, ADAMTS13 activity testing should be available ideally within 24 h (to 72 h) after the suspicion of TTP to ensure appropriate therapy. PLASMIC (Platelet count; combined hemoLysis variable; absence of Active cancer; absence of Stem-cell or solid-organ transplant; MCV; INR; Creatinine) or French scores (Table 2) are both useful to evaluate pretest probability for TTP in patients with features of TMA and no associated conditions (in particular, pregnancy, cancer or chemotherapy, transplantation, severe sepsis). Furthermore, measuring ADAMTS13 inhibitors or anti-ADAMTS13 immunoglobulin G to underline the diagnosis of iTTP is important, although negative inhibitor results can also occur in some cases of early iTTP or be false negative in the case of immunoglobulin subtypes that are not detected by the immunoassay used. If congenital TTP (cTTP) is suspected, genetic analysis of ADAMTS13 should be performed.

CONCLUSION

Not only treatment regimens, but also diagnostic approaches, have dramatically changed in TTP in recent years. The 2020 ISTH guidelines group reviewed all available evidence on the management of TTP in a rigorous way and the ERBP working group endorsed the 2020 ISTH guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopaenic purpura. However, the ERBP working group wants to draw attention to a number of considerations that enhance the clinical applicability of the guidelines in Europe.

First we urge establishing ADAMTS13 activity measurements in TTP centres across Europe to shorten the time to TTP diagnosis and to prevent a clinical relapse in the follow-up period.

Second, TPE and corticosteroids remain cornerstones of acute iTTP treatment, but the addition of rituximab improves the time to ADAMTS13 remission and the number of clinical relapses in acute iTTP. Furthermore, rituximab is a recommended preemptive strategy in patients with an ADAMTS13 relapse to prevent a clinical relapse.

Third, caplacizumab improved therapy of acute iTTP treatment by reducing unfavourable outcomes such as the risk of refractoriness and acute clinical exacerbation. Recombinant ADAMTS13 may be added to the iTTP armamentarium for the treatment of acute episodes and is currently being tested in clinical studies.

### Severe congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnancy complicated by eclampsia [^51a68e15]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A postpartum woman was diagnosed with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), triggered by pregnancy. She presented with severe thrombocytopenia, haemolysis, hypertension and neurological symptoms. Laboratory findings, including microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and a severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity, confirmed the diagnosis. Genetic testing identified a mutation in the ADAMTS13 gene. The patient was managed with plasma exchange (PLEX), fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and supportive care. After two sessions of PLEX, her platelet count increased to 150 × 10⁹/L, LDH normalised, blood pressure stabilised and antihypertensive medications were discontinued. At discharge, she was asymptomatic, with a creatinine of 0.6mg/dL. Follow-up at 3 and 6months showed no recurrence. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of TTP in pregnancy, differentiation from other pregnancy-related disorders and the role of genetic testing in guiding long-term management and counselling.

### Morbidities and mortality in patients with hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^3ceb5720]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The possibilities of unrecognized hTTP suggest that the current prevalence estimate of hTTP (0.5–2.0 cases per million population) is an underestimate. One report described a search for hTTP in Central Norway using multiple case-finding strategies. These data reported an estimated prevalence of hTTP of 16.7 cases per million population. This estimate was supported by identifying the common pathologic ADAMTS13 mutations c.4143insA and p.R1060W in 0.33% to 1.0% of blood donors. As measurements of ADAMTS13 activity become more common, more patients with hTTP will be identified.

Morbidities and deaths in patients with hTTP are preventable by replacing ADAMTS13. In spite of the apparent simplicity of plasma prophylaxis, only 39 (72%) of the 54 patients with major morbidities who survived and continued to be observed were described as receiving prophylaxis. Major morbidities recurred in 28% of patients receiving prophylaxis and in 47% of patients not receiving prophylaxis. Plasma prophylaxis may not be used more often because the usual regimen of 10 to 15 mL/kg once every 2 weeksis a major lifetime inconvenience. In addition, current regimens of plasma prophylaxis may be insufficient. The International Hereditary TTP Registry has documented that the incidence of acute TTP episodes was not different between patients who received prophylaxis (0.36 per person-year; 95% CI, 0.29–0.44 per person-year) and patients without regular plasma prophylaxis (0.41 per person-year; 95% CI, 0.30–0.56 per person-year). More frequent infusions and larger volumes of plasma are more effectiveand have contributed to the successful management of women with hTTP during pregnancy.

### Pharmacokinetics of plasma infusion in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^ea475bb3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Essentials Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is primarily treated with plasma infusion. We present a pharmacokinetic analysis of ADAMTS-13 in six patients following plasma infusion. A median half-life of 130 h was demonstrated, ranging between 82.6 and 189.5 h. Investigation of interindividual clearance of ADAMTS-13 is necessary to optimize treatment. SUMMARY: Background Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is defined by persistent severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13 in the absence of anti-ADAMTS-13 inhibitory antibodies, confirmed by mutational analysis. Replacement of the missing protease prevents disease relapse, primarily using plasma infusion (PI). Objectives, patients and methods There is scant evidence regarding optimal dose and frequency of treatment, which tends to be empirically guided. We present a pharmacokinetic analysis of ADAMTS-13 in six patients with congenital TTP on established regimes following PI. Results We found a median clearance of 25.41 mL h⁻¹ and half-life of 130 h, ranging between 82.6 and 189.5 h (3.4–7.9 days, respectively). All patients reached baseline ADAMTS-13 level within 7–10 days post-plasma. Median ADAMTS-13 activity peak post-PI was 24.05 IU dL⁻¹. Variation was related to elimination rate, which, in turn, was affected by weight and metabolism, but not to von Willebrand factor antigen or activity levels. Using the pharmacokinetic parameters, we simulated individualized protocols based on PI dose or frequency to target hypothetical optimal plasma levels of ADAMTS-13 of 10 and 50 IU dL⁻¹, respectively. Results suggest a target trough ADAMTS-13 of 10 IU dL⁻¹ is feasible but 50 IU dL⁻¹ would not be achievable taking into account volume required. Conclusions Further work is needed to compare treatment of congenital TTP with PI vs. recombinant ADAMTS-13. PI may provide longer duration of ADAMTS-13 effect, but is limited by plasma volume required, whereas recombinant therapy can provide a higher ADAMTS-13 peak. We propose that investigation of interindividual clearance of ADAMTS-13 is necessary to optimize treatment and provide the rationale for dose and frequency of prophylaxis.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and pregnancy: presentation, management, and subsequent pregnancy outcomes [^d473a90f]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Pregnancy can precipitate thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). We present a prospective study of TTP cases from the United Kingdom Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (UK TTP) Registry with clinical and laboratory data from the largest cohort of pregnancy-associated TTP and describe management through pregnancy, averting fetal loss and maternal complications. Thirty-five women presented with a first TTP episode during pregnancy: 23/47 with their first congenital TTP (cTTP) episode and 12/47 with acute acquired TTP in pregnancy. TTP presented primarily in the third trimester/postpartum, but fetal loss was highest in the second trimester. Fetal loss occurred in 16/38 pregnancies before cTTP was diagnosed, but in none of the 15 subsequent managed pregnancies. Seventeen of 23 congenital cases had a missense mutation, C3178T, within exon 24 (R1060W). There were 8 novel mutations. In acquired TTP presentations, fetal loss occurred in 5/18 pregnancies and 2 terminations because of disease. We also present data on 12 women with a history of nonpregnancy-associated TTP: 18 subsequent pregnancies have been successfully managed, guided by ADAMTS13 levels. cTTP presents more frequently than acquired TTP during pregnancy and must be differentiated by ADAMTS13 analysis. Careful diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment in congenital and acquired TTP have assisted in excellent pregnancy outcomes.

### Morbidities and mortality in patients with hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^1bd80d6c]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

These data describe our current knowledge of the health outcomes of patients with hTTP. With more common use of ADAMTS13 measurements, there will be greater recognition of these patients. More common use of ADAMTS13 measurements will identify hTTP as a cause of severe hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants, stroke in children and young adults, and severe complications during pregnancy. More frequent identification of patients with hTTP and more convenient prophylaxis will prevent major morbidities and deaths.

### Severe HELLP syndrome masquerading as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura: a case report [^3c3b12d2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Our case demonstrates that ALF caused by a HELLP syndrome may be severe enough to induce severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and elicit the full range of clinical symptoms associated with TTP. Akin to the autoimmune and congenital forms of the condition, this cause of secondary TTP is also amenable to TPE. Yet its timely recognition and differentiation from the canonical forms of TTP is essential to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatments such as immunosuppressive therapy, a mainstay in the auto-immune form of the disease, or repeated prophylactic TPE, as considered in some cases of congenital TTP.

The typical course of platelets during a HELLP syndrome has been previously described. Here, the persistence of TMA features, along with neurological impairment, encouraged us to prioritize a diagnosis of TTP and to initiate TPE.

Central to these investigations is the assessment of ADAMTS13 activity since severe functional deficiency in ADAMTS13 (< 10%) serves as the indisputable pathophysiological basis for TTP. Reciprocally, severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is held to be the only specific, if not quasi-pathognomonic, diagnostic marker of the disease. TTP may be caused by either IgG auto-antibodies directed against ADAMTS13 or by a recessively inherited bi-allelic mutation of the ADAMTS13 gene. In adulthood, this latter mechanism is more likely to occur during pregnancy than in other settings.

This case contends that a third mechanism may be involved: the severity of liver failure, as evidenced by the lowered levels of factor V (30%) along with partial liver necrosis. Because of the dual blood supply of the liver, liver necrosis is an exceptional complication of HELLP syndrome. A retrospective analysis derived from the UNOS databank yielded only eight cases of fulminant liver failure from HELLP syndrome requiring liver transplantation.

### Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) with placental abruption despite maternal improvement: a case report [^976aeb9a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is common, usually mild, and most often, attributed to gestational thrombocytopenia which can be monitored without treatment or adverse outcome. On rarer occasions, thrombocytopenia is the first indicator of a more severe disease process with potential for both fetal and maternal morbidity or even mortality.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare hematologic condition that leads to severe thrombocytopenia and occlusive microangiopathywith potential sequalae including neurological abnormalities, renal insufficiency, fevers, thrombocytopenia, end organ damage and death if untreated. The disease may be either congenital or acquired, and is caused by decreased activity of ADAMST13, a von Willebrand factor cleaving protease. ADAMST13 activity may be decreased by the presence of an inhibitor or autoantibody as in the case of acquired TTP or, in the case of hereditary TTP, as the result of decreased production from a genetic mutation, a circumstance also known as Upshaw Shulman Syndrome (USS). Treatment involves therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) together with immune suppression in autoimmune (acquired) TTP or replacement of deficient ADAMTS13 with fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusions in the case of USS. Pregnancy has been known to perpetuate both acquired and congenital disease processes, and result in both significant maternal and fetal complications.

Prior case reports have focused primarily on maternal complications with only a few reports of fetal outcomes. When poor fetal outcomes are reported they have been associated with severe maternal disease. We present a case of maternal congenital TTP diagnosed during pregnancy in the early third trimester with appropriate response to TPE but deterioration of fetal well-being requiring preterm delivery.

CHAPTER 4. TREATMENT OF THE FIRST EPISODE OF iTTP

In all patients with suspected iTTP, TPE and steroid treatment should be started immediately. In patients with a high suspicion for iTTP, caplacizumab might be started before receiving ADAMTS13 activity results. We nevertheless urge that rapid ADAMTS13 activity evaluation, ideally within 24 h (to 72 h) of admission, would improve the treatment of iTTP patients and limit critical side effects of caplacizumab, such as bleeding. In case of ADAMTS13 activity < 10%, caplacizumab should be started according to the Phase III Trial with Caplacizumab in Patients with Acquired Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (HERCULES) protocol [10 mg intravenously immediately, followed by 10 mg subcutaneously (s.c.)] after each TPE, followed by daily s.c. injections. Caplacizumab needs to be continued until stable recovery of ADAMTS13 activity > 10–20%, since earlier discontinuation leads to a high risk of TTP exacerbation. As recommended in the 2020 ISTH guidelines, we urge not starting caplacizumab if ADAMTS13 activity testing is not available. Overall, it is important to receive ADAMTS13 results as quickly as possible and/or to transfer the patient with high suspicion of TTP to an experienced centre.

### The international hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura registry: key findings at enrollment until 2017 [^a4265486]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Detailed information on 291 acute episodes in 81 cTTP patients was available at the time of enrollment. The frequency of acute manifestations varied considerably in individual patients with a median of approximately 0.1 acute episode per patient-year and a range of 0.02–9 yearly acute episodes per patient (Online Supplementary Table S2). In two-thirds of episodes, the responsible physicians assumed a triggering factor, mainly mild to moderately severe infections, alcohol excess in men, pregnancy in women, and various other potential triggers (Figure 3). Pregnancy is a well-known trigger for acute disease episodes in cTTP,-, and it is conceivable that pregnancy and other conditions leading to an increased endothelial von Willebrand factor secretion may bring about acute disease in the face of absent or severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity. It is generally thought that an acute episode in cTTP is rapidly controlled by simple plasma infusion;, however, data from our Registry show that the median duration of over 200 well-documented episodes was seven days, probably because of delayed plasma therapy or illness from the triggering event.

Information on prophylactic treatment was available for 117 of 123 cTTP patients (Table 3). Twenty-nine percent of the patients had no regular prophylaxis and received plasma only on demand. Seventy-one percent were on prophylactic treatment, usually with fresh frozen plasma or solvent/detergent plasma infusions, while only one patient was treated with a commercial Factor VIII concentrate (Koate®). Dosing intervals mostly varied between two and three weeks, as had been proposed earlier on the basis of platelet count measurements. Whether such a dosing interval sufficiently controls minor TTP-related symptoms is questionable given the frequently reported symptoms like headache or mental disorders. Even though ADAMTS13 half-life in plasma is about 2–4 days, almost all patients will have unmeasurable ADAMTS13 levels within 7–10 days after infusion of 2–4 units of fresh frozen plasma. Evidently, a prospective follow up of cTTP patients will be needed to optimize replacement therapy. In the near future, the availability of rhADAMTS13, successfully tested in a pharmacokinetics and safety study in 15 cTTP patients, will greatly facilitate regular prophylactic treatment, and will probably allow treatment to be carried forward at home. In addition, given the high risk of acute episodes, ischemic strokes and other sequelae, a general prophylactic ADAMTS13 replacement in cTTP may be indicated.

### Management and follow-up of pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience [^577bd613]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In physiological conditions, von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels increase from the early stages of pregnancy and can reach levels > 200 IU/dL, returning to normal values 1 to 3 weeks postpartum. This increase in VWF during pregnancy is associated with a moderate decrease in the activity of its specific cleaving protease ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13) of 20% to 40% compared with prepregnancy levels. Pregnancy-onset TTP is defined by a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency leading to the accumulation of the most hemostatically active ultralarge multimers of VWF that spontaneously bind to platelets to form platelet-rich microthrombi obstructing the microcirculation and resulting in thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia.

In the vast majority of pregnancy-onset TTP cases, the severe functional deficiency in ADAMTS13 is acquired (aTTP) with a recovery of an ADAMTS13 activity detectable during remission (> 20 IU/dL). aTTP is most often immune mediated (iTTP) by anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. In up to 20% of cases, aTTP may not be associated with detectable anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. In such cases, the term TTP of unidentified pathophysiology (uTTP) is now used. Another specificity of pregnancy is the relatively high frequency of the otherwise extremely rare late-onset congenital TTP (cTTP; Upshaw-Schulman syndrome), which accounts for 24% to 66% of the published cohorts of pregnancy-onset TTP., cTTP stems from recessively biallelic deleterious variants of the ADAMTS13 gene, cloned for the first time in 2001. The clinical distinction between cTTP and aTTP (either iTTP or uTTP) at the acute phase is practically impossible without rapid turnover of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies or genetic analysis; in contrast, it is crucial to adapt management and subsequent follow-up.

Pregnancy may be complicated by a rare but life-threatening disease called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Most cases of TTP are due to an acquired autoimmune or hereditary (Upshaw-Schulman syndrome [USS]) severe deficiency of a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13 (ADAMTS13). In the present study, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the national registry of the French Reference Center for Thrombotic Microangiopathies from 2000–2010 to identify all women who were pregnant at their initial TTP presentation. Among 592 adulthood-onset TTP patients with a severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, 42 patients with a pregnancy-onset TTP were included. Surprisingly, the proportion of USS patients (n = 10 of 42 patients [24%]; confidence interval, 13%-39%) with pregnancy-onset TTP was much higher than that in adulthood-onset TTP in general (less than 5%) and was mostly related to a cluster of ADAMTS13 variants. In the present study, subsequent pregnancies in USS patients not given prophylaxis were associated with very high TTP relapse and abortion rates, whereas prophylactic plasmatherapy was beneficial for both the mother and the baby. Pregnancy-onset TTP defines a specific subgroup of patients with a strong genetic background. This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as number NCT00426686 and at the Health Authority, French Ministry of Health, as number P051064.

Discussion and conclusions

We present this case to discuss a rare disease entity and the potential role for obstetrical monitoring and surveillance to improve fetal outcomes. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in pregnancy is a rare but potentially fatal condition for both the patient and her fetus if left untreated. The disease is a known mimicker of preeclampsia, and often the two entities can coexist within the same patient thus requiring a low index of suspicion to initiate further workup. TTP, whether congenital or acquired, is often triggered by pregnancy. Swift recognition of TTP is needed to ensure prompt treatment with TPE. In our patient, the diagnosis of congenital TTP (USS) was made and ultimately confirmed on genetic testing of her ADAMTS13 locus. Although exceedingly rare in the general population and as a cause of TTP overall USS is a surprisingly common etiology of TTP presenting in pregnancy, responsible for 24–66% of cases. Therefore, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for USS and undertake genetic testing in women presenting with a first episode of TTP during pregnancy.

Treatment with TPE drastically decreases the rates of maternal mortality otherwise resulting from TTP; however data is limited regarding fetal outcomes during an index pregnancy. The available data suggests that TTP predominantly is diagnosed in the late second to early third trimester, and fetal survival is more likely if TTP is recognized and treated beyond 30 weeks gestation. It has been posited that late presentations of TTP are associated with more mild disease and greater placental reserve, while pregnancies in the second trimester are likely to have severe placental dysfunction from the underlying disease process leading to severe fetal growth restriction (FGR) and stillbirth. The underlying cause of these findings is unknown, however, it suggests that earlier disease presentation allows for progression of the disease within the placenta and therefore in the growing fetus, while later presentations affect a placenta that has developed normally and is able to better withstand insult in the third trimester.

### Management and follow-up of pregnancy-onset thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the French experience [^e2208fd0]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

The 12 patients with iTTP total 21 subsequent pregnancies:

- Out of 21 pregnancies, 18 pregnancies did not relapse, and 11 of 18 who were monitored regularly on their ADAMTS13 activity, which remained in normal range, ended with a live birth. Of particular interest, 3 additional patients (3 of 18 pregnancies) received immunosuppressive therapy: 1 received rituximab as a preemptive therapy after a biological relapse that occurred 5 months before her pregnancy; 1 received azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine, and corticosteroid throughout her pregnancy because of a preexisting lupus; and 1 received corticosteroids in postpartum also because of a preexisting lupus. Two patients (2 of 18 pregnancies) received aspirin and low-molecular weight heparin during their pregnancy. Six pregnancies (6 of 18; 2 patients, 1 of which also had lupus) ended in miscarriage; in 4 cases, ADAMTS13 activity was normal. One pregnancy (1 of 18) ended in PE, and a live birth but no TTP relapse (ADAMTS13 activity decreased at 16 IU/dL).
- The final 3 of 21 pregnancies were marked by a TTP relapse, ending with live birth (n = 2) and IUFD (n = 1). In all 3 cases, ADAMTS13 activity measured at the beginning of the pregnancy was very low (≤ 20 IU/dL).

The 2 patients with uTTP total 3 subsequent pregnancies, during which ADAMTS13 activity remained normal and no relapse occurred.

In the cTTP group, median length of follow-up was 6.5 years (IQR, 6.5 years). No TTP relapse outside of pregnancy were reported for the 29 patients with cTTP in our cohort. Eighteen pregnancies were reported in 15 patients. One pregnancy ended in abortion, 3 pregnancies were led without prophylaxis and subsequently were complicated in each case by a TTP relapse, ending in 2 IUFD and 1 live birth. The remaining 14 other pregnancies were all carried out with prophylactic plasma therapy: 1 pregnancy resulted in IUFD but no relapse; 12 pregnancies ended in a live birth with no relapse; and 1 pregnancy was marked by a TTP relapse with a live birth.

Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

The consensus guideline introduced by Scully et al. in 2017 and reports of several other groups offered a comprehensive update on the management and classification of TTP by addressing both acquired and inherited forms of TTP, including the diagnostic criteria and the importance of ADAMTS13 testing for TTP diagnosis. A major clue to our understanding of ADAMTS13 was introduced by Roose et al. who showed that this protease usually circulates in an open conformation during the acute phase of iTTP but remains primarily closed during remission, with ADAMTS13 activity higher than 50% and undetectable anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. All in all, despite major advances in recent years in the understanding of the disease, many aspects of its pathophysiology still remain unclear. TTP remains primarily a clinical diagnosis, which must be confirmed by the presence of severely reduced ADAMTS13 activity (< 10%) with or without the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies.

### Residual plasmatic activity of ADAMTS13 is correlated with phenotype severity in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^bf75a235]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

The quantification of residual plasmatic ADAMTS13 activity in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patients is constrained by limitations in sensitivity and reproducibility of commonly used assays at low levels of ADAMTS13 activity, blunting efforts to establish genotype-phenotype correlations. In the present study, the residual plasmatic activity of ADAMTS13 was measured centrally by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (limit of detection = 0.5%) in 29 congenital TTP patients. The results were used to study correlations among ADAMTS13 genotype, residual plasmatic activity, and clinical phenotype severity. An ADAMTS13 activity above 0.5% was measured in 26 (90%) patients and lower levels of activity were associated with earlier age at first TTP episode requiring plasma infusion, more frequent recurrences, and prescription of fresh-frozen plasma prophylaxis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that activity levels of less than 2.74% and 1.61% were discriminative of age at first TTP episode requiring plasma infusion < 18 years, annual rate of TTP episodes > 1, and use of prophylaxis. Mutations affecting the highly conserved N-terminal domains of the protein were associated with lower residual ADAMTS13 activity and a more severe phenotype in an allelic-dose dependent manner. The results of the present study show that residual ADAMTS13 activity is associated with the severity of clinical phenotype in congenital TTP and provide insights into genotype-phenotype correlations.

### Management of thrombotic microangiopathy in pregnancy and postpartum: report from an international working group [^41947c0a]. Blood (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy and postpartum are high-risk periods for different forms of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). However, the management of pregnancy-associated TMA remains ill defined. This report, by an international multidisciplinary working group of obstetricians, nephrologists, hematologists, intensivists, neonatologists, and complement biologists, summarizes the current knowledge of these potentially severe disorders and proposes a practical clinical approach to diagnose and manage an episode of pregnancy-associated TMA. This approach takes into account the timing of TMA in pregnancy or postpartum, coexisting symptoms, first-line laboratory workup, and probability-based assessment of possible causes of pregnancy-associated TMA. Its aims are: to rule thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in or out, with urgency, using ADAMTS13 activity testing; to consider alternative disorders with features of TMA (preeclampsia/eclampsia; hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets syndrome; antiphospholipid syndrome); or, ultimately, to diagnose complement-mediated atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; a diagnosis of exclusion). Although they are rare, diagnosing TTP and aHUS associated with pregnancy, and postpartum, is paramount as both require urgent specific treatment.

### The clinical utility of ADAMTS13 activity, antigen and autoantibody assays in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^8e47ee06]. British Journal of Haematology (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been linked to a severe deficiency in ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) activity. Since the identification of ADAMTS13, and its target cleavage sequence in von Willebrand factor (VWF), several novel ADAMTS13 activity, antigen and autoantibody assays have been developed. Our aim was to evaluate the potential use of these novel assays. ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitors were measured by overnight incubation of patient plasma with pure VWF followed by multimer or collagen binding analysis. ADAMTS13 activity (Rapid peptide assay), antigen and immunoglobulin G anti-ADAMTS13 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 118 samples from seven TTP patients (six adult idiopathic, one congenital) were studied longitudinally during episodes of TTP, their treatment and prophylaxis. ADAMTS13 antigen levels varied considerably between patients and sample times, but in new cases of acute TTP, rapid assays of ADAMTS13 antigen, on serial samples, maybe helpful in confirming the diagnosis. The rapid peptide ADAMTS13 activity assay showed good concordance of results with the older activity assay methods. The change in ADAMTS13 activity mirrored the autoantibody level and in 5/6 acquired TTP cases, a fall in antibody appeared to predict a rise in ADAMTS13 activity, potentially allowing modification of patient management based on autoantibody levels.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of four pregnancy-related TTP patients

Patients A, B, C were primipara, whereas, patient D was expecting her fourth child. Patients A and B lost their babies in the neonatal period. For patient A, due to prematurity (enterocolitis at 6 weeks of age) and for patient B, probably because of a coarctation of the aorta and ventricular septal defect (post-partum day 18). All patients except patient B presented features of preeclampsia. Patient D, who presented post-partum auto-immune TTP, had two ADAMTS-13 activity assessments at 22 and 25 months after delivery which showed 11% and 40%, respectively, without inhibitor, but was lost to follow-up

(y.o.: years old; WG: weeks of gestation; G/L: Giga per liter; D: day of delivery)

In subsequent pregnancies patients A and B received prophylactic plasma infusion, and gave birth to healthy children. Patient B had 3 pregnancies overall: plasma infusion was initiated at 13 WG of her second pregnancy (upon retrospective diagnosis of TTP in her first pregnancy) and from 4 WG of her third pregnancy. In her second pregnancy she gave birth at 35 WG vaginally to a boy (birth weight 32 th percentile), and in her third pregnancy gave birth at 38 WG vaginally to a girl (birthweight 38 th percentile). ADAMTS-13 activity for patient B's second and third babies were 33% and 38% after 6 months. The histopathological analysis of placentas showed an impressive improvement with plasma exposure during these three successive pregnancies (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Patient B placental pathologies over 3 pregnancies with increasing plasma exposure. Placental pathologies of patient B over her three pregnancies are shown. 1. No plasma infusion in first pregnancy; delivery at 33 WG due to TTP with a significant advance in maturation and villi infarction over fibrin deposit. 2. Prophylactic plasma infusions from 13 WG in second pregnancy; significant advance in maturation and intervillous old thrombosis on placental pathology at 35 WG. 3. Plasma infusions from the beginning of her third pregnancy allowed birth at 38 WG and a placental histology consistent with the term. Second and third pregnancies were uneventful

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^323beef5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia develops in 5% to 10% of women during pregnancy or in the immediate postpartum period. A low platelet count is often an incidental feature, but it might also provide a biomarker of a coexisting systemic or gestational disorder and a potential reason for a maternal intervention or treatment that might pose harm to the fetus. This chapter reflects our approach to these issues with an emphasis on advances made over the past 5 to 10 years in understanding and managing the more common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy. Recent trends in the management of immune thrombocytopenia translate into more women contemplating pregnancy while on treatment with thrombopoietin receptor agonists, rituximab, or mycophenylate, which pose known or unknown risks to the fetus. New criteria to diagnose preeclampsia, judicious reliance on measurement of ADAMTS13 to make management decisions in suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, new evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of anticomplement therapy for atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome during pregnancy, and implications of thrombotic microangiopathies for subsequent pregnancies are evolving rapidly. The goals of the chapter are to help the hematology consultant work through the differential diagnosis of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy based on trimester of presentation, severity of thrombocytopenia, and coincident clinical and laboratory manifestations, and to provide guidance for dealing with some of the more common and difficult diagnostic and management decisions.

### TTP and ADAMTS13: when is testing appropriate? [^81eca7f1]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2007). Low credibility.

The last 10 years witnessed the publication of many studies on the pathophysiology of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life-threatening disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and multiorgan failure. The most important finding was the identification of a novel metalloprotease, named ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motives), that is involved in the regulation of the size of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a major modulator of platelet adhesion and aggregation in the microcirculation. Inherited or acquired deficiencies of ADAMTS13 impair VWF cleavage, leading in turn to the disseminated formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the micro-circulation and to symptoms of end-organ ischemia. By measuring ADAMTS13 in plasma, it has been clearly shown that patients with inherited TTP have severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. However, patients with acquired TTP present with clinical and laboratory heterogeneity, and there are unequivocal cases of acquired TTP with measurable plasma levels of ADAMTS13. This heterogeneity poses a challenge for understanding the pathogenesis of TTP and selecting appropriate therapies.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of TTP: an integrated approach [^79716c96]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP) is a rare, life-threatening disease with an incidence of approximately 2 persons per million per year. It is characterized by severe deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving protease, ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13), leading to formation of platelet-rich thrombi in the microvasculature. Prompt initiation of appropriate therapy, particularly plasma exchange, may be life-saving. Diagnosis of TTP is challenging because of its diverse clinical manifestations, overlap in clinical presentation with other thrombotic microangiopathies, and limited availability of ADAMTS13 testing. Clinical prediction scores have been developed to estimate the pretest probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency and may be used as an adjunct to clinical judgment to guide initial management decisions. An ADAMTS13 activity level of less than 10% supports the diagnosis of TTP in appropriate clinical contexts, but many centers do not offer testing in-house and must send out the test to a reference laboratory with a turnaround time of several days. In such instances, initial management decisions must be made without the benefit of laboratory testing. In patients with TTP, inhibitor tests may be useful for distinguishing immune-mediated from congenital TTP. In this article, we review the epidemiology, natural history, and clinical presentation of TTP and laboratory assays for TTP including ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor assays. We also describe an evidence-based approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected TTP that integrates clinical and laboratory assessment.

### The third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura shows up again: what is it, does it even exist, how to find out? Comment on "Acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura without detectable Anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies: a possible underlying autoimmune mechanism" and on "The different faces of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura" [^7924bf3f]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Haematologica a Letter by Delphine Simon et al. on behalf of the French Centre National de Référence des Microangiopathies Thrombotiques (CNR-MAT), again brings up the existence and characteristics of a third form of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), labeled as TTP of unidentified pathophysiology (uTTP). This reiterated important insight is accompanied by a comment by a TTP specialist, Paul Knöbl. Many questions concerning this potentially important but so far incompletely understood variant of TTP remain and I will try to put this uTTP variant into perspective and propose further steps to confirm its existence and unravel its secrets.

TTP was first described in 1924 by Moschcowitzand the history of extensive research, elucidation of the pathophysiology, and the enormous therapeutic advances for this rare - and during half a century universally fatal - disease has been reviewed by many groups. In all these reviews two separate forms of TTP are generally distinguished: (i) a rare congenital or hereditary form (cTTP or hTTP) caused by biallelic variants of the ADAMTS13 gene giving rise to a severe constitutional deficiency of ADAMTS13 (A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease with ThromboSpondin type 1 motifs, number 13), the specific von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving metalloprotease and (ii) a still rare but more common acquired form of TTP caused by autoantibodies inhibiting and/or clearing ADAMTS13 from plasma, generally termed autoimmune TTP (iTTP). In both forms of TTP, cTTP and iTTP, the defective proteolytic processing of VWF multimers results in accumulation of highly adhesive, unusually large VWF multimers leading to microvascular clumping of platelets and ischemia of multiple organs. Treatment of acute cTTP episodes consists of plasma infusions and many patients need regular plasma prophylaxis to avoid recurring acute bouts. More recently, recombinant human ADAMTS13 has become available for improved and facilitated treatment and prophylaxis of cTTP. Acute iTTP episodes are managed by daily plasma exchanges with plasma replacement, immunosuppression with corticosteroids and rituximab, and the anti-VWF nanobody caplacizumab. The International Working Group on TTP has proposed consensus definitions of the disease TTP, outlined the differential diagnosis between TTP and other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA), and defined response to treatment and outcomes. Moreover, under the auspices of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, recommendations and guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of TTP have been established. In sum, TTP, both cTTP and iTTP, have been transformed from a generally deadly condition without any effective therapy until the 1960s to 1970s to two pathophysiologically well understood separate diseases, which can be effectively managed provided they are recognized promptly and diagnosed in a timely manner.

### Targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^856e0513]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening thrombotic disorder associated with a severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13-the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor. Plasma therapy is the current standard of care for managing acute episodes of TTP, which involves removing patient plasma and replacing it with donor plasma to raise the level of ADAMTS-13 activity. Recently, therapies aimed at replacing ADAMTS-13 have been investigated as possible substitutes or add-ons to plasma therapy for congenital and immune-mediated TTP. Enzyme replacement therapy provides recombinant ADAMTS-13 via intravenous (i.v.) infusion to restore enzyme activity. Recombinant ADAMTS-13-loaded platelets localize to the site of thrombus formation in a more concentrated manner than enzyme replacement or plasma therapy. ADAMTS-13-encoding messenger RNA aims to induce a steady supply of secreted protein and gene therapy is a potentially curative strategy. Overall, targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapies may provide better outcomes than plasma therapy by achieving higher levels of ADAMTS-13 activity and a more sustained response with fewer adverse events. Herein, we describe targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapies for the treatment of TTP and discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach.

### Impact of new medications on the treatment of immune TTP [^d87c8a62]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The last decade has seen the introduction of 2 new licensed therapies for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), caplacizumab and recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13), for immune and congenital TTP (cTTP), respectively. They improve acute TTP outcomes, and reduce the need for plasma therapy, time to clinical response, and treatment burden. Future pathways need to replace plasma exchange in acute TTP and optimize/personalize rADAMTS13 in cTTP. Future emphasis should focus on additional monoclonals/treatments to tackle ADAMTS13 antibodies.

### Platelets: thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^a2e2f3f2]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2002). Low credibility.

Abnormalities of plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF) have been recognized to be associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) for over 20 years. Patients with chronic, relapsing TTP have VWF multimers that are larger than normal, similar in size to those secreted by cultured endothelial cells. Recent observations have documented that a deficiency of a VWF-cleaving protease (termed ADAMTS13) may be responsible for the presence of these unusually large VWF multimers. Multiple mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene can result in ADAMTS13 deficiency and cause congenital TTP; autoantibodies neutralizing ADAMTS13 protease activity have been associated with acquired TTP. In Section I, Dr. Evan Sadler reviews the structure, biosynthesis, and function of the ADAMTS13 protease. He describes the mutations that have been identified in congenital TTP and describes the relationship of ADAMTS13 deficiency to the development of both congenital and acquired TTP. Dr. Sadler postulates that the development of TTP may be favored by conditions that combine increased VWF secretion, such as during the later stages of pregnancy, and decreased ADAMTS13 activity. In Section II, Dr. Bernhard Lämmle describes the assay methods for determining ADAMTS13 activity. Understanding the complexity of these methods is essential for understanding the difficulty of assay performance and the interpretation of assay data. Dr. Lämmle describes his extensive experience measuring ADAMTS13 activity in patients with TTP as well as patients with acute thrombocytopenia and severe illnesses not diagnosed as TTP. His data suggest that a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 activity (< 5%) is a specific feature of TTP. However, he emphasizes that, although severe ADAMTS13 deficiency may be specific for TTP, it may not be sensitive enough to identify all patients who may be appropriately diagnosed as TTP and who may respond to plasma exchange treatment. In Section III, Dr. James George describes the evaluation and management of patients with clinically suspected TTP, as well as adults who may be described as having hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). Dr. George presents a classification of TTP and HUS in children and adults. Appropriate evaluation and management are related to the clinical setting in which the diagnosis is considered. A clinical approach is described for patients in whom the diagnosis of TTP or HUS is considered (1) following bone marrow transplantation, (2) during pregnancy or the postpartum period, (3) in association with drugs which may cause TTP either by an acute immune-mediated toxicity or a dose-related toxicity, (4) following a prodrome of bloody diarrhea, (5) in patients with autoimmune disorders, and (6) in patients with no apparent associated condition who may be considered to have idiopathic TTP. Patients with idiopathic TTP appear to have the greatest frequency of ADAMTS13 deficiency and appear to be at greatest risk for a prolonged clinical course and subsequent relapse. Management with plasma exchange has a high risk of complications. Indications for additional immunosuppressive therapy are described.

CHAPTER 5. TREATMENT OF A RELAPSING EVENT OF iTTP

A clinical relapse has been recently defined as a decrease of platelets to < 150 × 10⁹/L with or without evidence of new ischaemic organ injury after a clinical remission. Other causes of thrombocytopaenia need to be ruled out and the clinical relapse needs to be confirmed by detection of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency. An ADAMTS13 relapse is defined as ADAMTS13 levels < 20% after an ADAMTS13 complete or partial remission. According to the ISTH guidelines, starting TPE, corticosteroids, rituximab and caplacizumab in case of a clinical relapse is recommended. When an ADAMTS13 relapse without a clinical relapse is diagnosed, the working group and others favour preemptive rituximab treatment in such situations to reinduce ADAMTS13 remission, thereby reducing the risk of a clinical relapse.

### Dissecting the pathophysiology of immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: interplay between genes and environmental triggers [^6959293b]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is another important modifier of TTP susceptibility, either in the congenital or in the autoimmune form. Raised VWF levels are required to induce TTP in Adamts13 −/− mice, but varying the concentration between 20 and 120 U/mL does not appear to affect the occurrence or severity of the disease, suggesting that a threshold level of VWF is sufficient, and that higher levels confer little additional risk. However, humans appear to be more sensitive to changes in VWF levels than mice. Women with inherited ADAMTS13 deficiency frequently develop TTP during pregnancy, which probably results from the progressive increase in VWF levels throughout the gestation period. Moreover, obese individuals have higher levels of VWF, providing further evidence for an association between obesity and TTP. Thus, changes in VWF secretion, multimer distribution, and plasma level may trigger TTP. Among additional modifiers of TTP, blood group O was found over-represented in iTTP cohorts, suggesting that blood group O could be a risk factor for TTP.

### Long-term follow-up outcomes in congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^00e04c13]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (cTTP) is an ultra-rare thrombotic microangiopathy mediated through inherited deficiency in ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13). To date more than 200 ADAMTS13 genetic variants have been associated with cTTP. We report longitudinal follow up from the UK TTP registry in 104 confirmed cTTP cases (91 consented for follow-up) in a large multi-ethnic national cTTP patient cohort, including a large Black African cTTP cohort. 71 ADAMTS13 variants were identified, with N-terminal variants associated with earlier age at presentation. During the follow-up period (median 63 months (range 1–179), 80.2% of patients received regular (plasma derived) prophylaxis which reduced end-organ damage, including stroke/TIA (19.0% to 1.5%) and renal impairment during follow-up. Post presentation acute TTP episodes were reduced with prophylaxis (0.68 vs 0.06 acute episodes/follow-up year) Despite regular prophylaxis, symptom control remained apparent on plasma-derived therapy (including headache 42.6%, depression/anxiety 13.2%, fatigue 16.2% and abdominal pain 13.2%). The majority of cTTP patients in the UK have now switched to recombinant ADAMTS13 (n = 43, 58.9%), owing to inadequate symptom control (53.5%), plasma reactions (30.2%), or subclinical disease activity (16.3%). This work shows the breadth of ADAMTS13 genetic variants in cTTP, and demonstrates efficacy of regular prophylaxis in (i) reducing acute TTP episodes, and (ii) preventing end organ damage, but despite advances, cTTP related symptoms and the use of blood products, remained problematic.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a rare, potentially life-threatening thrombotic microangiopathy, manifests either as congenital TTP or acquired forms. It is caused by the absence or severe depletion of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 13 (ADAMTS13) protease, leading to the accumulation of ultra large von Willebrand factor multimers as well as extensive platelet adhesion and clumping, which can ultimately cause severe secondary end-organ damage. Pregnancy can provoke or exacerbate TTP, leading to maternal and fetal complications.

Objective

In this report, we focused on pregnancy outcomes in a recently recognized cohort of congenital TTP patients of Bedouin Arab descent in southern Israel who were all homozygous for a novel c.3772delA variant of the ADAMTS13 gene, leading to the clinical manifestations of TTP largely during pregnancy.

Study Design

All patients presented in this study belong to 2 closely related families of Arab Bedouin descent and were found to be homozygous for a novel ADAMTS13-c.3772delA variant. The cohort consisted of 19 females; 16 of them had congenital TTP and had been pregnant and were thus included. Patient data were collected from electronic medical records.

Results

Of note, 13 women from our cohort, who delivered 14 fetuses (owing to 1 twin pregnancy), were diagnosed with congenital TTP following complicated pregnancies, which included recurrent pregnancy loss, stillbirth, early onset preeclampsia (both mild and severe), hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome, intrauterine growth restriction with abnormal Doppler flow, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and a total perinatal mortality rate of 30.7% (4/13). An additional 3 women, who were diagnosed owing to complications outside of pregnancy and at older ages, experienced TTP during their pregnancies, which occurred before diagnosis. Subsequent pregnancies were treated with fresh frozen plasma leading to a 100% fetal survival rate in the pregnancies that reached fetal viability. All placentas had lesions consistent with maternal vascular underperfusion. However, the severity and frequency of these lesions were lower in the 8 placentas from pregnancies treated with fresh frozen plasma.

Conclusion

This case series details a distinctive cohort of congenital TTP patients, all homozygous for the same, novel ADAMTS13 variant, who presented with clinical complications during pregnancy and maternal vascular lesions of underperfusion in the placenta. Our findings imply that the variant identified in the ADAMTS13 gene in our cohort may have a specific functional impact on the placenta, and that treatment with fresh frozen plasma during pregnancy ameliorates the course of the disease, leading to a milder phenotype or a normal pregnancy in the majority of cases.

FIGURE 2
The course of a patient with suspected/proven immune‐mediated Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (iTTP) in a hospital with optimal resources. Acute stage: if the patient suffers from a thrombotic microangiopathy without any apparent cause, a clinical score should be used to estimate ADAMTS13 levels and a citrated blood sample taken for actual ADAMTS13 activity assessment at the day of presentation (Day 0). The French Score takes into account thrombocytopenia and creatinine values, scoring +1 for each if present. A score of 2 indicates high probability of ADAMTS13 < 10%. In this case, a triplet regimen with daily PEX + steroids and daily caplacizumab is instated. If the clinical score is 1, TTP should still be suspected and PEX + steroids and daily caplacizumab should be initiated and kept until the ADAMTS13 activity test results from Day 0 arrive. If ADAMTS13 ≥ 10%, this is suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. If ADAMTS13 < 10%, the diagnosis of iTTP is confirmed, and rituximab is added (usually by day 4 following PEX initiation). This regimen is kept until a clinical response ensues for two days, at which point PEX is stopped, but the remaining therapies continue, with weekly assessments of ADAMTS13 activity. Caplacizumab may be stopped once adequate ADAMTS13 responses are achieved (> 20% or > 10%). Long‐term follow‐up: the focus shifts to preventing relapses and long‐term morbidity, with periodic assessments of ADAMTS13 activity (typically every three months, with pre‐emptive treatment if needed), and yearly assessments to control cardiovascular risk factors, assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders and improvement of quality of life as well as other specific assessments (e.g. pregnancy planning in the case of female patients of childbearing age)

### Successful treatment of congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura using the intermediate purity factor VIII concentrate BPL 8Y [^f2322fb2]. British Journal of Haematology (2002). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is caused by an absolute deficiency of von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease. The recent identification of this protease and the development of assays for its detection have enabled its quantification in a number of plasma products, including some commercial intermediate-purity plasma-derived factor VIII preparations. We report the successful, weekly prophylactic use of a commercial intermediate-purity plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate in the treatment of a 14-year-old girl with severe congenital TTP who had previously required transfusions of fresh-frozen plasma every 2 weeks from the age of 4 months.

Regarding medical management for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, more specifically with respect to management of an acute event, corticosteroids, ISTH 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroids in addition to therapeutic plasma exchange in patients with immune-mediated TTP experiencing a first acute event.

We then tested whether overt disease onset was related with residual plasma ADAMTS13 activity in all patients whose ADAMTS13 activity was measured in Nara or Bern after a comparative evaluation had shown a good agreement of activity levels in the very low range below 5–10% (Online Supplementary Table S1). For 97 patients with available information, it was evident that overt disease onset was not strictly related to residual ADAMTS13 activity. Whereas about 40% of cTTP patients with an ADAMTS13 activity < 1% had a neonatal disease onset, 20% seemed to have a first TTP manifestation at age > 20 years. On the other hand, most cTTP patients with an ADAMTS13 activity > 1–2% had a delayed apparent disease manifestation (Figure 4). Thus, residual ADAMTS13 activity is clearly not the only determinant of disease severity, as reflected by age at overt onset.

In conclusion, the Hereditary TTP Registry has provided substantial information, but it will be of utmost importance for the development of an optimized management strategy to enlarge the cohort by directly enrolling more patients from around the globe, and through embarking on collaborations with other established registries on cTTP. It would be highly desirable to prospectively follow all cTTP patients at regular intervals and evaluate the best prophylactic strategy to avoid unnecessary deaths and late sequelae in this treatable condition.

A complete list of the collaborators of the Hereditary TTP Registry appears in the Online Supplementary Appendix A.

### Animal models for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^dcc9c8fe]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a puzzling disorder in many ways. The disease is difficult to diagnose as analogous symptoms are also found in other microangiopathic disorders. Although ADAMTS13 deficiency is generally required to develop TTP, only some patients with severe ADAMTS13 deficiency do spontaneously develop this disease. It is therefore assumed that environmental and/or genetic factors are needed to cause acute TTP. Nevertheless, acute TTP-like symptoms have also been observed in patients with moderate or normal levels of ADAMTS13. The development of animal models for TTP has allowed a closer look at the specific need for ADAMTS13 deficiency and the necessity for additional triggers in the pathophysiology of TTP. Mouse models for congenital TTP and a baboon model for acquired TTP have been generated. These animal models have also proven to be extremely valuable in developing new treatment strategies for TTP. In the current review, we discuss current animal models for TTP, what we have learned from them and how they were used to test new treatment strategies.

- Thirty-six women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura were studied during 37 pregnancies, and maternal characteristics with predictive value for the fetal platelet count were determined. Nine neonates were thrombocytopenic, with a platelet count of less than 50 × 109/L in eight. Four of these nine neonates delivered to a subgroup of 31 mothers were studied prospectively; the frequency of thrombocytopenia in neonates of women with immune thrombocytopenic purpura was thus 13%. Only two of these nine neonates presented with hemorrhagic syndromes. The frequency of neonatal thrombocytopenia was higher in mothers with deep thrombocytopenia and in those who had not responded to corticosteroid treatment following diagnosis.

No prognostic value could be assigned to the other maternal characteristics studied, such as a history of splenectomy, maternal treatment at the time of delivery, or the presence of platelet autoantibodies evaluated either with the platelet immunofluorescence test or the platelet Western blot immunoassay.
