hypertension home reading

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about home blood pressure monitoring for hypertension, including when to use it, how to do it, how to interpret it, and how it compares with office and ambulatory monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why home monitoring matters. Then, I should verify the diagnostic thresholds and how they differ from office values. Next, I will review the practical protocol for measurement, including device selection, cuff size, timing, and number of readings. After that, I need to check how to interpret results and what to do when home and office readings disagree. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation barriers, and summarize the bottom line with a concise, actionable takeaway.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Home blood pressure monitoring is recommended to confirm a hypertension diagnosis after an elevated office reading and to guide ongoing management because it reduces white-coat effects, improves reproducibility, and correlates better with cardiovascular outcomes than office measurements, though ambulatory blood pressure monitoring remains the reference standard when available [^111iQm4V] [^111ZaodB] [^111PL8qq].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic thresholds before I proceed. Historically, home hypertension is defined as an average home BP of 135/85 mmHg or higher, which corresponds to an office threshold of 140/90 mmHg. However, with the 2017 ACC/AHA shift to 130/80 mmHg for office BP, many guidelines now align home thresholds to 130/80 mmHg for diagnosis and treatment targets, even though some European guidance still uses 135/85 mmHg pending stronger outcome data, so I should explicitly note this discrepancy and tailor to the guideline context [^114XfKhy] [^117U8teM] [^1126qbxU].

> I need to ensure the measurement protocol is precise. Let me think about device selection and validation. Upper-arm oscillometric devices validated to international standards such as AAMI/ESH/ISO are preferred; wrist and finger devices should be avoided due to accuracy concerns, and cuff size must match the mid-arm circumference to avoid systematic error [^116ui8Uo] [^116hycER]. Hold on, I should verify the timing and posture: patients should rest seated for 2–5 minutes with back supported, feet flat, cuff at heart level, bladder empty, and avoid caffeine, exercise, and smoking for 30 minutes prior; two readings about 1 minute apart should be taken in the morning before medications and breakfast and again in the evening before bedtime for at least 3 days, preferably 7 days, with the first day often discarded to mitigate the "day 1 effect" [^112xNJky] [^111BBJ8f] [^116Vzuqz].

> Let me consider the minimum number of readings needed for reliability. I should double-check that averaging at least 12–14 readings over 3–7 days yields stable estimates; studies suggest that 2 morning and 2 evening readings over 3–7 days provide reliable means, and some analyses indicate that 3 days may suffice in many cases, though 7 days remains the conservative standard in most guidelines [^111Vyymy] [^116rRU34] [^111BBJ8f].

> Next, I should review how to interpret results and handle discordance. If the average home BP is 130/80 mmHg or higher (or 135/85 mmHg depending on the guideline), hypertension is confirmed. If home BP is normal but office BP is high, white-coat hypertension is likely. If home BP is high but office BP is normal, masked hypertension is suspected and carries increased cardiovascular risk, prompting closer follow-up or ambulatory monitoring when feasible [^1126qbxU] [^112vghXx]. Hold on, I should verify the role of ABPM: when home and office readings disagree or when phenotypes like white-coat or masked hypertension are suspected, ABPM is the reference standard and should be used if available to clarify diagnosis and risk stratification [^111PL8qq] [^1126qbxU].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, home monitoring is reasonable when office measurements are impractical or to improve control, though evidence is limited and should be interpreted cautiously. In pediatrics, home monitoring can be a practical adjunct when ABPM is unavailable, but validation data are sparse and cuff sizing is critical. In chronic kidney disease, out-of-office monitoring is emphasized to better reflect true BP and guide renoprotective therapy. In older adults, home monitoring helps mitigate white-coat effects and variability, supporting more accurate assessment and titration [^112wNueA] [^112sTws8] [^113ghkYQ] [^117TK6Qp].

> But wait, what about implementation and adherence in real-world practice. I should confirm that patient education and provider engagement are essential because many patients use unvalidated devices, measure incorrectly, or fail to bring data to clinicians; structured training, validated device lists, and telemonitoring with feedback improve technique, adherence, and BP control, and cost-effectiveness analyses increasingly support HBPM, especially when paired with co-interventions [^116B6LA6] [^117L3HHa] [^111ndqzx]. Hold on, I should verify that meta-analyses show modest but meaningful BP reductions with HBPM, with larger effects when combined with medication titration or telehealth support, reinforcing the need for integrated workflows rather than isolated self-monitoring [^115Rxck4] [^112G2gGH].

> Let me reconsider the bottom line and make sure it is actionable. Home blood pressure monitoring is a validated, practical, and guideline-endorsed approach to confirm hypertension after an elevated office reading and to guide therapy; use a validated upper-arm device with proper cuff size, train patients to take two seated readings morning and evening for 3–7 days, discard day 1 if protocolized, and average the results. Interpret using 130/80 mmHg or 135/85 mmHg depending on the guideline, and escalate to ABPM when results are discordant or phenotypes are uncertain. With education and telemonitoring, HBPM improves control and can be cost-effective, though device validation and standardization remain critical gaps that clinicians must actively address [^111iQm4V] [^1126qbxU] [^111BBJ8f] [^111ndqzx] [^112bsJEV].

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is a **validated, practical alternative** to office and ambulatory measurements for diagnosing and managing hypertension [^1126qbxU] [^111PL8qq]. HBPM improves diagnostic accuracy by revealing white-coat and masked hypertension, and it enhances treatment adherence and control when paired with education or telemonitoring [^117L3HHa] [^115Rxck4]. Use **validated upper-arm devices** with appropriately sized cuffs, and follow standardized protocols: measure twice in the morning and twice in the evening for 7 days, discard day 1, and average the remaining readings [^111BBJ8f] [^112xNJky]. Interpret results using a home threshold of **≥ 135/85 mmHg** (or ≥ 130/80 mmHg per some guidelines) [^114XfKhy] [^1126qbxU]. HBPM is especially useful for long-term monitoring, resistant hypertension, and high-risk patients, but it does not replace ambulatory monitoring when diagnosis is uncertain or nocturnal patterns are needed [^111PL8qq] [^117T2KHh].

---

## Clinical significance and benefits

HBPM provides several **clinical advantages** over office-based measurements:

- **Diagnostic accuracy**: HBPM improves detection of white-coat and masked hypertension, leading to more accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions [^1126qbxU] [^112vghXx].

- **Therapeutic adherence**: Regular self-monitoring enhances patient engagement and adherence to antihypertensive therapy, improving long-term blood pressure control [^115uuU79] [^111jfq2f].

- **Prognostic value**: Home blood pressure correlates more strongly with cardiovascular outcomes than office measurements, providing better risk stratification [^113pGjBt] [^112hQZan].

---

## Recommended measurement protocol

To ensure accuracy and reliability, the following **protocol is recommended**:

| **Parameter** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Device selection | Validated upper-arm oscillometric devices with appropriately sized cuffs [^116ui8Uo] [^116hycER] |
| Measurement frequency | Twice daily (morning and evening) for 7 days [^111BBJ8f] [^116Vzuqz] |
| Measurement technique | - Seated position <br/> - Back supported <br/> - Feet flat on floor <br/> - Arm at heart level <br/> - Cuff on bare arm <br/> - 2 minutes rest between readings [^112xNJky] [^117Vf4FG] |
| Data interpretation | Discard first day; average remaining readings [^111BBJ8f] [^112fwE2u] |

---

## Diagnostic thresholds

Hypertension diagnosis using HBPM is based on the following **thresholds**:

- **General threshold**: ≥ 135/85 mmHg [^114XfKhy] [^115Fo1K2].

- **High-risk patients**: ≥ 130/80 mmHg (e.g. diabetes, chronic kidney disease) [^117U8teM] [^1126qbxU].

- **Normal home blood pressure**: < 130/80 mmHg [^117U8teM].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Despite its benefits, HBPM has **limitations**:

- **Patient adherence**: Requires patient training and adherence to measurement protocols [^115GaZiw] [^116B6LA6].

- **Device accuracy**: Unvalidated devices or improper cuff sizing can lead to inaccurate readings [^112bsJEV] [^116ui8Uo].

- **Clinical context**: HBPM does not replace ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in complex cases or when nocturnal patterns are needed [^111PL8qq] [^114XL4B1].

---

## Integration into clinical practice

HBPM is **increasingly integrated** into clinical practice through:

- **Guideline endorsement**: Major guidelines recommend HBPM for diagnosis, monitoring, and management of hypertension [^111BBJ8f] [^117Hefhe].

- **Telemedicine**: Digital platforms enable remote monitoring, data transmission, and clinician oversight, enhancing care coordination [^115ssfZJ] [^116Gmu6n].

- **Education and training**: Structured patient education programs improve measurement accuracy and adherence [^115GaZiw] [^112xNJky].

---

Home blood pressure monitoring is a **validated, practical tool** that improves diagnostic accuracy, enhances adherence, and supports better cardiovascular outcomes. It should be integrated into routine care with appropriate patient education, validated devices, and standardized protocols.

### European Society of Hypertension practice guidelines for home blood pressure monitoring [^112Rx153]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Self-monitoring of blood pressure by patients at home (home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM)) is being increasingly used in many countries and is well accepted by hypertensive patients. Current hypertension guidelines have endorsed the use of HBPM in clinical practice as a useful adjunct to conventional office measurements. Recently, a detailed consensus document on HBPM was published by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring. However, in daily practice, briefer documents summarizing the essential recommendations are needed. It is also accepted that the successful implementation of clinical guidelines in routine patient care is dependent on their acceptance by involvement of practising physicians. The present document, which provides concise and updated guidelines on the use of HBPM for practising physicians, was therefore prepared by including the comments and feedback of general practitioners.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) overcomes many of the limitations of traditional office blood pressure (BP) measurement and is both cheaper and easier to perform than ambulatory BP monitoring. Monitors that use the oscillometric method are currently available that are accurate, reliable, easy to use, and relatively inexpensive. An increasing number of patients are using them regularly to check their BP at home, but although this has been endorsed by national and international guidelines, detailed recommendations for their use have been lacking. There is a rapidly growing literature showing that measurements taken by patients at home are often lower than readings taken in the office and closer to the average BP recorded by 24-hour ambulatory monitors, which is the BP that best predicts cardiovascular risk. Because of the larger numbers of readings that can be taken by HBPM than in the office and the elimination of the white-coat effect (the increase of BP during an office visit), home readings are more reproducible than office readings and show better correlations with measures of target organ damage. In addition, prospective studies that have used multiple home readings to express the true BP have found that home BP predicts risk better than office BP (Class IIa; Level of Evidence A). This call-to-action article makes the following recommendations: (1) It is recommended that HBPM should become a routine component of BP measurement in the majority of patients with known or suspected hypertension; (2) Patients should be advised to purchase oscillometric monitors that measure BP on the upper arm with an appropriate cuff size and that have been shown to be accurate according to standard international protocols. They should be shown how to use them by their healthcare providers; (3) Two to 3 readings should be taken while the subject is resting in the seated position, both in the morning and at night, over a period of 1 week. A total of ≥ 12 readings are recommended for making clinical decisions; (4) HBPM is indicated in patients with newly diagnosed or suspected hypertension, in whom it may distinguish between white-coat and sustained hypertension. If the results are equivocal, ambulatory BP monitoring may help to establish the diagnosis; (5) In patients with prehypertension, HBPM may be useful for detecting masked hypertension; (6) HBPM is recommended for evaluating the response to any type of antihypertensive treatment and may improve adherence; (7) The target HBPM goal for treatment is < 135/85 mm Hg or < 130/80 mm Hg in high-risk patients; (8) HBPM is useful in the elderly, in whom both BP variability and the white-coat effect are increased; (9) HBPM is of value in patients with diabetes, in whom tight BP control is of paramount importance; (10) Other populations in whom HBPM may be beneficial include pregnant women, children, and patients with kidney disease; and (11) HBPM has the potential to improve the quality of care while reducing costs and should be reimbursed.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^111iQm4V]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinician summary: Screening for hypertension in adults — "Screen adults for hypertension. Grade A" applies to "Adults 18 years or older without known hypertension". This recommendation is consistent with the 2015 USPSTF recommendation. Measure blood pressure with an office blood pressure measurement. Take blood pressure measurements outside of the clinical setting to confirm a hypertension diagnosis before starting treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring: patients wear a programmed portable device that automatically takes blood pressure measurements, typically in 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are sleeping. Home blood pressure monitoring: patients measure their own blood pressure at home with an automated device. Measurements are taken much less frequently than with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although they can be spread out over more time). Blood pressure measurements should be taken at the brachial artery (upper arm) with a validated and accurate device in a seated position after 5 minutes of rest. Reasonable options include "Screening for hypertension every year in adults 40 years or older and in adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese)". Reasonable options also include "Screening less frequently (ie, every 3–5 years) as appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading".

### How well are we managing and monitoring high blood pressure? [^111YA9sK]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We will summarize the latest available data on hypertension control levels in different populations throughout the world, and review the factors that appear to contribute to the widespread lack of blood pressure control in identified hypertensive patients.

Recent Findings

Population surveys throughout the world indicate that the proportion of hypertensive patients with blood pressure controlled to below 140/90 mmHg ranges from 5% in Taiwan to 25% in the United States. Studies in the US have shown that the majority of hypertensive patients classified as uncontrolled have diastolic pressure below 90 mmHg with mild systolic elevation in the 140–160 mmHg range, and that these blood pressure levels rarely elicit a treatment intensification action by the physician. The results of the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering to Prevent Heart Attack Trial indicate that it is feasible to maintain average blood pressures on treatment to levels well below 140/90 mmHg in elderly hypertensive patients in primary care settings. Although the literature on automated blood pressure measurement and comparisons between office blood pressure and home blood pressure continues to grow, there has been little attention paid to practicing physicians' attitudes and beliefs about different blood pressure measurement methods, or to the feasibility of standardizing blood pressure measurement in typical practice settings.

Summary

The experience in the US indicates that widely publicized treatment guidelines recommending blood pressure control targets and choice of first-line agents may have little influence on practicing physicians, even when based on solid evidence from clinical trials. Controversies in the literature regarding treatment targets, appropriate drug choices, and blood pressure monitoring methods are likely to delay improvements in overall population control.

### Predictors of the home-clinic blood pressure difference: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115E93yv]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective diagnosis and management of hypertension depends on accurate measurement of blood pressure, which allows appropriate targeting of antihypertensive treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is considered to be the "gold standard" measure of blood pressure, because multiple readings are taken and because it is associated with a range of cardiovascular outcomes and end organ damage. Ambulatory blood pressure is usually lower than clinic blood pressuredue to the white coat effect (Table 1), and as such, clinical guidelines recommend that ABPM (or home) blood pressure targets are 5mm Hg lower than the corresponding clinic values. However, this "home-clinic blood pressure difference" is not always consistent. In some patients, blood pressures measured at home or with ABPM are higher than would be expected for the corresponding clinic blood pressure, the so-called masked effect (Table 1). Such patients are likely to be undertreated and have increased target organ damage, with subsequent increased cardiovascular mortality compared to normotensive patients.

Table 1.
Definitions of the home-clinic blood pressure difference

Clinic blood pressure monitoring is still recommended for initial screening of blood pressure in routine clinical practice, and thus, identifying those patients most likely to display a white coat or masked effect is important to avoid misdiagnosis and mismanagement of hypertension. There is a large body of literature proposing factors that predict white coat or masked hypertension, but no studies have systematically reviewed the evidence. Consequently there is little consensus as to which factors are most important or how they should be used in clinical practice to guide diagnosis and management decisions. The present study aimed to systematically review the literature and establish the most important predictors of a significant home-clinic blood pressure difference to inform interventions that might identify those with discordant clinic and ambulatory blood pressure in routine clinical practice.

Discussion

Summary of findings

This review has shown that neither clinic nor home measurements of blood pressure are sufficiently specific or sensitive in the diagnosis of hypertension. We included 20 studies with 5683 patients that compared different methods of diagnosing hypertension in diverse populations with a range of thresholds applied. In the nine studies that used similar diagnostic thresholds and were included in the meta-analysis (two comparing home with ambulatory measurement only, six comparing clinic with ambulatory measurement only, and one study comparing all three methods), neither clinic nor home measurement could be unequivocally recommended as a single diagnostic test. Clinic measurement, the current reference in most clinical work and guidelines, performed poorly in comparison with ambulatory measurement, and, given that clinic measurements are also least predictive in terms of cardiovascular outcome, this is not reassuring for daily practice. Home monitoring provided better sensitivity and might be suitable for ruling out hypertension given its relative ease of use and availability compared with ambulatory monitoring. In the case of clinic measurement, the removal of studies with a mean blood pressure in the normotensive range reduced specificity still further. This has profound implications for the management of hypertension, suggesting that ambulatory monitoring might lead to more appropriate targeting of treatment rather than starting patients on lifelong antihypertensive treatment on the basis of clinic measurements alone, as currently recommended. In clinical practice, this will be particularly important near the threshold for diagnosis, where most errors in categorisation will occur if ambulatory monitoring is not used.

### Number of measurements needed to obtain a reliable estimate of home blood pressure: results from the improving the detection of hypertension study [^112F5HHR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2015, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reaffirmed its recommendation to screen all adults 18 years and older for high blood pressure (BP). 1 The USPSTF and, more recently, the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) Guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults further recommend obtaining BP measurements outside of the clinic setting to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension before initiating treatment. 1, 2

Home BP monitoring (HBPM) is an approach for measuring out‐of‐clinic BP to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension after initial BP screening in the clinic. 3 There are few studies that have compared the reliability of different HBPM strategies that vary in the number of days HBPM is performed, the time(s) of day BP is assessed, and the number of measurements that are taken at each assessment. 4, 5, 6, 7 Based on expert opinion, several guidelines 3, 8, 9, 10, 11 have recommended that 2 home BP readings be obtained by the patient in the morning and in the evening for a preferred period of 7 days, with a minimum of 3 days of HBPM. The 2017 ACC/AHA guidelines on high BP recommend that multiple home BP readings (at least 2 readings 1 minute apart in the morning and in the evening) should be taken, and home BP should be based on an average of readings on ≥ 2 occasions for clinical decision‐making. 2

In the current study of a community‐based sample of adults not taking antihypertensive medication, we examined the reliability of mean home BP and, secondarily, hypertension status when based on 1 to 7 days of measurements, 1 to 4 readings per day, and morning or evening readings. These data can inform clinicians and patients on how HBPM should be conducted to obtain a reliable estimate of mean home BP.

### What is the evidence base for diagnosing hypertension and for subsequent blood pressure treatment targets in the prevention of cardiovascular disease? [^114oufuD]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Where and how are patients currently diagnosed?

Since 2011, in the UK, guidelines from NICE have recommended that a raised clinic BP reading (≥ 140/90 mmHg) in an undiagnosed patient should be followed by confirmatory ABPM, unless BP ≥ 180/110 mmHg. Home BP measurement can be used as an alternative if ABPM is not available or tolerated.

In comparison, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) practice guidelines (2013) recommend that office BP remains the "gold standard" for screening, diagnosis and management of hypertension. However, for diagnostic purposes they recommend that ABPM or home BP is used in the case of suspected white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, grade I hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg) and high-normal BP, which can be interpreted as a broad recommendation for use.

The Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) have recently updated their recommendations for the diagnosis of hypertension to include the use of ABPM and home BP monitoring. For any office BP measurement > 140/90 mmHg but < 180/110 mmHg, out-of-office measurement should be used to rule out white coat hypertension. ABPM readings should be taken every 20–30 minutes during the day and every 30–60 minutes at night. At least 20 daytime readings and 7 nighttime readings are required to obtain an accurate average reading. Home BP should be measured using validated monitors that have met the standards set by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI). Hypertension diagnoses using home monitoring should be based on duplicate measurements taken morning and evening for a 7-day period, with the first day discarded. A diagnostic target of ≥ 135/85 mmHg is recommended for all out-of-office measurements. In the USA, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) report updated the threshold for a diagnosis of hypertension in those aged 60 years and over, and those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, but maintained previous recommendations on the use of clinic BP for routine diagnosis of hypertension. More recent evidence reviews in America have recommended updating guidelines to include ABPM for all new diagnoses of hypertension and as a way of quickly diagnosing white coat or masked hypertension. Overall, the direction of travel in guidelines in Europe and North America is firmly towards greater use of out-of-office measurement of BP in the diagnosis of hypertension.

### Call to action on use and reimbursement for home blood pressure monitoring: executive summary: a joint scientific statement from the American Heart Association, American society of hypertension, and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association [^113VhYwU]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: current status and new developments [^112hQZan]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is a reliable, convenient, and less costly alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Recognition and use of HBPM have dramatically increased over the last 20 years and current guidelines make strong recommendations for the use of both HBPM and ABPM in patients with hypertension. The accuracy and reliability of home blood pressure (BP) measurements require use of a validated device and standardized procedures, and good patient information and training. Key HBPM parameters include morning BP, evening BP, and the morning-evening difference. In addition, newer semi-automatic HBPM devices can also measure nighttime BP at fixed intervals during sleep. Advances in technology mean that HBPM devices could provide additional relevant data (e.g., environmental conditions) or determine BP in response to a specific trigger (e.g., hypoxia, increased heart rate). The value of HBPM is highlighted by a growing body of evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of target organ damage, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)- and stroke-related morbidity and mortality, and provides better prognostic information than office BP. In addition, use of HBPM to monitor antihypertensive therapy can help to optimize reductions in BP, improve BP control, and reduce target organ damage and cardiovascular risk. Overall, HBPM should play a central role in the management of patients with hypertension, with the goal of identifying increased risk and predicting the onset of CVD events, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk and eliminate adverse outcomes.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: a new standard method for monitoring hypertension control in treated patients [^111cKakx]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2008). Medium credibility.

Inadequate blood pressure (BP) control in patients with treated hypertension can be influenced by patient behavior, the inaccuracy of BP measurement in the clinical setting, and the fact that no single class of medication is universally effective. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) enables accurate measurement of BP and has been recommended (by multiple societies and associations) for the diagnosis of hypertension and the evaluation of antihypertensive treatment. Although HBPM is thought to improve BP control as a result of patients' increased adherence to their medication, this improvement is limited. Green et al. have shown that HBPM in combination with regular internet correspondence with a medical professional is a highly effective therapeutic strategy for BP control, possibly because this strategy is associated with an increase in number of prescriptions. This strategy should, therefore, be routinely used in the management of patients with hypertension.

### Home blood pressure measurement: a systematic review [^116fXvvK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this research was to review the literature on home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) and to provide recommendations regarding HBPM assessment. Observational studies on HBPM, published after 1992, as identified by PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane literature searches were reviewed. Studies were selected if they met the following criteria: 1) self-measurements had been performed with validated devices; 2) measurement procedures were described in sufficient detail; and 3) papers clearly explained how final HBPM results were calculated upon which conclusions and/or treatment decisions were based. Office blood pressure measurement (OBPM) yields higher blood pressure values than HBPM. For systolic blood pressure, differences between OBPM and HBPM increase with age and the height of office pressure. Differences also tend to be greater in men than in women and greater in patients without than in those with antihypertensive treatment. Furthermore, HBPM can diagnose normotension with almost absolute certainty; it correlates better with target organ damage and cardiovascular mortality than OBPM, it enables prediction of sustained hypertension in patients with borderline hypertension, and it proves to be an appropriate tool for assessing drug efficacy. Despite some limitations and although more data are needed, HBPM is suitable for routine clinical practice.

### Cardiovascular outcomes in the first trial of antihypertensive therapy guided by self-measured home blood pressure [^111gsyy4]. Hypertension Research (2012). Low credibility.

Hypertension guidelines recommend blood pressure self-measurement at home (HBP), but no previous trial has assessed cardiovascular outcomes in hypertensive patients treated according to HBP. The multicenter Hypertension Objective Treatment Based on Measurement by Electrical Devices of Blood Pressure (HOMED-BP; 2001–2010) trial involved 3518 patients (50% women; mean age 59.6 years) with an untreated systolic/diastolic HBP of 135–179/85–119 mm Hg. In a 2 × 3 design, patients were randomized to usual control (125–134/80–84 mm Hg (UC)) vs. tight control (< 125/ < 80 mm Hg (TC)) of HBP and to initiation of drug treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers or calcium channel blockers. During follow-up, a computer algorithm automatically generated treatment recommendations based on HBP. At the last follow-up (median 5.3 years), TC patients used more antihypertensive drugs than UC patients (1.82 vs. 1.74 defined daily doses, P = 0.045) and had a greater HBP reduction (21.3/13.1 mm Hg vs. 22.7/13.9 mm Hg, P = 0.018/0.020), but they less frequently achieved the lower HBP targets (37.4 vs. 63.5%, P < 0.0001). The primary end point, cardiovascular death plus stroke and myocardial infarction, occurred in 25 UC and 26 TC patients (hazard ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.59–1.77; P = 0.94). Rates were similar (P ≥ 0.13) in the three drug groups. In all patients combined, the risk of the primary end point independently increased by 41% (6–89%; P = 0.019) and 47% (15–87%; P = 0.0020) for a 1-s.d. increase in baseline (12.5 mm Hg) and follow-up (13.2 mm Hg) systolic HBP. The 5-year risk was minimal (≤ 1%) if on-treatment systolic HBP was 131.6 mm Hg or less. HOMED-BP proved the feasibility of adjusting antihypertensive drug treatment based on HBP and suggests that a systolic HBP level of 130 mm Hg should be an achievable and safe target.

### Home blood pressure monitoring in clinical practice: a review [^112pRGFQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring is a convenient and inexpensive technique to monitor blood pressure in hypertensive patients. There are convincing data that home blood pressure monitoring is a good predictor of future cardiovascular risk, perhaps better than office blood pressure. Home blood pressure measurement can be standardized using validated instruments and systematic protocols; normative criteria have established home blood pressure > 135/85 mm Hg as hypertensive. Home blood pressure monitoring has been shown to improve compliance and blood pressure control, and to reduce health care costs. Ongoing studies are evaluating management of hypertension based on home blood pressure readings compared with traditional office-based readings. Home blood pressure monitoring is particularly useful for evaluation of white coat hypertension and masked hypertension. In this article, we discuss the methodology for measuring blood pressure at home, its comparison to the other measurement techniques, the advantages and disadvantages, cost benefit analyses, and ongoing clinical trials to help define the role of home blood pressure monitoring in the clinical management of hypertension.

### Expert panel consensus recommendations for home blood pressure monitoring in Asia: the hope Asia network [^112cgPSp]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the leading cause of mortality throughout Asia. Home blood pressure monitoring has the potential to improve hypertension control and is a useful adjunct to conventional office blood pressure measurements due to its diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value in predicting cardiovascular outcomes. At present, there are no region-specific guidelines addressing the use of home blood pressure monitoring in Asia. Therefore, an expert panel was convened to address the use of home blood pressure monitoring and develop key recommendations to help guide clinical practice throughout the Asia region. The resulting recommendations support the use of home blood pressure monitoring with a validated device as an accurate adjunct for diagnosing hypertension and predicting cardiovascular outcome. Diagnosis and treatment of hypertension should still be guided by conventional office/clinic blood pressure measurements. The expert panel encourages the incorporation of home blood pressure monitoring into local clinical guidelines and offers practical recommendations to ensure continuity of care where a validated home blood pressure device is not available.

### The case for home monitoring in hypertension [^116VMteG]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Although the assessment of cardiovascular risk in individual patients takes into account a range of risk factors, the diagnosis and management of hypertension (high blood pressure) is largely determined by a single numerical value, albeit that often several readings are taken over time. Given the critical impact of a decision to embark on lifelong drug therapy, the importance of ensuring that a blood pressure (BP) record is both accurate and representative is clear. However, there is good evidence that the variability of BP is such that even if measurement is of the highest quality, it can be difficult to say with confidence whether a patient is above or below a treatment threshold. This commentary argues that current BP measurement is inadequate to make the clinical decisions that are necessary and that multiple readings are required to deliver an acceptable degree of accuracy for safe decision-making. This is impractical in a doctor's surgery, and the only realistic long-term strategy is to involve the patient in measuring his or her own BP in their own environment. Evidence is presented that such a strategy is better able to predict risk, is cost-effective for diagnosing hypertension, can improve BP control and is thus better able to protect individuals in the future. In this commentary, I explain why doctors and other healthcare professionals should increase their familiarity with the technology, be aware of its strengths and limitations and work with patients as they become more empowered in the management of their chronic condition, hypertension.

### Self-measured blood pressure monitoring at home: a joint policy statement from the American Heart Association and American medical association [^117L3HHa]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension, a common cardiovascular risk factor among the general population, have been based primarily on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office. BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse self-measured BP monitoring. Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension. Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions. The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States. Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed. To adequately address barriers to the implementation of self-measured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating self-measured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.

### The role of home blood pressure measurement in managing hypertension: an evidence-based review [^112QbTTw]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

This article reviews the current literature regarding the role of home measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the management of hypertension. Subjects with hypertension can use simple automated devices to measure their own BP at home. The results can be accurate and reliable, and because multiple readings allow a mean value to be calculated, a better estimate of the underlying BP level is obtained. Home measurement of BP gives results which are equivalent to the accepted 'gold standard' measure of ambulatory BP values, whilst using a simpler and much less expensive technique which is therefore more widely available. Both methods are better than conventional office measurements in identifying the 'true' or underlying mean BP level and identifying falsely raised levels or 'white coat hypertension'. White coat hypertension confounds the treatment of hypertension, but may not be entirely harmless. Ambulatory BP is a better predictor of cardiovascular prognosis than clinic BP. The use of home BP measurement as an equivalent, feasible, and (apparently) more cost-effective technique to measure BP in hypertension, should enable groups of patients with a poorer prognosis to be identified and their treatment adjusted in order to improve their prognosis.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: current status and new developments [^114zu4rH]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

HISTORY AND GUIDELINES

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) uses similar technology to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), but allows patients to perform their own blood pressure (BP) measurements at a time and frequency that suits them. HBPM provides information on BP at specific times and under everyday conditions over long time periods. Key advantages of HBPM include its relatively widespread availability, the ability to take multiple daily readings over a long period of time, avoidance of white-coat reactions, the ability to detect masked hypertension and BP variability, improved management of hypertension due to immediate feedback and patient involvement in their healthcare, and relatively low cost. Disadvantages include the requirement for patient education and training, measurement errors, and lack of funding in some healthcare settings.

Although ABPM is the gold standard out-of-office BP measurement, HBPM is recommended as a more practical and less expensive alternative, especially for long-term monitoring of treated patients with hypertension. Recognition and use of HBPM have increased dramatically over the last 20 years. Current hypertension guideline documents make strong recommendations for the use of out-of-office BP monitoring techniques, including HBPM and ABPM, for the diagnosis of hypertension and for the monitoring and management of antihypertensive therapy (Table 1).

Table 1.
Home blood pressure monitoring recommendations in major guideline and consensus documents

Patients for whom out-of-office BP monitoring with HBPM is indicated include those with high office BP (to detect white-coat hypertension), high-normal office BP or normal office BP with hypertension-mediated organ damage or high cardiovascular (CV) risk (to detect masked hypertension), highly variable office BP or resistant hypertension, and for evaluating BP control (especially in high-risk patients). The Japanese guidelines state that where there is a discrepancy between office BP and home BP readings, a home BP-based diagnosis should take precedence.

### Blood pressure measurement: a KDOQI perspective [^113ghkYQ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have elevated blood pressure (BP). In patients with CKD, hypertension is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease, progression of CKD, and all-cause mortality. New guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommend new thresholds and targets for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension in patients with and without CKD. A new aspect of the guidelines is the recommendation for measurement of out-of-office BP to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension and guide therapy. In this KDOQI (Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative) perspective, we review the recommendations for accurate BP measurement in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring. Regardless of location, validated devices and appropriate cuff sizes should be used. In the clinic and at home, proper patient preparation and positioning are critical. Patients should receive information about the importance of BP measurement techniques and be encouraged to advocate for adherence to guideline recommendations. Implementing appropriate BP measurement in routine practice is feasible and should be incorporated in system-wide efforts to improve the care of patients with hypertension. Hypertension is the number 1 chronic disease risk factor in the world; BP measurements in the office, at home, and with ambulatory BP monitoring should adhere to recommendations from the AHA.

### Home blood pressure monitoring [^117Vf4FG]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Home blood pressure monitoring provides important diagnostic information beyond in-office blood pressure readings and offers similar results to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring involves patients independently measuring their blood pressure with an electronic device, whereas ambulatory blood pressure monitoring involves patients wearing a portable monitor for 24 to 48 hours. Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is the diagnostic standard for measurement, home blood pressure monitoring is more practical and accessible to patients, and its use is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association. Home blood pressure monitoring generally results in lower blood pressure readings than in-office measurements, can confirm the diagnosis of hypertension after an elevated office blood pressure reading, and can identify patients with white coat hypertension or masked hypertension. Best practices for home blood pressure monitoring include using an appropriately fitting upper-arm cuff on a bare arm, emptying the bladder, avoiding caffeinated beverages for 30 minutes before taking the measurement, resting for five minutes before taking the measurement, keeping the feet on the floor uncrossed and the arm supported with the cuff at heart level, and not talking during the reading. An average of multiple readings, ideally two readings in the morning and again in the evening separated by at least one minute each, is recommended for one week. Home blood pressure readings can be used in hypertension quality measures.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: current status and new developments [^11776m2Z]. American Journal of Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is a reliable, convenient, and less costly alternative to ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Recognition and use of HBPM have dramatically increased over the last 20 years and current guidelines make strong recommendations for the use of both HBPM and ABPM in patients with hypertension. The accuracy and reliability of home blood pressure (BP) measurements require use of a validated device and standardized procedures, and good patient information and training. Key HBPM parameters include morning BP, evening BP, and the morning–evening difference. In addition, newer semi-automatic HBPM devices can also measure nighttime BP at fixed intervals during sleep. Advances in technology mean that HBPM devices could provide additional relevant data (e.g. environmental conditions) or determine BP in response to a specific trigger (e.g. hypoxia, increased heart rate). The value of HBPM is highlighted by a growing body of evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of target organ damage, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)- and stroke-related morbidity and mortality, and provides better prognostic information than office BP. In addition, use of HBPM to monitor antihypertensive therapy can help to optimize reductions in BP, improve BP control, and reduce target organ damage and cardiovascular risk. Overall, HBPM should play a central role in the management of patients with hypertension, with the goal of identifying increased risk and predicting the onset of CVD events, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk and eliminate adverse outcomes.

### Home blood pressure monitoring [^111KAgtp]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension have been based primarily on blood pressure (BP) measurement in the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of office BP. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) consists of the measurement of BP by a person outside of the office at home and is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. HBPM provides valuable data for diagnosing and managing hypertension. Another validated approach, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), has been considered to be the reference standard of out-of-office BP measurement. However, HBPM offers potential advantages over ABPM including being a better measure of basal BP, wide availability to patients and clinicians, evidence supporting its use for better office BP control, and demonstrated efficacy when using telemonitoring along with HBPM. This state-of-the-art review examines the current state of HBPM and includes discussion of recent hypertension guidelines on HBPM, advantages of using telemonitoring with HBPM, use of self-titration of antihypertensive medication with HBPM, validation of HBPM devices, best practices for conducting HBPM in the clinical setting, how HBPM can be used as an implementation strategy approach to improve BP control in the United States, health equity in HBPM use, and HBPM use among specific populations. Finally, research gaps and future directions of HBPM are reviewed.

### Home blood pressure monitoring: Australian expert consensus statement [^115Fo1K2]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of blood pressure (BP) by a doctor in the clinic has limitations that may result in an unrepresentative measure of underlying BP which can impact on the appropriate assessment and management of high BP. Home BP monitoring is the self-measurement of BP in the home setting (usually in the morning and evening) over a defined period (e.g. 7 days) under the direction of a healthcare provider. When it may not be feasible to measure 24-h ambulatory BP, home BP may be offered as a method to diagnose and manage patients with high BP. Home BP has good reproducibility, is well tolerated, is relatively inexpensive and is superior to clinic BP for prognosis of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Home BP can be used in combination with clinic BP to identify 'white coat' and 'masked' hypertension. An average home BP of at least 135/85mmHg is an appropriate threshold for the diagnosis of hypertension. Home BP may also offer the advantage of empowering patients with their BP management, with benefits including increased adherence to therapy and lower achieved BP levels. It is recommended that, when feasible, home BP should be considered for routine use in the clinical management of hypertension.

### Status of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and home blood pressure monitoring for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the US: an up-to-date review [^111PL8qq]. Hypertension Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The diagnosis and management of hypertension has been based on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office setting. However, data have demonstrated that BP may substantially differ when measured in the office than when measured outside the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are validated approaches for out-of-office BP measurement. In the 2015 and 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reports on screening for hypertension, ABPM was recommended as the reference standard for out-of-office BP monitoring and for confirming an initial diagnosis of hypertension. This recommendation was based on data from more published studies of ABPM vs. HBPM on the predictive value of out-of-office BP independent of office BP. Therefore, HBPM was recommended as an alternative approach when ABPM was not available or well tolerated. The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline recommended ABPM as the preferred initial approach for detecting white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension among adults not taking antihypertensive medication. In contrast, HBPM was recommended as the preferred initial approach for detecting the white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among adults taking antihypertensive medication. The current review provides an overview of ABPM and HBPM in the US, including best practices, BP thresholds that should be used for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, barriers to widespread use of such monitoring, US guideline recommendations for ABPM and HBPM, and data supporting HBPM over ABPM.

### Measuring blood pressure for decision making and quality reporting: where and how many measures? [^115ESpMe]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal setting and number of blood pressure (BP) measurements that should be used for clinical decision making and quality reporting are uncertain.

Objective

To compare strategies for home or clinic BP measurement and their effect on classifying patients as having BP that was in or out of control.

Design

Secondary analysis of a randomized, controlled trial of strategies to improve hypertension management. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00237692)

Setting

Primary care clinics affiliated with the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

Patients

444 veterans with hypertension followed for 18 months.

Measurements

Blood pressure was measured repeatedly by using 3 methods: standardized research BP measurements at 6-month intervals; clinic BP measurements obtained during outpatient visits; and home BP measurements using a monitor that transmitted measurements electronically.

Results

Patients provided 111,181 systolic BP (SBP) measurements (3218 research, 7121 clinic, and 100,842 home measurements) over 18 months. Systolic BP control rates at baseline (mean SBP < 140 mm Hg for clinic or research measurement; < 135 mm Hg for home measurement) varied substantially, with 28% classified as in control by clinic measurement, 47% by home measurement, and 68% by research measurement. Short-term variability was large and similar across all 3 methods of measurement, with a mean within-patient coefficient of variation of 10% (range, 1% to 24%). Patients could not be classified as having BP that was in or out of control with 80% certainty on the basis of a single clinic SBP measurement from 120 mm Hg to 157 mm Hg. The effect of within-patient variability could be greatly reduced by averaging several measurements, with most benefit accrued at 5 to 6 measurements.

Limitation

The sample was mostly men with a long-standing history of hypertension and was selected on the basis of previous poor BP control.

Conclusion

Physicians who want to have 80% or more certainty that they are correctly classifying patients' BP control should use the average of several measurements. Hypertension quality metrics based on a single clinic measurement potentially misclassify a large proportion of patients.

### Home blood pressure measurements are not performed according to guidelines and standardized education is urgently needed [^116B6LA6]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Patient education is needed to perform home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) according to blood pressure (BP) guidelines. It is not known how BP is measured at home and what education is provided, which was the aim of the study.

Methods

Mixed-methods study among Australian adults who perform HBPM (June to December 2023). Participants completed a 30-item online survey on whether they followed guideline recommendations and the education they received for HBPM. Phone interviews were conducted among a purposive sample to further explore survey topics.

Results

Participants (n = 350) were middle-aged (58 ± 16 years; 54% women), and most (n = 250, 71%) had hypertension. Guideline recommendations for HBPM were not always followed by survey participants. Most participants measured BP seated (n = 316, 90%) with the cuff fitted to a bare arm (n = 269, 77%). Only 15% measured BP in the morning and evening (n = 54) and 26% averaged the BP readings over 7 days (n = 90). Interview participants (n = 34) described measuring BP at "different times of the day after doing different things". One-third of participants (n = 112, 37%) received education for HBPM, which interview participants described as vague verbal instructions from health care practitioners. Participants who received education did not perform high-quality HBPM. Participants who did not receive education mimicked BP measurement methods of health care practitioners, "I do it the way I've seen them do it".

Conclusions

HBPM is not performed according to guideline recommendations, and adults who received ad hoc education did not perform high-quality HBPM. These findings highlight a need for effective education to support HBPM for clinical decision-making.

### Blood pressure control by home monitoring: meta-analysis of randomised trials [^115Rxck4]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure levels and proportion of people with essential hypertension achieving targets.

Design

Meta-analysis of 18 randomised controlled trials.

Participants

1359 people with essential hypertension allocated to home blood pressure monitoring and 1355 allocated to the "control" group seen in the healthcare system for 2–36 months.

Main Outcome Measures

Differences in systolic (13 studies), diastolic (16 studies), or mean (3 studies) blood pressures, and proportion of patients achieving targets (6 studies), between intervention and control groups.

Results

Systolic blood pressure was lower in people with hypertension who had home blood pressure monitoring than in those who had standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system (standardised mean difference 4.2 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 6.9) mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure was lower by 2.4 (1.2 to 3.5) mm Hg, and mean blood pressure was lower by 4.4 (2.0 to 6.8) mm Hg. The relative risk of blood pressure above predetermined targets was lower in people with home blood pressure monitoring (risk ratio 0.90, 0.80 to 1.00). When publication bias was allowed for, the differences were attenuated: 2.2 (-0.9 to 5.3) mm Hg for systolic blood pressure and 1.9 (0.6 to 3.2) mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure.

Conclusions

Blood pressure control in people with hypertension (assessed in the clinic) and the proportion achieving targets are increased when home blood pressure monitoring is used rather than standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system. The reasons for this are not clear. The difference in blood pressure control between the two methods is small but likely to contribute to an important reduction in vascular complications in the hypertensive population.

### Economic evaluation of blood pressure monitoring techniques in patients with hypertension: a systematic review [^111ndqzx]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Blood pressure monitoring is critical to the timely diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. At-home self-monitoring techniques are highly effective in managing high blood pressure; however, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of at-home self-monitoring compared with traditional monitoring in clinical settings remains unclear.

Objective

To identify and synthesize published research examining the cost-effectiveness of at-home blood pressure self-monitoring relative to monitoring in a clinical setting among patients with hypertension.

Evidence Review

A systematic literature search of 5 databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit, and CINAHL) followed by a backward citation search was conducted in September 2022. Full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English including patients with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ≥ 130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure ≥ 80 mm Hg) at baseline were included. Data from studies comparing at-home self-monitoring with clinical-setting monitoring alternatives were extracted, and the outcomes of interest included incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. Non-peer-reviewed studies or studies with pregnant women and children were excluded. To ensure accuracy and reliability, 2 authors independently evaluated all articles for eligibility and extracted relevant data from the selected articles.

Findings

Of 1607 articles identified from 5 databases, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the US (6 [40%]) and in the UK (6 [40%]), and almost all studies (14 [90%]) used a health care insurance system perspective to determine costs. Nearly half the studies used quality-adjusted life-years gained and cost per 1-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure as outcomes. Overall, at-home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) was found to be more cost-effective than monitoring in a clinical setting, particularly over a minimum 10-year time horizon. Among studies comparing HBPM alone vs 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or HBPM combined with additional support or team-based care, the latter were found to be more cost-effective.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review, at-home blood pressure self-monitoring, particularly using automatic 24-hour continuous blood pressure measurements or combined with additional support or team-based care, demonstrated the potential to be cost-effective long-term compared with care in the physical clinical setting and could thus be prioritized for patients with hypertension from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.

### Emergence of home blood pressure-guided management of hypertension based on global evidence [^113J39Jp]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension from the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension and the 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), have stressed the importance of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurement for hypertension management. There has been a similar emphasis on out-of-office BP monitoring for the management of hypertension in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and other Asian countries. – Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are 2 well-validated approaches for measuring out-of-office BP. In the published literature, HBPM is a term that has commonly referred to the self-measurement of BP at home, although in some studies, HBPM has been used to describe a provider or research assistant measuring an individual's BP in his/her home. ABPM and HBPM can identify white coat hypertension (diagnostic disagreement between office and out-of-office BP in untreated subjects) and white coat uncontrolled hypertension (diagnostic disagreement in treated subjects). – Although ABPM has been the preferred method for out-of-office measurement, the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline considered HBPM to be a more practical approach in clinical practice than ABPM, particularly for individuals taking antihypertensive medication. The 2014 Japanese Society of Hypertension Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension proposed HBPM as the most effective and practical for guiding antihypertensive medication initiation and titration in clinical care, while waiting for intervention trials demonstrating better cardiovascular outcomes in patients managed based on out-of-office BP levels.

### Diagnostic accuracy of office blood pressure measurement and home blood pressure monitoring for hypertension screening among adults: results from the IDH study [^11413vf1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Recent hypertension guidelines and the 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) report recommend using office blood pressure (BP) measurements as an initial screening test for identifying hypertension and to use out‐of‐office BP monitoring for confirming the presence of high BP among those who have high office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) has been recommended as a reference standard for out‐of‐office BP monitoring over home BP monitoring (HBPM).HBPM has been recommended as an alternative to ABPM.

A key question that was addressed in a 2021 systematic review by Guirguis‐Blake et alfor the USPSTF was the diagnostic accuracy of high office BP based on initial single visit as screening for hypertension compared with high awake BP or 24‐hour BP on ABPM, the reference standard. Other key questions were the diagnostic accuracy of high confirmatory office BP, defined as high office BP at a subsequent visit or visits, and separately, the diagnostic accuracy of high BP on HBPM, each compared with high awake BP or 24‐hour BP on ABPM among adults with an initially high office BP. However, there were several evidence‐based gaps in the 2021 systematic review by Guirguis‐Blake et al. All studies in the pooled analyses used the BP thresholds for hypertension recommended in the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure guideline: high office BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg, high home BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg, high awake BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg, and high 24‐hour BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg. None of the studies used the BP thresholds recommended in the more recent 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline: high office BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, high home BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, high awake BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg, and high 24‐hour BP ≥ 125/75 mm Hg. Further, studies using awake BP and, separately, 24‐hour BP, as the reference standard were placed in the same pooled analysis without being distinguished from one another. Awake BP is recommended as the reference standard for diagnosing hypertension in the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline. Finally, most studies used the auscultatory method with a mercury sphygmomanometer to measure office BP instead of the oscillometric method, which is more common in clinical practice.

### Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring to diagnose and manage hypertension [^114XL4B1]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Application

The rational management of hypertension inevitably starts with accurate measurement of BP. Americanand Europeanguidelines are unanimous in recommending ambulatory BP monitoring in all patients under consideration for BP-lowering medication. The idea behind these recommendations is to exclude white-coat hypertension and to diagnose masked hypertension, pending on the clinical indications summarized in Table 3. If multiple treatment adjustments are required, as may often be the case, then repeating ambulatory monitoring or other approaches, such as home BP monitoringor automated office BP measurement, are justified. While uptitrating antihypertensive drug treatment, 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring allows excluding excessive BP lowering during the night or during activities in the upright position (Table 3). After having optimized treatment, it would seem reasonable to repeat ambulatory monitoring during follow-up to ensure that adequate BP reduction has been achieved.

Table 3.
Clinical Indications for Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring

Ambulatory and home BP monitoring are complimentary techniques, in particular in the follow-up of white-coat hypertensive patients. Office BP measurement remains the standard screening method for the diagnosis of hypertension. When office BP is elevated in the absence of target organ damage or when patients with a normal clinic BP show unexplained target organ damage, ambulatory BP monitoring combined with home BP measurement can be applied, as for instance proposed in Figure 3. Home BP measurement, especially if combined with telemonitoring, is a powerful instrument in educating and empowering patients. In a randomized clinical trial, involving 450 patients recruited at 59 primary care practices in the United Kingdom and followed up for 12 months, self-monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensive dugs lowered systolic BP 8.8 mm Hg more (CI, 4.9–12.7 mm Hg) than usual care based on office BP measurement. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelineendorses home above ambulatory monitoring in the adjustment of BP-lowering treatment, certainly when BP must be repeatedly measured at short time intervals.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^114VwHvs]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertension screening — screening intervals and implementation details. The USPSTF suggests annual screening for hypertension in adults 40 years or older and for adults at increased risk for hypertension (such as Black persons, persons with high-normal blood pressure, or persons who are overweight or obese). Screening less frequently (e.g., every 3 to 5 years) is appropriate for adults aged 18 to 39 years not at increased risk for hypertension and with a prior normal blood pressure reading. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers the most evidence-based risk information for future cardiovascular events. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring devices are small portable machines that record blood pressure noninvasively at typically 20- to 30-minute intervals over 12 to 24 hours while patients go about their normal activities or are asleep. Home blood pressure monitoring devices are fully automated oscillometric devices that record measurements taken from the patient's brachial artery, are activated by patients or caregivers, and measurements are taken much less frequently than with ABPM (eg, 1 to 2 times a day or week, although the blood pressure measurements can be spread out over more time).

### Factors associated with physician recommendation of home blood pressure monitoring and blood pressure in the US population [^111jfq2f]. American Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypertension guidelines recommend home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to help achieve blood pressure (BP) control. We hypothesized that HBPM use with a physician recommendation would be associated with lower BP and greater medication adherence.

Methods

We used data from 6,320 adults with hypertension in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009–2014 to characterize the association of (i) provider recommendation for HBPM and (ii) HBPM use on 2 outcomes: measured BP (linear regression) and medication adherence (logistic regression). Provider recommendation, HBPM use, and medication use were self-reported.

Results

Among adults with hypertension, 30.1% reported a physician recommendation for HBPM, among whom 82.0% reported using HBPM. Among those who did not report a physician recommendation for HBPM, 28.3% used HBPM. Factors associated with a physician recommendation were having health insurance, higher education attainment, hypertension awareness, and having a prescription for antihypertensive medication. Among those who reported receiving a physician recommendation, those who used HBPM had a mean BP that was 3.1/4.5 mm Hg lower than those who did not. Those who reported having a physician recommendation and using HBPM were more likely to report hypertension medication adherence (odds ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval: 2.0, 4.4).

Conclusions

HBPM use was associated with lower BP and higher medication adherence. Use of HBPM was higher among those with a physician recommendation. These results support a role for physicians in counseling and partnering with patients on HBPM use for BP management.

### Emergence of home blood pressure-guided management of hypertension based on global evidence [^1172Hgwb]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Perspectives

In the era of exponential progress in the field of information and communication technology, having home BP values self-measured by patients daily, and remotely sent to electronic health records and providers may increase the accuracy of hypertension diagnosis, and the efficacy of its management, in particular when HBPM is accompanied by co-interventions. In addition, HBPM accompanied by information on patients' living conditions could provide integrated data that might more precisely guide hypertension management, thus helping to reduce CVD risk. Available evidence suggests that HBPM is an important adjunct to office BP measurement for the diagnosis of hypertension and for monitoring BP control among patients taking antihypertensive medication. In addition, HBPM may itself have a favorable impact on hypertension control, by improving medication adherence. Although office BP remains the standard method for evaluating BP in real-world clinical practice, data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that HBPM particularly when accompanied by co-interventions reduces BP and is associated with a higher rate of BP control. Therefore, HBPM is an important tool for the management of hypertension.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^1141A7Qr]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF hypertension screening — initial test and diagnostic confirmation. Initial screening for hypertension should be performed with office blood pressure measurement (OBPM). Office blood pressure measurement is most commonly performed using a manual or automated sphygmomanometer. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) with validated and accurate devices should be used outside of a clinical setting to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension before starting treatment. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring involves wearing a programmed device that automatically takes frequent blood pressure measurements over the course of a day (or day and night), whereas HBPM involves patients measuring their own blood pressure at home with an HBPM device.

### Japanese society of hypertension (JSH) guidelines for self-monitoring of blood pressure at home [^116hycER]. Hypertension Research (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Home blood pressure (BP) measurements are indispensable for the improvement of hypertension management in medical practice as well as for the recognition of hypertension in the population. The Working Group for Establishment of Guidelines for Measurement Procedures of Self-Monitoring of Blood Pressure at Home of the Japanese Society of Hypertension has established standards for all techniques and procedures of home BP measurements. The recommendations are as follows.

Recommendation

1) Arm-cuff devices based on the cuff-oscillometric method that have been validated officially, and the accuracy of which has been confirmed in each individual, should be used for home BP measurement. 2) The BP should be measured at the upper arm. Finger-cuff devices and wrist-cuff devices should not be used for home BP measurements. 3) Devices for home BP measurement should be adapted to the American Association for Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) standards and the British Hypertension Society (BHS) guidelines. In addition, the difference between the BP measured by the auscultatory method and that measured using the device should be within 5 mmHg in each individual. The home measurement device should be validated before use, and at regular intervals during use. 4) Home BP should be monitored under the following conditions. The morning measurement should be made within 1 h after waking, after micturition, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest, before drug ingestion, and before breakfast. The evening measurement should be made just before going to bed, sitting after 1 to 2 min of rest. 5) Home BP should be measured at least once in the morning and once in the evening. 6) All home BP measurements should be documented without selection, together with the date, time, and pulse rate. Use of devices with a printer or an integrated circuit memory is useful to avoid selection bias. 7) The home BP in the morning and that in the evening should be averaged separately for a certain period. The first measurement on each occasion should be used for totaling. 8) Home BP values averaged for a certain period indicate hypertension when 135/80 mmHg and over and definite hypertension when 135/85 mmHg and over. Normotension is defined as less than 125/80 mmHg and definite normotension as less than 125/75 mmHg. Home BP measurements based on these guidelines can be considered an appropriate tool for clinical decision-making, and it is hoped that these guidelines will serve to reduce confusion and confirm the place of home BP measurement in clinical practice.

### The great myth of office blood pressure measurement [^112fDjZ1]. Journal of Hypertension (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines have traditionally recommended manual blood pressure (BP) measurement in the office setting as the standard method for diagnosing hypertension. In reality, manual BP in routine clinical practice is relatively inaccurate, over-diagnoses hypertension by provoking office-induced increases in BP and correlates poorly with both the awake ambulatory BP and target organ damage. The most recent guidelines recommend 24-h ambulatory BP and home BP for diagnosing hypertension. The advent of automated office BP (AOBP) represents a third alternative to conventional manual BP measurement, one that maintains the role of office BP readings in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. AOBP has three basic principles: multiple readings taken using a fully automated sphygmomanometer with the patient resting quietly alone. AOBP eliminates office-induced hypertension such that the cut-point for a normal AOBP is the same as for the awake ambulatory BP and home BP. As compared to routine manual office BP, AOBP provides more accurate BP readings, is more consistent during repeated office visits and in different settings and correlates better with both the awake ambulatory BP and target organ damage. The advantages of AOBP over manual BP measurement support its use in routine clinical practice.

### Automated blood pressure measuring devices: how are they clinically validated for accuracy? [^116ui8Uo]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Accurate blood pressure (BP) assessment is essential for the optimal diagnosis and management of hypertension. Contemporary clinical practice guidelines strongly endorse use of automated cuff blood pressure measuring devices (BPMD) as the preferred means of measuring and monitoring BP in the office, at home and with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. To ensure that they are accurate, automated BPMDs should undergo clinical validation testing, performed using an established clinical validation standard. Unfortunately, most BPMDs sold on the global market have not been clinically validated. Furthermore, in the last thirty years, several different clinical validation protocols have been published, with major differences apparent between these standards, causing controversy with respect to which standard is considered acceptable for clinical validation. Complexly worded standards, multiple revisions, and firewalled access also contribute to a lack of understanding and use of clinical validation standards and the number of expert centers performing clinical validations is small. Recently, joint society collaborations have led to creation of the AAMI/ESH/ISO universal standard for the clinical validation of automated cuff BPMDs. Not only is this unified standard a necessary step, but oversight from regulators and influential stakeholders to ensure that only clinically validated BPMDs can be marketed is additionally needed.

2 PURPOSE AND SCOPE

Hypertension guidelines have to deal with a large number of complex issues, which limits the space for a detailed discussion on practical aspects of BP measurement. This has been the case for HBPM as well, which is recommended in recent hypertension guidelines but without detailed instructions on its practical application. These instructions are provided in the present manuscript, together with an update on the emerging technologies in this field in order to provide healthcare professionals with guidance that details the appropriate use of contemporary HBPM in clinical practice and research.

### The case for home monitoring in hypertension [^114ucQ3Y]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Self- or Home Blood Pressure Monitoring

There remains variability in the literature as to what to call this technology, and although the term 'home monitoring' is still used extensively, such devices can be used in any environment.

The science that led to the development of ambulatory monitors is available in small, simple-to-use self-monitors that use the same oscillometric technology and allow patients to measure blood pressure themselves semiautomatically as often as they wish or as required.

Home monitors are generally at least an order of magnitude cheaper than ambulatory devices and can be bought without reference to a health care professional in major pharmacies in the United Kingdom and many other countries.

As such electronic devices have developed; national specialist organisations have recommended that they are validated against the so-called 'gold standard' of the mercury manometer and a variety of validation protocols have been published to ensure that retailed machines are indeed accurate.

It is salutary to note that there is no obligation on a manufacturer to demonstrate accuracy before selling their devices, and there are examples of inaccurate machines being sold to the public. In Great Britain and Ireland, there are important agencies that have realised this problem and maintain a web-based list of validated devices for both patients and healthcare professionals.

The average blood pressure obtained by multiple measurements with a self-monitor approximates to the daytime average of an ambulatory monitor, and there are some who have argued that self-monitoring can displace an ambulatory monitor in all aspects of hypertension diagnosis and management. What most home monitors will still not do is measure blood pressure through the night, and it is worth mentioning in passing that there is evidence that nocturnal pressure has independent predictability in terms of cardiovascular outcomes. As we do not yet have any clinical strategies as to how to treat nocturnal pressure, this remains an area for further research rather than a practical clinical reality.

### Does this adult patient have hypertension? the rational clinical examination systematic review [^1126qbxU]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Office blood pressure (BP) measurements are not the most accurate method to diagnose hypertension. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) and 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) are out-of-office alternatives, and ABPM is considered the reference standard for BP assessment.

Objective

To systematically review the accuracy of oscillometric office and home BP measurement methods for correctly classifying adults as having hypertension, defined using ABPM.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and DARE databases and the American Heart Association website (from inception to April 2021) were searched, along with reference lists from retrieved articles.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently abstracted raw data and assessed methodological quality. A third author resolved disputes as needed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Random effects summary sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated for BP measurement methods for the diagnosis of hypertension. ABPM (24-hour mean BP ≥ 130/80 mm Hg or mean BP while awake ≥ 135/85 mm Hg) was considered the reference standard.

Results

A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (n = 6877) that compared conventional oscillometric office BP measurements to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM and 6 studies (n = 2049) that compared mean BP on HBPM to mean BP during 24-hour ABPM were included (range, 117–2209 participants per analysis); 2 of these studies (n = 3040) used consecutive samples. The overall prevalence of hypertension identified by 24-hour ABPM was 49% (95% CI, 39%-60%) in the pooled studies that evaluated office measures and 54% (95% CI, 39%-69%) in studies that evaluated HBPM. All included studies assessed sensitivity and specificity at the office BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg and the home BP threshold of 135/85 mm Hg. Conventional office oscillometric measurement (1–5 measurements in a single visit with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) had a sensitivity of 51% (95% CI, 36%-67%), specificity of 88% (95% CI, 80%-96%), positive LR of 4.2 (95% CI, 2.5–6.0), and negative LR of 0.56 (95% CI, 0.42–0.69). Mean BP with HBPM (with BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg) had a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI, 65%-86%), specificity of 76% (95% CI, 65%-86%), positive LR of 3.1 (95% CI, 2.2–4.0), and negative LR of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.20–0.47). Two studies (1 with a consecutive sample) that compared unattended automated mean office BP (with BP ≥ 135/85 mm Hg) with 24-hour ABPM had sensitivity ranging from 48% to 51% and specificity ranging from 80% to 91%. One study that compared attended automated mean office BP (with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg) with 24-hour ABPM had a sensitivity of 87.6% (95% CI, 83%-92%) and specificity of 24.1% (95% CI, 16%-32%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Office measurements of BP may not be accurate enough to rule in or rule out hypertension; HBPM may be helpful to confirm a diagnosis. When there is uncertainty around threshold values or when office and HBPM are not in agreement, 24-hour ABPM should be considered to establish the diagnosis.

### Lancet commission on hypertension group position statement on the global improvement of accuracy standards for devices that measure blood pressure [^112bsJEV]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The Lancet Commission on Hypertension identified that a key action to address the worldwide burden of high blood pressure (BP) was to improve the quality of BP measurements by using BP devices that have been validated for accuracy. Currently, there are over 3000 commercially available BP devices, but many do not have published data on accuracy testing according to established scientific standards. This problem is enabled through weak or absent regulations that allow clearance of devices for commercial use without formal validation. In addition, new BP technologies have emerged (e.g. cuffless sensors) for which there is no scientific consensus regarding BP measurement accuracy standards. Altogether, these issues contribute to the widespread availability of clinic and home BP devices with limited or uncertain accuracy, leading to inappropriate hypertension diagnosis, management and drug treatment on a global scale. The most significant problems relating to the accuracy of BP devices can be resolved by the regulatory requirement for mandatory independent validation of BP devices according to the universally-accepted International Organisation for Standardization Standard. This is a primary recommendation for which there is an urgent international need. Other key recommendations are development of validation standards specifically for new BP technologies and online lists of accurate devices that are accessible to consumers and health professionals. Recommendations are aligned with WHO policies on medical devices and universal healthcare. Adherence to recommendations would increase the global availability of accurate BP devices and result in better diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, thus decreasing the worldwide burden from high BP.

### Use of home blood-pressure monitoring in the detection, treatment and surveillance of hypertension [^114TVqLM]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Use of home blood-pressure monitoring is increasing but the technique and the equipment have limitations. We provide an overview of recent evidence in this rapidly evolving field.

Recent Findings

Home blood-pressure monitoring is an acceptable method for screening patients for hypertension. There is increasing evidence supporting the predictive power of home blood pressure for stroke risk even in the general population. The identification of white-coat and masked hypertension remains an important role for home blood-pressure monitoring. Unvalidated equipment and poor patient technique are major concerns. The purchase of devices needs to be linked to a simple patient-education programme, which is perhaps an opportunity for collaboration between healthcare providers and commercial companies. Devices that store the blood-pressure measurements in the memory are preferred to ensure accuracy of reporting. Data-transmission systems providing automatic storage, transmission and reporting of blood pressure, direct involvement of the patient and potentially a reduced number of hospital/general practitioner visits, offer significant advantages. To reduce patient anxiety, overuse of home blood-pressure monitoring should be avoided but there is the potential for self-modification of treatment, subject to certain safeguards.

Summary

Self-monitoring of blood pressure is developing rapidly, linked to increasing awareness of the impact of reducing high blood pressure on public health and the marketing/advertising strategies used to sell automatic devices. Home blood-pressure monitoring has a role in the detection and management of blood pressure, but not at the expense of careful blood-pressure measurement in the office and adherence to national guidelines.

### Optimal number of days for home blood pressure measurement [^114shH52]. American Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines make no outcome-based recommendations on the optimal measurement schedule for home blood pressure (BP).

Methods

We enrolled 4,802 randomly recruited participants from three populations. The participants were classified by their (i) cross-classification according to office and home BP (normotension, masked hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and sustained hypertension) and (ii) home BP level (normal BP, high normal BP, grade 1 and 2 hypertension), while the number of home measurement days was increased from 1 to 7. The prognostic accuracy of home BP with an increasing number of home BP measurement days was also assessed by multivariable-adjusted Cox models.

Results

Agreement in classification between consecutive measurement days indicated near perfect agreement (κ ≥ 0.9) after the sixth measurement day for both office and home BP cross-classification (97.8% maintained classification, κ = 0.97) and home BP level (93.6% maintained classification, κ = 0.91). Over a follow-up of 8.3 years, 568 participants experienced a cardiovascular event, and the first home BP measurement alone predicted events significantly (P ≤ 0.003). The confidence intervals (CIs) were too wide and overlapping to show superiority of multiple measurement days over the first measurement day (hazard ratios per 10mm Hg increase in systolic BP at initial day, 1.11 [CI 1.07–1.16]; that at 1–7 days, 1.18 [CI 1.12–1.24]). Masked hypertension, but not white-coat hypertension, was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, irrespective of the number of home measurement days.

Conclusion

Even a single home BP measurement is a potent predictor of cardiovascular events, whereas seven home measurement days may be needed to reliably diagnose hypertension.

8.4 HOME vs. ABPM (more details in the online supplemental file S8.4)

When combined with OBP, both HBPM and ABPM can identify white-coat and masked hypertension in untreated and treated individuals. The threshold for BP normality is indicated as similar for HBP and ambulatory daytime BP (≥ 135/85 mmHg), whereas a lower threshold is recommended for 24-h ABP (≥ 130/80 mmHg). The similar diagnostic ability of HBPM and ABPM is probably because of the fact that both methods provide multiple measurements taken away from the office setting in the usual environment of each individual. However, there are also important methodological differences between them, as HBP is measured only after few minutes rest, in a standardized sitting posture at home and during the day, whereas ABP is measured at different postures (sitting, standing and lying), in different environments (work, home, other) and during routine daytime activities and night-time sleep. Thus, HBPM and ABPM are similar but are not identical methods and the diagnostic agreement between them is sometimes a challenging clinical issue. ABPM has been indicated as the most reliable and accurate measurement of BP for diagnosing hypertension and while assessing the response to therapy, as it provides information about specific patterns of BP behavior, such as nocturnal dipping, morning surge and short-term variability over 24-h. At variance from ABPM, HBPM it is widely available, relatively inexpensive and well accepted by patients, particularly for repeated monitoring. Consequently, current guidelines recommend also HBPM as a method for the evaluation of BP in untreated individuals with suspected hypertension and, more so, for monitoring the long-term BP control in treated hypertensive patients. An important issue to consider is the reproducibility of BP information provided by HBPM and ABPM, respectively, which was shown to be similar by a direct comparison of HBPM and ABPM data in the same individuals, or even higher for HBPM. In a recent meta-analysis of 58 studies, diagnostic performance of HBPM was slightly higher than OBP. Indeed, a normal OBP can be accompanied by elevated HBP in case of masked hypertension. However, some individuals with normal HBP showed elevated BP from 24-h ABPM, suggesting that ABPM is still necessary for confirming the diagnosis of hypertension. A recent study, in agreement with previously published PAMELA study data indicated that individuals showing a diagnostic disagreement between their home and ambulatory BP may have cardiovascular risks that are intermediate between those with sustained home and ambulatory normotension and hypertension. However, no precise indications are given in available guidelines on when and in which particular patients to use ABPM or HBPM and the decision to use ABPM or HBPM often reflects the preference of the individual patient and of the healthcare provider. The healthcare system in which a patient is managed may also be a factor. Although it remains unclear whether one approach is superior to the other for diagnosing hypertension and monitoring BP control, it has to be acknowledged that HBPM and ABPM are equivalent but they measure different aspects of the BP behaviour, so they represent complementary rather than alternative approaches. See Box 19. The 2018 ESC/ESH Hypertension guidelines emphasize the complementary role of HBPM and ABPM and recommend that both methods should be used, whenever possible. Unfortunately, this is not often possible in low-resource settings because of healthcare costs and unavailability of these approaches, in particular ABPM, in daily practice, which might make HBPM the preferred out-of-office BPM method.

Hypertension monitoring — home blood pressure self-monitoring (HBPM): Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Weak for | Reviewed, New-added). When compared with usual care, home blood pressure self-monitoring has been shown to improve systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control when paired with a co-intervention, and our evidence review found two systematic reviews (SRs) of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). One SR of 29 RCTs showed improved blood pressure control compared to usual care (adjusted MD in SBP 2.7 mm Hg). Another SR and meta-analysis found that self-monitoring alone was not associated with lower blood pressure; however, when paired with co-interventions blood pressure self-monitoring was associated with a lower blood pressure (MD in SBP -6.1 mm Hg). Three additional RCTs were consistent, finding self-monitoring more effective than usual care when accompanied by medication titration in response to self-monitoring data, while studies examining medication adherence revealed no difference between self-monitoring and usual care. There was some question among the Work Group members whether a 2–4 mm Hg reduction in blood pressure was clinically significant.

We suggest using out-of-office blood pressure monitoring methods (ambulatory 24-hour monitoring or home blood pressure measurements) to inform the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Among patients treated for hypertension, we suggest offering home blood pressure self-monitoring with co-interventions for lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

INTRODUCTION

Hypertension is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease and stroke, the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the UK, hypertension affects more than 13.5 million individuals and contributes to approximately 75 000 deaths annually. Effective detection and management of hypertension requires accurate and consistent monitoring. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) has been shown to correlate more strongly with cardiovascular outcomes than office blood pressure measurements and is now recommended for both diagnosis and monitoring in national and international guidelines. HBPM has become a routine part of hypertension management in primary care, with evidence supporting improved hypertensive control when self-monitoring is combined with professional and self-titration of antihypertensive therapy.

Despite evidence for HBPM efficacy, an international consensus on the optimal HBPM strategy has yet to be reached. Current guidelines offer different recommendations regarding the number of days required for accurate assessment. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) 2024 hypertension guidelines suggest that monitoring should continue beyond three days only if the average BP approaches the treatment threshold. While Hodgkinson et al. (2019) made a similar recommendation, the ESC guidelines do not differentiate between diagnostic and long-term monitoring protocols, treating all self-monitoring periods similarly. In contrast, the NICE 2019 Hypertension Guidelines advocate for a 7-day monitoring period. While Groenland et al. propose 4.5 consecutive days of HBPM, their study population had no prior monitoring experience and monitored for a total of 7 days.

A key consideration in HBPM protocols is the well documented "day 1 effect", where systolic BP is systematically higher on the first day of monitoring, likely due to an initial alerting response. With repeated short-term BP monitoring, recorded systolic blood pressure values are known to reduce in association with a fall in the alerting reaction. It remains unclear whether this phenomenon persists with long-term self-monitoring. We hypothesise that with prolonged HBPM, BP variability decreases, leading to more stable and reliable measurements over time. If true, this could support shorter monitoring periods for long-term HBPM users and potentially challenge the necessity of excluding day 1 readings after patients have become accustomed to self-monitoring.

Utilising HBPM data collected from over 6 months, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of prior monitoring on blood pressure variability and assess whether a reduced HBPM regimen could be recommended for long-term monitors. Specifically, the study seeks to determine:

HOME BP MEASUREMENT: SCHEDULE, THRESHOLDS, AND APPROACHES

Good patient information and training, use of standardized procedures and use of a validated device are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of home BP measurements (Figure 1). Patients need to be provided with general information about hypertension diagnosis and treatment, along with guidance on how to select an appropriate HBPM device and how to measure their own BP (ideally accompanied by a hands-on demonstration). It is important to remind patients not to overuse HBPM and not to modify their antihypertensive therapy without consulting their physician. In addition to being validated, the HBPM device should use an upper-arm cuff oscillometric method (with an appropriately sized cuff) and be able to automatically store all readings; telehealth-equipped devices that can transmit readings to healthcare providers are preferable. The patient should have an empty bladder, and rest quietly in a seated position with the back supported and both feet on the floor for 2–5 minutes before taking home BP measurements. The cuff of the device should be placed directly above the elbow and pulled taut, with the arm supported on a flat surface. Morning measurements should be made before breakfast and before taking any antihypertensive drugs, and evening measurements should be taken before going to bed. At least 2 readings should be taken, 1–2 minutes apart, and measurements should be made for at least 3 (preferably 7) consecutive days.,

Figure 1.
Key recommendations for ensuring accurate measurement of home blood pressure.

The key parameters provided by HBPM include morning BP, evening BP, and the morning–evening difference in BP. The relationship between values for these home BP measures and office BP is shown in Table 2. However, 1 limitation of standard HBPM is that measurements are only taken at 2 times during the day (morning and evening) in a relatively low-stress environment (i.e. the patient's home). Given that young adult workers often show increased work site BP, especially during stressful conditions, even when home BP is well controlled, there may be also be a role for HBPM in the work place.

6.4 Improving adherence to treatment and BP control (Box 6)

6.4.1 Improving adherence to treatment (more details in the online supplemental file S6.4.1)

Low adherence to antihypertensive medications is the most common cause of treatment resistance and it is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Strategies focused on improving adherence are complex and related to patient's behaviour and education, physician attitude, complexity of drug regimen and other healthcare supportive measures. As HBPM requires active cooperation by the patient, it may be particularly effective in favourably affecting patients' perceptions of their hypertension, thereby encouraging them to be compliant with lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive therapy. Although HBPM, as an isolated intervention, has been associated with a significant increase in the number of pills taken per week, establishing the specific contribution of HBPM to treatment adherence has not been easy as in most studies, HBPM has been used in combination with other interventions, such as telemonitoring, patient counselling, additional education or medication reminders. A meta-analysis of 28 trials with more than 7000 participants revealed a significant modest positive effect of HBPM (isolated or associated to other co-interventions) on medication adherence when measured objectively by pill count or electronic monitoring The question on whether improving treatment adherence is more effective when based on HBPM alone, on HBPM combined with telemonitoring and with feedback to patients by their doctor between visits, or when based exclusively on BP determination during office visits is currently being addressed.

### Home blood pressure monitoring in pediatric hypertension: the US perspective and a plan for action [^112sTws8]. Hypertension Research (2018). Low credibility.

The 2017 US guidelines for pediatric hypertension place considerable emphasis on blood pressure measurements, which are the cornerstone for hypertension diagnosis and management. It is recognized that when the diagnosis of hypertension is based solely on office blood pressure measurements, many children are misclassified (over- or underdiagnosed). Therefore, out-of-office blood pressure evaluations using ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring are often necessary to obtain an accurate diagnosis. Strong evidence for the diagnostic and clinical value of ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in children has justified its central role in decision making in recent pediatric recommendations. However, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is not widely accessible in primary care. There is little evidence for home blood pressure monitoring in children, yet this method is widely available and feasible for the evaluation of elevated blood pressure in children. This article presents a case for using home blood pressure monitoring for the management of children with suspected or treated hypertension in clinical practice in comparison to using office measurements or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, as well as its optimal application. More research on home blood pressure monitoring in children is urgently needed.

### Number of measurements needed to obtain a reliable estimate of home blood pressure: results from the improving the detection of hypertension study [^111Vyymy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, we examined whether less burdensome strategies of HBPM provide reliable estimates of home BP among individuals not taking antihypertensive medication. Mean home BP was reliable using the average of 2 morning and 2 evening BP readings for a minimum of 2 days and a single morning and single evening reading for a minimum of 3 days. For diagnosing home hypertension, there was good agreement using a minimum of 3 days of either 2 morning and 2 evening readings or a single morning and single evening BP reading. A greater number of days of HBPM was required to reliably estimate home BP and diagnose home hypertension when using the other strategies.

Guidelines and scientific statements have recommended that out‐of‐clinic BP monitoring with either ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or HBPM be used to identify white‐coat hypertension, defined as having clinic hypertension without out‐of‐clinic hypertension, and masked hypertension, defined as having out‐of‐clinic hypertension without clinic hypertension. 2, 3, 8 ABPM is more commonly recommended than HBPM for measuring out‐of‐clinic BP 1 as there are more outcome studies demonstrating that higher BP on ABPM is associated with an increased risk of CVD. 28, 29, 30 In the United States, several barriers prevent the widespread adoption of ABPM in clinical practice. These include a lack of availability in many areas, excessive patient burden due to poor tolerability and discomfort, and unreimbursed costs. 3, 31, 32 The 2017 ACC/AHA high BP guideline 2 considered HBPM to be a more practical approach than ABPM for the measurement of out‐of‐clinic BP.

8.3 Therapeutic targets and treatment titration (more details in the online supplemental file S8.3)

Therapeutic targets (Box 17)

BP targets to be achieved with antihypertensive treatment are generally a controversial issue. In recent United States and European guidelines, new and lower OBP targets were proposed based on the evidence from observational studies, from few specifically designed interventional trials, in particular SPRINT, and from recent meta-analyses. No direct guidance was provided on the targets for ambulatory or home BP; however, because of inadequate evidence. In the HOMED-BP study, participants were randomized to more (< 125/ < 80 mmHg) or less stringent HBP control (125–134/80–84 mmHg). No differences between the groups in terms of cardiovascular events were observed. It should be noted that the achieved BP was very similar in both goups. More recently, the HONEST study provided evidence that achieved systolic HBP above 145 mmHg was associated with significantly higher risk than in a reference group targeting less than 125 mmHg HBP. The risk of this higher HBP category corresponded to that of OBP greater than 150 mmHg. Spline regression analysis suggested some further (although minor) benefit down to HBP of 125 mmHg. Indirect evidence supporting a HBP target less than 135/85 mmHg comes from studies on masked uncontrolled hypertension, in which treated individuals with controlled OBP but HBP higher than the above-mentioned target value had clearly elevated risk compared wiht those with better controlled HBP. In summary, given that the most recent ESC/ESH Hypertension guidelines recommend as a general target for OBP SBP/DBP values 130/80 mmHg or less in treated patients, in the absence of specific evidence on corresponding home BP targets, we might provisionally suggest that HBP values ≤ 130/80 mmHg should also be achieved.

### Screening for hypertension in adults: US preventive services task force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^112vghXx]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

How does evidence fit with biological understanding — hypertension phenotypes, risk, and detection: Cardiovascular disease risk is highest with sustained hypertension, followed by masked and then white coat hypertension; estimates based on international cohorts are 8% and 14%, respectively, and a US-based survey estimated masked hypertension at 12.3%. White coat hypertension can be detected with out-of-office measurements using home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) after an elevated in-office reading, whereas masked hypertension can only be detected when out-of-office measurements are obtained. Screening algorithms that start with office blood pressure measurement (OBPM) and follow with ABPM or HBPM are not able to identify persons with masked hypertension; follow-up ABPM or HBPM after a positive OBPM would miss fewer sustained cases and overtreat fewer white coat cases, and confirmation with ABPM identifies the greatest number of sustained cases without any white coat cases being treated and is considered the gold standard.

### Agreement between guideline thresholds using an "All-in-one" device to measure office, home, and ambulatory blood pressures [^111wT311]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Defined blood pressure (BP) thresholds are essential to allow effective and consistent diagnosis of hypertension and for monitoring the effects of interventions to reduce BP. Historically, clinical decisions were based on office (clinic) BP values alone. However, the past decade has seen increased recognition of the importance of out‐of‐office BP monitoring in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension.,

Out‐of‐office BP measurements have consistently been shown to provide better information about cardiovascular prognosis than office BP. In addition, it has recently been reported that home BP was superior to ambulatory BP in terms of predicting cardiovascular prognosis. These data support current guideline recommendations for the use of ambulatory and home BP monitoring (ABPM and HBPM, respectively) for the diagnosis and management of hypertension. In particular, home BP thresholds are likely to become increasingly relevant in an era that is seeing increasing use of home‐based digital strategies for hypertension evaluation and treatment. Furthermore, just the act of self‐measurement of home BP with telemonitoring has been shown to reduce BP and increase the proportion of patients with BP normalization.

BP thresholds for home and ambulatory measurements differ from those for office BP and vary between different international guidelines (Table S1). As the use of ABPM and HBPM increases, clear and correct definition of BP thresholds that correspond to office BP is important. However, there are currently no data on the corresponding thresholds of office, home, and ambulatory BP determined using the same BP measurement device. Therefore, this study used baseline data from the HI‐JAMP (Home‐Activity Information and Communication Technology–Based Japan Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring Prospective) study to determine corresponding values for office, home, and ambulatory BP measured using the same device in treated patients with hypertension.

Manual blood pressure uses "a manual auscultatory blood pressure cuff, instead of an automated method". Automated office blood pressure (AOBP) is obtained in the provider's office with "an automated device that is programmed to start only after a set resting period and measured several times", with "an average reading" output and without required provider attendance. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) is obtained on "a frequent intermittent basis (i.e., 15–30 min per 24 h)" using an automated wearable device outside the office. Home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is "obtained at the patient's home with an automated oscillometric or manual auscultatory device, usually excluding ABPM".

### Use of different blood pressure thresholds to reduce the number of home blood pressure monitoring days needed for detecting hypertension [^116rRU34]. Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Home blood pressure (BP) monitoring over a 7-day period is recommended to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.

Methods

We determined upper and lower home BP thresholds with > 90% positive predictive value and > 90% negative predictive value using 1 to 6 days of monitoring to identify high home BP (systolic BP ≥ 130 mmHg or diastolic BP ≥ 80 mmHg) based on 7 days of home BP monitoring. The sample included 361 adults from the Improving the Detection of Hypertension Study who were not taking antihypertensive medication. We used two 7-day periods, at least 3 days apart, the first being a sampling period and the second a reference period. For each number of days in the sampling period, we determined the percentage of participants who had a high likelihood of having (> 90% positive predictive value) or not having (> 90% negative predictive value) high BP and would not need to continue home BP monitoring. Only the participants in an uncertain category (ie, positive predictive value ≤ 90% and negative predictive value ≤ 90%) after each day were carried forward to the next day of home BP monitoring.

Results

Of the 361 participants (mean [SD] age of 41.3 [13.2] years; 60.4% women), 38.0% had high home BP during the reference period. There were 63.7%, 17.1%, 10.5%, 3.3%, 3.6%, and 1.4% participants who would not need to continue after 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days of monitoring.

Conclusions

In most people, high home BP can be identified or excluded with a high degree of confidence with 3 days or less of monitoring.

### Emergence of home blood pressure-guided management of hypertension based on global evidence [^115Xzq9o]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is strong evidence that high home BP is associated with increased CVD risk. HBPM can be used to identify specific hypertension phenotypes such as white coat hypertension, masked hypertension, white coat uncontrolled hypertension, and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Morning hypertension, based on the average of morning home BP readings, and nocturnal hypertension, based on the average of nighttime BP readings on nocturnal HBPM can be detected by newer HBPM devices. The proposal of using lower office BP and home BP thresholds by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline (ie, 130/80 mm Hg for both office BP and home BP) has raised new perspectives about hypertension diagnosis and management, but has also added some uncertainties in this field. Randomized controlled trials are needed to define the optimal home BP threshold and target goal for the appropriate use of HBPM in routine management of hypertension, including investigations focused on the nocturnal home BP levels.

### Home blood pressure monitoring… [^116Vzuqz]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

The American Heart Association recommends two measurements separated by at least one minute twice per day to diagnose hypertension using home blood pressure monitoring. Patients should be instructed to record their readings for three to seven days leading up to their clinic appointment. 9–12 Some guidelines recommend omitting the first day of readings because they tend to be more elevated than other readings. 10, 13 The recorded readings should be averaged. Types of Hypertension Detectable Using Blood Pressure Monitoring Home blood pressure monitoring or ambulatory blood pressure monitoring can identify several hypertension patterns, including confirmed, white coat, and masked hypertension. 9, 14, 15 Although ambulatory blood pressure monitoring may be more accurate, home blood pressure monitoring is often more practical in routine practice.

CONFIRMED HYPERTENSION Confirmed hypertension occurs when ambulatory blood pressure monitoring or home blood pressure monitoring and in-office measurements are both in the hypertension range. 15 WHITE COAT HYPERTENSION Figure 1 describes the use of home blood pressure monitoring in differentiating white coat hypertension from confirmed hypertension. 15 Clinicians should consider white coat hypertension and arrange for home blood pressure monitoring when office blood pressure is consistently in the hypertension range after a three-month trial of lifestyle modification and without evidence of end-organ damage. MASKED HYPERTENSION Masked hypertension occurs when blood pressure is normal in the office but elevated at home. Patients with masked hypertension have a similar risk of cardiovascular events as patients with sustained hypertension and about two times the risk of those who have normal blood pressure.

21 Figure 2 outlines the use of home blood pressure monitoring to diagnose masked hypertension, which should be suspected when in-office blood pressure is consistently mildly elevated and there is evidence of end-organ damage or the patient has significant cardiovascular risk factors. 15 Masked hypertension is confirmed when home blood pressure monitoring demonstrates readings in the hypertension range. Home Blood Pressure Monitoring in Hypertension Therapy For patients who are taking medications for hypertension, home blood pressure monitoring is useful for ongoing monitoring of therapy. Because pretreatment home blood pressure is generally lower than in-office blood pressure, therapy may appear to decrease home blood pressure less than in-office blood pressure — showing that home blood pressure falls about 20% less than in-office blood pressure with treatment.

7.3.2 New approaches to HBPM telemonitoring: mobile health: current evidence, future perspectives (Box 14) (more details in the online supplemental file S7.3.2)

In the era of mobile revolution, the widespread use of smartphone technologies, along with the development of smartphones applications for HBPM and remote transmission (T), have opened new perspectives for HBPT (mHealth). Preliminary data from clinical studies and a recent meta-analysis have suggested the value of these technologies in improving patients' adherence to antihypertensive treatment, and in achieving higher BP control rates. In a recent prospective pilot study in patients with treated hypertension, using a telemedicine healthcare management system, which allowed continuous communication between physician and patient via a smartphone application, improved HBP control was achieved in the patients with poor control at baseline. Despite the promising results and future perspectives of mHealth-related interventions, there are still some issues in the digital health-based approach that should be addressed before recommending it for widespread clinical use.

Implications of CAMBO study

The CAMBO trial has important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Existing guidelines are almost exclusively based on morbidity and mortality data related to "research quality" blood pressure readings. However, the cut-off point of 140/90 mm Hg for diagnosing and treating hypertension was not derived from blood pressure data obtained in routine clinical practice. Findings from CAMBO and other recent similar studies indicate that a manual office blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg taken as part of a research study is likely to be equivalent to a reading of at least 150/95 mm Hg when recorded in routine clinical practice, raising concerns about the external validity of manual office blood pressure readings taken under research conditions.

Automated office blood pressure readings are an alternative to manual readings, as they are less affected by the setting in which they are taken (providing the patient is alone), are similar to the mean awake ambulatory blood pressure, and are less likely to provoke a white coat effect. Automated office blood pressure has also become available at a crucial time in the 100 years of office blood pressure measurement. Advocates of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring have recommended introducing ambulatory monitoring into primary care to overcome the problems associated with current manual office blood pressure measurement. Recent monographs from the American Heart Association and the European Society of Hypertension have also recommended the widespread use of home blood pressure monitoring. The American Heart Association report stated that "every hypertensive patient should purchase a home BP recording device". Although few hypertension experts have gone as far as recommending the complete abandonment of office blood pressure measurement, conventional manual office blood pressure readings are clearly widely viewed as providing suboptimal measures of an individual patient's blood pressure status.

Automated office blood pressure measurement provides an opportunity to continue recording blood pressure in the primary care setting, although it is not a replacement for home blood pressure or 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Identification of a close relation between readings taken with automated office blood pressure measurement and 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring suggests that future clinical outcome studies will confirm automated office blood pressure readings as being a better predictor of future cardiovascular events than are manual office blood pressure readings.

The initial findings from the CAMBO trial in patients with systolic hypertension and no serious comorbidities highlight the importance of recording blood pressure in the office with a fully automated device that takes multiple readings with the patient resting alone in the examining room. Further studies in other hypertensive populations are needed before automated office blood pressure can be recommended as a replacement for conventional manual blood pressure measurement.

### Home blood pressure monitoring in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension: a systematic review [^114PNLXz]. American Journal of Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Background

It is recognized that for the reliable assessment of blood pressure (BP) and the accurate diagnosis of hypertension, out-of-office BP measurement with ambulatory (ABPM) or home BP monitoring (HBPM) is often required. The clinical usefulness of ABPM is well established. However, despite the wide use of HBPM, only in the last decade convincing evidence on its usefulness has accumulated.

Methods

Systematic review of the evidence on applying HBPM in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension (PubMed, Cochrane Library, 1970–2010).

Results

Sixteen studies in untreated and treated subjects assessed the diagnostic ability of HBPM by taking ABPM as reference. Seven randomized studies compared HBPM vs. office measurements or ABPM for treatment adjustment, whereas many studies compared HBPM with office measurements in assessing the antihypertensive drug effects. Several studies with different design investigated the role of HBPM vs. office measurements in improving patients' compliance with treatment and hypertension control rates. The evidence on the cost-effectiveness of HBPM is limited. The studies reviewed consistently showed moderate diagnostic agreement between HBPM and ABPM, and superiority of HBPM compared to office measurements in diagnosing uncontrolled hypertension, assessing antihypertensive drug effects and improving patients' compliance and hypertension control. Preliminary evidence suggests that HBPM has the potential for cost savings.

Conclusions

There is conclusive evidence that HBPM is useful for the initial diagnosis and the long-term follow-up of treated hypertension. These data are useful for the optimal application of HBPM, which is widely used in clinical practice. More studies on the cost-effectiveness of HBPM are needed.

Home BP Threshold of 135/85 mm Hg

A commonly recommended HBPM monitoring schedule consists of performing morning and evening BP measurements twice on each occasion over a minimum of 3 days with a preferred period of 7 days. Traditionally, out-of-office BP thresholds have been determined by using the regression and outcome-derived approacheswith data from observational studies. The threshold for high out-of-office BP corresponding to an office BP threshold of 140/90 mm Hg has been determined to be 135/85 mm Hg for both home and daytime BP on ABPM.–

PERSPECTIVES

HBPM is an important and practical tool for the out-of-office measurement of BP. When performed according to current guidelines and using a validated device, it provides similar data to ABPM but is more widely available and convenient for patients. The introduction of wearable HBPM devices into clinical practice would be expected to make HBPM accessible to a larger number of patients, with the potential to replace ABPM as the out-of-office BP monitoring tool of choice. In addition, devices and systems with additional features such as nocturnal home BP monitoring, and monitoring of temperature and environmental factors alongside home BP, will facilitate a more comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, and evaluation of CV risk. However, it is also important to note that current use and awareness of HBPM varies between regions and countries, and between specialists and general practitioners. There are also a number of challenges that need to be overcome to facilitate the widespread implementation of an HBPM-based approach to hypertension management. These include a lack of awareness about the clinical value of HBPM, insufficient knowledge about HBPM best practices, and a lack of resources (both time and equipment). Nevertheless, a substantial body of evidence for the prognostic value of home BP measurements highlight the importance of this approach to the management of CV risk factors in patients with hypertension. HBPM can play a key role in anticipation medicine strategies designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of CV events based on a series of data collected over time, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk and eliminate events. Current developments and future advances in HBPM technologies, along with targeted training and education to support their use, will see HBPM continue to feature as an essential component of the continuum of care for hypertension, including diagnosis and both short- and long-term monitoring of the response to antihypertensive therapy.

### Attitudes of primary care physicians and their patients about home blood pressure monitoring in Ontario [^113UhcwA]. Journal of Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Guidelines recommend home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) to improve blood pressure control, but the attitudes of primary care physicians and their hypertensive patients towards its use are not known.

Methods

A 28-item self-administered survey about home blood pressure monitoring was mailed to a random sample of 1418 primary care physicians in Ontario and 765 (55%) were returned. Of the 478 physicians treating hypertension, 299 agreed to give surveys to their hypertensive patients. We received 149 patient surveys.

Results

The majority of primary care physicians (63%) often or almost always encouraged their hypertensive patients to monitor their own blood pressure at home. Only 13%, however, preferred home blood pressure monitoring to office or ambulatory readings for diagnostic purposes and 19%, to guide therapy. Physicians had concerns about patients becoming preoccupied with home monitoring (70%) and the accuracy of home devices (65%). Most patients (78%) had a device at home, and 84% indicated that their doctor encouraged them to measure blood pressure. Yet, 80% received no advice from their physician on the type of device to purchase, only 8% had specific training on proper measurement technique, 68% did not regularly take the results to the doctor and 39% did nothing specific about alarming readings.

Conclusions

Primary care physicians prefer office or ambulatory to home readings to make diagnostic and therapeutic decisions. While home monitoring is popular among patients, its clinical usefulness is undermined by the lack of reliable purchasing information, standard measurement protocols, proper training on measurement technique and specific instructions on handling and interpreting results.
