## Question

Symptoms and Most appropriate imaging for septic pelvic thrombophlebitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and the most appropriate imaging to diagnose it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the clinical syndrome and the initial diagnostic suspicion. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and bedside evaluation. Next, I will need to check the imaging pathway, justifying ultrasound first and when to escalate to CT or MRI. After that, I should confirm optimal CT/MR protocols and key interpretive signs. Finally, I will integrate imaging with clinical criteria to confirm diagnosis and outline management implications, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references and self-checks.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome I'm targeting, because if I mischaracterize it, the rest of the pathway will be off. Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis classically presents postpartum, often within 1–3 days but up to six weeks, with persistent spiking fevers despite appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics and focal pelvic or right lower quadrant pain without a clear surgical abdomen, and blood cultures may grow anaerobes such as Fusobacterium or typical pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus, particularly after cesarean section or other pelvic infection risk factors, so this clinical triad should heighten suspicion when fevers do not defervesce on adequate therapy [^114pgsZv] [^112qcuAc] [^112koSmU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before excluding more common postpartum sources of fever. I should review endometritis or myometritis, wound infection including abdominal wall hematoma, urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis, retained products of conception, and pelvic abscess, because SPT is a diagnosis of exclusion when fever persists despite adequate antimicrobial coverage for these entities in reproductive-age patients with acute pelvic pain and a broad differential [^114zrJCL] [^111y6Whc] [^112BEoSt].

> I will now examine the initial bedside evaluation I'd pursue, but wait, let me verify the role of ultrasound here. At the bedside, I should obtain a directed exam looking for a rare palpable tender cord, draw CBC and blood cultures including anaerobic bottles, and start with transabdominal and transvaginal Doppler ultrasound to look for ovarian vein thrombosis or abscess as an initial, radiation-sparing modality; however, ultrasound is operator-dependent and often limited by postoperative pain and bowel gas in the deep pelvis, so nondiagnostic studies are common [^114zrJCL] [^111y6Whc]. Hold on, I should verify the guideline basis for calling ultrasound "first-line" in this specific postpartum venous context; ESVS chronic venous disease guidance supports abdominal and pelvic venous ultrasound assessments in suspected pelvic venous disorders, but that pertains to chronic venous disease and pelvic congestion rather than puerperal sepsis, so for acute postpartum fever with a broad differential, ACR acute pelvic pain and sepsis criteria justify ultrasound first for gynecologic causes while recognizing early cross-sectional imaging when the clinical picture remains unclear [^113Bxq12] [^114zrJCL] [^113ofbwd].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to cross-sectional imaging, and I need to ensure I'm choosing the modality that balances accuracy, speed, and availability. When ultrasound is negative, equivocal, or technically limited and suspicion remains high in a patient with persistent postpartum fever despite antibiotics, contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis with a venous-phase acquisition is typically the most appropriate next step because it is rapid, widely available, diagnoses thrombus and alternative etiologies, and can be combined with CT pulmonary angiography if septic emboli are suspected; while reported CT/CTV performance versus duplex ultrasound for pelvic DVT is high, this figure originates from limited evidence, so I should interpret it alongside the full clinical context [^113ofbwd] [^112gYLuQ] [^111y6Whc].

> I need to check the optimal CT protocol because missing the venous phase timing can undermine diagnostic yield. A multiphasic CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast emphasizing a delayed venous phase at approximately 70–90 seconds after peripheral injection improves visualization of hypodense intraluminal filling defects, venous dilation, and perivascular stranding consistent with thrombophlebitis; 3D multiplanar reconstructions assist in tracing thrombus extension to the renal veins or IVC, and a concomitant chest CTA can be considered if pulmonary emboli are suspected, especially in the setting of septic embolization [^112gYLuQ] [^11246a6p] [^111D2YvX].

> Let me consider MRI as an alternative, but wait, I should double-check when it truly adds value over CT in the acute setting. MRI abdomen and pelvis with gadolinium and MR venography provides excellent soft-tissue contrast without radiation and is appropriate when iodinated contrast is contraindicated, in pregnancy when the patient is stable, or when CT is unavailable, yet practical limitations include availability after-hours and longer acquisition times; moreover, postpartum MR venography can reveal a surprisingly high rate of pelvic venous filling defects of uncertain clinical significance, so I should be cautious not to overcall incidental postpartum thrombus without the clinical triad of SPT [^11246a6p] [^111y6Whc] [^111cigQS] [^117AB4UR].

> I should confirm the key imaging findings I'm relying on so I don't overinterpret nonspecific changes. The direct sign is an intraluminal filling defect in a dilated pelvic vein, most often the right ovarian vein, and indirect signs include venous wall enhancement, perivascular fat stranding, and adjacent uterine or adnexal inflammatory changes; on CT, thrombi appear as hypodense venous defects sometimes with a hyperenhancing rim, and I need to carefully distinguish these from physiologic postpartum venous distention or nonocclusive mixing artifacts by correlating with clinical features and assessing for contiguous extension or complications [^112gYLuQ] [^1126Pzib].

> But wait, what if the imaging is positive and the patient is improving on antibiotics — does that suffice for SPT, or do I need additional criteria? The diagnosis of septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is clinched by compatible imaging demonstrating pelvic venous thrombus in a patient with postpartum fever and pelvic pain that persists despite appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics when no other source is identified, and this combined clinico-radiologic definition helps avoid misdiagnosis in an era where incidental postpartum venous filling defects are common on MRV [^114pgsZv] [^117AB4UR].

> I will now examine the management implications because the imaging decision pathway should directly inform therapy. Once SPT is confirmed, I should continue or escalate broad-spectrum antibiotics targeting polymicrobial pelvic sources and anaerobes, and I should consider therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH in consultation with obstetrics and hematology, acknowledging that anticoagulation remains debated yet is commonly used in practice; follow-up cross-sectional imaging at about one to two weeks can document thrombus resolution or progression, and I should remain vigilant for concurrent thrombophilia or embolic complications given reported associations with DVT and PE in this population [^114pgsZv] [^112qcuAc] [^112koSmU].

> Let me summarize the decision flow to ensure internal consistency and catch any gaps. In a postpartum patient with persistent fever and pelvic pain despite adequate antibiotics, I start with clinical exam and cultures, obtain pelvic ultrasound recognizing its limitations, and if fever persists or ultrasound is negative or equivocal, I proceed to contrast-enhanced CT abdomen and pelvis with venous-phase imaging to confirm pelvic venous thrombus and evaluate alternative causes; MRI/MRV is reserved for CT contraindications or specific scenarios where radiation avoidance is paramount, and a confirmed thrombus in the appropriate clinical context establishes SPT and prompts antibiotics with consideration of anticoagulation and interval imaging follow-up [^114zrJCL] [^113ofbwd] [^112gYLuQ] [^114pgsZv].

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) presents with **persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics** [^114pgsZv], lower abdominal or flank pain, and sometimes a palpable tender mass or signs of sepsis [^112koSmU]. The most appropriate imaging modality is **contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis** [^112gYLuQ], which rapidly and accurately detects ovarian or pelvic vein thrombus and septic emboli [^112qcuAc] [^113ofbwd]. MRI is a suitable alternative when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^11246a6p], whereas ultrasound is limited by low sensitivity and operator dependence [^114Z8hWW].

---

## Clinical symptoms and signs

SPT typically presents with the following clinical features:

- **Persistent fever**: Unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics [^114pgsZv], often the primary clinical clue [^112koSmU].

- **Lower abdominal or flank pain**: Commonly right-sided [^112koSmU], reflecting ovarian or pelvic vein involvement [^112qcuAc].

- **Palpable tender mass**: Occasionally a cord-like structure in the lower abdomen or flank, though rare [^1153Vbzz].

- **Leukocytosis**: Moderate elevation in white blood cell count in less than one-third of cases [^1153Vbzz].

- **Positive blood cultures**: Present in a minority of cases, often polymicrobial [^1153Vbzz].

- **Sepsis or septic shock**: In severe cases [^112koSmU], with hypotension, tachycardia, and organ dysfunction [^113ofbwd].

---

## Imaging modalities for diagnosis

Accurate diagnosis of SPT relies on **imaging** [^1126Pzib], as clinical findings are often nonspecific. The following imaging modalities are commonly used:

| **Imaging modality** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|
| Ultrasound (US) | - Non-invasive <br/> - No radiation <br/> - Bedside availability | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited sensitivity for deep pelvic veins <br/> - Often inconclusive [^114zrJCL] |
| Computed tomography (CT) | - High sensitivity and specificity <br/> - Rapid acquisition <br/> - Widely available <br/> - Detects thrombus, vein enlargement, perivascular inflammation, septic emboli [^112gYLuQ] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Iodinated contrast risks (allergy, nephrotoxicity) [^113ofbwd] |
| Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast <br/> - Useful when CT contraindicated [^11246a6p] | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer acquisition <br/> - Contraindications (metal implants, claustrophobia) [^114zrJCL] |

## Most appropriate imaging modality

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the **most appropriate imaging modality** for diagnosing SPT [^113ofbwd]. CT provides rapid, accurate visualization of thrombus within the ovarian or pelvic veins, vein enlargement, perivascular inflammation, and septic emboli [^112gYLuQ]. It is widely available and can be performed quickly, making it ideal in acute settings [^112qcuAc]. MRI is a **valuable alternative** when CT is contraindicated (e.g. contrast allergy, pregnancy) or inconclusive, offering high soft-tissue contrast and detection of thrombus and inflammation without radiation exposure [^11246a6p]. Ultrasound is generally **limited** by operator dependence and low sensitivity for deep pelvic veins, making it less reliable as a primary diagnostic tool for SPT [^114Z8hWW].

---

## Conclusion

SPT presents with **persistent fever unresponsive to antibiotics** [^114pgsZv], lower abdominal or flank pain, and occasionally a palpable tender mass or signs of sepsis [^112koSmU]. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis is the **most appropriate imaging modality** for diagnosing SPT [^112gYLuQ], providing rapid and accurate visualization of thrombus and associated inflammatory changes [^113ofbwd]. MRI is a useful alternative when CT is contraindicated or inconclusive [^11246a6p]; ultrasound is generally limited by operator dependence and low sensitivity [^114zrJCL].

### Imaging of deep venous pathology [^112gYLuQ]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Computed tomography/computed tomography venography can be used to accurately diagnose acute pelvic vein or inferior vena cava occlusion and are additionally capable of diagnosing pulmonary emboli, offering a single diagnostic examination to assess both. Most commonly used is multidetector computed tomography angiography (CTA), combined with late venous-phase imaging (indirect CTV), to accurately diagnose a pelvic vein or inferior vena cava occlusion, which can be the source of significant pulmonary emboli. On CTA/CTV, thrombi appear as intravascular hypodense masses, sometimes encircled by a hyperdense rim of contrast medium. The thrombosed veins are generally dilated compared to their normal dimensions.

In some cases, CT is capable of distinguishing perivascular stranding as a sign of an antithrombotic/inflammatory response. The reported specificity and sensitivity compared to DUS are approximately 93–100% and 97%, respectively. Indirect CTV, for which contrast is injected through a cubital vein and scanning is performed at 70–90 seconds post-contrast injection, in addition to CT pulmonary angiography, is a relatively accurate method for evaluation of femoropopliteal venous thrombosis in one examination without the need for a second contrast bolus. However, introducing CTV as an alternative to DUS is not ideal since it introduces risks associated with radiation and iodine contrast material.

Use of MRI is more appealing in this regard, as MRI is noninvasive, does not require radiation or iodinated contrast material, and can be used in specific risk groups.

A young woman in her 20s presented with fever, abdominal pain, and malodorous vaginal discharge. She was found to be in septic shock in the setting of a recent medical abortion with subsequent intrauterine device placement. Her blood cultures grew Fusobacterium necrophorum. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, the fever failed to defervesce. Subsequent evaluation revealed septic thrombophlebitis of the right gonadal vein and branches of the right iliac vein. She improved with a prolonged course of targeted antimicrobial therapy.

### Immune regulation, maternal infection, vaccination, and pregnancy outcome [^114pgsZv]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is an uncommon postpartum complication occurring around three days after delivery. It is unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics when there is no other obvious source. Diagnosis can be confirmed by visualizing a thrombus in the pelvic veins through computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The condition is treated with prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, with or without the addition of anticoagulation.

Thrombophilia might play a role in this condition, since a recent cohort study reported an association with deep venous thrombosis (9%) and pulmonary emboli (7%). Mortality, which once exceeded 50%, is now rare, with none reported in recent case series and cohort studies.

Pelvic venous disorders (PeVDs) are rarely considered as a cause of chronic pelvic pain in women being evaluated by nonvascular specialists. A Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) Foundation-sponsored Research Consensus Panel addressing this issue identified multiple gaps in the literature and made recommendations to enhance the evidence. Since the publication of these recommendations in 2019, significant progress has been made in developing the necessary tools to improve the ability to conduct rigorous clinical studies and advance the evidence supporting the diagnosis and treatment of PeVD.

This report summarizes the 5-year impact of the panel's recommendations. The investment made by SIR Foundation to host a Research Consensus Panel on PeVD has facilitated enduring academic productivity related to this clinical issue.

### Can cross-sectional imaging replace diagnostic venography in pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) [^115ABgEC]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of MRV and venography**: In comparing magnetic resonance venography (MRV) with diagnostic venography, MRV was less likely to visualize dilated ovarian veins (66.7% vs. 86.7%; p = 0.009) and the pelvic plexus (46.7% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.027). Venography was more effective in detecting ovarian vein incompetence (73.3% vs. 60%; p = 0.121) and pelvic plexus incompetence (80% vs. 66.7%; p = 0.003). It was also superior in demonstrating moderate and severe venous congestion with a P value of .034.

- **Comparison of CTV and venography**: When comparing three-dimensional computed tomographic venography (CTV) with venography, CTV was more likely to detect internal iliac vein (IIV) dilations (60% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.003) and internal iliac vein reflux (IIVR) (73.3% vs. 40%; P < .001). Conversely, venography was more likely to visualize ovarian vein (OV) dilations (80% vs. 53.3%; p = 0.001) and pelvic plexus dilations (60% vs. 40%; p = 0.028). Furthermore, venography demonstrated superiority in showing moderate and severe venous congestion with a P value of .002.

Additionally, there were no findings related to Nutcracker syndrome and inferior vena cava anomalies using both CTV and diagnostic venography modalities. Intravenous ultrasound (IVUS) was not employed in our study due to its cost and unavailability at our institution. The pressure gradient was also not evaluated, as Nutcracker syndrome was not the focus of our analysis.

### Thrombophlebitis of abdominal veins as an unusual cause for acute abdomen: Avoiding the diagnostic pitfalls [^1126Pzib]. Emergency Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

The purpose of this pictorial essay is to review the imaging appearances of the spectrum of thrombophlebitis of abdominal veins on computed tomography (CT) scans. Thrombophlebitis of abdominal veins is rare but can mimic other, more common conditions presenting with acute abdomen. Due to non-specific presenting symptoms, signs, and laboratory findings, diagnosis largely relies on imaging, particularly CT, which is readily available in the emergency setting.

### Imaging modalities in genitourinary emergencies [^111AgKrq]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

Emergency physicians rely on a multitude of imaging modalities in diagnosing genitourinary emergencies. There are many considerations to account for when deciding which imaging modality to use first, as several diagnostic tools can often be applied to the same pathologic condition. Factors include radiation exposure, sensitivity, specificity, patient age, availability of resources, cost, and completion timeliness. In this review, the strengths and weaknesses of different imaging tools in the evaluation of genitourinary emergencies are discussed.

### Septic thrombophlebitis of multiple dural sinuses extending to bilateral internal jugular veins due to acute sphenoid sinusitis: a case of Lemierre's syndrome [^113nURJA]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Low credibility.

Lemierre's syndrome (LS) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition characterized by septic thrombophlebitis within the head and neck region. The lack of a standardized definition in the literature contributes to its limited evidence base. LS presents with various clinical manifestations, often showing atypical features across different age groups. Early diagnosis of LS is challenging due to its nonspecific nature. Recent evidence highlights significant short- and long-term morbidity risks. Successful management requires a multidisciplinary approach and appropriate antibiotic therapy. While LS is commonly associated with oropharyngeal infections, it can also arise from non-oropharyngeal sources, complicating diagnosis and management.

We present a case of LS secondary to acute isolated sphenoid sinusitis in an 86-year-old woman. Imaging revealed multiple metastatic septic thrombophlebitis, including bilateral cavernous, inferior petrosal, right transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and internal jugular veins. Blood cultures grew Streptococcus intermedius, and endoscopic sphenoidotomy identified a fungus ball, with cultures confirming Streptococcus anginosus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The patient demonstrated significant recovery with no complications at follow-up. This case illustrates a complex, multifocal pattern of septic thrombophlebitis extending to multiple venous structures, highlighting the need for comprehensive imaging and a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosing and managing this rare complication.

### Cross-sectional imaging of acute gynaecologic disorders: Ct and mri findings with differential diagnosis-part ii: uterine emergencies and pelvic inflammatory disease [^111y6Whc]. Insights into Imaging (2019). Low credibility.

Although transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound (US) is the ideal technique for initial investigation of women with suspected genital disorders, in the emergency department (ED), the use of cross-sectional imaging is steadily growing. As a result, radiologists increasingly encounter unsuspected female genital diseases on urgent CT studies requested under alternative presumptive diagnoses. Therefore, familiarity with these conditions and their imaging appearances is required to avoid missing or misinterpreting clinically important abnormalities.

Compared to CT, on state-of-the-art scanners, MRI provides a superior characterization of abnormal or inconclusive gynaecological findings. If scanner availability and patient conditions permit, the use of MRI is attractive for further investigation of acute female genital disorders without ionizing radiation.

This pictorial essay aims to provide radiologists with increased familiarity in the recognition and characterization of acute gynaecologic disorders on CT and MRI to allow timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The previous first installment reviewed the cross-sectional imaging appearances of corpus luteum and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts, gynaecologic haemoperitoneum from either ruptured corpus luteum and ectopic pregnancy, and adnexal torsion. The present second installment will discuss and present (with imaging examples) the main non-pregnancy-related uterine emergencies, including endometrial polyps, degenerated leiomyomas, and uterine inversion, and the spectrum of pelvic inflammatory disease.

### Genitourinary emergencies in the nonpregnant woman [^111yv57r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Lower abdominal and pelvic pains are common symptoms in women who present to the emergency department (ED). Once pregnancy has been ruled out, attention should be focused on other potential life or fertility threats. Ultrasound remains the most helpful initial diagnostic modality. Time-sensitive and serious conditions, such as large ovarian masses or abnormal vaginal bleeding, need gynecologic consultation. Because many patients do not have access to primary care, ED physicians should be familiar with the treatment of sexually transmitted diseases. However, most nonpregnant women with pelvic complaints can safely be managed in the outpatient setting after ED evaluation.

### Prevalence of traumatic hip and pelvic fractures in patients with suspected hip fracture and negative initial standard radiographs — a study of emergency department patients [^113Npw4A]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2005). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of hip and pelvic fractures in emergency department (ED) patients with hip pain and negative standard initial radiographs.

This was a retrospective, cohort study conducted at an academic, community-based ED. Patients presenting during a one-year period with hip pain, for whom a plain-film radiograph was obtained, were included. Eligible patients were identified through electronic record queries. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were ordered at the discretion of the treating physician. Initial plain radiographs were interpreted at the point of care by board-certified radiologists, and MRI images were reviewed by radiologists with fellowship training in musculoskeletal imaging. Structured follow-up at more than one month post-visit was conducted to rule out any subsequent diagnosis of hip fracture. Ninety-five-percent confidence intervals (95% CIs) and kappa (κ) statistics were calculated as appropriate.

Seven hundred sixty-four of 895 patients (85.3%) had follow-up completed, comprising the study group. Within this group, 219 patients (29%) showed evidence of fracture on initial radiographs. Of the 545 patients with negative initial radiographs, 62 patients (11.4%) underwent hip MRI during their ED visit, and MRI identified 24 additional patients with hip fractures. Interobserver agreement for the presence of fracture on MRI was very good (κ = 0.847). For patients with negative initial plain radiographs who did not have a hip MRI, follow-up did not reveal any subsequent diagnosis of fracture. Thus, 24 of 545 patients were identified with fractures through MRI.

### Computed tomography in patients with sepsis presenting to the emergency department: Exploring its role in light of patient outcomes [^115R9oXw]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In the CT group (n = 62/192), 96.8% of the patients received a microbiological test to identify the responsible agent, yet in 20%, no agent was identified. A detailed description of the etiological agents can be found in the supplementary Table 2.

- **Ct report analysis**: The median time-to-CT after sepsis diagnosis (ttCTsd) was 3.83 hours (IQR 1.50–29.97 hours), whereas the median time-to-CT after emergency department arrival (ttCTeda) was 7.44 hours (IQR 3.68–30.77 hours). Regarding the organ regions covered by the CT scan, approximately half of the patients (n = 32) received a CT scan of more than one organ region. Specifically, in 33.9% of the patients (n = 21), more than two organ regions were scanned; in 12.9% (n = 8), more than 3; and in 4.8% (n = 3), four organ regions were scanned.

	- The most commonly examined region was the chest (95.2%; n = 49/62), followed by the abdomen/pelvis (62.9%; n = 39/62), and the head (19.4%; n = 12/62). The extremities were the organ region least commonly examined at 4.8% (n = 3/62). The percentage of positive findings on CT, graded as possible or certain foci, per organ region was 57.1% (n = 28/49) for the chest and 53.9% (n = 21/39) for the abdomen/pelvis. An infectious focus was least commonly found in the head (8.3%, n = 1/11).

	- In 58.1% (n = 36/62) of focus-CTs, secondary findings were documented. Most commonly, other findings (55.6%; n = 20/36), tumor (11.1%; n = 4/36), and trauma (8.3%; n = 3/36) were noted. Only one patient had a fracture as an incidental finding. In 25.0% (n = 9/36), several secondary findings were documented.

### MDCT of pelvic inflammatory disease: A review of the pathophysiology, gamut of imaging findings, and treatment [^112BEoSt]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), representing an ascending, sexually transmitted pyogenic infection of the female genital tract, is a commonly encountered cause for emergency visits and hospitalizations among young and adult female patients. Although gynecologic evaluation and sonography constitute the mainstay of diagnosis, multidetector CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis is frequently performed, often as the initial imaging modality, due to its ability to address the frequently vague and indeterminate clinical presentation.

Knowledge of and attention to the often subtle early imaging features of PID afford the radiologist a critical opportunity to direct and expedite appropriate pathways of patient care, thereby minimizing the risk for secondary complications such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and enteric adhesions. This paper reviews the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, early and late imaging features of PID, potential secondary complications, and treatment options. Additionally, it discusses published data metrics on CT performance regarding sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis, as well as potential imaging differential diagnostic considerations.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® postmenopausal acute pelvic pain [^111cLA76]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Acute pelvic pain is a common presenting complaint in both the emergency room and outpatient settings. While pelvic pain of gynecologic origin in postmenopausal women occurs less frequently than in premenopausal women, it exhibits important differences in etiology. The most common causes of postmenopausal pelvic pain from gynecologic origin are ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ovarian neoplasm. Other etiologies are attributable to urinary, gastrointestinal, and vascular systems.

As the optimal imaging modality varies for these etiologies, it is important to narrow the differential diagnosis before choosing the initial diagnostic imaging examination. Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound are the best initial imaging techniques when the differential is primarily of gynecologic origin. CT with intravenous (IV) contrast is more useful if the differential diagnosis remains broad. MRI without IV contrast or MRI without and with IV contrast, as well as CT without IV contrast, may also be used for certain differential considerations.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness.

### Improving diagnostic efficiency: Analysis of pelvic MRI versus emergency hip aspiration for suspected hip sepsis [^112neaKz]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2013). Low credibility.

Accurately diagnosing and treating childhood hip sepsis is challenging. Adjacent bone and soft-tissue infections are common and can lead to delayed and inappropriate treatment. This study evaluated the effect of early advanced imaging (bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging) in the management of suspected hip sepsis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review of pediatric patients admitted between 2003 and 2009 with suspected hip sepsis was performed. Patients were classified into two categories: group I - immediate hip aspiration or group II - advanced imaging performed before intervention.

- **Results**: In total, 130 patients (53 in group I and 77 in group II) were included. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to laboratory values, temperature, number of anesthetics, and length of hospital stay. However, patients in group I were younger than those in group II (5.4 vs. 7.3 years, P = 0.02) and more patients in group I were unable to bear weight on the affected limb compared with group II (83% vs. 61%, P = 0.009). In group I, 36 patients (68%) had a septic hip compared with 35 patients (45%) in group II. In group I, 16 patients (30%) required reoperation versus 13 (17%) patients in group II. Results from the multivariate analysis demonstrated that reoperation was required 2.8 times (95% confidence interval, 1.12–6.78) more often in group I as compared with group II (P = 0.03).

- **Conclusions**: Advanced imaging performed before hip aspiration improves diagnostic efficacy and may decrease the need for reoperation.

- **Level of evidence**: III.

### Postpartum ovarian vein thrombosis presenting as ureteral obstruction [^112ziUL4]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Ovarian vein thrombosis (OVT) is a relatively uncommon but serious postpartum complication. Although infrequent, OVT may progress to involve the inferior vena cava or the renal vein, or it may cause sepsis and septic pulmonary embolism, all of which are potentially life-threatening. Clinical misdiagnosis is common, and, unfortunately, most affected women undergo laparotomy for possible appendicitis. We present an interesting case of OVT presenting as ureteral obstruction in a postpartum woman who was in her early 20s. Knowledge of this entity and clinical suspicion for its occurrence in a puerperal patient with fever and abdominal pain not responding to antibiotics should guide clinicians to appropriate diagnosis and treatment, avoiding misdiagnosis, unnecessary laparotomy, and potential complications.

### ACR appropriateness criteria postmenopausal subacute or chronic pelvic pain [^114Hfqkc]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Pelvic pain is common in both reproductive age and postmenopausal women, and the major etiologies change throughout the life cycle. Chronic pain is defined as lasting for at least six months. There are many gastrointestinal and urinary disorders associated with chronic pain in this age group, which are not discussed in this guideline. Pain may be localized to the deep pelvis, with potential causes including pelvic congestion syndrome, intraperitoneal adhesions, hydrosalpinx, chronic inflammatory disease, or cervical stenosis. Ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice, while CT and MRI may be appropriate for further characterization of sonographic findings.

Alternatively, pain may be localized to the vagina, vulva, or perineum, with potential causes including vaginal atrophy, vaginismus, vaginal or vulvar cysts, vulvodynia, or pelvic myofascial pain. Imaging is primarily indicated in the context of an abnormal physical exam; ultrasound is the initial modality of choice, while MRI may be appropriate for further characterization in select cases. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment.

### 18f-fdg pet/ct for diagnosing infectious complications in patients with severe neutropenia after intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy or stem cell transplantation [^117KH3mV]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

We found a clear correlation between FDG uptake in the CVC tract and septic thrombophlebitis of the subclavian vein. This supports the results of another study on the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the diagnosis of septic thrombophlebitis, in which 18F-FDG PET/CT was prospectively conducted in patients with suspected septic thrombophlebitis. The 18F-FDG PET/CT showed pathological tracer uptake in all nine patients with proven septic thrombophlebitis. Control patients in that study were collected from a retrospective cohort of patients with deep venous thrombosis without signs of infection, in whom an 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for other reasons.

Selection bias in that study makes it impossible to calculate positive and negative predictive values of 18F-FDG PET/CT regarding detection of septic thrombophlebitis. A caveat in our study is that ultrasound was only performed on clinical grounds, so we might have missed asymptomatic deep venous thrombosis. The negative predictive value of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the presence of septic thrombophlebitis, however, can be estimated to be high (94%), as only one patient with persistent bacteraemia was found to have a deep venous thrombosis ruled out solely by the absence of clinical signs. The positive predictive value (67%) regarding septic thrombophlebitis, on the other hand, might be underestimated in our study, because ultrasound was not performed in all patients, precluding these patients from fulfilling the definition of septic thrombophlebitis.

In three patients with FDG uptake in the subclavian tract and persistent bacteraemia, only one ultrasound was performed.

### Acute appendicitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein shown by 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT [^112ju8QT]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein is a serious infectious disorder and is difficult to diagnose at an early stage. In this case, we presented 18 F-FDG and 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT findings in a 45-year-old man with acute appendicitis complicated by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal vein. The 68 Ga-FAPI-46 PET/CT showed intense radiotracer uptake in the thrombosis of the portal vein, with higher SUV max and greater disease extent than the 18 F-FDG PET/CT. This case demonstrated that 68 Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be a useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of this infectious condition.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: A rare case report [^1131CSSh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

After 1–3 days of the C-section, the patient's haemoglobin level showed a progressive decline from 97 to 88 to 83 g/L, while the platelet count increased from 79 to 88 × 10⁹/L. B-ultrasound imaging suggested an abdominal wall incision haematoma. Based on these findings, we considered the diagnosis of abdominal incision haematoma after the C-section. A second surgery for the removal of the abdominal wall haematoma was performed on the third day after the C-section. We removed a blood clot of approximately 100 mL between the rectus abdominis and the anterior sheath. Additionally, approximately 10 mL of blood clot was removed from the right rear of the rectus abdominis, peritoneal front. The intraoperative blood loss was approximately 20 ml.

On postoperative day 1 of the second surgery, the patient recorded a body temperature of 39.5 °C, a low haemoglobin level of 89 g/L, and an increased platelet count of 108 × 10⁹/L. The patient was administered piperacillin tazobactam at 2.5 g q 8 h and levofloxacin at 0.4 g q d. Acetaminophen was also administered as an antipyretic symptomatic treatment. The patient was advised to get out of bed as early as possible and move more frequently to prevent thrombosis.

On postoperative day 2 of the second surgery, the body temperature was 38.6 °C, the haemoglobin level was 83 g/L, and the platelet count increased to 138 × 10⁹/L. On postoperative day 3, the body temperature declined to 37.2 °C. By postoperative day 4 of the second surgery, the haemoglobin level was 84 g/L, and the platelet count was 167 × 10⁹/L. Her fibrinogen level was 2.2.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute pelvic pain in the reproductive age group: 2023 update [^114zrJCL]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

This review focuses on the initial imaging in the reproductive age adult population with acute pelvic pain, including patients with positive and negative beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) levels with suspected gynecological and nongynecological etiology. For all patients, a combination of transabdominal and transvaginal pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is usually appropriate as an initial imaging study.

- **Suspected nongynecological etiology in patients with negative β-hCG**: If nongynecological etiology is suspected, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with or without contrast is also typically appropriate.
- **Suspected nongynecological etiology in patients with positive β-hCG**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast and MRI of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast may be suitable.
- **Suspected gynecological etiology in patients with negative β-hCG**: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast, MRI of the pelvis without contrast, or MRI of the pelvis with and without contrast may be appropriate.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific conditions.

### The utility of dynamic magnetic resonance venography in the setting of pelvic venous pathology [^113GMTrD]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The standard initial noninvasive imaging modality for diagnosing May-Thurner syndrome is duplex ultrasound, but this modality provides only indirect measures and is frequently limited, necessitating further imaging to make the diagnosis. Other noninvasive imaging modalities, such as computed tomographic venography, time-of-flight, and magnetic resonance venography, allow for direct visualization but lack hemodynamic and anatomic information about what is occurring throughout the cardiac cycle. Intravascular ultrasound is the invasive tool of choice in the setting of iliac vein compression syndrome, but quality, noninvasive imaging modalities have yet to be described. Contrast-enhanced, dynamic magnetic resonance venography allows for detailed imaging of the pelvis as well as dynamic vascular imaging, improving preoperative planning.

### The natural history of pelvic vein thrombosis on magnetic resonance venography after vaginal delivery [^117AB4UR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism constitutes the leading cause of direct maternal mortality in the developed world. At the time of writing, there are no studies using magnetic resonance venography (MRV) to delineate the incidence and natural history of intraluminal filling defects in the postpartum period in patients with low thrombosis risk.

- **Study design**: This was a prospective cohort study of women at low thrombosis risk post-vaginal delivery undergoing MRV in the early postpartum period.

- **Results**: In 30 eligible and consenting participants, independently adjudicated MRV, conducted on a median of postpartum day 1, identified definite thrombosis in 30% (95% confidence interval, 13.6–46.4%) of study participants. All episodes of definite thrombosis were identified in the iliac and ovarian veins. Probable thrombosis was identified in an additional 27% of study participants (95% CI, 10.3–41.7%), and possible thrombosis in an additional 10% (95% CI, 0–20.7%).

- **Conclusion**: In this group of low-risk postpartum patients, we identified a high prevalence of definite pelvic vein intraluminal filling defects of uncertain clinical significance. This study suggests that some degree of pelvic vein intraluminal filling defect may be a normal finding after uncomplicated vaginal delivery.

### Computed tomography imaging of septic shock. Beyond the cause: the "CT hypoperfusion complex". A pictorial essay [^113DpGcB]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Septic shock qualifies as a medical emergency and represents one of the most important causes for presentation to the Emergency Department (ED). Sepsis refers to life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated host response to infection. According to the new Septic 2016 definition, also referred to as Sepsis-3, septic shock patients can be identified by the co-occurrence of sepsis symptoms with persistent hypotension that requires vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg or higher or serum lactate levels > 2 mmol/L (18 mg/dL), despite adequate volume resuscitation. This revised definition emphasizes that sepsis is the primary cause of death from infection.

Sepsis-associated mortality is high, ranging from 10 to 40%, and the incidence of sepsis has continuously increased in parallel with the average age of the population and the increased invasiveness of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Mortality is associated with multiple pathogenic factors, including the timeliness of diagnosis and the execution of appropriate and early treatment. Due to the high mortality rate, the early identification and appropriate management of sepsis are crucial to improving outcomes as well as time-dependent emergencies such as polytrauma, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke. The management of septic shock requires prompt recognition and the appropriate administration of antibiotic therapy, hemodynamic support, and the identification and treatment of the infection source. Early sepsis identification is the cornerstone of management.

### What is the significance of ovarian vein reflux detected by computed tomography in patients with pelvic pain [^1142MNCz]. Clinical Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common gynecological complaint. CPP refers to nonmenstrual pain localized in the anatomic pelvis for at least six months' duration without any identifiable organic cause, which is severe enough to cause functional disability and require treatment. Pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS) is a poorly understood disorder and often an overlooked cause of pelvic pain. Ovarian vein reflux (OVR) and pelvic varicosities are contributors to PCS. Conversely, OVR can be observed in asymptomatic women, typically those who have been parous. OVR has a characteristic appearance on enhanced computed tomography (CT); contrast medium retrogradely fills the ovarian veins and parauterine veins during the arterial phase after intravenous contrast administration.

While CT is not the ideal modality to evaluate all causes of pelvic pain, it is a commonly used diagnostic tool to screen patients presenting with abdominal and pelvic pain. CT can demonstrate abnormal ovarian venous flow as well as tortuous and dilated ovarian and pelvic veins. Recognizing ovarian vein reflux is important, as when correlated with the patient's clinical presentation, it may aid in the diagnosis of PCS.

### A comparison of the accuracy of ultrasound and computed tomography in common diagnoses causing acute abdominal pain [^116r4nEm]. European Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

After clinical assessment at the ED, all consenting patients underwent ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) within a few hours of presentation to the ED. Ultrasound and CT were independently evaluated by two different blinded observers. Between 5 pm and 11 pm, when often only one attending radiologist or radiological resident was present, both ultrasound and CT were evaluated by the same observer. The ultrasound examination was performed and evaluated by the observers: the attending radiologist or radiological resident, not by a sonographer. To guarantee a blinded evaluation for study purposes, ultrasound was performed first and documented in the case record form. CT was only evaluated after finalising the ultrasound part of the case record form.

The CT findings with immediate treatment consequences were communicated to the treating physician. In cases presenting after hours, CT examinations were re-evaluated by an abdominal radiologist the next morning, and these findings were documented in the case record form. This radiologist was blinded to the ultrasound evaluation and had access to the same details on clinical findings as the person evaluating the ultrasound examination. This second reading was used for this comparative study, ensuring all CT examinations were read or supervised by a radiologist, contrary to ultrasound examinations, which were performed by radiological residents alone after hours.

To evaluate the effects of experience, all observers were asked to record the number of abdominal ultrasounds they had performed (< 100, 100–500, 500–1,000, 1,000–5,000).

### A diagnostic dilemma of fever and back pain postpartum [^115CJNrb]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

A 26-year-old woman presented with fever, chills, and back pain 6 weeks postpartum. An infused CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast confirmed septic pelvic vein thrombophlebitis as the diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report describing such a massive thrombophlebitis extending from the superior vena cava to the femoral vein inferiorly, responsive to conventional anticoagulation therapy. This exceptional case reminds us to consider septic pelvic thrombophlebitis in the differential diagnosis of any patient who presents with fever and back pain of unknown etiology.

### Imaging of pelvic venous disorders (PeVD); should every patient get an MRI [^114iw6m6]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Pelvic venous disease (PeVD) is part of the broad differential diagnosis of chronic pelvic pain, presenting a challenging diagnosis and clinical workup to identify those patients most likely to benefit from intervention. Ultrasound, MRI, CT, venography, and intravascular ultrasound can all provide information to aid in the diagnostic algorithm. The purpose of this article is to review imaging as a component of the outpatient workup of patients with chronic pelvic pain. This guides appropriate understanding and use of imaging modalities to accurately identify patients suffering from PeVD. A favored approach is to begin with transabdominal sonography with selective use of MRI/MRV in specific patient populations.

### Initial imaging assessment of severe blunt trauma [^112EuLhr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Total body computed tomography (CT) scans are increasingly used in traumatized patients, but the necessity for an initial rapid imaging assessment beforehand remains unknown. To address this problem, we assessed the value of an initial imaging assessment (chest X-ray, pelvic X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography) in severely traumatized patients in a prospective study.

- **Design and setting**: Prospective study of a cohort in a level 1 trauma center of a university teaching hospital.

- **Patients and interventions**: The study involved 400 patients with severe blunt trauma. Within 30 minutes of arrival at the hospital, these patients underwent a rapid imaging assessment at the bedside, including chest and pelvic X-ray, and an abdominal ultrasonography. The decisions taken for each imaging technique (chest drainage or thoracotomy, pelvic angiography, and laparotomy, respectively) were judged as appropriate or inappropriate.

- **Measurements and results**: Emergency chest drainage or thoracotomy was performed in 78 cases (78 appropriate), pelvic angiography in 8 cases (5 appropriate), and immediate laparotomy in 48 cases (47 appropriate). Emergency treatment was decided in 108 patients, and the decisions were considered appropriate in 392 (98%, 95% CI: 97%-99%) cases. Three variables (heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, and Glasgow Coma Scale) were independent predictors of the need for an emergency decision; however, among patients who had none of these criteria, 16% required an emergency decision.

A simple and rapid initial imaging assessment enabled appropriate emergency decisions before further imaging.

### Vascular CT and MRI: A practical guide to imaging protocols [^11246a6p]. Insights into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

CT and MR venography of the abdomen and pelvis are commonly performed to assess the extension of lower limb deep vein thromboses (DVTs) or a compressive venous syndrome, such as May-Thurner syndrome, where the left common iliac vein is obstructed by the crossing right common iliac artery. MR venography (MRV) is preferable to CT venography (CTV) due to the presence of contrast mixing artefacts in the latter. Imaging of the thighs may be included (Figures 13 and 14). CTV is preferred for assessing potential inferior vena cava (IVC) filter complications, such as malposition, migration, tilting, caval thrombosis, or perforation.

- **Figure 13**: A 45-year-old man with bilateral leg swelling underwent an MR venogram of the abdomen and pelvis. Coronal image from a T2-weighted sequence demonstrates an expanded suprarenal IVC with heterogeneous T2 high signal material, likely thrombus (arrow). Coronal and axial images from a venous phase T1-weighted fat-saturated post-gadolinium sequence demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement of the intraluminal IVC material, concerning for tumour thrombus. A coronal image from a T1-weighted fat-saturated post-gadolinium sequence of the abdomen demonstrates a horseshoe kidney with an exophytic mass arising from the right lower moiety (curved arrow), which was subsequently confirmed as a papillary renal cell carcinoma on biopsy.

- **Figure 14**: A 35-year-old woman underwent an abdominal MR venogram 5 days post dilatation and curettage for an intrauterine fetal death at 25 weeks. Coronal images from a post-contrast venous phase fat-saturated T1-weighted sequence were obtained.

Although discouraged in childbearing-age women, CT often provides the first diagnosis of an unsuspected acute gynaecological disorder; therefore, familiarity with their imaging appearances is crucial to avoid missing or misinterpreting clinically important entities which may require surgical treatment. If clinical conditions and scanner availability permit, MRI is superior to CT for further characterisation of uterine abnormalities causing acute pain and genital bleeding. Additionally, cross-sectional imaging is helpful to elucidate the varied imaging appearances of PID and atypical genital infections.

### Computed tomography imaging of septic shock. Beyond the cause: the "CT hypoperfusion complex". A pictorial essay [^111D2YvX]. Insights into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

The importance of diagnostic imaging for establishing the infection source in septic shock is well recognized. A wide range of imaging tools is currently available for investigating septic shock. The choice of imaging modality depends on several factors, the most important being the overall clinical condition of the patient and the presence or absence of localizing signs and symptoms.

The diagnostic accuracy of CT for identifying the source of clinically suspected septic shock is well established. CT allows for the rapid and detailed study of multiple body areas simultaneously, providing a standardized method for patient evaluation that is not operator-dependent. In a few minutes, CT can provide images of multiple body regions, improving the ability to identify the septic source, which can enhance patient management. CT also plays an increasingly important role in guiding aspiration and drainage with a high degree of accuracy.

CT should be performed in all patients using a spiral technique, with craniocaudal acquisition in a supine position and abducted upper limbs, to reduce the radiation dose and ensure higher image quality of the thoraco-abdominal organs. Breath-hold acquisitions can help avoid motion artifacts. In emergency settings, CT examinations should include both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced acquisitions of the abdomen. High concentrations (370–400 mg I/mL) of intravenous contrast medium (80–130 mL iodinated contrast medium, depending on the patient) should be used.

### Polyarticular septic arthritis secondary to septic thrombophlebitis of the brachiocephalic vein: A rare case report [^114KickQ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Polyarticular septic arthritis (PASA) accounts for approximately 15% of all septic arthritides and is rare in immunocompetent adults. Even with appropriate therapy, PASA's mortality rate is nearly 50%.

- **Case report**: We report a rare presentation of PASA caused by idiopathic septic thrombophlebitis of the brachiocephalic vein in an immunocompetent adult female patient who presented with symptoms of right clavicular, left wrist, and right hip pain associated with fevers. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in blood cultures and joint aspiration of one of the affected hips. Transesophageal echocardiogram was negative for valvular vegetations, and computed tomography chest with contrast revealed thrombi in the brachiocephalic and subclavian veins extending to the superior vena cava. It also showed bilateral pulmonary nodules consistent with septic pulmonary emboli. No clear precipitant for the underlying septic thrombophlebitis was identified. Management was conservative, with systemic anticoagulation and IV antibiotics. The patient's symptoms improved, and she was discharged to subacute rehabilitation.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?** Early diagnosis and treatment of PASA in the emergency department is imperative to reducing overall morbidity and mortality associated with this condition. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case report of idiopathic septic thrombophlebitis of the subclavian vein causing PASA in an immunocompetent adult.

### Prospective comparison of contrast-enhanced computed tomography versus magnetic resonance venography in the detection of occult deep pelvic vein thrombosis in patients with pelvic and acetabular fractures [^111adjUf]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the rate of pelvic vein thrombosis following acetabular or pelvic fracture, as identified by enhanced computed tomography (CT) venography or magnetic resonance venography (MRV).

- **Design**: Prospective evaluation of CT venography and MRV in patients with pelvic and acetabular trauma to screen for deep vein thrombosis.

- **Setting**: Level I trauma center.

- **Results**: Thirty patients with pelvic or acetabular fractures who met the study criteria were prospectively screened. Pelvic deep vein thrombosis was detected by CT venography in two patients (7%) and by MRV in four patients (13%). Invasive selective pelvic venographies were performed on the five subjects who tested positive in one or both screening tests. Only one CT venography case was validated by invasive pelvic venography. The false-positive rate for CT venography was 50%, whereas the false-positive rate for MRV was 100%.

- **Conclusions**: We cannot recommend the sole use of either CT venography or MRV to screen and direct the treatment of asymptomatic thrombi in patients with fracture of the pelvic ring due to the high false-positive rates. If these studies are used as screening tools, confirmation of the presence of thrombosis with selective venography should be performed prior to initiating treatment.

### Can cross-sectional imaging replace diagnostic venography in pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) [^116JanHw]. Journal of Vascular Surgery. Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The results of this study should be interpreted in the context of its limitations. The present study included a limited sample size, thus is at risk of type II error. The results may be subject to selection bias because this study is retrospective. The outcomes were reported from a single tertiary referral center, and thus may not be generalizable to other less experienced centers. The lack of IVUS is a significant limitation in assessing compression syndromes in our study. Also, the lack of treatment is considered a significant limitation because uncertainty regarding the patients' outcomes, when certain imaging modalities are not utilized, is also a considerable limitation, as the lack of treatment can affect their results.

### Consensus statement on the management of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions from the VIVA Foundation, the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society [^1152ofGd]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Low credibility.

CT venography has previously demonstrated value in detecting thrombus within abdominal and pelvic venous structures. However, there are no large studies that specifically correlate the anatomic features or metrics of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVL) on CT or magnetic resonance imaging with the presence of venous stasis symptoms. A retrospective series of 50 asymptomatic patients found that 24% had more than 50% diameter compression of the left iliac vein on CT. MR venography demonstrated 90% sensitivity in a retrospective series of 28 patients with NIVL; however, its use is limited by availability, patient tolerance, and potential for artifacts. Venous duplex ultrasonography may be an alternative method to diagnose NIVL noninvasively in centers with local expertise in this modality. While not predictive of symptoms, these data suggest that anatomic features of NIVL can be identified by axial imaging and may be valuable in assessing for NIVL in the presence of symptoms.

### Buttock pain: a missed diagnosis [^1137kBf1]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

A 13-year-old schoolboy presented with right-sided buttock pain, features of sepsis, and Staphylococcus aureus-positive blood cultures. On examination, he was febrile and in severe pain, with limited hip rotation and positive sacroiliac stress tests. Initial imaging with pelvic X-ray, hip ultrasound, and MRI were normal. Despite this, a diagnosis of septic arthritis of the hip was presumed, and the patient underwent a washout of the right hip.

Upon more detailed review of the imaging, an abnormal section of the sacroiliac joint was noted. Subsequent pelvic MRI confirmed that this was, in fact, septic sacroiliitis. The patient made a good recovery following washout of the right sacroiliac joint and six weeks of antibiotics.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® sepsis [^113ofbwd]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). High credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. A search for the underlying cause of infection typically includes radiological imaging as part of this investigation. This document focuses on thoracic and abdominopelvic causes of sepsis. In 2017, the global incidence of sepsis was estimated to be 48.9 million cases, with 11 million sepsis-related deaths (accounting for nearly 20% of all global deaths); therefore, understanding which imaging modalities and types of studies are acceptable or not acceptable is imperative.

The five variants provided include the most commonly encountered scenarios in the setting of sepsis, along with recommendations and data for each imaging study. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European Society of Paediatric Radiology [^117Pojz1]. European Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

What is the appropriate imaging pathway in cases of suspected physical abuse in children?

Figure 6 outlines the appropriate initial and follow-up investigations for children with suspected physical abuse. The investigations depend on the age of the child, the presence or absence of abnormal neurology on examination, and the presence or absence of other physical injuries.

- **Imaging of the neuroaxis**: Children under 1 year with suspected abusive head trauma (AHT) should all have a high-resolution non-contrast CT with 3-D reformats. If this is abnormal, indicating intracranial hemorrhage, skull fracture, or parenchymal injury, the infant should proceed to an MRI of the brain and spine within 2–5 days. If the CT scan is normal, with no abnormal neurology and no suspicion of non-accidental injury, then no further imaging is required. However, if the CT is normal but there is abnormal neurology or a high index of clinical suspicion for physical abuse, then an MRI of the brain and whole spine should be performed within 2–5 days.

When an initial MRI brain is performed for suspected AHT, an MRI of the whole spine should always be performed at the same time, due to the high likelihood of associated spinal findings. MRI of the brain and spine has increased sensitivity for parenchymal injury, intracranial hemorrhage, and fluid collections. It allows further delineation of extra-axial collections, assessment of septations within collections, and differentiation of acute from chronic subdural hematomas (SDHs). Dating of extra-axial hemorrhage is notoriously challenging and is a topic of much debate in the court setting because of the impact of factors such as…

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^112f6VuT]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) is a well-recognized but rare puerperal complication that has two types: ovarian vein thrombophlebitis (OVT) and deep septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (DSPT). The present case report describes the clinical and imaging findings of a female patient diagnosed with right ovarian vein infectious thrombophlebitis after caesarean section (C-section).

- **Case presentation**: A 35-year-old G3P2 female who presented with a foetal vein Galen malformation at 41 weeks of gestation underwent C-section. The patient had a high fever after the C-section, and anti-inflammatory treatment was not effective within 1 week. An abdominal wall incision haematoma was found, and a second surgery for the removal of the abdominal wall haematoma was performed. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with abdominal incision haematoma and right ovarian vein infectious thrombophlebitis after C-section. We used imipenem and tigecycline to strengthen the anti-inflammatory effects, simultaneously administrating low-molecular-weight heparin and warfarin as anticoagulant therapy. On the 30th day after C-section, the right ovarian vein thrombus disappeared.

- **Conclusion**: This case illustrates the need to consider the potential relationship between abdominal incision haematoma and ovarian vein thrombophlebitis. Despite advances in the management of venous thromboembolism globally, more data on epidemiology in terms of first incidence, prevalence, recurrence, and risk factors, management of bleeding complications, and increased awareness in Asian populations are necessary.

### Pylephlebitis complicating acute appendicitis: Prompt diagnosis with contrast-enhanced computed tomography [^111uKV5d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Pylephlebitis, a rare complication of abdominal infections, is characterized by septic thrombophlebitis of the portal venous system, carrying high rates of morbidity and mortality.

We present a case of pylephlebitis complicating acute appendicitis and report the utility of a computed tomography scan in the diagnosis. It is crucial for emergency physicians to be aware of this condition. The prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, the clinical presentation is often nonspecific. A computed tomography scan is instrumental in the early diagnosis of pylephlebitis because it readily reveals the thrombus in the mesenteric or portal vein in the setting of acute appendicitis. Early and aggressive treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is necessary, and anticoagulation therapy can also be used to prevent bowel ischemia.

### The spectrum of pelvic inflammatory disease [^1152dbdw]. European Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pelvic infection presents a serious problem for the practicing physician and the radiologist called to determine the origin and extent of the inflammatory process. Pelvic infections may clinically mimic other pelvic inflammatory processes. Imaging, based on the various aspects of these conditions, may provide crucial information to distinguish pelvic infections from other pelvic pathological conditions. This article reviews the various imaging modalities involved in the radiological management of pelvic infections, as well as their findings, with special attention to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

### ACR appropriateness criteria acutely limping child up to age 5 [^116v5bXi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2018). High credibility.

Imaging plays an important role in the evaluation of the acutely limping child. The decision-making process about initial imaging must consider the level of suspicion for infection and whether symptoms can be localized.

The appropriateness of specific imaging examinations in the acutely limping child up to age 5 is discussed with attention in each clinical scenario to the role of radiography, ultrasound, nuclear medicine, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. Common causes of limping such as toddler's fracture, septic arthritis, transient synovitis, and osteomyelitis are discussed.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Role of multidetector CT in the management of acute female pelvic disease [^114mZiE3]. Emergency Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to highlight the role of multidetector CT (MDCT) in emergency radiology as a useful tool in the diagnosis and management of acute female pelvic disease and to describe key radiologic signs to improve differential diagnosis. We retrospectively reviewed MDCT findings of acute pelvic disease and its mimics in women reporting to the emergency room at our institution from December 2006 to August 2008.

We describe MDCT findings of gynecologic and obstetric disorders such as hemorrhagic ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, intravascular leiomyomatosis, blunt maternal trauma, and postpartum and post-cesarean section complications. We also briefly review gastrointestinal tract entities that may mimic these conditions. Although ultrasound is the imaging modality of choice for the evaluation of female pelvic pain, the role of MDCT remains essential in the management of patients in which gynecologic exploration is not diagnostic or undone since it is not the initial suspicion.

### Imaging in pelvic osteomyelitis: Support for early magnetic resonance imaging [^1163yrMe]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Children with pelvic osteomyelitis may present with symptoms that are nonspecific. Conventional imaging modalities, including plain radiographs, ultrasound, technetium bone scans, and computed tomography, rarely demonstrate pathology diagnostic of this condition. As a result, accurate diagnosis is often delayed, and children may undergo surgical diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that could be avoided. We report the radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 23 children admitted with a suspected diagnosis of pelvic osteomyelitis. The focus is on MRI abnormalities, proposing an anatomical classification based on patterns of pelvic involvement.

- **Methods**: The medical records and imaging reports of all patients admitted to our institution with symptoms suggestive of pelvic osteomyelitis between July 31, 1992, and March 10, 2003, were reviewed. Criteria for diagnosis were defined based on those used by Farley et al. in 1985. Special attention was given to imaging strategies and the influence of each radiographic method on the ultimate diagnosis.

- **Results**: Abnormalities on the MRI included soft tissue inflammation and bone edema, which appeared bright on T2 and short inversion time Short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) images and enhanced after gadolinium administration. Five distinct patterns of pelvic involvement were observed, each corresponding to a cartilaginous epiphysis or apophysis.

### Postpartum septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and ovarian vein thrombosis after caesarean section: a rare case report [^1153Vbzz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

In view of the lack of precise laboratory examination methods, the diagnosis of SPT has been challenged. After physical examination, the patient usually has no toxic reaction. The lower abdomen may have tenderness on palpation, and occasionally, a cord or sausage-like abdominal tenderness may be recognized. This is the most diagnostic finding in an abdominal examination, but it is rare. In less than one-third of cases, leukocytosis is moderate, and blood cultures are positive. In this case, although the patient's clinical condition did not change, the analysis parameters of inflammation improved after the third antibiotic treatment.

Although the incidence of VTE in Asian populations is lower than that in Western countries, the overall burden of VTE in Asia has been greatly underestimated. Factors that can explain the lower prevalence of VTE in Asian populations relative to Western populations may include the limited availability of Asian epidemiological data, ethnic differences in genetic susceptibility to VTE, low awareness of thrombotic diseases in diagnosis, and fewer Asian patients with symptomatic VTE. Generally, the clinical evaluation, diagnostic tests, and treatment precautions of VTE between Asian and Western populations are the same. Management of VTE is based on balancing the benefits of treatment with the risk of bleeding. For Asian populations, this is a particularly important consideration because of the increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage caused by the use of vitamin K antagonists.
