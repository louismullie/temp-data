## Question

How often does hormone evaluation or follow up imaging need to be done if it is under 1 cm

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how often hormone evaluation or follow-up imaging should be done for thyroid nodules under 1 cm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial hormonal assessment and when a radionuclide scan is indicated. Then, I should verify the ultrasound-based risk stratification and how it changes management for subcentimeter nodules. Next, I will examine the follow-up intervals by risk category, including when no routine follow-up is needed. After that, I should consider special situations that warrant earlier evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant schedule and double-check for any exceptions or controversies before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the initial hormonal evaluation. For any newly discovered thyroid nodule, I need to check a serum TSH because a suppressed TSH suggests autonomy and shifts the workup toward a radionuclide scan rather than biopsy, whereas a normal or elevated TSH supports proceeding with ultrasound risk stratification and size-based decisions for FNA, particularly for nodules 1 cm or larger [^116Dmdi7] [^116ZnosJ].

> Wait, let me verify the role of scintigraphy in subcentimeter disease. If TSH is low or low-normal, I should obtain a radionuclide thyroid scan, preferably with iodine-123, to determine whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, because hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and generally do not require FNA, though I need to ensure overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is addressed appropriately if present [^116Dmdi7] [^113QwhX4].

> Next, I should review ultrasound risk stratification for nodules under 1 cm, since this drives follow-up. Hold on, I should verify the ATA categories: very low suspicion patterns include spongiform nodules and pure cysts, low to intermediate suspicion include mildly hypoechoic or iso/hyper echoic solid nodules without high-risk features, and high suspicion include solid hypoechoic nodules with irregular margins, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide shape, or extrathyroidal extension; these features correlate with malignancy risk and guide whether surveillance or biopsy is indicated in small nodules [^notfound].

> I will now examine the key principle for subcentimeter nodules. The ATA advises that nodules 1 cm or smaller with very low suspicion ultrasound patterns, including spongiform nodules and pure cysts, do not require routine ultrasound surveillance, which helps avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment in this low-risk group; I should confirm that this applies when there are no suspicious nodes or worrisome clinical features [^116JsbJ6] [^114oR7ix].

> Let me consider the low to intermediate suspicion subcentimeter nodules. For nodules under 1 cm that do not meet FNA criteria, the ATA suggests repeat ultrasound at 12–24 months if they are low to intermediate suspicion, whereas high suspicion nodules under 1 cm warrant earlier follow-up at 6–12 months; I should double-check that these intervals are contingent on stability and clinical context, and that growth or new suspicious features would prompt reconsideration of FNA thresholds even below 1 cm [^114oR7ix] [^112NbJkF].

> But wait, what if the nodule is very small, like under 5 mm. I need to ensure I am not over-calling biopsy; AACE/ACE/AME recommends that nodules under 5 mm should be monitored with ultrasound rather than biopsied, and for 5–10 mm nodules, FNA is considered only when suspicious ultrasound features are present or there are high-risk clinical factors, aligning with a conservative approach to tiny nodules [^114UXq3y] [^117RMjYk].

> Next, I should review special situations that override routine intervals. Hold on, I should verify the triggers: suspicious cervical lymph nodes, extrathyroidal extension, a personal or family history of thyroid cancer, or focal 18F-FDG-PET uptake increase the pretest probability and may justify earlier evaluation or even FNA below the usual 1 cm threshold, so I need to keep these exceptions in mind when planning follow-up [^117RMjYk] [^114K7fRy].

> Let me synthesize a practical schedule and make sure it aligns with guidelines. For very low suspicion subcentimeter nodules, no routine ultrasound follow-up is needed; for low to intermediate suspicion nodules under 1 cm, repeat ultrasound in 12–24 months if stable and extend the interval thereafter; for high suspicion subcentimeter nodules, repeat ultrasound in 6–12 months; and for nodules under 5 mm, avoid biopsy and use ultrasound monitoring only, adjusting based on growth or evolving features; throughout, I should recheck TSH only if clinically indicated or if nodule management changes, rather than at fixed intervals [^116JsbJ6] [^114oR7ix] [^114UXq3y].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought to apply the same 12–24 month interval across all subcentimeter nodules, but that would over-surveil very low suspicion lesions; I should correct that and reserve routine follow-up for those with at least low to intermediate suspicion features, while avoiding routine imaging for spongiform or purely cystic nodules under 1 cm unless new risk factors emerge [^116JsbJ6] [^114oR7ix].

> I should double-check growth thresholds that would change management. A volume increase greater than 50 percent or a 20 percent increase in at least two dimensions with a minimal increase of 2 mm are commonly used to define clinically meaningful growth and may prompt FNA even in smaller nodules, so I need to ensure measurements are reproducible and consider 3D volumetry when available to reduce interobserver variability [^112NbJkF] [^11754od6].

> Finally, I need to ensure I am not inadvertently recommending TSH suppression for benign subcentimeter nodules. Routine levothyroxine suppression is not recommended for benign nodules in iodine-sufficient populations due to potential harms, so management should remain observational with risk-adapted ultrasound intervals and selective TSH reassessment as clinically indicated [^115Qw5to] [^114cck7V].

---

For nodules < 1 cm, **routine hormone testing is not required** unless there are clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction or the nodule is hyperfunctioning on scintigraphy [^111QghER]. Imaging follow-up is **risk-based**: very low suspicion nodules (spongiform or pure cysts) need no routine ultrasound [^116JsbJ6]; low to intermediate suspicion nodules should have repeat ultrasound at 12–24 months [^114oR7ix]; and high suspicion nodules should be rechecked at 6–12 months. If a nodule grows by > 20% in two dimensions or > 50% in volume, or new suspicious features appear, **repeat ultrasound and consider FNA** [^112NbJkF] [^111sdsjM]. TSH should be checked at baseline and only repeated if clinically indicated or if the nodule shows interval growth or new suspicious features.

---

## Hormone evaluation

### Baseline hormone assessment

At baseline, **TSH measurement** is recommended for all patients with thyroid nodules, including those < 1 cm, to assess thyroid function and guide further evaluation [^116pnehY] [^116ZnosJ]. Free T4 and free T3 are **not routinely indicated** unless TSH is abnormal or there are clinical signs of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.

---

### Indications for repeat hormone testing

Repeat TSH is indicated only when there are **clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction** — such as weight changes, palpitations, fatigue, or menstrual irregularities — or if the nodule grows significantly (> 20% in two dimensions or > 50% in volume) or develops new suspicious ultrasound features.

---

## Imaging follow-up

Imaging follow-up for nodules < 1 cm is **primarily based on ultrasound features and clinical judgment** [^114oR7ix]. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) and European Thyroid Association (ETA) provide clear guidance on follow-up intervals and indications for further evaluation [^114oR7ix] [^112f2ged].

---

### ATA guidelines (2015)

| **Ultrasound risk category** | **Recommended follow-up** |
|-|-|
| Very low suspicion (spongiform, pure cysts) | No routine ultrasound surveillance [^114oR7ix] |
| Low to intermediate suspicion | Repeat ultrasound at 12–24 months [^114oR7ix] |
| High suspicion | Repeat ultrasound at 6–12 months [^114oR7ix] |

---

If a nodule shows **significant growth** (> 20% in two dimensions or > 50% in volume) or develops new suspicious ultrasound features, repeat ultrasound and consider fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are recommended [^112NbJkF] [^111sdsjM].

---

### ETA guidelines (2023)

The ETA provides **more detailed follow-up recommendations** based on EU-TIRADS classification:

| **Eu-tirads category** | **Recommended follow-up** |
|-|-|
| 2 (benign) | No routine ultrasound surveillance |
| 3 (low risk) | Repeat ultrasound in 2–3 years |
| 4 (intermediate risk) | Repeat ultrasound in 1–2 years |
| 5 (high risk) | Repeat ultrasound in 6–12 months |

---

These guidelines emphasize **individualized follow-up** based on nodule characteristics and patient risk factors [^117Ph2Gh].

---

## Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors

Clinical judgment and patient-specific factors significantly influence follow-up intervals and the need for further evaluation. High-risk patients — those with a personal or family history of thyroid cancer, prior head and neck irradiation, or suspicious clinical features — may require **more frequent follow-up** [^116Vg6NX]. Patient preference also matters; some patients may prefer closer surveillance despite low-risk features, whereas others may opt for less frequent follow-up if they understand and accept the risks [^113BnLxx].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Hormone evaluation**: Baseline TSH measurement is recommended for all patients with thyroid nodules, including those < 1 cm. Repeat hormone testing is indicated only if there are clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction or significant nodule growth.

- **Imaging follow-up**: Follow-up intervals are based on ultrasound risk stratification. Very low suspicion nodules require no routine ultrasound surveillance, low to intermediate suspicion nodules require ultrasound at 12–24 months, and high suspicion nodules require ultrasound at 6–12 months.

- **Clinical judgment**: Patient-specific factors, including risk profile and preferences, should guide follow-up intervals and further evaluation.

---

Hormone evaluation for thyroid nodules < 1 cm should be limited to baseline TSH measurement, with repeat testing only if clinically indicated. Imaging follow-up should be **risk-based**, with ultrasound intervals determined by nodule characteristics and patient-specific factors.

Thyroid nodules can be detected by ultrasonography in up to 68% of the general population. They are typically benign and are often discovered incidentally. The primary goal of thyroid nodule evaluation is to determine whether it is malignant. After thyroid ultrasonography has been performed, the next step is measurement of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone. If levels are low, a radionuclide thyroid uptake scan is indicated. Hyperfunctioning nodules are rarely malignant and do not require tissue sampling. Nonfunctioning nodules and nodules in a patient with a normal or high thyroid-stimulating hormone level may require fine-needle aspiration based on ultrasound characteristics and size. Nodules with suspicious features and solid hypoechoic nodules 1 cm or larger require aspiration. The Bethesda System (categories 1 through 6) is used to classify samples. Molecular testing can be used to guide treatment when aspiration yields an indeterminate result. Molecular testing detects mutations associated with thyroid cancer and can help inform decisions about surgical excision vs. continued ultrasound monitoring. Treatment of pregnant women with nonfunctioning thyroid nodules and of children with thyroid nodules is similar to that for nonpregnant adults, with the exception of molecular testing, which has not been validated in these populations.

Background

There is no consensus on what constitutes appropriate methodology and timing for follow-up of patients after surgery for benign nodular disease.

Methods

A systematic review of the medical literature using evidence-based criteria was used to address the following four issues: (1) How often should patients who have undergone thyroidectomy for the treatment of benign nodular goiter be followed, and what constitutes appropriate follow-up? (2) What is the most appropriate method for detecting recurrent nodular thyroid disease? (3) Does thyroid hormone administration prevent recurrent nodular thyroid disease? (4) Does iodine administration prevent recurrent nodular thyroid disease?

Results

Altogether, 742 articles were found in MEDLINE using a keyword search strategy; we then narrowed them to 23 articles. There were a total of four articles with Level I data, five articles with Level II data, one article with Level III data, and 13 articles with Level IV or retrospective data.

Conclusions

Based on the available data, it is our recommendation that patients undergoing thyroid lobectomy for benign nodular thyroid disease should be followed with an annual physical examination, neck ultrasonography, and serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement. Patients undergoing total thyroidectomy should be followed with an annual physical examination and a serum TSH measurement. Routine thyroxine and/or iodine supplementation may be useful for preventing recurrence in patients from iodine-deficient regions.

Thyroid nodule evaluation — serum thyrotropin (TSH) and radionuclide scan — With the discovery of a thyroid nodule > 1 cm in any diameter, a serum TSH level should be obtained, and if the serum TSH is subnormal, a radionuclide thyroid scan should be obtained to document whether the nodule is hyperfunctioning, isofunctioning, or nonfunctioning. Since hyperfunctioning nodules rarely harbor malignancy, if one corresponds to the nodule, no cytologic evaluation is necessary, although if overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism is present, additional evaluation is required. A higher serum TSH level, even within the upper part of the reference range, is associated with increased risk of malignancy in a thyroid nodule, as well as more advanced stage thyroid cancer.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for thyroid nodules, more specifically with respect to follow-up evaluation, benign by FNA, ATA 2016 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence regarding the use and time interval of surveillance ultrasound for risk of malignancy in patients with nodules > 1 cm with very low suspicion ultrasound patterns (including spongiform nodules) and pure cysts. Obtain ultrasound at ≥ 24 months if repeated.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^115CxSTn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, current guidelines recommend repeat evaluation of a benign thyroid nodule after 1–2 years, which is only based on expert opinion. This study suggests that this recommendation can be safely extended to 3 years without increased malignancy and mortality risk, or likelihood of harm. Nodule growth can be expected, and therefore young patients, those experiencing possible structural symptoms, or those with larger nodules at baseline may be candidates for modified recommendations. Conversely, even longer follow-up intervals should be considered for older patients with predominantly cystic nodules. While replication of these data in large prospective multicenter studies is needed, this extension in follow-up interval would reduce unnecessary visits and medical interventions for millions of affected patients worldwide, leading to healthcare savings.

Availability of data and materials

These data are not publicly available as these concern patient-related data.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

The approach to the thyroid nodule has been incrementally modified over the past decade. The widespread adoption of fine needle aspiration in the 1980s, coupled with increased use of serial ultrasound monitoring, arguably led to the biggest changes in recommendations for surgical intervention during the past 50 years. For the office-based practitioner, thyroid nodule presentation patterns are changing with discoveries of more thyroid "incidentalomas" and with new risk assessment challenges associated with small (< 1 cm) nodules. At the same time, improved primary evaluation techniques, most notably the increasing use of small, portable ultrasound imaging units, are making many clinicians more comfortable in recommending less invasive follow-up.

Diagnostic whole-body radioiodine (RAI) scans (C11) during follow-up — after the initial posttreatment WBS performed following RAI remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy, low-risk and intermediate-risk patients (lower risk features) with an undetectable Tg on thyroid hormone with negative anti-Tg antibodies and a negative US (excellent response to therapy) do not require routine diagnostic WBS during follow-up (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). For higher-risk surveillance, Diagnostic WBS, either following thyroid hormone withdrawal or rhTSH, 6–12 months after adjuvant RAI therapy can be useful in the follow-up of patients with high or intermediate risk (higher risk features) of persistent disease (see risk stratification system, section [B19]) and should be done with 123I or low activity 131I (Strong recommendation, Low-quality evidence); in patients with uptake on planar imaging, SPECT/CT RAI imaging is preferred over planar imaging in patients with uptake on planar imaging.

Nodules benign by FNA — Follow-up — Perform clinical follow-up of FNA benign nodules, unless symptomatic. Consider a repeat clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement in approximately 12 months in accordance with clinical setting. If nodules are unchanged at the first US control, repeat the US follow-up after 24 months. In asymptomatic nodules with a repeated benign cytology and no suspicious clinical or US features, routine follow-up may be avoided. In nodules with benign cytology but suspicious clinical or US features, a repeat FNA is recommended. In nodules with an increase > 50% in volume or that become symptomatic, we recommend repeat FNA.

Thyroid nodules — prevalence and risk assessment — are detected in up to 50 to 60% of healthy people, most patients are asymptomatic and often euthyroid so malignancy must be ruled out by reviewing clinical and US risk factors, and all patients with a palpable thyroid nodule or clinical risk factors should undergo US examination.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodule management — follow-up after benign FNA cytology: Thyroid nodules with benign cytologic findings and no clinical or ultrasound (US) risk factors should be followed-up clinically if they are asymptomatic, with clinical and US examination and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement appropriate in 12 to 24 months; in patients with stable US features and size, subsequent clinical controls may be performed at 2-year intervals. As a general rule, routine repeat FNA is not necessary, but cytologic assessment should be repeated for initially benign cytology with suspicious US findings because of the low (about 1%-2%) possibility of false-negative results, and reaspiration under US guidance should be performed when a nodule shows suspicious US changes, enlarges substantially, or becomes symptomatic. Observational data report a mean follow-up of 3 years with false-negative results in less than 1.5% of cases, and a minority of benign nodules — about 11% to 15% over 5 years — present progressive growth; volume increase should prompt repeat FNA only when the increase is more than 50% over 12 months.

Thyroid nodule definition and evaluation thresholds — nonpalpable and palpable nodules of the same size carry similar malignancy risk, and evaluation is generally size-based: nonpalpable nodules have "the same risk of malignancy as do sonographically confirmed palpable nodules of the same size", and "only nodules > 1 cm should be evaluated", although "there may be nodules < 1 cm that require further evaluation because of clinical symptoms or associated lymphadenopathy". The guideline adds that pursuing all very small cancers "is deemed to cause more harm than good", and overall "most thyroid nodules are low risk, and many thyroid cancers pose minimal risk to human health and can be effectively treated".

Table 13 — Response-to-therapy reclassification after total thyroidectomy and radioiodine (RAI) remnant ablation defines four categories with thresholds, outcomes, and management. Excellent response is negative imaging and either suppressed thyroglobulin (Tg) < 0.2 ng/mL or TSH-stimulated Tg < 1 ng/mL (in the absence of anti-Tg antibodies), with 1%–4% recurrence and < 1% disease specific death; an excellent response to therapy should lead to an early decrease in the intensity and frequency of follow up and the degree of TSH suppression. Biochemical incomplete response is negative imaging with suppressed Tg ≥ 1 ng/mL or stimulated Tg ≥ 10 ng/mL or rising anti-Tg antibody levels; at least 30% spontaneously evolve to no evidence of disease (NED), 20% achieve NED after additional therapy, 20% develop structural disease, and < 1% disease specific death; if associated with stable or declining serum Tg values, a biochemical incomplete response should lead to continued observation with ongoing TSH suppression, whereas rising Tg or anti-Tg antibody values should prompt additional investigations and potentially additional therapies. Structural incomplete response is structural or functional evidence of disease with any Tg level (with or without anti-Tg antibodies), with 50%–85% continuing to have persistent disease despite additional therapy and disease specific death rates as high as 11% with loco-regional metastases and 50% with structural distant metastases; this may lead to additional treatments or ongoing observation depending on clinico-pathologic factors including size, location, rate of growth, RAI avidity, 18FDG avidity, and specific pathology of the structural lesion(s). Indeterminate response comprises nonspecific imaging findings or faint uptake in the thyroid bed on RAI scanning, nonstimulated Tg detectable but < 1 ng/mL, stimulated Tg detectable but < 10 ng/mL, or anti-Tg antibodies stable or declining without structural or functional disease; 15%–20% will have structural disease identified during follow-up, the remainder are stable or resolve, and < 1% disease specific death; an indeterminate response should lead to continued observation with appropriate serial imaging and serum Tg monitoring, with additional imaging or biopsy if findings become suspicious.

Clinical practice guideline recommendations

Recommendations for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer extracted from these guidelines are shown in Table 4. Regarding the diagnostic procedures, all guidelines advocated thyroid sonography. In addition, a measurement of TSH and free thyroxine levels should be performed in all patients. A routine measurement of serum thyroidglobulin (Tg) for the initial evaluation of thyroid nodules is not recommended. However, although all the guidelines supported FNA as the procedure of choice in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the CPGs define various nodular sizes as indications for FNA. The German Association of Endocrine Surgeons (GAES), IKNL, and Northern Cancer Network (NCN) guidelines recommend that FNA should be performed in all nodules, two CPGs recommend that the indication of FNA must be performed in nodules > 0.5 cm in diameter, and the other three CPGs suggest that FNA cytology is needed when the thyroid nodule is bigger than 1 cm in the absence of clinical suspicion. In the 2013 version of the NCCN guidelines, the threshold for FNA is a solid thyroid nodule > 1.5 cm, if no suspicious sonographic features are present. For laboratory evaluation, four CPGs recommend routine serum calcitonin, particularly before surgery for nodular thyroid disease. Four guidelines suggest a serum calcitonin assay as an optional test, but the American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines cannot recommend or discourage the routine measurement of serum calcitonin, because of insufficient evidence. For radionuclide scanning, three guidelines mentioned thyroid scintigraphy in a single thyroid nodule with a low TSH level, and the GAES CPGs recommend thyroid scintigraphy before the planning and execution of an operation.

Cervical ultrasonography (C10) after thyroid surgery — cervical US to evaluate the thyroid bed and central and lateral cervical nodal compartments should be performed at 6–12 months and then periodically, depending on the patient's risk for recurrent disease and Tg status (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If a positive result would change management, ultrasonographically suspicious lymph nodes ≥ 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter should be biopsied for cytology with Tg measurement in the needle washout fluid (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence), whereas suspicious lymph nodes < 8–10 mm in the smallest diameter may be followed without biopsy with consideration for FNA or intervention if there is growth or if the node threatens vital structures (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Low-risk patients who have had remnant ablation, negative cervical US, and a low serum Tg on thyroid hormone therapy in a sensitive assay (< 0.2 ng/mL) or after TSH stimulation (Tg < 1 ng/mL) can be followed primarily with clinical examination and Tg measurements on thyroid hormone replacement (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

Differentiated thyroid cancer — thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression targets in long-term follow-up (Recommendation 70) are response-specific. In patients with a structural incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained below 0.1 mU/L indefinitely in the absence of specific contraindications (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients with a biochemical incomplete response to therapy, the serum TSH should be maintained between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L, taking into account the initial ATA risk classification, Tg level, Tg trend over time, and risk of TSH suppression (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients who presented with high-risk disease but have an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, consideration should be given to maintaining thyroid hormone therapy to achieve serum TSH levels of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for up to 5 years after which the degree of TSH suppression can be reduced with continued surveillance for recurrence (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with an excellent (clinically and biochemically free of disease) or indeterminate response to therapy, especially those at low risk for recurrence, the serum TSH may be kept within the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). In patients who have not undergone remnant ablation or adjuvant therapy who demonstrate an excellent or indeterminate response to therapy with a normal neck US, and low or undetectable suppressed serum Tg, and Tg or anti-Tg antibodies that are not rising, the serum TSH can be allowed to rise to the low reference range (0.5–2 mU/L) (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence).

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^113BnLxx]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Approximately 60% of adults harbor 1 or more thyroid nodules. The possibility of cancer is the overriding concern, but only about 5% prove to be malignant. The widespread use of diagnostic imaging and improved access to health care favor the discovery of small, subclinical nodules and small papillary cancers. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment is associated with potentially excessive costs and nonnegligible morbidity for patients.

Evidence Acquisition

We conducted a PubMed search for the recent English-language articles dealing with thyroid nodule management.

Evidence Synthesis

The initial assessment includes an evaluation of clinical risk factors and sonographic examination of the neck. Sonographic risk-stratification systems (e.g. Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data Systems) can be used to estimate the risk of malignancy and the need for biopsy based on nodule features and size. When cytology findings are indeterminate, molecular analysis of the aspirate may obviate the need for diagnostic surgery. Many nodules will not require biopsy. These nodules and those that are cytologically benign can be managed with long-term follow-up alone. If malignancy is suspected, options include surgery (increasingly less extensive), active surveillance or, in selected cases, minimally invasive techniques.

Conclusion

Thyroid nodule evaluation is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. For most nodules, the likelihood of malignancy can be confidently estimated without resorting to cytology or molecular testing, and low-frequency surveillance is sufficient for most patients. When there are multiple options for diagnosis and/or treatment, they should be discussed with patients as frankly as possible to identify an approach that best meets their needs.

Recommendation 33 — Thyroid nodules in patients with GD should be evaluated and managed according to recently published guidelines for nodules in otherwise nonthyroidal individuals. Strength of evidence: Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Thyroid cancer occurs in GD with a frequency of 2% or less. Thyroid nodules larger than 1–1.5 cm should be evaluated before RAI therapy, and nonfunctioning or hypofunctioning nodules on RAI scan should be considered for fine-needle aspiration; if cytopathology is suspicious or diagnostic of malignancy, surgery is advised after normalization of thyroid function with ATDs. Disease-free survival at 20 years is reported to be 99% after thyroid surgery for GD in patients with small (≤ 1 cm) coexisting thyroid cancers. The use of thyroid ultrasound in all patients with GD identifies more nodules and cancer than palpation and 123I scintigraphy, but further study is required before routine ultrasound (which may lead to surgery) can be recommended; ATA has published updated guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

### Thyroid nodules [^117GQ6P4]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Palpable thyroid nodules occur in 4 to 7 percent of the population, but nodules found incidentally on ultrasonography suggest a prevalence of 19 to 67 percent. The majority of thyroid nodules are asymptomatic. Because about 5 percent of all palpable nodules are found to be malignant, the main objective of evaluating thyroid nodules is to exclude malignancy. Laboratory evaluation, including a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, can help differentiate a thyrotoxic nodule from an euthyroid nodule. In euthyroid patients with a nodule, fine-needle aspiration should be performed, and radionuclide scanning should be reserved for patients with indeterminate cytology or thyrotoxicosis. Insufficient specimens from fine-needle aspiration decrease when ultrasound guidance is used. Surgery is the primary treatment for malignant lesions, and the extent of surgery depends on the extent and type of disease. Ablation by postoperative radioactive iodine is done for high-risk patients — identified as those with metastatic or residual disease. While suppressive therapy with thyroxine is frequently used postoperatively for malignant lesions, its use for management of benign solitary thyroid nodules remains controversial.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^113oTau4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are increasingly common, affecting 5–20% of the adult population. Once detected, ultrasound (US) is recommended, often in conjunction with fine needle aspiration (FNA). A benign cytological result is obtained in 65–75% of cases, most often leading to a recommendation for conservative (i.e. non-surgical) management. However, cytological examination is not flawless and many studies confirm a modest, though non-negligible 1–10% risk of a false-negative cytology (i.e. malignancy). Because of this, physicians have long recommended continued follow-up of cytologically benign nodules.

However, the empirical evidence for this recommendation remains weak, as there are little data on the optimal time interval for such a repeat evaluation, while other investigations have suggested a negligible risk of disease-specific mortality regardless of follow-up strategy. Current guidelines recommend repeat evaluation after 1–2 years; however, this is based solely on expert opinion. Furthermore, it is unclear what specific findings at the time of repeat evaluation should prompt concern or further investigation, which has led to confusion and variability in clinical practice.

The importance of establishing improved guidance should not be underestimated. Thyroid nodules afflict millions of patients worldwide, and most prove benign. Despite this, follow-up and repeat assessment are extended over many years, with some undergoing lifelong follow-up. Nodule growth can be expected over time, though most often it does not signal malignant concern. While US is superior to physical examination of the neck, such technology also exacerbates concern regarding small changes in nodule size or parenchyma. In an era of increasing healthcare cost and intervention, some have argued that overtreatment and overdiagnosis of nodular thyroid disease is occurring. It is estimated that over 500,000 thyroid nodule aspirates occur annually in the United States alone (Medicare data); as 300,000–350,000 will prove benign, millions of repeat assessments are mandated during the years thereafter. Determining the optimal time interval for such evaluations would reduce unnecessary anxieties, while likely leading to fewer US examinations, repeat aspirations, and thyroidectomies. Ultimately, patient morbidity may be decreased while healthcare savings are realized.

### Management of incidental thyroid nodules [^116AAXv8]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Thyroid nodules are widely prevalent, and often discovered incidentally. Malignancy rates are low for incidental thyroid nodules, and overall outcomes are favorable regardless of diagnosis. Patients with thyroid nodules should be evaluated with TSH levels followed by ultrasound of the thyroid and cervical lymph nodes. It is important to recognize sonographic features suspicious for thyroid malignancy and obtain biopsies when indicated according to major society guidelines. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology along with molecular testing can help guide management decisions regarding thyroid nodules. Surgical resection and other emerging technologies are safe and effective for the treatment of thyroid nodules needing intervention.

AACE/ACE/AME thyroid nodules — ultrasound (US) indications and objectives: High-resolution US is the most sensitive test available for detecting thyroid nodules, measuring their dimensions, identifying their content, and evaluating any associated changes in the thyroid gland. If results of palpation are normal, US should be performed when a thyroid nodule is suspected on clinical grounds or risk factors have been recognized. In all patients with palpable thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters (MNGs), US should be performed to achieve the following: aid in the diagnosis of diffuse causes (e.g., chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis), look for coincidental thyroid nodules or diffuse thyroid gland changes, detect US features suggestive of malignancy and select the lesions for biopsy, assess the presence of extracapsular growth or suspicious lymph nodes, and obtain an objective measure of the baseline volume of the thyroid gland and of lesions assigned to follow-up or nonsurgical therapy.

### Evaluation of a thyroid nodule [^113ZvQ5R]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The thyroid specialist frequently evaluates thyroid nodules because they may represent malignancy. Nodules are typically found on physical examination or incidentally when other imaging studies are performed. Malignant or symptomatic nodules that compress nearby structures warrant surgical excision. Yet, the majority of thyroid nodules are asymptomatic and benign, so the thyroid surgeon must rely on diagnostic studies to determine when surgery is indicated. Ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for thyroid nodules, and the ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the preferred method of tissue sampling. Nodules 1 cm or larger or nodules with suspicious sonographic appearance warrant cytologic analysis to better quantify the risk for malignancy. Molecular biomarkers are a powerful adjunct to cytology. Detecting malignancy preoperatively allows total thyroidectomy in a single operation without the need for frozen section or a second operation for completion of a thyroidectomy if malignancy is found during the initial thyroid lobectomy.

Thyroid nodule size and growth — surveillance and risk considerations: Currently, about 50% of cytologic diagnoses of thyroid malignancy relate to papillary thyroid microcarcinomas (PTMCs) ≤ 10 mm in diameter. Even when size does not predict benign versus malignant, consideration should be given that the risk of cancer is slightly higher in nodules > 4 cm, and a large size (> 4 cm) is a risk factor for a more advanced stage in differentiated thyroid carcinoma. During follow-up, the appearance of suspicious changes at ultrasound (US) examination should prompt repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA). Growth is not synonymous with malignancy because benign hyperplastic nodules may have a slow constant growth, whereas PTMC may be stable for years, and rapid growth is observed only in rare aggressive tumors and is usually associated with major US and clinical signs of aggressiveness. Rather than a sign of malignancy, steady nodule growth is a relevant issue when deciding an appropriate shift to active clinical management, and US monitoring is critical for assessing the response to nonsurgical therapies. Measurement of the major nodule diameter is of limited value and should not be considered a reliable index due to interobserver variability quantified in about 20%.

Although thyroid nodules are a common clinical entity, few (5% to 10%) are malignant and require surgical treatment. Most nodules are discovered incidentally in patients undergoing surveillance for medical reasons unrelated to thyroid disorders. Therefore, a systematic approach to their evaluation is important to avoid unnecessary surgery. High-resolution ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration have resulted in substantial improvements in diagnostic accuracy, cost reductions, and higher malignancy yield at the time of surgery. In this article, the authors present practical guidelines and a suggested management strategy for the effective diagnosis and management of incidentally discovered thyroid nodules.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and associazione medici endocrinologi medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules [^116pnehY]. Endocrine Practice (2006). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common and are frequently benign. Current data suggest that the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules is 3% to 7% in North America; the prevalence is as high as 50% based on ultrasonography (US) or autopsy data. The introduction of sensitive thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH) assays, the widespread application of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, and the availability of high-resolution US have substantially improved the management of thyroid nodules. This document was prepared as a collaborative effort between the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) and the Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME). Most Task Force members are members of AACE. We have used the AACE protocol for clinical practice guidelines, with rating of available evidence, linking the guidelines to the strength of recommendations. Key observations include the following. Although most patients with thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, occasionally patients complain of dysphagia, dysphonia, pressure, pain, or symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism. Absence of symptoms does not rule out a malignant lesion; thus, it is important to review risk factors for malignant disease. Thyroid US should not be performed as a screening test. All patients with a palpable thyroid nodule, however, should undergo US examination. US-guided FNA (US-FNA) is recommended for nodules ≥ 10 mm; US-FNA is suggested for nodules < 10 mm only if clinical information or US features are suspicious. Thyroid FNA is reliable and safe, and smears should be interpreted by an experienced pathologist. Patients with benign thyroid nodules should undergo follow-up, and malignant or suspicious nodules should be treated surgically. A radioisotope scan of the thyroid is useful if the TSH level is low or suppressed. Measurement of serum TSH is the best initial laboratory test of thyroid function and should be followed by measurement of free thyroxine if the TSH value is low and of thyroid peroxidase antibody if the TSH value is high. Percutaneous ethanol injection is useful in the treatment of cystic thyroid lesions; large, symptomatic goiters may be treated surgically or with radioiodine. Routine measurement of serum calcitonin is not recommended. Suggestions for thyroid nodule management during pregnancy are presented. We believe that these guidelines will be useful to clinical endocrinologists, endocrine surgeons, pediatricians, and internists whose practices include management of patients with thyroid disorders. These guidelines are thorough and practical, and they offer reasoned and balanced recommendations based on the best available evidence.

Concerning thyroid surgery for DTC, patients with node-negative cancer 1 cm in diameter or more should be treated with total or near-total thyroidectomy, except where contraindications prevent this surgery. However, the NCCN and SEOM CPGs recommend total or subtotal thyroidectomy in tumors > 4 cm in diameter. In contrast, the LATS guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for DTC, regardless of tumor size. An additional surgical consideration is cervical lymph node dissection for patients with DTC. Three CPGs recommend that prophylactic central-compartment neck dissection may be performed in patients who present with a DTC with clinically uninvolved central-neck lymph nodes, especially for advanced primary tumors (nodule > 4 cm).

Recommendations for the postoperative care of DTC are varied. First, radioiodine ablation is recommended for all high-risk patients, as determined from the presence of metastases, incomplete excision, gross extrathyroidal extension of the tumor regardless of tumor size, or a primary tumor > 4 cm, even in the absence of other higher-risk factors. However, the NCN guidelines mention that routine postoperative I 131 ablation of thyroid remnants has been shown to reduce local recurrence and improve patient survival when they have tumors more than 1 cm in diameter. Moreover, the NCCN guidelines recommend that I 131 ablation be performed in patients with thyroglobulin > 1 ng/ml. Second, all CPGs emphasized the need for TSH suppression therapy following DTC surgery. However, the target levels of the TSH varied across the guidelines. Initial TSH suppression to below 0.1 mU/L is recommended for high-risk patients, whereas NCN guidelines suggest the maintenance of the TSH at 0.01 to 0.1 mU/L. Moreover, CPG recommendations were inconsistent regarding the maintenance of the TSH in low-risk patients.

### AIUM practice guideline for the performance of ultrasound examinations of the head and neck [^115oSHAB]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Endocrine — thyroid and parathyroid ultrasound is motivated by the facts that thyroid nodules are the most common lesions seen in the head and neck and that a major consideration in the evaluation of thyroid nodules is the potential for malignancy. Ultrasound evaluation of a thyroid nodule, frequently coupled with an ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), is the most reliable means to assess for potential malignancy. Hyperparathyroidism is a common clinical entity; while surgical excision via 4-gland exploration can be offered as therapy, directed exploration with excision of an abnormal gland is more frequently performed in patients with preoperative localization, and while sestamibi imaging is commonly used, ultrasound can accurately identify the abnormal gland. Indications for an ultrasound evaluation of the thyroid and parathyroid glands include but are not limited to the following: evaluation of the location and characteristics of palpable neck masses; evaluation of abnormalities detected by other imaging examinations or laboratory studies, eg, areas of abnormal uptake seen on radioisotope thyroid examinations; evaluation of the presence, size, and location of the thyroid gland; evaluation of high-risk patients for occult thyroid malignancy; follow-up of thyroid nodules, when indicated; and evaluation for recurrent disease or regional nodal metastases in patients with proven or suspected thyroid carcinoma.

Differentiated thyroid cancer — high-sensitivity serum thyroglobulin (Tg) assays and reduced need for stimulation: A Tg assay with a functional sensitivity of 0.1–0.2 ng/mL may reduce the need to perform TSH-stimulated Tg measurements, with one study showing a T4-suppressed serum Tg < 0.1 ng/mL only rarely (2%) associated with an rhTSH-stimulated Tg ≥ 2 ng/mL and, despite 42% having baseline rhTSH-stimulated Tg elevation > 0.1 ng/mL, only one patient with residual tumor; another study found TSH-suppressed Tg > 0.1 ng/mL in 14% but a 35% false-positive rate using an rhTSH-stimulated Tg cutoff of ≥ 2 ng/mL. In low-risk patients not undergoing ablation, an ultrasensitive Tg was < 1 ng/mL in 91% and < 2 ng/mL in 96% at 9 months after thyroidectomy. A second-generation assay cutoff of 0.15 ng/mL yielded a NPV of 98.6% and 91% specificity, and Tg levels on thyroid hormone therapy around 0.2–0.3 ng/mL best combine sensitivity and specificity; it was concluded that annual serum Tg on LT4 with periodic neck US is adequate with no need for rhTSH stimulation testing in those with serum Tg < 0.2–0.3 ng/mL and a stable or indeterminate neck sonogram.

### Does a restrictive diagnostic work-up for thyroid nodules lead to a different papillary thyroid cancer patient population? A comparison between Dutch and U.S. T1-T3 patient population [^11387rNm]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2015 ATA guidelines propose to de‐escalate surgical treatment for low‐risk PTC, advocating for a hemithyroidectomy rather than a total thyroidectomy for patients with 1–4 cm PTCs. However, after careful examination of the Dutch PTC population in our study, the suggestion arises that the applicability of this recommendation to the Dutch population may be more nuanced. It is feasible to perform a hemithyroidectomy in carefully selected low‐risk PTC patients, but the a priori chance of encountering these patients is low in the Dutch PTC population. Furthermore, it seems that because more incidentalomas (probably being low‐risk T1 tumors) are diagnosed in the U.S. diluting the patients outcomes for survival and recurrence, the counseling in the Netherlands for patients with T1 tumors should be based on the outcomes of our own national data. It also highlights that the diagnostic practices specific to a particular country or region should be taken into account when considering adopting a foreign recommendation and recurrence outcomes should be monitored.

The most optimal treatment for PTC is still a matter of international debate; however, national differences in diagnostic strategies PTC lead to different PTC patient populations that necessitate approaches being adapted to the national practices, advocating a data‐driven de‐escalation on a national basis.

1.9 Suggested follow‐up of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary‐like nuclear feature lesions

Cases of NIFTP represent a new thyroid tumor diagnostic category introduced in 2016 and long‐term prospective follow‐up of patients with these tumors does not exist. Therefore, our clinical suggestions are based in large part on expert opinion and retrospective case‐control studies rather than prospective trials.

The diagnosis of NIFTP should not be based on retrospective interpretation of written pathologic reports created before May of 2016. The pathologic rendering of a diagnosis of NIFTP requires that the entire tumor be available for sectioning and that the whole specimen is evaluated for presence of papillary architecture or evidence of capsular or vascular invasion. Such an evaluation is time‐consuming but necessary for accurate diagnosis and meaningful prospective data collection.

The suggestions below are no substitute for the evidence‐based, individualized, clinical judgement of a physician caring for a unique patient with thyroid nodular disease.

Based on the significant lack of tumor recurrence in several retrospectively analyzed NIFTP cohorts, 7, 24, 25 patients with resected solitary NIFTP tumors should require less active follow‐up than that recommended for patients with "low‐risk recurrence of differentiated thyroid cancer" in the 2015 American Thyroid Association guidelines. 26 Measurement of yearly quantitative thyroglobulin in patients with NIFTP is also appropriate, with expected values 6 weeks after surgery < 5 ng/mL for total thyroidectomy patients and levels < 30 ng/mL for lobectomy patients, in the absence of thyroglobulin antibodies. 27 Single thyroglobulin measurements are of less value than mapping the thyroglobulin trend over 3 or more data points. Maintenance of thyroid‐stimulating hormone in the normal range should be sufficient. If significant thyroid tissue remains in the neck, as documented by a 6‐week post‐total thyroidectomy serum thyroglobulin concentration in excess of 5, a neck ultrasound examination should be considered every 1 to 2 years for the first decade after surgery to evaluate residual thyroid tissue and lymph node architecture and size.

The NIFTP tumors are currently viewed as thyroid cancer precursors and frequently present with microcarcinomas and macrocarcinomas elsewhere in the thyroid. 28 Therefore, when there is multifocal tumor associated with an NIFTP lesion, follow‐up frequency and intensity should be based on the coexisting malignant lesion with the highest risk, as assessed by pathologic evaluation of all excised tissue.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) — extent of thyroid surgery and postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) strategy: In properly selected patients, lobectomy is associated with excellent survival, with only one disease-specific death after a median follow-up of 8 years in a cohort of 889 PTC patients with T1–T2 tumors treated with total thyroidectomy (n = 528) or lobectomy (n = 361), and a cause-specific survival rate of 98% after a median of 17 years in another series. With proper patient selection, loco-regional recurrence rates of less than 1%–4% and completion thyroidectomy rates of < 10% can be achieved following thyroid lobectomy, and in low- to intermediate-risk patients with unifocal tumors < 4 cm without extrathyroidal extension or lymph node metastases the extent of initial thyroid surgery probably has little impact on disease-specific survival. Near-total or total thyroidectomy is necessary if the overall strategy is to include RAI therapy postoperatively and is recommended if the primary thyroid carcinoma is > 4 cm, if there is gross extrathyroidal extension, or if regional or distant metastases are clinically present; for tumors between 1 and 4 cm, either bilateral thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy may be suitable, and older age (> 45 years), contralateral thyroid nodules, a personal history of radiation therapy to the head and neck, and familial DTC may be criteria for recommending a bilateral procedure because of plans for RAI therapy or to facilitate follow-up strategies.

Table 2.
Minimally Invasive Techniques for Treatment of Symptomatic, Benign Thyroid Nodules

Figure 2.
Suggested management and follow-up of nodules with no indication for immediate biopsy and those cytologically classified as benign.

On the whole, the recent findings and increasing use of comprehensive US-based risk stratification systems should reduce the "diagnostic burden" related to nodules classified as benign: they can be safely followed with visits every 2 or 3 years, and the frequency can be even further reduced if no changes have been noted at previous visits.

Patients whose nodules are cytologically classified as malignant or suspicious for malignancy (Bethesda classes V and VI; or suspicious molecular analysis) should generally be referred for surgery. However, for those with subcentimeter, intrathyroidal cancers with no high-risk features, active US surveillance can be proposed in lieu of immediate surgery. The first study published on this issue in 2003 found that more than 70% of microPTCs remained stable during surveillance, and the frequency of spread to the locoregional lymph nodes was quite low (~1%). The active surveillance strategy does not merely delay surgery: the likelihood of disease progression diminishes with age, and older patients are therefore less likely to require surgery during their lifespan. Similar results have been reported worldwide.

Active surveillance protocols initially provide for US neck examinations every 6 months. Once disease stability has been documented — in general, with 2 years of serial US examinations showing no evidence of progression — the examination frequency can be reduced to every 1 to 2 years or more. In contrast, if surveillance does reveal evidence of progression (i.e. an increase ≥ 3 mm in the maximum diameter of the nodule, growth toward the dorsal surface of the gland or toward nearby structures, or the appearance of lymph node metastases), surgery is indicated. These data provide a solid background for recommendations to avoid immediate biopsy and adopt an US-based surveillance strategy for subcentimeter, intrathyroidal nodules even if sonographically suspicious.

Benign thyroid nodules — medical therapy and iodine intake: Routine TSH suppression therapy for benign thyroid nodules in iodine sufficient populations is not recommended, with the guideline noting that the potential harm outweighs benefit for most patients (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). Individual patients with benign, solid, or mostly solid nodules should have adequate iodine intake, and a daily supplement (containing 150 μg iodine) is recommended (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence), while one randomized trial found that sufficient dietary iodine intake (150 μg daily) also reduced nodule size slightly more than placebo. When used, suppressive levothyroxine (LT4) has modest efficacy, with an average 5%–15% reduction in nodule volume when treated for 6–18 months, and two high-quality meta-analyses indicate that six to eight patients will require suppressive LT4 to achieve one successful treatment response. The TSH suppression in high-quality studies often reached substantial levels — the majority suppressed TSH to < 0.2 mIU/L, with many to < 0.1 mIU/L — which has been associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and osteoporosis.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^115Nn2f1]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are common, and most are benign. Given the risk of false-negative cytology (i.e. malignancy), follow-up is recommended after 1–2 years, though this recommendation is based solely on expert opinion. Sonographic appearance may assist with planning, but is limited by large inter-observer variability. We therefore compared the safety and efficacy of long- versus short-interval follow-up after a benign initial aspiration, regardless of sonographic appearance.

Methods

This study evaluated all patients referred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Thyroid Nodule Clinic, between 1999 and 2010, with a cytologically benign nodule > 1 cm and who had returned for follow-up sonographic evaluation. Despite standard clinical recommendations, variation in patient compliance resulted in variable follow-up intervals from time of initial aspiration to the first repeat evaluation. Main outcome measures included nodule growth, repeat fine needle aspiration (FNA), thyroidectomy, malignancy, and disease-specific mortality.

Results

We evaluated 1,254 patients with 1,819 cytologically benign nodules, with a median time to first follow-up of 1.4 years (range, 0.5–14.1 years). The longer the follow-up interval, the more nodules grew and the more repeat FNAs were performed (P < 0.001). The most clinical meaningful endpoints of malignancy or mortality, however, did not differ between the various follow-up intervals. The risk of a thyroidectomy (usually because of compressive symptoms) increased when time to first follow-up exceeded > 3 years (4.9% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.0001), though no difference in malignancy risk was identified (0.2–0.8%, P = 0.77). No (0%) thyroid cancer-specific deaths were identified in either cohort.

Conclusions

While expert opinion currently recommends repeat evaluation of a cytologically benign nodule at 1–2 years, these are the first data to demonstrate that this interval can be safely extended to 3 years without increased mortality or patient harm. Nodule growth can be expected, though detection of malignancies is unchanged. While replication of these data in large prospective multicenter studies is needed, this extension in follow-up interval would reduce unnecessary visits and medical interventions for millions of affected patients worldwide, leading to healthcare savings.

### Physician perspectives of overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk papillary thyroid cancer in the US [^1121Y4XZ]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of low-risk thyroid cancer are important problems. American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines indicate that thyroid nodules less than 1 cm should not be biopsied, nodules 1 cm to 1.5 cm should be biopsied only when features concerning for a malignant tumor exist, and papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) nodules 1 cm or less should be managed with active surveillance or lobectomy. Biopsy and treatment with total thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine (RAI) outside these recommendations have been associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment, respectively. Because physician-level factors associated with overdiagnosis and overtreatment of thyroid cancer are poorly understood, we conducted a national survey examining physicians' recommendations for thyroid nodules and low-risk PTC.

### Evidence and thoughts about thyroid nodules that grow after they have been identified as benign by aspiration cytology [^116mfeUo]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

Coherent management of thyroid nodules that grow after being identified as benign will vary depending on their biology. Some are thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) regulated, so a dose of levothyroxine that reduces TSH to the lower limits of normal (subsuppression) may prevent or reverse enlargement; others are controlled by poorly understood mechanisms that must be elucidated before effective medical treatment can be designed; a few are autonomous requiring obliteration, and a very few are "missed" malignancies that should be excised.

Thyroid nodule management — How to select nodule(s) for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) advises to consider a balance between the risk of a potentially delayed diagnosis and that of unnecessary diagnostic procedures or surgery; nodules with a major diameter < 5 mm should be monitored, rather than biopsied, with ultrasound (US); in nodules with a major diameter 5 to 10 mm that are associated with suspicious US signs, consider either FNA sampling or watchful waiting based on the clinical setting and patient preference; specifically, FNA is recommended when there are subcapsular or paratracheal lesions, suspicious lymph nodes or extrathyroidal spread, a positive personal or family history of thyroid cancer, or coexistent suspicious clinical findings; FNA is recommended for the following nodules: high US risk thyroid lesions ≥ 10 mm, intermediate US risk thyroid lesions > 20 mm, and low US risk thyroid lesions only when > 20 mm and increasing in size or associated with a risk history and before thyroid surgery or minimally invasive ablation therapy; FNA is not recommended for nodules that are functional on scintigraphy.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for thyroid nodules, more specifically with respect to fine-needle aspiration, indications based on nodule size, AACE/ACE/AME 2016 guidelines recommend to perform FNA of thyroid nodules meeting the following criteria:

- high ultrasound risk thyroid lesions > 1 cm

- intermediate ultrasound risk thyroid lesions > 2 cm

- low ultrasound risk thyroid lesions only when > 2 cm and increasing in size or associated with a risk history and before thyroid surgery or minimally invasive ablation therapy.

Biochemical incomplete response to therapy — There are adequate data to make a strong recommendation regarding the intensity and duration of TSH suppression in this category; it encompasses patients with low serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels (median nonstimulated Tg 3.6 ng/mL) and initial American Thyroid Association (ATA) low risk (16%–24%), ATA intermediate risk (47%–64%), or ATA high risk (18%–21%); the risk of developing structurally identifiable disease relates to the magnitude of Tg elevation and rate of rise of anti-Tg antibody; and, based on weak data and expert opinion, the authors state, "we recommend a goal TSH of 0.1–0.5 mU/L for the majority of patients with a biochemical", referencing this biochemical incomplete response to therapy category.

Persistently nondiagnostic thyroid nodule cytology — When cytologic results by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) are repeatedly inadequate in solid nodules, consider performing an ultrasound (US)-guided core-needle biopsy (CNB); consider surgery for persistently nondiagnostic solid nodules (with follow-up considered in a minority with clearly favorable clinical and US features); and follow-up clinically and with US persistently nondiagnostic cystic or predominantly (> 50%) cystic nodules without suspicious clinical or US features.

### Long-versus short-interval follow-up of cytologically benign thyroid nodules: a prospective cohort study [^113yNBku]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are common, and most are benign. Given the risk of false-negative cytology (i.e. malignancy), follow-up is recommended after 1–2 years, though this recommendation is based solely on expert opinion. Sonographic appearance may assist with planning, but is limited by large inter-observer variability. We therefore compared the safety and efficacy of long- versus short-interval follow-up after a benign initial aspiration, regardless of sonographic appearance.

Methods

This study evaluated all patients referred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Thyroid Nodule Clinic, between 1999 and 2010, with a cytologically benign nodule > 1 cm and who had returned for follow-up sonographic evaluation. Despite standard clinical recommendations, variation in patient compliance resulted in variable follow-up intervals from time of initial aspiration to the first repeat evaluation. Main outcome measures included nodule growth, repeat fine needle aspiration (FNA), thyroidectomy, malignancy, and disease-specific mortality.

Results

We evaluated 1,254 patients with 1,819 cytologically benign nodules, with a median time to first follow-up of 1.4 years (range, 0.5–14.1 years). The longer the follow-up interval, the more nodules grew and the more repeat FNAs were performed (P < 0.001). The most clinical meaningful endpoints of malignancy or mortality, however, did not differ between the various follow-up intervals. The risk of a thyroidectomy (usually because of compressive symptoms) increased when time to first follow-up exceeded > 3 years (4.9% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.0001), though no difference in malignancy risk was identified (0.2–0.8%, P = 0.77). No (0%) thyroid cancer-specific deaths were identified in either cohort.

Conclusions

While expert opinion currently recommends repeat evaluation of a cytologically benign nodule at 1–2 years, these are the first data to demonstrate that this interval can be safely extended to 3 years without increased mortality or patient harm. Nodule growth can be expected, though detection of malignancies is unchanged. While replication of these data in large prospective multicenter studies is needed, this extension in follow-up interval would reduce unnecessary visits and medical interventions for millions of affected patients worldwide, leading to healthcare savings.

Strength-of-evidence recommendation levels A–D specify criteria and corresponding actions: A requires " > 1 Conclusive level 1 publications demonstrating benefit > > risk", with the action "Action recommended for indications reflected by published reports" and that it "can be used with other conventional therapy or as first-line therapy". B is supported by " ≥ 1 Conclusive level 2 publications demonstrating benefit > > risk", with the action "Use if the patient declines or does not respond to conventional therapy; must monitor for adverse effects". C applies when there are "No conclusive level 1 or 2 publications" with " ≥ 1 Conclusive level 3 publication demonstrating benefit > > risk", and may be used "when the patient declines or does not respond to conventional therapy, provided there are no important adverse effects";. D is defined by "No conclusive level 1, 2, or 3 publication demonstrating benefit > > risk" and is "Not recommended"; the "Patient is advised to discontinue use".

### Management of incidental pituitary microadenomas… [^115jVkuC]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

The incidental finding of a pituitary microadenoma is not uncommon. Studies have suggested a 10 percent prevalence of pituitary microadenomas in the general population. Current recommendations for the evaluation of such an incidental finding are controversial. Some experts suggest extensive laboratory evaluation to determine levels of prolactin, growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone.

The following management strategies were assessed: expectant management, with further testing performed only if endocrinologic or neurologic symptoms such as amenorrhea, galactorrhea or visual field problems develop; prolactin screening, with hyperprolactinemia confirmed by a repeat test and treated with bromocriptine; an endocrinologic screening panel that includes determination of prolactin, somatomedin C and cortisol levels after administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone; and follow-up of MRI scans. The model included issues such as the expected natural history of an incidental asymptomatic pituitary microadenoma, test characteristics, outcomes of pharmacologic and surgical interventions, quality of life, and costs of testing and treatment. Determination of the prolactin level was found to be the most cost-effective management strategy for patients with asymptomatic, incidental pituitary microadenomas.

An endocrine screening panel and follow-up MRI provided slightly greater quality-adjusted survival than expectant management, although the cost increased substantially. The authors conclude that, while this study does not resolve the debate about conservative versus aggressive management of these lesions, it does provide evidence for a reasonable approach to patients with asymptomatic pituitary microadenomas. They note that the low prevalence of other endocrinopathies in patients with incidental pituitary microadenomas suggests that further evaluation of patients with normal prolactin levels confers little benefit and is not cost effective. Follow-up with MRI scanning provides no better clinical results than hormone screening.
