## Question

Glp-1 receptor agonists kidney disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how GLP-1 receptor agonists affect kidney disease outcomes, including mechanisms, magnitude of benefit, safety, and guideline positioning, culminating in practical prescribing advice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why GLP-1 RAs might matter in CKD. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine mechanisms of renal protection. After that, I need to quantify benefits across kidney endpoints and subgroups. I should then review safety and tolerability in CKD. Finally, I will align with current guidelines and translate this into practical, stepwise recommendations for clinicians, including where semaglutide's FLOW trial and FDA labeling fit in [^1111cqUM] [^115ytA8g].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. CKD in type 2 diabetes is common and carries high risks of progression to kidney failure and cardiovascular death; residual risk persists despite RAAS blockade, so therapies with cardiorenal benefit beyond glycemic control are critical, and GLP-1 RAs have emerged as candidates with both indirect and direct renal effects, including natriuresis, RAAS modulation, anti-inflammatory actions, and weight loss that may reduce intraglomerular pressure and proteinuria [^112uj7jv] [^114quag9].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before drawing conclusions. Historically, most renal signals came from secondary kidney outcomes in cardiovascular outcome trials; however, the FLOW trial was a dedicated kidney outcomes study of semaglutide in T2D with CKD and albuminuria, and it demonstrated a 24% reduction in a composite kidney outcome, which materially strengthened the evidence base and informed regulatory action [^1111cqUM] [^112N3LHx]. I should also confirm that meta-analyses consistently show kidney benefit; indeed, a 2025 Lancet meta-analysis of large RCTs showed an 18% reduction in a composite kidney outcome and a 16% reduction in kidney failure, with consistent benefits across diabetes and non-diabetes subgroups, reinforcing class effects on clinically important kidney events [^114esczR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms; I need to check whether benefits are purely hemodynamic or metabolic. Mediation analyses from LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 suggest only a minority of kidney benefit is explained by HbA1c, blood pressure, or weight changes, implying direct renal effects such as reduced inflammation, oxidative stress, and improved kidney hemodynamics via natriuresis and RAAS suppression; AWARD-7 further showed attenuated eGFR decline under glycemic equipoise, supporting non-glycemic mechanisms [^114quag9] [^112uj7jv]. But wait, what if receptor expression is limited in the kidney? GLP-1 receptors are sparsely expressed in renal parenchyma, so observed effects likely reflect systemic and local hemodynamic and anti-inflammatory pathways rather than direct tubular or glomerular receptor activation, which still aligns with clinical benefit [^113YcTLK].

> I will now examine the magnitude of benefit across kidney endpoints. For composite kidney outcomes, pooled estimates show roughly 18–24% relative risk reductions depending on the population and definitions, with FLOW showing a 24% reduction in T2D with CKD and albuminuria, and a 2025 Lancet meta-analysis showing an 18% reduction across large RCTs, including signals for reduced kidney failure and slower eGFR decline; earlier meta-analyses also reported about a 21% reduction in composite kidney outcomes largely driven by reduced macroalbuminuria, with sensitivity analyses still showing benefit when albuminuria components are excluded [^114esczR] [^111cs6FJ] [^116mihtW]. Let me double-check eGFR slope data; yes, FLOW and other analyses show slower annual eGFR decline with semaglutide, supporting a disease-modifying effect on CKD progression [^111RRs3w].

> Next, I should review benefits in CKD subgroups and non-diabetic populations. Benefits appear consistent in participants with baseline eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m², with meta-analytic data showing reduced composite kidney outcomes and mortality in CKD cohorts; SELECT, although obesity-focused, also showed a 22% reduction in a kidney composite, suggesting potential benefits beyond diabetes, though the renal phenotype differed from diabetic CKD [^115x6X23] [^114zz1Ur]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought SELECT enrolled only people with eGFR less than 60, but I should correct that; SELECT included participants with cardiovascular disease and BMI 27 kg/m² or more without diabetes, and only a subset had reduced eGFR, so the kidney signal there is encouraging but not definitive for advanced CKD without diabetes [^114esczR] [^114zz1Ur].

> I need to ensure safety and tolerability are addressed, especially in CKD. GLP-1 RAs are generally safe across eGFR strata, with no dose adjustment required for renal impairment for liraglutide, dulaglutide, or semaglutide; gastrointestinal adverse effects are common but usually transient and mitigated by slow titration, and dehydration from GI effects can rarely precipitate AKI in vulnerable patients, so counseling on hydration is prudent [^116TfYi8] [^112N17ew] [^112gnnkD]. Hold on, I should verify hypoglycemia risk; when used alone, hypoglycemia risk is low, but it rises with concomitant insulin or sulfonylureas, so dose reductions of those agents should be considered to mitigate risk [^112jjvn8].

> Let me consider where guidelines land so I don't overstate indications. KDIGO recommends GLP-1 RAs as a second-line option in T2D with CKD who are not at glycemic targets on metformin and an SGLT2 inhibitor or cannot use those agents, and advises prioritizing agents with proven cardiovascular benefits; ADA 2025 similarly recommends GLP-1 RAs with demonstrated benefit to reduce cardiovascular risk and slow kidney disease progression in T2D with CKD [^113W2Xqd] [^114N1afG] [^115YhUZN]. I should confirm the VA/DoD stance; they recommend adding a GLP-1 RA to ACEi/ARB in T2D with albuminuric CKD to reduce CKD progression, MACE, and mortality, reflecting strong evidence integration in high-risk populations [^115AbgYE] [^112V8Zr9].

> Now, translating this into practice, I should confirm the role of semaglutide after FLOW. In 2025, semaglutide became the first GLP-1 RA with FDA approval to reduce the risk of worsening kidney disease, kidney failure, and cardiovascular death in adults with T2D and CKD, which operationalizes the kidney outcomes evidence into a labeled indication and supports use in appropriate patients with albuminuric CKD [^115ytA8g]. Let me reconsider sequencing; SGLT2 inhibitors remain foundational first-line for T2D with CKD when eGFR thresholds are met, and GLP-1 RAs are layered when additional glycemic, cardiovascular, or weight benefits are needed or when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or contraindicated, with consideration of combination therapy in selected patients [^111Ei8NA].

> I should double-check practical prescribing details. Start low and titrate slowly to minimize GI intolerance, monitor for volume status in those prone to dehydration, and review concomitant glucose-lowering regimens to adjust insulin or sulfonylurea doses to avoid hypoglycemia; in advanced CKD, GLP-1 RAs retain efficacy without renal dose adjustment, though clinical experience in dialysis is limited and should be individualized [^112N17ew] [^112jjvn8] [^116TfYi8]. But wait, what about combination with SGLT2 inhibitors; evidence suggests additive cardiovascular and kidney benefits without major safety signals, supporting sequential or combined use in appropriate candidates, though long-term head-to-head combination data are still evolving [^114ELFDR] [^111RRs3w].

> In summary, GLP-1 receptor agonists, particularly semaglutide with FLOW-driven labeling, provide clinically meaningful kidney protection in T2D with CKD, reducing composite kidney outcomes, slowing eGFR decline, and lowering kidney failure and mortality risks, with mechanisms that extend beyond glycemic control; current guidelines endorse their use as second-line therapy after SGLT2 inhibitors or as an alternative when SGLT2 inhibitors are unsuitable, and careful patient selection, slow titration, and attention to concomitant therapies optimize outcomes [^112N3LHx] [^114esczR] [^113W2Xqd] [^115YhUZN].

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce kidney disease progression in type 2 diabetes with CKD, with the strongest evidence from the FLOW trial showing a **24% reduction in kidney failure, ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or kidney death** with semaglutide [^112N3LHx]. Meta-analyses confirm **modest reductions in composite kidney outcomes** (HR ~0.82–0.85) and slower eGFR decline (~0.45 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) [^114esczR] [^113uKnKJ]. Benefits are largely independent of glycemic effects and likely reflect reduced albuminuria, blood pressure, weight, and inflammation [^114quag9] [^112uj7jv]. GLP-1 RAs are safe across CKD stages, require no dose adjustment, and are recommended by KDIGO and ADA for T2D with CKD — especially when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated or as add-on therapy [^113W2Xqd] [^115YhUZN] [^112TtxQw].

## Clinical evidence of renal benefits

### Major randomized controlled trials

- **FLOW trial (semaglutide)**: 24% reduction in kidney failure, ≥ 50% eGFR decline, or kidney death (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.66–0.88) in T2D with CKD and albuminuria [^112N3LHx].

- **LEADER (liraglutide)**: 22% reduction in new or worsening nephropathy (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67–0.89), mainly from less macroalbuminuria [^113f3F72].

- **SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide)**: 36% reduction in new or worsening nephropathy (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46–0.87), largely from less macroalbuminuria [^113f3F72].

- **AWARD-7 (dulaglutide)**: slower eGFR decline vs insulin glargine in T2D with CKD stages 3–4, with less hypoglycemia [^116rbhoX].

---

### Meta-analyses and systematic reviews

Meta-analyses show a **modest reduction in composite kidney outcomes** (HR ~0.82–0.85) and slower eGFR decline (~0.45 mL/min/1.73 m²/year) [^113uKnKJ] [^114esczR]. They also show a **24% reduction in macroalbuminuria** (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71–0.82) [^notfound].

---

## Mechanisms of renal protection

GLP-1 RAs confer renal benefits through **multiple mechanisms**, including:

- **Reduced intraglomerular pressure**: natriuresis and RAAS modulation lower glomerular hypertension [^114quag9].

- **Anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects**: reduced renal inflammation and fibrosis [^116U38dC].

- **Improved metabolic profile**: weight loss, lower HbA1c, and blood pressure reduction indirectly protect the kidneys [^112uj7jv].

---

## Safety and tolerability in CKD

GLP-1 RAs are **safe across CKD stages**, with no dose adjustment required; gastrointestinal side effects are common but usually mild and transient [^116TfYi8] [^112gnnkD]. Hypoglycemia risk is low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, and no excess acute kidney injury or pancreatitis has been observed in CKD populations [^112gnnkD].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation regarding glp-1 ras in ckd** |
|-|-|
| KDIGO 2024 | Initiate long-acting GLP-1 RA in T2D with CKD not at glycemic targets despite metformin and SGLT2 inhibitor, or unable to use them [^113W2Xqd] |
| ADA 2025 | Use GLP-1 RAs with proven benefit in T2D with CKD to reduce cardiovascular risk and kidney disease progression [^115YhUZN] |
| VA/DoD 2025 | Strong recommendation to add GLP-1 RA to ACEi/ARB in T2D with albuminuric CKD to reduce CKD progression, MACE, and mortality [^115AbgYE] |

---

## Limitations and gaps in current evidence

- **Non-diabetic CKD**: Limited data; FLOW and most trials enrolled patients with T2D [^112aCJRJ].

- **Advanced CKD**: Few studies in eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; more data needed [^113f3F72].

- **Long-term outcomes**: More data on hard renal endpoints (dialysis, transplant) are needed [^1179Pp5B].

---

## Comparison with other antihyperglycemic agents

Compared with SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs have **smaller effects on kidney failure** but provide greater cardiovascular risk reduction; SGLT2 inhibitors are first-line for kidney protection, with GLP-1 RAs as add-on or alternative when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated [^111Ei8NA] [^11374fAA]. Compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs have **superior renal and cardiovascular outcomes** [^113uKnKJ] [^116Tg5VT].

---

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce kidney disease progression in T2D with CKD, with the strongest evidence from FLOW; they are safe, require no dose adjustment, and are recommended by major guidelines — particularly as add-on therapy or when SGLT2 inhibitors are not tolerated [^112N3LHx] [^113W2Xqd] [^115YhUZN].

### Effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114esczR]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and can also have kidney benefits. However, whether GLP-1 receptor agonists improve clinically important kidney outcomes remains uncertain. We aimed to comprehensively assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular disease outcomes by performing a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.

Methods

For this meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for randomised controlled trials that included at least 500 participants with type 2 diabetes, compared a GLP-1 receptor agonist with placebo with at least 12 months of follow-up, and reported a primary clinical kidney or cardiovascular outcome, from database inception to March 26, 2024. Post hoc, we included the SELECT trial (NCT03574597), which enrolled participants with cardiovascular disease and a BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or more without diabetes. Study-level summary data were extracted independently by two authors for inclusion in this random-effects analysis. The main kidney outcome was a composite outcome, consisting of kidney failure (kidney replacement therapy or a persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min per 1·73 m 2), a sustained reduction in eGFR by at least 50% or the nearest equivalent, or death from kidney failure. The main cardiovascular outcome was MACE, consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42024528864.

Findings

Of the 5140 records identified through the literature search, 11 trials, involving 85373 participants (29386 female, 55987 male), were included in the meta-analysis. In participants with type 2 diabetes (67769), GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the composite kidney outcome by 18% compared with placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82, 95% CI 0·73–0·93; I² = 26·41%), kidney failure by 16% (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·99; I² = 0%), MACE by 13% (HR 0·87, 0·81–0·93; I² = 49·75%), and all-cause death by 12% (HR 0·88, 0·83–0·93; I² = 0%). The effect on the composite kidney outcome (HR 0·81, 95% CI 0·72–0·92; I² = 23·11%), kidney failure (HR 0·84, 0·72–0·98; I² = 0%), MACE (HR 0·86, 0·80–0·92; I² = 48·9%), and all-cause death (HR 0·87, 0·82–0·91; I² = 0%) was similar when the SELECT trial was included, with no evidence of heterogeneity between this trial and those including participants with type 2 diabetes (p heterogeneity > 0·05). There was no difference in the risk of serious adverse events, including acute pancreatitis and severe hypoglycaemia, between the GLP-1 receptor agonist and placebo groups (risk ratio [RR] 0·95, 95% CI 0·90–1·01; I² = 88·5%). However, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events occurred more frequently in the GLP-1 receptor agonist groups (RR 1·51, 95% CI 1·18–1·94; I² = 96·3%).

Interpretation

We found evidence that GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduce clinically important kidney events, kidney failure, and cardiovascular events.

### Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonist-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in diabetic and non-diabetic patients with CKD [^112UprCp]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-based therapies function as glucose-lowering agents by mimicking the action of incretins, stimulating insulin secretion following oral glucose ingestion. They are recognized for their efficacy in reducing blood glucose levels, facilitating modest weight loss, and lowering blood pressure. In addition, prescription and utilization of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (RAs) are steadily increasing, reflecting their growing role in diabetes and overweight/obesity management. Large randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated their significant cardiovascular and renal benefits in individuals with type 2 diabetes.

Assessing the impact of GLP-1 RAs on cardiovascular and renal outcomes based on the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) at baseline remains an important question in order to confirm whether their therapeutic effect is independent of kidney function.

This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 RAs on hard clinical endpoints, stratified by CKD status, among diabetic and non-diabetic patients administered GLP-1 RAs versus placebo control.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^113iszMw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects around 10% of the global population and is most often caused by diabetes. Diabetes with CKD (diabetic kidney disease, DKD) is a progressive condition that may cause kidney failure and which contributes significantly to the excess morbidity and mortality in these patients. DKD is treated with direct disease-targeting therapies like blockers of the renin-angiotensin system, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists as well as indirect therapies impacting hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, obesity and hypertension, which all together reduce disease progression. While no glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs) are currently indicated to improve kidney outcomes, accumulating evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs) corroborates a kidney-protective effect in people with T2D and CKD, and GLP-1 RAs are now mentioned in international treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes (T2D) with CKD. GLP-1 RAs are indicated to improve glycaemia in people with T2D; certain GLP-1 RAs are also approved for weight management and to reduce cardiovascular risk in T2D. Ongoing pivotal trials are assessing additional indications, including T2D with CKD. In this article, we review and discuss kidney outcomes from a multitude of completed clinical trials as well as real-world evidence and ongoing clinical trials.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### The incretin pathway as a therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease: a clinical focus on GLP-1 receptor agonists [^116aMYeN]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains the main cause for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. Both CKD and ESKD lead to major increases in risk of cardiovascular disease and death in people with diabetes. Despite optimal management of lifestyle, glucose levels and hypertension, residual risk remains high, indicating that additional therapies to mitigate the burden of the disease are desired. In past decades, new treatment options for the management of diabetes have emerged, of which some have showed promising renoprotective potential. This review discusses current understanding of the renal effects of glucagon-like peptide receptor agonists and their potential use in prevention and treatment of DKD.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^112vLbsY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The recent introduction of sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and a third-generation, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, finerenone, has greatly improved the treatment armamentarium for DKD. Some SGLT-2 inhibitors have been proven effective in reducing the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular events. – Nevertheless, current treatment options remain sparse and of insufficient efficacy on preventing progression of CKD; people with DKD continue to experience declining kidney function, they often suffer from poor health-related quality of life, and some ultimately develop kidney failure and a need for kidney replacement therapy. Thus, additional efficacious and well-tolerated therapeutic strategies to prevent or manage DKD are still needed.

In this article, we review current evidence supporting the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) as kidney-protective agents in the management of T2D with CKD. GLP-1 RAs are efficacious and well-tolerated glucose-lowering agents regardless of kidney function. In addition, GLP-1 RAs have proven benefits on weight loss, and certain members of the drug class reduce cardiovascular risk. Because no dedicated kidney outcomes trial has yet been completed with GLP-1 RAs, none of the agents are currently indicated to improve kidney outcomes. However, one such outcomes trial is ongoing with the GLP-1 RA semaglutide (FLOW, Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03819153). At this time, the drug class is recommended as second-line therapy (after metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitors) in current guidelines to improve glycaemic control and reduce cardiovascular risk in people with T2D and CKD.

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112uj7jv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Development of DKD increases risks for cardiovascular events and death. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist have demonstrated improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in large-scale clinical trials.

Recent Finding

GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/glucose-depending insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have robust glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of hypoglycemia even in advanced stages of DKD. Initially approved as antihyperglycemic therapies, these agents also reduce blood pressure and body weight. Cardiovascular outcome and glycemic lowering trials have reported decreased risks of development and progression of DKD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events for GLP-1 receptor agonists. Kidney and cardiovascular protection is mediated partly, but not entirely, by lowering of glycemia, body weight, and blood pressure. Experimental data have identified modulation of the innate immune response as a biologically plausible mechanism underpinning kidney and cardiovascular effects.

Summary

An influx of incretin-based therapies has changed the landscape of DKD treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonist use is endorsed by all major guideline forming organizations. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic studies with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists will further define the roles and pathways for these agents in the treatment of DKD.

### Emerging evidence for glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists in slowing chronic kidney disease progression [^1146UAqE]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease continues to increase, and several novel therapeutic agents have been shown to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease in those with diabetes. This review summarizes more recent data on the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and kidney outcomes.

Recent Findings

Posthoc analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials, as well as several retrospective studies, demonstrate benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for chronic kidney disease progression in diabetics. Although limited randomized clinical trials evidence assessing the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney outcomes in diabetic chronic kidney disease patients have been published, FLOW-CKD trial was halted based on interim data for efficacy, and results are awaited.

Summary

GLP-1 receptor agonism is a promising therapy for slowing the progression of diabetic chronic kidney disease. Recent studies support kidney benefits GLP-1 receptor agonists over insulin and dipeptidyl peptidase-4-inhibitors, and the FLOW-CKD trial would inform the potential benefits for reducing the need for dialysis and kidney-disease related mortality in those with kidney disease.

### Decision algorithm for prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetic kidney disease [^115irih6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease and its comorbid conditions, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, diabetes, and obesity, are interconnected conditions that compound the risk of kidney failure and cardiovascular mortality, and exponentiate health care costs. Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) are novel diabetes medications that prevent cardiovascular events and kidney failure. Clinical trials exploring the cardiovascular and kidney outcomes of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA have fundamentally shifted the treatment paradigm of diabetes. Clinical guidelines for diabetes management recommend a more holistic approach beyond glycemic control and emphasize heart and kidney protection of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA. However, the adoption of prescribing SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for patients with diabetes and high cardiovascular and kidney risk has been slow. In this review, we provide a decision-making tool to help clinicians determine when to consider SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for heart and kidney protection. First, we discuss a comprehensive risk assessment for patients with diabetic kidney disease. We compare the effectiveness of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA for different risk categories. Then, we present a decision algorithm using cardiovascular and kidney failure risk stratification and the strength of current evidence for the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA. Lastly, we review the adverse effects of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA and propose mitigation strategies.

Randomised controlled studies were eligible if participants with diabetes and CKD were randomly allocated to a GLP-1 receptor agonist, placebo, standard care or a second glucose-lowering agent. CKD included all stages (from 1 to 5).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias using the risk of bias assessment tool 2. Pooled analyses using summary estimates of effects were obtained using a random-effects model, and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and/or hazard ratio (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. The primary outcomes included death (all-cause and cardiovascular), 3- and 4-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), kidney failure, composite kidney outcome, and severe hypoglycaemia. The secondary outcomes included non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, non-fatal peripheral arterial events, heart failure, hospitalisation due to heart failure, estimated glomerular filtration rate or creatinine clearance, doubling of serum creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, albuminuria progression, vascular access outcomes, body weight, body mass index, fatigue, life participation, peritoneal dialysis infection, peritoneal dialysis failure, adverse events, serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, HbA1c, sudden death, acute MI, ischaemic stroke, and coronary revascularisation. Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Main Results

Forty-two studies involving 48,148 participants were included. All studies were conducted on people with type 2 diabetes, and no studies were carried out on children. The median study age was 66 years. The median study follow-up was 26 weeks. Six studies were conducted in people with CKD stages 1–2, 11 studies in people with CKD stages 3–5, one study in people on dialysis, and the remaining studies included people with both CKD stages 1–2 and 3–5. Risks of bias in the included studies for all the primary outcomes in studies that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists to placebo were low in most methodological domains, except one study that was assessed at high risk of bias due to missing outcome data for death (all-cause and cardiovascular). The overall risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death in studies that reported the treatment effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors were assessed as unclear or at high risk of bias due to deviations from intended interventions or missing data. For GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to insulin or another GLP-1 receptor agonist, the risk of bias for all-cause and cardiovascular death was low or unclear. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced the risk of all-cause death (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; I² = 23%; 8 studies, 17,861 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.05; I² = 42%; 7 studies, 17,801 participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably decreased 3-point MACE (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; I² = 65%; 4 studies, 19,825 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), and 4-point MACE compared to placebo (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89; 1 study, 2,158 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Based on absolute risks of clinical outcomes, it is likely that GLP-1 receptor agonists prevent all-cause death in 52 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 116 in CKD stages 3–5, cardiovascular death in 34 people with CKD stages 1–2 and 71 in CKD stages 3–5, while 95 CKD stages 1–2 and 153 in CKD stages 3–5 might experience a major cardiovascular event for every 1000 people treated over 1 year. Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists probably had little or no effect on kidney failure, defined as starting dialysis or kidney transplant (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.13; I² = 0%; 3 studies, 4,134 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or on composite kidney outcomes (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 16,849 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Compared to placebo, GLP-1 receptor agonists may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.25; I² = 44%; 4 studies, 6,292 participants; low-certainty evidence). The effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists compared to standard care or other hypoglycaemic agents were uncertain. No studies evaluated treatment on risks of fatigue, life participation, amputation or fracture.

Authors' Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists probably reduced all-cause death but may have little or no effect on cardiovascular death in people with CKD and diabetes. GLP-1 receptor agonists probably lower major cardiovascular events, probably have little or no effect on kidney failure and composite kidney outcomes, and may have little or no effect on the risk of severe hypoglycaemia in people with CKD and diabetes.

### GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2-is to lower glucose and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and diabetic kidney disease [^117RjMBF]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The landscape of diabetes management has changed, such that the goal of pharmacotherapy extends beyond glucose-lowering to prioritize risk reduction of cardiovascular disease and diabetic kidney disease. Two newer classes of medications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2-Is), have become first line therapies for many patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce cardiovascular and renal complications of type 2 diabetes. This review article will describe the mechanism of action, evidence for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, contraindications, adverse effects, and risk mitigation strategies for the GLP-1 RA and SGLT2-I drug classes. In addition, we will provide a practical approach for primary care clinicians to prescribe, adjust, and combine these medication classes, while considering patient preference, tolerability, comorbidities, cost, and availability.

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^1123Q8v1]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

This review examines the available literature on the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is an important cause of end-stage renal disease requiring renal replacement therapy, and diabetic kidney disease is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). GLP-1RAs are proven to be safe in terms of CVD, and some of them have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The effect of GLP-1RAs on hard renal endpoints has yet to be established; to date, there have been no published GLP-1RA clinical trials with primary renal endpoints. In this review, we discuss the evidence for a renal protective role of GLP-1RAs, highlighting the secondary renal outcomes from recent cardiovascular outcome trials of this class of glucose-lowering therapies.

### Managing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in clinical practice [^114AjZu1]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

The obesity epidemic has significantly heightened the impact of cardiometabolic risk factors on the global burden of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), originally developed for type 2 diabetes treatment, have demonstrated in randomised controlled trials their ability to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. This has led to substantial improvements in patient outcomes. SGLT2i, in particular, are the first class of drugs proven to improve the prognosis of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, and evidence is accumulating to suggest that also GLP-1RA might be beneficial in these patients. Remarkably, the benefits of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i are independent of type 2 diabetes status or baseline renal function. The critical role of these drug classes in managing high cardiovascular risk patients is increasingly acknowledged in guidelines, which now advocate their use across broader clinical phenotypes. This review compiles evidence supporting the use of these drugs in various clinical scenarios, highlighting their impact on outcomes and identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit from their prescription. Guideline recommendations are summarised at the conclusion of each section. In the conclusion, we highlight how these drugs have changed our approach to cardiometabolic diseases and emphasise the potential advantages achievable by using their reciprocal combination and combinations with other drugs representing the foundation of the guidelines-directed medical therapy.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^116TfYi8]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The clearance of drug compounds often happens via the kidneys and may be lower when kidney function is impaired. In those cases, the blood concentration and half-life of the compound can be increased, resulting in an elevated risk of side effects. In persons with diabetes and impaired kidney function, many diabetes medications therefore need to be used with caution (e.g. at a reduced dose level) if at all. However, no reduction in dose is required for any of the GLP-1 RAs marketed today according to kidney function. Indeed, most of the agents can be used also in people with advanced CKD, while some are subject to restrictions due to lack of data.

In summary, safety and tolerability of the GLP-1 RAs have been thoroughly investigated in people with CKD and are well established.

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112TtxQw]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease in type 2 diabetes — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are prioritized based on kidney and cardiovascular benefits: SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for people with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² and type 2 diabetes to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce heart failure risk independent of glucose management, while GLP-1 RAs are suggested for cardiovascular risk reduction if such risk is predominant. Selection of glucose-lowering medications should also consider an individual's cardiovascular and kidney risks, effects on weight, adverse effects, preferences, and cost, and both SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs have shown cardiovascular and kidney protection.

Summary and future perspectives

While results from the large, controlled clinical trials, meta-analyses and the available real-world evidence implies a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in people with T2D and high cardiovascular risk, a dedicated, properly powered kidney outcomes trial in participants with CKD remains needed to confirm this hypothesis. To that end, the FLOW trial has been initiated (Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT03819153); FLOW is a multinational, randomised, placebo-controlled, outcomes trial with a composite kidney outcome as the primary, confirmatory endpoint. The trial is currently ongoing testing the 1.0 mg s.c. version of the GLP-1 RA semaglutide versus placebo on top of standard of care. As the primary objective, FLOW will evaluate whether semaglutide can delay the progression of kidney impairment and lower the risk of death from kidney failure or CVD in people with T2D and CKD, of whom the vast majority enrolled in the trial has been selected for very high risk of CKD progression. FLOW, which will enrol around 3,500 participants, is expected to finalise in mid 2024.

In addition, studies investigating the kidney-specific mechanisms of action for GLP-1 RA are warranted. Here, the REMODEL trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04865770), which enrols a trial population similar to the one in FLOW, is ongoing. REMODEL, as well as the SMART trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04889183) in people with overweight/obesity and elevated albuminuria but without diabetes, are expected to complement and expand on the scientific insights gained from the FLOW trial.

Another area that needs clarification is if there are particular segments among people with diabetes and CKD that may benefit the most from GLP-1 RA treatment. As discussed above, the most pronounced kidney risk reduction seems to be seen for individuals with pre-existing CKD. Studies like REMODEL and FLOW may provide insights that could help optimising therapy.

Practical Use of GLP-1 RAs in People Living with CKD

In this section we provide general recommendations for GLP-1 RA use in people with CKD. The information for GLP-1 RA use for patients without CKD will also be included to enhance the context.

Current Treatment Guidelines for People Living with CKD

By nature, T2DM is a heterogenous and progressive disease for which a wide variety of treatment options exist and where treatment paradigms continue to evolve. Several international organizations have provided clinical practice guidelines to aid physicians in optimizing therapy for people living with CKD.

The general guidelines for management of T2DM that are provided by the ADA can aid physicians in navigating the overall treatment landscape. Pharmacologic intervention is usually initiated with a single oral agent, usually metformin, combined with lifestyle modifications. If HbA1c remains elevated, metformin treatment is followed by sequential addition of oral agents before intensification to injectables in a stepwise approach. Although the primary goal of diabetes management is to reduce glycemia and diabetes-related complications, special consideration needs to be taken in people living with compromised renal function. For example, metformin is regarded as contraindicated if eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m² due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia.

In 2020, the ADA provided a revision to the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes with updated guidelines recommending the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1 RAs to treat people living with T2DM and CKD independently of baseline A1C, individualized A1C target, or metformin use (summarized in Fig. 2). These revised changes take into consideration the latest trial findings on SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA and suggest that these medications are the preferred option for people when CKD predominates, independent of HbA1c. If CKD is the predominant condition, the recommendation is to start with an SGLT2i with evidence of reducing CKD progression, assuming eGFR is adequate. If SGLT2i is not tolerated or contraindicated, or if eGFR is less than adequate (< 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), then a GLP-1 RA is recommended.

Mechanisms of action

Currently, the mechanisms of action underlying the potential kidney-protective benefits of GLP-1 RAs in DKD are not fully elucidated (Figure 1). It has been speculated that the beneficial effects on CKD risk factors, such as blood glucose, systolic blood pressure and body weight indirectly improve kidney function, and mediation analyses using data from the LEADER, SUSTAIN 6 and REWIND CVOTs suggest that these effects partially, but only to a minor extent, explain the potential kidney benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Nevertheless, considering the importance of obesity/overweight in CKD, and that SGLT2 inhibitors only modestly reduce body weight, the weight-reducing benefit of GLP-1 RAs may arguably be of importance in the management of CKD. In AWARD-7, a clinical benefit on kidney function (attenuated eGFR decline) of dulaglutide was observed even though glycaemic equipoise was ensured using an active comparator (insulin glargine), indicating that the kidney benefit was not driven by improvements in glycaemic control.

Multiple direct actions have been suggested, including reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress and improved kidney oxygenation or perfusion; however, only a few smaller non-clinical and clinical studies have explored this. Furthermore, these studies have primarily focussed on the acute-phase response immediately after GLP-1 exposure in the setting of normal kidney function with or without diabetes.

While the effects of GLP-1 and GLP-1 RAs on oxidative stress have only been sparsely studied, accumulating evidence are available to suggest that GLP-1 RAs reduce systemic inflammation and that semaglutide specifically down-regulate the expression of several pro-inflammatory genes. – Additional studies are warranted to investigate whether the potential anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 receptor agonism may in fact play a role in the potential kidney-protective benefit of the GLP-1 RA drug class or certain of the specific compounds.

Changes in kidney haemodynamics induced by GLP-1 RAs might depend on baseline kidney function and these observations have not been consistent across studies. – In the acute phase, GLP-1 RA therapy has been shown to induce natriuresis, and the increased salt delivery in the distal nephron could reduce intraglomerular pressure via tubular glomerular feedback. Moreover, the compounds also suppress angiotensin II and renin, – thereby modulating the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). The relevance of these findings is not fully established, however, and should be investigated in mechanistic clinical trials.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) globally. People with T2D have a high prevalence and incidence of CKD, which presents an increased risk of kidney failure, cardiovascular disease, and death. Cardiovascular complications are an especially relevant concern for individuals with both diabetes and CKD. The treatment approach for people with CKD is multidisciplinary, with the aim being primarily to slow the progression of disease to avoid dialysis or kidney transplantation and secondarily to reduce the cardiovascular risk that accompanies CKD. Currently available therapies with demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular events and kidney outcomes among patients with T2D include sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (ns-MRAs). Among the latter class, finerenone is the drug with more robust and well-documented evidence supporting cardiovascular and kidney benefits among patients with CKD and T2D; finerenone was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022 specifically to prevent CKD disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with CKD associated with T2D.

The 2022 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines recommend SGLT2i as first-line therapy as part of a comprehensive management approach for people with T2D and CKD with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m 2. A growing body of clinical trial evidence suggests a protective effect of GLP-1 RA on cardiorenal outcomes compared with placebo or with standard of care; indeed, the first GLP-1 RA was recently approved by the US FDA for reducing the risk of worsening kidney disease and cardiovascular death in patients with T2D and CKD. While KDIGO guidelines do not explicitly recommend the use of GLP-1 RA as first-line therapy for CKD in T2D, KDIGO's comprehensive risk reduction strategy includes GLP-1 RA as an additional therapy option for patients at risk of insufficient glycemic control. Systematic reviews and network meta-analyses of GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in patients with T2D concluded that both medication classes have cardiovascular and kidney benefits but with notable differences in benefits and harms.

In patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 25–75), semaglutide reduced the risk of major kidney disease outcomes by approximately 25%. In adults without preexisting cardiovascular disease and body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27 kg/m², semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly administration reduced a five-component kidney composite end point by 22%. A randomized trial with liraglutide (1.8 mg subcutaneous daily) demonstrated a 22% lower occurrence of a composite kidney outcome versus placebo, primarily driven by reduced new persistent microalbuminuria.

### Clinical profile and treatment patterns in individuals with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease who initiate a GLP-1 receptor agonist: a multinational cohort study [^112N3LHx]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) worldwide. Diabetes with CKD is the most common underlying cause of kidney failure, accounting for almost 50% of cases in the developed world. Additionally, people with T2D and CKD are at elevated risk of cardiovascular disease. Available therapies for preventing and reducing the risk of CKD progression among patients with T2D include renin-angiotensin system inhibitor drugs (e.g. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEi], angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]), sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also have favorable renal effects given their direct and indirect mechanisms of action, including stimulating pathways responsible for reducing oxidative stress in the kidneys, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss and glucose control. GLP-1 RAs have been shown to have beneficial effects on kidney outcomes. Specifically, evidence from cardiovascular outcomes trials, in which kidney outcomes have been captured as secondary endpoints, and from observational studies suggests that treatment with a GLP-1 RA is associated with cardiovascular benefits in patients with prediabetes and T2D, and with lower risks of composite kidney outcomes in patients with T2D. Moreover, FLOW, the first randomized trial designed to study the effects of GLP-1 RAs on kidney outcomes, showed a 24% reduction in the risk (hazard ratio = 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.66–0.88) of a primary composite kidney outcome (kidney failure onset, at least a 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] from baseline, or death from kidney-related or cardiovascular causes) when comparing patients initiating semaglutide with patients initiating placebo. In 2025, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the GLP-1 RA semaglutide to reduce the risk of worsening CKD, and the KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs as a second-line therapy for patients with T2D and CKD who have not met their glycemic targets despite use of metformin and an SGLT2i or for those who are unable to tolerate these medications.

### Kidney and cardiovascular outcomes among patients with CKD receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115x6X23]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiac and kidney outcomes in patients with diabetes; however, their efficacy in individuals with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is uncertain. This study evaluated the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on kidney and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported through May 25, 2024.

Setting & Study Populations

Adult participants in RCTs with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73 m².

Selection Criteria For Studies

RCTs including adults (≥ 18 years old) with varying degrees of kidney function, including individuals with CKD characterized by a baseline eGFR of < 60mL/min/1.73m 2, that compared GLP-1 receptor agonists with control treatments with respect to a composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, or a composite CV disease outcome. From among 212 screened studies, 12 trials involving that included participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2 were included.

Data Extraction

Two independent investigators extracted the data.

Analytical Approach

Pooled odds ratios (ORs) for composite kidney outcome, all-cause mortality, and composite CV outcome were estimated using random-effects models. Evidence certainty was assessed using the GRADE system.

Results

The analyses included 17,996 RCT participants with baseline eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m 2. GLP-1 receptor agonists were significantly associated with a reduced risk of the composite kidney outcome (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.77–0.94]; P = 0.001) with low heterogeneity (I 2 < 0.01%). GLP-1 receptor agonists were also associated with a reduced the risk of a > 30% eGFR decline (OR, 0.78; P = 0.004), a > 40% decline (OR, 0.76; P = 0.01), and a > 50% decline (OR, 0.72; P < 0.001). Risk of all-cause mortality was also lower in the GLP-1 receptor agonist group (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.60–0.98], P = 0.03), though there was high heterogeneity (I 2 = 71.6%). Composite CV outcomes were also lower with the use of a GLP-1 receptor agonist (OR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.74–0.99], P = 0.03; I² = 40.3%). Sensitivity analyses restricted to human GLP-1 backbone agents showed enhanced benefits.

Limitations

Inconsistent kidney outcome definitions, focus on diabetic populations in most studies, and potential publication bias.

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists improved kidney and CV outcomes, and survival in patients with CKD enrolled in an array of clinical trials.

Plain-Language Summary

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce body weight and improve glycemic control. They also have been shown to protect the heart and kidney in people with diabetes. However, the extrapolation of these findings to those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. This study meta-analyzed data from clinical trials focusing on patients with CKD and noted that GLP-1 receptor agonists may slow kidney disease progression and lower the risk of heart disease, stroke, and death. These findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists offer multiple kidney and cardiovascular benefits to people with CKD.

### The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113uKnKJ]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are anti-hyperglycaemic agents, with cardioprotective effects, however renal protective effects remain unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of GLP1-RAs on renal outcomes in patients with or without diabetes.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register searched to December 2024. The primary outcome was the composite of kidney failure (defined as eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) or dialysis requirement, worsening of renal function and changes in proteinuria. Subgroup analysis was performed based on diabetic status, CKD and individual GLP1-RA drugs. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual trials were pooled using random effects models.

Results

We identified 19 trials including 90882 patients. Mean age was 60.8 years and mean follow-up was 25.9 months. GLP1-RAs were associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of primary renal outcome (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73–0.89), a 12% reduction in renal functional decline (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81–0.95) and a 0.45 ml/min/1.73m2 reduction in yearly loss (16 trials, MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.10–0.81). GLP1-RAs also reduced microalbuminuria by 24% (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.71–0.82), HbA1c (units: %) by 0.61 (MD -0.61, 95% CI -0.76- -0.49) and body weight by 5 kg (MD -5.24, 95% CI -7.46–3.02). Although there were no significant differences in progression to kidney failure (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.71–1.05), GLP1-RAs reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.81–0.90) and all-cause mortality by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82–0.91). No significant differences were seen in severe adverse events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90–1.01). However, there were more gastroenterological side effects.

Conclusions

GLP1-RAs demonstrated cardiovascular and renal benefits. Further high-quality randomised trials assessing their effects in patients without diabetes, with or without proteinuria and/or CKD are needed.

Discussion

This meta-analysis evaluates the effects of GLP-1 RA-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients with or without CKD. In this report, we demonstrate that GLP-1 RAs reduce the absolute risk of MACE and renal outcomes regardless of CKD status. Importantly, these therapies maintain their protective effects even in patients with an eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. There is no significant interaction with renal function, and the benefits of GLP-1 RAs remain consistent irrespective of the timing of patient inclusion in the trials.

GLP-1 RAs are well-documented for their ability to lower glucose levels, induce modest weight loss, and reduce blood pressure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone that binds GLP-1 receptors, which are found in multiple organ systems, such as digestive, cardiovascular and central nervous systems. Glucose-lowering effects are mediated by the stimulation of insulin release and the suppression of glucagon secretion, with a low risk of hypoglycemia. Beyond their metabolic effects, GLP-1 RAs also modulate inflammation, an increasingly important factor in the pathophysiology of diabetes. GLP-1 receptor activation plays a protective role against oxidative injury, which is particularly relevant to its cardiovascular and kidney protective effects.

Treatments for CKD in People Living with T2DM

Findings from systematic reviews and meta-analyses indicate that improved renal outcomes can be achieved through obesity management, intensive glycemic control using glucose-lowering medications, and anti-hypertension drugs. A caveat of using these medications is that many have reduced renal clearance due to declining kidney function or are contraindicated and often require careful dose adjustments. Furthermore, several of these therapies have only a modest glucose-lowering effect in people with reduced glomerular filtration. For these reasons, limited treatment options exist for this patient population.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), and KDIGO provide clinical practice guidelines for diabetes management in CKD. These guidelines recommend a comprehensive strategy be followed to reduce risks of CKD in people living with T2DM and are summarized in Fig. 2. In the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2021, the ADA recommend that for people with indications of high risk or established CKD either a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) or a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) be considered as a treatment option, independently of metformin use. Guidelines provided by KDIGO similarly recommend SGLT2i for people with an eGFR of ≥ 30 ml/min/1.73 m² due to the vascular and renal benefit, despite its modest effect on glucose control. The current KDIGO guidelines do not recommend SGLT2i for people in more advanced stages of CKD (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2), as the efficacy for lowering glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is blunted. This is indicated in the label information for empagliflozin and canagliflozin, with both of these SGLT2i not recommended for individuals with an eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m 2. For dapagliflozin, recently updated prescribing information indicates that initiation of treatment with this SGLT2i is not recommended in individuals with an eGFR < 25 ml/min/1.73 m². In people with T2DM and CKD, who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite use of metformin and SGLT2i, or are unable to use those medications due to contraindications, long-acting GLP-1 RAs are recommended. The use of GLP-1 RAs in this population is not only due to the limited use of SLGT2i in more severe stages but also because the glycemic lowering efficacy of SLGT2i is reduced in individuals with moderate renal impairment and likely absent in those with severe renal impairment. These anti-hyperglycemic therapies have shown promise in directly improving renal outcomes and reducing CKD progression independently of glycemic control. The use of GLP-1 RAs is also associated with a low risk for hypoglycemia, which is a limiting factor for many other diabetes medications in people with renal impairment.

### Cardiorenal protection with the newer antidiabetic agents in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115uKkyx]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem, resulting in significant cardiovascular and kidney adverse outcomes worldwide. Despite the widespread use of standard-of-care therapies for CKD with T2D over the past few decades, rates of progression to end-stage kidney disease remain high with no beneficial impact on its accompanying burden of cardiovascular disease. The advent of the newer classes of antihyperglycemic agents, including SGLT2 (sodium glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors and GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists, has changed the landscape of therapeutic options for patients with CKD with T2D, with demonstration of significant reductions in cardiovascular adverse events and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Several potential mechanisms exist through which these beneficial effects are achieved in both drug classes, which may be independent of their antihyperglycemic effects. This scientific statement summarizes the current literature on the cardiorenal protective effects with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with CKD and T2D. It reviews potential mechanistic pathways that may drive these benefits and summarizes the literature on adverse effects in patients with CKD and T2D at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease. Last, it provides practical guidance on a proposed collaborative care model bridging cardiologists, nephrologists, endocrinologists, and primary care physicians to facilitate the prompt and appropriate integration of these therapeutic classes in the management of patients with T2D and CKD.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^1159wPzY]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD) worldwide. The risk for CKD onset and progression in patients with T2D remains high even under optimal evidence‐based treatment, which includes lifestyle modification, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and non‐steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs).

Emerging data support the role of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) in improving kidney outcomes in patients with T2D. The FLOW trial has demonstrated that semaglutide improves kidney outcomes in patients with T2D and CKD with albuminuria. Most trials that compared GLP‐1 RA and placebo in patients with T2D at high cardiovascular risk and mostly preserved kidney function found that GLP‐1 RAs improve cardiovascular outcomes and prevent the onset of new macroalbuminuria. Whether treatment with GLP‐1 RAs mitigates the loss of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in these populations was less certain – some studies, but not others, found a preservation of kidney function with GLP‐1 RA versus placebo. Further investigation is needed to determine whether these kidney effects can be extrapolated from randomized controlled trials (RCT)s to real‐world settings, often including patients with lower cardiovascular and kidney risk profiles. Furthermore, these studies assessed the treatment effects of GLP‐RA compared with placebo; it is unclear whether such kidney effects exist when compared with an active comparator.

This systematic review and meta‐analysis assessed the association between initiating GLP‐1 RA, versus other glucose‐lowering agents (GLAs), and adverse kidney outcomes, in patients with T2D treated in real‐world settings.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — practice points and clinical considerations include the guideline notes that "the prioritization of GLP-1 RAs to those agents with documented cardiovascular benefits", "starting with a low dose and titrating upward slowly to minimize gastrointestinal side effects", "not using GLP-1 RAs with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors", and "pointing out the lack of hypoglycemia risk with this class unless they are being used with insulin or sulfonylureas". In AWARD-7, dulaglutide "experienced significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia (blood glucose ≤ 70 mg/dL) compared to insulin glargine", and "liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide do not require dosage adjustment for low eGFR". Transplant and dialysis considerations are that "Recommendations are the same for kidney transplant recipients as other CKD patients; however, experience in patients requiring dialysis is lacking, but pharmacokinetic studies showed no excess side effects across the entire range of kidney function, including dialysis". Weight effects are emphasized as "studies have shown a 5%-10% body weight loss with GLP-1 RAs in obese individuals", while "the lack of uniformity of cardiovascular benefits among the approved drugs in this class precludes concluding that the cardiovascular benefits are a class effect". Kidney outcome signals vary, as "Although the AWARD-7 trial of patients with stage 3 CKD treated with dulaglutide suggested that there was some preservation of eGFR, the subgroup with stage 3 CKD in the larger REWIND trial did not show a significant benefit on the sustained decline of eGFR of > 30%", and "The FLOW trial may help clarify the role of the injectable semaglutide on reduction of kidney disease progression as a primary outcome".

### How to individualize renoprotective therapy in obese patients with chronic kidney disease: a commentary by the diabesity working group of the ERA [^115YtKrW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

The inter-related pandemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are fueling a rise in the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), which amplifies the risk of cardiovascular events and which may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Treatment options for such patients have rapidly expanded over the past decade, and continue to evolve. Herein, we primarily focus on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and their role in the management of CKD in the setting of overweight/obesity and T2DM. Recommendations from the recent KDIGO CKD guidelines are summarised, and new evidence arising since publication of these guidelines is highlighted. We review clinical studies supporting the role of GLP-1RAs in patients with diabesity and CKD, including the FLOW trial, as well as exploring potential mechanisms of their nephroprotective effects. Their role in the management of patients with ESKD on maintenance dialysis and after kidney transplantation, while less evidence-based, is also discussed. The potential for other gut hormone-based therapies including GLP-1/GIP dual agonists (tirzepatide), triple agonists (incorporating glucagon agonism), and amylin analogues to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD is explored. We highlight the role of novel therapies distinct from the gut-kidney axis, including nsMRAs. We outline the potential for multi-target therapy incorporating RAASis, SGLT2is, incretin-based treatments and nsMRAs to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with overweight/obesity and T2DM. Current unknowns in the timing and sequence of multi-target therapy in patients with CKD are emphasised. Priority research questions for the future are highlighted throughout the review.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease: a narrative review of the key evidence with practical considerations [^115qK3Tj]. Diabetes Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are incretin-mimetic agents that are effective adjuncts in the treatment of diabetes. This class of medications is also associated with promoting weight loss and a low risk of hypoglycemia, and some have been shown to be associated with a significant reduction of major cardiovascular events. Mounting evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs have benefits beyond reducing blood glucose that include improving kidney function in people living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), a common microvascular complication of T2DM. Several large clinical studies, the majority of which are cardiovascular outcome trials, indicate that GLP-1 RA therapy is safe and tolerable for people living with T2DM and compromised renal function, and also suggest that GLP-1 RAs may have renoprotective properties. Although evidence from clinical trials has shown GLP-1 RAs to be safe and efficacious in people living with T2DM and renal impairment, their use is uncommon in this patient population. With continuing developments in the field of GLP-1 RA therapy, it is important for physicians to understand the benefits and practical use of GLP-1 RAs, as well as the clinical evidence, in order to achieve positive patient outcomes. Here, we review evidence on GLP-1 RA use in people living with T2DM and CKD and summarize renal outcomes from clinical studies. We provide practical considerations for GLP-1 RA use to provide an added benefit to guide treatment in this high-risk patient population.

### SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists: established and emerging indications [^1179Pp5B]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are used in patients with type 2 diabetes as glucose lowering therapies, with additional benefits of weight loss and blood pressure reduction. Data from cardiovascular outcome trials have highlighted that these drugs confer protection against major cardiovascular disease in those with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reduce the risk of admission to hospital for heart failure, and reduce cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Ongoing research using hard renal endpoints such as end stage kidney disease rather than surrogate markers might clarify the renoprotective benefits of both agents. When used for glucose lowering, SGLT2 inhibitors are most effective if the estimated glomerular filtration rate is more than 60 mL per min per 1·73m 2 at initiation and should be avoided where there is a risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. GLP-1 receptor agonists are contraindicated in those with a history of medullary thyroid cancer and used with caution in patients with a history of pancreatitis of a known cause. These drugs are now second-line, or even arguably first-line, glucose lowering therapies in patients with cardiorenal disease, irrespective of glycaemic control. If an SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 receptor agonist is considered suitable in patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment should be prioritised according to existing evidence: GLP-1 receptor agonists should be considered in patients at a high risk of, or with established, cardiovascular disease and SGLT2 inhibitors considered for patients with heart failure (with reduced ejection fraction) or chronic kidney disease (with or without established cardiovascular disease). There is now compelling data on the benefits of these drugs for a range of other clinical indications even without type 2 diabetes, including for GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with obesity and overweight with weight-related comorbidities.

### Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and cardiometabolic protection: historical development and future challenges [^113YcTLK]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite these benefits, it remains unclear whether the protective effects on specific organs result from direct receptor activation or are indirectly driven by systemic health improvements, such as weight loss. For instance, GLP-1R is expressed at low levels in the heart and blood vessels. In the kidney, they are localized to a subset of vascular smooth muscle cells but are absent from glomerular epithelial or tubular cells. Similarly, in the liver, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells lack canonical GLP-1R expression. These gaps emphasize the need for targeted research to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and unlock the full therapeutic potential of GLP-1RAs. Addressing these challenges will require a combination of preclinical and clinical studies to validate findings and ensure broad applicability.

Beyond their initial role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D), GLP-1RAs have evolved into versatile therapies with benefits in conditions such as obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and metabolic liver disease. The interrelationship among these cardiometabolic conditions — where obesity and T2D often lead to renal and hepatic complications — highlights the need for a multidisciplinary approach to evaluate the complex interplay and pleiotropic effects of GLP-1RAs. Based on current clinical evidence, the following sections explore the therapeutic applications of GLP-1RAs in T2D, obesity, CKD, and metabolic liver disease, emphasizing their role in addressing the interconnected cardiometabolic spectrum and the challenges that remain to better unlock their potential.

### Cardiovascular, mortality, and kidney outcomes with GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials [^111cs6FJ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Background

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, uncertainty regarding kidney outcomes persists and whether benefits extend to exendin-4-based GLP-1 receptor remains uncertain. We aimed to meta-analyse the most up-to-date evidence on the cardiovascular benefits and risks of GLP-1 receptor agonists from outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We did a meta-analysis, including new data from AMPLITUDE-O, using a random effects model to estimate overall hazard ratio (HR) for MACE; its components; all-cause mortality; hospital admission for heart failure; a composite kidney outcome consisting of development of macroalbuminuria, doubling of serum creatinine, or at least 40% decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), kidney replacement therapy, or death due to kidney disease; worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change; and odds ratios for key safety outcomes (severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer). We also examined MACE outcome in patient subgroups on the basis of MACE incidence rates in the placebo group, presence or absence of cardiovascular disease, HbA 1c level, trial duration, treatment dosing interval, structural homology to human GLP-1 or exendin-4, BMI, age, and eGFR. We searched PubMed for eligible trials reporting MACE (ie, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), up to June 9, 2021. We meta-analysed data from published randomised placebo-controlled trials testing either injectable or oral GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes. We restricted the search to trials of more than 500 patients with a primary outcome that included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke. This meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO, CRD42021259711.

Findings

Of 98 articles screened, eight trials comprising 60080 patients fulfilled the prespecified criteria and were included. Overall, GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced MACE by 14% (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·80–0·93]; p < 0·0001), with no significant heterogeneity across GLP-1 receptor agonist structural homology or eight other examined subgroups (all p interaction ≥ 0·14). GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced all-cause mortality by 12% (HR 0·88 [95% CI 0·82–0·94]; p = 0·0001), hospital admission for heart failure by 11% (HR 0·89 [95% CI 0·82–0·98]; p = 0·013), and the composite kidney outcome by 21% (HR 0·79 [95% CI 0·73–0·87]; p < 0·0001), with no increase in risk of severe hypoglycaemia, retinopathy, or pancreatic adverse effects. In sensitivity analyses removing the only trial restricted to patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ELIXA), all benefits marginally increased, including the outcome of worsening of kidney function, based on eGFR change (HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·69–0·98]; p = 0·030).

Interpretation

GLP-1 receptor agonists, regardless of structural homology, reduced the risk of individual MACE components, all-cause mortality, hospital admission for heart failure, and worsening kidney function in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Funding

We review clinical studies supporting the role of GLP-1RAs in patients with diabesity and CKD, including the FLOW trial, as well as exploring potential mechanisms of their nephroprotective effects. Their role in the management of patients with ESKD on maintenance dialysis and after kidney transplantation, while less evidence-based, is also discussed. The potential for other gut hormone–based therapies, including GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide dual agonists (tirzepatide), triple agonists (incorporating glucagon agonism) and amylin analogues to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with CKD, is explored. We highlight the role of novel therapies distinct from the gut–kidney axis, including non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs). We outline the potential for multitarget therapy incorporating renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, incretin-based treatments and nsMRAs to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in patients with overweight/obesity and T2DM.

The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists-based therapies on cardiovascular and renal outcomes has not been systematically reviewed across baseline kidney function groups. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (RAs) in patients with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Methods

We performed a PubMed/Medline search of randomized, placebo-controlled, event-driven outcome trials of GLP-1 RAs versus placebo in patients with and without diabetes from inception to January 2025. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included hospitalization for heart failure, CKD progression, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The relative risk (RR) was estimated using a random-effects model.

Results

Nine RCTs were included with a total of 75,088 patients, including 17,568 with eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Use of an GLP-1 RA in patients with CKD was associated with a lower incidence of MACE (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74–0.95; P 0.006) and of CKD progression (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.77–0.94; P 0.002), compared with placebo. There was no differential treatment effect of GLP-1 RA on these endpoints by CKD status at baseline.

Conclusions

GLP-1 RAs offer substantial cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with CKD. These findings support their use in CKD patients and confirms that these therapies may be continued as kidney function declines.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline — GLP-1 receptor agonist use when SGLT-2 inhibitor is not suitable: For adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease who are not good candidates for a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, we recommend a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven renal protection to improve macroalbuminuria; the benefit of select GLP-1 RAs to improve incident macroalbuminuria outweighed the potential harm of gastrointestinal or other less common adverse events, and the risk of these adverse events can be further decreased by careful patient selection to avoid those at high risk at baseline.

Treatment with the GLP1-RAs liraglutide and semaglutide should be considered if eGFR is > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 as it is associated with a lower risk of renal endpoints (recommendation class IIa, level of evidence B). Treatment with GLP-1 RAs was not abundant with 0.6% of patients with type 1 and 5.3% of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving them (Fig. 5). Rates were comparable in patients with an eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, not in line with guideline recommendations. Treatment was again generally initiated after the diagnosis of CKD. Patients with type 1 diabetes receiving GLP-1RAs were characterized by a higher age (52.8 vs. 44.9 years), lower proportion of males (47.8 vs. 53.8%), a higher BMI (34.8 vs. 25.8 kg/m²) and a higher prevalence of CVD (26.9 vs. 11.9%)

The PIONEER-6 trial with oral semaglutide did not report renal outcomes, and renal replacement therapy and death because of kidney disease were reported in five and two trials, respectively, with no significant differences between GLP-1 RA and placebo. Baseline kidney function was similar across trials (median/mean estimated eGFR ranged from 72–80 mL/min/1.73m2), subgroup analysis based on eGFR was unavailable for renal outcomes, and a SR of trials found no proportional relationship between HbA1c lowering and reduction in the composite renal outcome before or after adjustment for confounders.

Introduction

Diabetes has become widespread, with approximately 463 million people diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (DM) over recent years. By 2045, diabetes will affect at least 700 million people. Approximately 25–30% of patients with type 2 DM (T2DM) will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD), and diabetes is currently the primary cause of end-stage kidney disease requiring kidney replacement therapy. Patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) often have high rates of cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, infections, and mortality.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most commonly used drugs for treating diabetes. Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated that clinical chronic renal events can be decreased by intensive glucose control, blood pressure decline, and the renin-angioten-sin-aldosterone system (RAAS) antagonized by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Even with recommended RAAS blockers, patients with DKD are at a substantial risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A previous study has reported that, the use of medications such as GLP-1RAs and SGLT2i delays or minimizes microvascular and macrovascular damage.

### The expanding role of GLP-1 receptor agonists: a narrative review of current evidence and future directions [^116Hgb7h]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), originally developed for the management of type 2 diabetes, have gained prominence in managing obesity, offering clinically meaningful weight loss of 15–20% in many clinical trials. The approval of liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide for chronic weight management has significantly expanded their use. Beyond their effects on glycemic control and weight loss, GLP-1 RAs are now being evaluated for a range of other conditions, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, knee osteoarthritis, polycystic ovary syndrome, neurodegenerative disease, and substance abuse disorders. Despite these advancements, several challenges persist. Long-term safety concerns, particularly regarding potential risks to the thyroid and gallbladder, are still being explored. Additionally, weight regain after treatment discontinuation and reductions in lean mass have raised new clinical concerns, while issues surrounding cost and accessibility present barriers to the widespread adoption of these drugs. This review explores the evolving role of GLP-1 RAs, highlighting their benefits beyond weight loss, key safety and policy considerations, and future directions for optimizing their use.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^116fEU1q]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

The GLP-1 RA drug class comprises the exendin-4-based peptides exenatide, lixisenatide and efpeglenatide, and the human recombinant peptide RAs dulaglutide, liraglutide and semaglutide (Table 1). These agents are indicated (or currently in development as regards efpeglenatide) to improve glycaemic control in people with T2Dand for weight management (liraglutide and semaglutide). Certain GLP-1 RAs are available to reduce incident cardiovascular risk in people with T2D and established CVD or multiple cardiovascular risk factors (dulaglutide, liraglutide and once-weekly s.c. semaglutide). Most GLP-1 RAs are administered via s.c. injections on a daily or, for the newer-generation GLP-1 RAs, weekly basis. A tablet-based once-daily option for oral administration is available for semaglutide. Finally, albiglutide, a GLP-1 RA constructed as a GLP-1/albumin fusion protein was previously marketed in the United States and EU for use in T2D.

A systematic evaluation of the literature since 2014 informed new recommendations. These include additional focus on lifestyle management and diabetes self-management education and support. For those with obesity, efforts targeting weight loss, including lifestyle, medication, and surgical interventions, are recommended. With regards to medication management, for patients with clinical cardiovascular disease, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist with proven cardiovascular benefit is recommended. For patients with chronic kidney disease or clinical heart failure and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an SGLT2 inhibitor with proven benefit is recommended. GLP-1 receptor agonists are generally recommended as the first injectable medication.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^112fVvk3]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiometabolic disease in type 2 diabetes — integrated management emphasizes concurrent cardiovascular and kidney risk reduction: There is an increasing appreciation of the common pathophysiology and interrelationship of cardiometabolic risk factors leading to both adverse cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in people with diabetes, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). These three comorbidities have been termed cardiometabolic disease or cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic health. Reasons to concurrently consider these comorbidities include the major benefit observed across the spectrum of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes treated with sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Therefore, in addition to the management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs that have demonstrated benefit is considered a foundational element of risk reduction and the pharmacological strategy to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes.

The two subsequent safety trials were LEADER (Liraglutide Effects and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results), and SUSTAIN-6 (Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes With Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes), investigating respectively liraglutide and semaglutide versus placebo in 9340 and 3297 people with T2D and high cardiovascular risk. In contrast to ELIXA, these trials both reported a prespecified renal outcome of new or worsening nephropathy, which was a composite of mostly adjudicated events defined as new-onset or persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of serum creatinine and eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73 m², need for RRT, and renal death (Figure 3). Liraglutide reduced this renal composite by 22% after 3.8 years [95% (CI) 8–33%; p = 0.003] of treatment, whereas semaglutide showed a reduction of 36% after 2.1 years (95% CI 12–54%; p = 0.005). Importantly, these reductions were predominantly driven by reductions in macroalbuminuria with reductions of, respectively, 26% and 46%, and no effect was seen on hard renal endpoints. Since the mean differences in HbA1c levels between treatment arms in LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 of ~0.6% and ~1.1% were even larger than in ELIXA, an influencing role for glucose could initially not be ruled out. In this regard, it was reassuring that the authors of the LEADER trial convincingly showed that renoprotective effects are not dependent on glucose levels, since the outcome remained more or less the same after adjustment for improvements in renal risk factors such as HbA1c, blood pressure, and body weight.LEADER also reported eGFR trajectories, showing a 2% slower decline in the liraglutide group than in the placebo group. Subgroup analyses indicated that this effect was the strongest in patients with moderate (eGFR 30–59 ml/min/1.73 m²) or severe (eGFR < 30 ml/min/1.73 m²) reduced renal function at baseline. Although the renal beneficial effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists were particularly apparent in conjunction with a decline in renal function, the number of patients with CKD greater than stage 4 was small. It is important to stress that in all three trials ELIXA, LEADER and SUSTAIN, the use of the lixisenatide, liraglutide and semaglutide, respectively, was safe; also in patients with CKD that were included in the trial.

### GLP-1-based therapeutics for cardiorenal protection in metabolic diseases [^114ydKVc]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Over last decade, significant progress has been made in cardiorenal protection for metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. With an expanding range of pharmacological options and continuously evolving guidelines, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have garnered substantial clinical and societal attention for their role in T2D and weight-management. GLP-1RAs have consistently demonstrated robust HbA1c- and bodyweight-reducing efficacy in clinical and real-world studies. In addition, mounting data established their cardiorenal benefits beyond glycemic control in select high-risk populations. In T2D, GLP-1RAs have been shown to improve both hard cardiovascular and, more recently, relevant kidney outcomes. Meanwhile, in individuals with obesity but without T2D, semaglutide (at a higher dose compared to T2D) reduces body-weight by up to 15%, and lowers the risk of major adverse cardiovascular-events by 20%. The success of GLP-1-based therapy fueled the development of new single-molecules, that combine GLP-1R agonism with activation of other entero-pancreatic hormone receptors (e.g. glucose-dependent insulinoptropic polypeptide [GIP], glucagon and amylin) aiming to achieve complementary and potentially synergistic effects. These next-generation GLP-1-based therapeutics for metabolic diseases, either already available or approaching clinical approval, appear to enhance the metabolic and weight-reducing efficacy compared to existing GLP-1RAs. An example is tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist, which has been approved for both T2D and obesity-management, demonstrating up to 22.5% weight-loss in phase-3 trials. This review explores the landscape of current and emerging GLP-1-based therapies, their efficacy in managing hyperglycemia and bodyweight, recent evidence supporting their cardiorenal benefits, and clinical implications of these advancements.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^11374fAA]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real-world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real-world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP-1 RA versus other glucose-lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005-January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP-1 RA were compared to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney-related hospitalizations, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance-weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random-effect models.

Results

Thirty-one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%-64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney-related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney-related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP-1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP-1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP-1 RA in real-world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

### Diabetic nephropathy: update on pillars of therapy slowing progression [^117VsfeG]. Diabetes Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Management of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) has evolved in parallel with our growing understanding of the multiple interrelated pathophysiological mechanisms that involve hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory pathways. These pathways and others play a vital role in the initiation and progression of DKD. Since its initial discovery, the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system has remained a cornerstone of DKD management, leaving a large component of residual risk to be dealt with. The advent of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors followed by nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and, to some extent, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) has ushered in a resounding paradigm shift that supports a pillared approach in maximizing treatment to reduce outcomes. This pillared approach is like that derived from the approach to heart failure treatment. The approach mandates that all agents that have been shown in clinical trials to reduce cardiovascular outcomes and/or mortality to a greater extent than a single drug class alone should be used in combination. In this way, each drug class focuses on a specific aspect of the disease's pathophysiology. Thus, in heart failure, β-blockers, sacubitril/valsartan, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and a diuretic are used together. In this article, we review the evolution of the pillar concept of therapy as it applies to DKD and discuss how it should be used based on the outcome evidence. We also discuss the exciting possibility that GLP-1 RAs may be an additional pillar in the quest to further slow kidney disease progression in diabetes.

### Cardiovascular, kidney, and safety outcomes with GLP-1 receptor agonists alone and in combination with SGLT2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111RRs3w]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2) inhibitors both improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists on clinical outcomes with and without SGLT2 inhibitors.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE and Embase databases from inception until July 12, 2024, for randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outcome trials of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes that reported treatment effects by baseline use of SGLT2 inhibitors, with findings supplemented by unpublished data. We estimated treatment effects by baseline SGLT2 inhibitor use using inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis. The main cardiovascular outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death) and hospitalization for heart failure. Kidney outcomes included a composite of ≥ 50% reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate, kidney failure or death caused by kidney failure, and annualized rate of decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (estimated glomerular filtration rate slope). Serious adverse events and severe hypoglycemia were also evaluated. This meta-analysis was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; CRD42024565765).

Results

We identified 3 trials with 1743 of 17072 (10.2%) participants with type 2 diabetes receiving an SGLT2 inhibitor at baseline. GLP-1 receptor agonists reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 21% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71–0.87]), with consistent effects in those receiving and not receiving SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline (HR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.54–1.09] and HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.71–0.87], respectively; P -heterogeneity = 0.78). The effect on hospitalization for heart failure was similarly consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.36–0.93] and HR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.63–0.85]; P -heterogeneity = 0.26). Effects on the composite kidney outcome (risk ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.66–0.95]) and estimated glomerular filtration rate slope (0.78 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /y [95% CI, 0.57–0.98]) also did not vary according to SGLT2 inhibitor use (P -heterogeneity = 0.53 and 0.94, respectively). Serious adverse effects and severe hypoglycemia were also similar regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use (P -heterogeneity = 0.29 and 0.50, respectively).

Conclusions

In people with type 2 diabetes, the cardiovascular and kidney benefits of GLP-1 receptor agonists are consistent regardless of SGLT2 inhibitor use.

Treatment with GLP-1 RA in People Living with T2DM and CKD

The GLP-1 RA class of medications are incretin-mimetics that have been available from 2005, of which exenatide was the first to receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since then, additional GLP-1 RAs have gained regulatory approval in both the United States and Europe. These medications have been demonstrated to be safe and effective in controlling glycemia through HbA1c reduction. The glucose-lowering effect is due to GLP-1 RA binding to the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor in the pancreas where insulin secretion is promoted while glucagon secretion is suppressed. Additional benefits include improved metabolic control and weight loss by acting on the gut, where they slow gastric emptying, and the central nervous system, where they suppress appetite. Target tissues for GLP-1 are highlighted in Fig. 3 and include the heart and kidney. The GLP-1 RAs have been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes, with liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide demonstrating a reduction of major cardiovascular events in people with established cardiovascular disease. Dulaglutide has also demonstrated reduced cardiovascular outcomes in people without established cardiovascular disease. These agents act on the kidneys, with clinical evidence suggesting they promote renal protection. Direct renal benefits include decreased glomerular atherosclerosis, inhibition of the renin–angiotensin system, stimulation of proximal tubule natriuresis, and reduced fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress, while they indirectly reduce renal risk factors by reducing hypertension, decreasing weight, and improving glycemic control. The potential direct and indirect benefits mediated by GLP-1 RA are summarized in Fig. 4. For a more detailed overview on the potential mechanisms by which GLP-1 RA may exert these effects on the kidney, we refer readers to recent review articles. Importantly unlike many other glucose-lowering medications, including metformin, sulfonylureas, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, GLP-1 RAs do not have a relative contraindication in people with renal impairment.

### The potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease: from randomised trials to clinical practice [^115kyHPx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Dual agonists activating the GLP-1 receptor and the receptor of the other major hormone of the incretin system, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), are also in clinical development. Such and other combination therapies that integrate a GLP-1 RA and additional relevant compounds may hold additional potential. Results from the SURPASS programme for tirzepatide have shown that this dulaglutide-based GLP-1/GIP dual agonist provide profound glycaemic and weight-related benefits, which may translate into corresponding kidney-protection. Furthermore, the combination of the once-weekly GLP-1 RA semaglutide and the amylin analogue, cagrilintide, has displayed similar promising efficacy results on body weight that seem to go beyond what is achievable with semaglutide alone. Amylin clearance predominantly happens via the renal route, suggesting the effects of amylin, whether beneficial or risk-associated, could be more pronounced in people with CKD.

The current KDIGO guideline recommends blockade of the RAAS and SGLT-2 inhibitors in people with DKD. In addition, the American Diabetes Association now recommends finerenone in case of SGLT-2 inhibitor intolerance or inadequacy. Further expanding the treatment options for people with DKD, GLP-1 RA treatment may provide additional benefits (Figure 1), including body weight reduction. Recent evidence supports the safe combined use of SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAsand that the benefits of finerenone are independent of GLP-1 RA treatment in people with DKD. Thus, combined appropriate use of these three drug classes may offer added or even synergistic benefits to people with DKD.

In conclusion, data from clinical trials and real-world evidence suggest a potential kidney-protective effect of GLP-1 RAs in DKD as reflected by the prioritisation of the drug class in current treatment guidelines. Confirmatory and mechanistic trials are ongoing, which will provide additional insights, potentially allowing for the approved use of GLP-1 RAs to address the profound current unmet medical need for kidney protection in diabetes, alone or in combination with other treatment options.

A trial in participants with type 2 diabetes and moderate-to-severe CKD "(participants with eGFR as low as 15 mL/min/1.73 m²) reported a significantly slower rate of eGFR decline with dulaglutide treatment compared with insulin glargine", pooled analyses showed benefit "in those with baseline eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2", and the FLOW trial of "subcutaneous semaglutide, 1 mg weekly" found the "primary composite kidney outcome… was reduced by 24% with a hazard ratio of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88)". In SELECT, semaglutide "(2.4 mg weekly)" achieved "a relative risk reduction of 20%" for major adverse cardiovascular events; the secondary "nephropathy" outcome was "reduced by 22% with a hazard ratio of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.63–0.96)", and "only 21% had an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or UACR ≥ 30 mg/g at baseline".

### Chronic kidney disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Ei8NA]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes with chronic kidney disease (CKD) — sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are recommended for high-risk CKD and for use at lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels. SGLT2 inhibitors are recommended for individuals at high risk of CKD progression, and for people with type 2 diabetes and CKD, use in individuals with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 is recommended to reduce CKD progression and cardiovascular events. The eGFR limit is supported by major trial criteria (CREDENCE: eGFR > 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 300 mg/g; DAPA-CKD: eGFR > 25 mL/min/1.73 m2 and UACR > 200 mg/g), analyses suggesting safety and effectiveness at eGFR levels of > 20 mL/min/1.73 m2, and EMPA-KIDNEY efficacy in participants with eGFR as low as 20 mL/min/1.73 m2. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may also be used at low eGFR for cardiovascular protection but may require dose adjustment.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of medications for adults with type 2 diabetes at varied risks of cardiovascular and kidney related complications?

Context

Emerging clinical trials of novel medications have demonstrated benefits on cardiovascular, kidney, and weight related outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes. Dynamically updated practice guidelines adhering to standards of trustworthiness are necessary in response to a rapidly evolving evidence base and the availability of multiple medication alternatives. This living practice guideline incorporates the latest available medications and evidence and provides recommendations stratified by risks of cardiovascular and kidney complications to inform diabetes management.

Recommendations

The panel issued risk-stratified recommendations regarding four prioritised medications for adults with type 2 diabetes (SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, finerenone and tirzepatide):• Lower risk (three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease (CVD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD)): weak recommendation against SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Moderate risk (more than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD; or established CVD and/or CKD at lower risk of complications): weak recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation against finerenone in adults with CKD.• Higher risk (established CVD and/or CKD at higher risk of complications, or established heart failure): strong recommendation in favour of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists; and a weak recommendation in favour of finerenone in adults with CKD.• Across risk strata: weak recommendation in favour of tirzepatide in adults with obesity.

About This Guideline and How It Was Created

An international panel including two patient partners, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations. The panel followed standards for trustworthy guidelines and used the GRADE approach, explicitly considering the balance of benefits, harms and burdens of treatment from an individual patient perspective. Recommendations were informed by a linked living systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating relative benefits and harms updated to 31 July 2024; and by linked systematic reviews addressing risk prediction models and values and preferences of adults with type 2 diabetes. Candidate therapeutics are prioritised based on availability of sufficient randomised trial data, relevance to a global audience and likelihood of changing practice. This is the first version of the living guideline. The guideline is part of the BMJ Rapid Recommendations series. MAGICapp displays the most recent version of the guideline and full content including evidence summaries and decision aids; major updates will be published in The BMJ. We encourage re-use, adaptation and translation of these living guidelines, and recognise that the lack of availability or high costs of some medications may be prohibitive and will impact on how these recommendations are implemented across different health care systems.

### KDOQI US commentary on the KDIGO 2020 clinical practice guideline for diabetes management in CKD [^114ixkaC]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) — Recommendation 4.3.1 states that in patients with T2D and CKD who have not achieved individualized glycemic targets despite metformin and SGLT2i, or who are unable to use those medications, we recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA (1B). The commentary notes cardiovascular benefit has been shown for liraglutide, dulaglutide, injectable semaglutide, and albiglutide, with lack of cardiovascular benefit with lixisenatide and exenatide and oral semaglutide, and that in the oral semaglutide PIONEER 6 study there were significant reductions in cardiovascular and all-cause mortality; thus, they suggest the guideline line be modified to recommend a long-acting GLP-1 RA with proven cardiovascular benefits. For kidney outcomes, KDIGO states the composite kidney outcome benefit for liraglutide was driven primarily by reduction in new severely increased albuminuria, and exploratory analyses in REWIND show possible preservation of eGFR with dulaglutide when using eGFR reductions of 40% and 50% from baseline, whereas the primary analysis of a sustained reduction of 30% from baseline did not show this.

### Combination therapy with kidney protective therapies: optimizing the benefits? [^114ELFDR]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Recent advances in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) have led to the development of several new agents that are kidney protective, particularly in people with diabetes. These agents include sodium/glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2 inhibitors), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This review summarizes the available data regarding the effects of using these therapies in combination.

Recent Findings

There is convincing evidence that SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs individually improve kidney function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in people with CKD, especially diabetic CKD. There is some evidence that GLP-1RAs may be beneficial, but further studies are needed. The available data support an additive kidney and cardiovascular benefit using combination therapy with SGLT-2 inhibitors and MRAs, and possibly with SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs, but more long-term data are needed. The currently available data suggest that combining these agents would likely be beneficial and may be an appropriate long-term strategy.

Summary

Several new agents are useful in slowing the progress of CKD. Further research to identify which combinations of agents work best together and which combinations are most effective for people with different characteristics, in order to personalize treatment and improve outcomes for people with CKD, should be a priority.

The Kidney Disease

Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease represents the first KDIGO guideline on this subject. The guideline comes at a time when advances in diabetes technology and therapeutics offer new options to manage the large population of patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) at high risk of poor health outcomes. An enlarging base of high-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is available to evaluate important new treatments offering organ protection, such as sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The goal of the new guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize the clinical care of people with diabetes and CKD by integrating new options with existing management strategies. In addition, the guideline contains practice points to facilitate implementation when insufficient data are available to make well-justified recommendations or when additional guidance may be useful for clinical application. The guideline covers comprehensive care of patients with diabetes and CKD, glycemic monitoring and targets, lifestyle interventions, antihyperglycemic therapies, and self-management and health systems approaches to management of patients with diabetes and CKD.

### Kidney outcomes with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists versus other glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of real-world data [^115HZqZN]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Aims

Randomized placebo‐controlled clinical trials showed that glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RA) reduce kidney risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), prominently in those with chronic kidney disease. It is unclear whether these findings may apply to broader populations of patients with T2D treated in real‐world settings and compared to active controls. We summarised real‐world data of adverse kidney outcomes among patients with T2D initiating GLP‐1 RA versus other glucose‐lowering agents.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed and Embase for observational cohort studies (April 2005–January 2025; PROSPERO CRD42023405356). Initiators of GLP‐1 RA were compared to sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), dipeptidyl‐peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), sulfonylureas, or basal insulin. Outcomes included risks of albuminuria progression, ≥ 40 or ≥ 50% eGFR reduction from baseline, acute kidney injury (AKI), kidney‐related hospitalizations, and end‐stage kidney disease (ESKD), per data availability. We synthesised the data using inverse variance‐weighted averages of logarithmic hazard ratios (HR)s in random‐effect models.

Results

Thirty‐one studies were eligible, encompassing 1,601,389 patients (mean age 49–78 years, 5%–64% women), with 21, 6, 5, and 1 of them using SGLT2i, DPP4i, basal insulin, and sulfonylureas as a comparator, respectively. Compared with SGLT2i, GLP‐1 RA initiators had higher risks for AKI (HR [95% CI] 1.12 [1.05–1.20]), kidney‐related hospitalizations (1.66 [1.01–2.73]), and ≥ 40% reduction in eGFR (1.40 [1.27–1.53]), without evidence for differences in risks of ≥ 50% eGFR reduction or ESKD. Compared to DPP4i, GLP‐1 RA initiators had lower risks for experiencing ≥ 50% eGFR reduction (0.84 [0.76–0.92]), kidney‐related hospitalizations (0.73 [0.65–0.83]), and ESKD (0.70 [0.63–0.78]). Similar benefits were observed when comparing GLP‐1 RA to sulfonylureas. Compared to basal insulin, GLP‐1 RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of albuminuria progression (0.89 [0.80–0.99]), with inconsistent data regarding possible benefits in reducing ESKD risk.

Conclusions

In patients with T2D, initiation of GLP‐1 RA in real‐world settings may be associated with improved kidney outcomes compared to DPP4i, sulfonylureas, and basal insulin, and worse kidney outcomes compared to SGLT2i.

Hypoglycemia

Despite having a pronounced anti-hyperglycemic effect, GLP-1 RAs are not typically associated with hypoglycemia when used as monotherapy. Caution is advised, with dose reduction recommended in some cases, when they are combined with a sulphonylurea or insulin as the risk of hypoglycemia is higher. In clinical trials examining GLP-1 RA in combination with a sulphonylurea (with or without metformin) or insulin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was low overall, but increased when compared with placebo. When GLP-1 RAs are not used concomitantly with a sulphonylurea or insulin, routine glucose monitoring is unnecessary due to the low risk of developing hypoglycemia.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in CKD — A GLP-1 RA is recommended as another option to reduce risks of ASCVD, macroalbuminuria, and eGFR decline in T2D; in advanced CKD (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), GLP-1 RAs retain glycemic efficacy without increased risk of hypoglycemia and can be used to control BG with an eGFR as low as 15 mL/min/1.73 m2, depending on the agent. Because gastrointestinal symptoms occur more frequently when kidney function is reduced, consider slowly titrating drug doses, and adjustment of concomitant glucose-lowering agents should be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.

KEY LEARNING POINTS

What is already known about this subject?

Evidence has emerged of the potential kidney-protective effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
To date, data have mostly been derived from cardiovascular (CV) outcome or glycaemic control trials featuring populations not selected for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and/or with kidney disease events as secondary outcomes.
Reduction of CKD progression by GLP-1RAs is yet to be confirmed and requires dedicated trials of kidney outcomes with GLP-1RAs.

What this study adds?

FLOW (NCT03819153) is a dedicated kidney outcomes trial to assess semaglutide, a once-weekly GLP-1RA, in a population with CKD and T2D at high risk of kidney disease progression.
The trial is designed to assess whether treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide delays the progression of kidney disease and lowers the risk of kidney failure, as well as kidney and CV disease mortality, compared with placebo in people with CKD and T2D.
Baseline data from the FLOW trial, which is ongoing, show that enrolled participants are nearly all classified as high or very high risk for CKD progression according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines categorisation, which assesses risk based on estimated glomerular filtration rate and urine albumin:creatinine ratio.

What impact this may have on practice or policy?

The FLOW trial will provide evidence on the effects of semaglutide on kidney outcomes, potentially expanding treatment options for patients with T2D to slow the progression of CKD and reduce kidney failure.

GAPS BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLEMENTATION IN KIDNEY CARE

Strategies to prevent and treat CKD have been built on a strong evidence base over the past 3 decades (Figure 3). Clinical practice guidelines for CKD are clear; however, adherence to these guidelines is suboptimal (Figure 2).

Safety and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs in people with CKD

The safety and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs are well established based on the clinical development programmes as well as extensive post-marketing experience.– In general, the drug class is associated with gastrointestinal side effects, primarily nausea, which are transient, related to treatment initiation and dose escalation, and mild to moderate in the majority of cases. To improve tolerability, gastrointestinal side effects are mitigated using a dose-escalation regimen. Gastrointestinal events, which can also include vomiting, may in rare cases lead to dehydration and, especially in people with pre-existing CKD, dehydration can lead to acute kidney injury. This is reflected in the prescribing information for GLP-1 RAs. However, analysis of data for semaglutide pooled from seven of the trials from the clinical development programme (SUSTAIN) did not find an increased risk of acute kidney injury with this GLP-1 RA; similar findings were also apparent for liraglutide in the data from LEADER.

Data from the CVOTs discussed in this review have corroborated the safety and tolerability of the use of GLP-1 RA in people with T2D and CKD. In LEADER, there was no difference in the overall occurrence of adverse events in the liraglutide versus placebo group according to the presence or absence of albuminuria, and same trend was observed based on eGFR.

Because GLP-1 RAs function in a blood glucose-dependent manner, the risk of severe hypoglycaemic episodes is lowand primarily observed if treatment is combined with insulins or SUs. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia was found to be lower with liraglutide compared with placebo for people with reduced eGFR or albuminuria in LEADER (HRs = 0.63; 95% CI = 0.43–0.91 and 0.57, 95% CI = 0.40–0.82, respectively).

A meta‐analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) found that compared with a placebo, GLP‐1 RA reduce the risk of cardiovascular outcomes, mortality, and the risk of composite kidney outcomes that included incident macroalbuminuria, in patients with T2D and high cardiovascular risk. The FLOW trial (NCT03819153) further demonstrated that semaglutide reduced the risk of major kidney disease events or cardiovascular death and mitigated eGFR slope in people with T2D and CKD with albuminuria. The current systematic review and meta‐analysis adds new insight into the kidney effects of GLP‐1 RA in people with T2D. The RCTs' settings include high‐quality, strict follow‐up conditions by multidisciplinary teams of healthcare experts that often cannot be achieved in the real world. Furthermore, real‐world populations are more diverse than those recruited to RCTs and often include populations with lower baseline kidney and cardiovascular risks. For example, the FLOW trial included only patients with eGFR of 50–75 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a UACR > 300– < 5000 mg/g, or an eGFR of 25– < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 with a UACR > 100– < 5000 mg/g. Finally, all completed CVOTs with GLP‐1 RA used a placebo comparator, while real‐world studies often utilise active comparators, enabling a more pragmatic view. Thus, while RCTs provide a higher level of proof, real‐world data provide complementary and required evidence.

Guideline recommendations relating to combination therapy in CKD with T2D

Three treatment guidelines — Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) (2022), American Diabetes Association (ADA) (2024), and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) (2022) — provide recommendations that relate to drug combinations for specific clinical scenarios in the management of CKD associated with T2D (Fig. 3). The KDIGO also recently published their 2024 update to the Clinical Practice Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of CKD.

Fig. 3
Current practice guideline recommendations for combination therapies in patients with T2D at risk of CKD. KDIGO 2022, ADA 2024 Chap. 11, and AACE 2022 and KDIGO 2024 S/R = strong support/recommended by at least one of the practice guidelines; PP = Practice Point (by KDIGO, not a formal recommendation); NG = not graded AACE, American Association of Clinical Endocrinology; ADA, American Diabetes Association; CKD, chronic kidney disease; CV, cardiovascular; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; GLP-1 RA, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist; KDIGO, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes; ns-MRA, nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor; T2D, type 2 diabetes

Before discussing the specific combinations, the base therapy for the combinations, or first-line drug therapies, needs to be considered. The glucose-lowering agents metformin and SGLT2is are recommended by the KDIGO 2022 guidelines as first-line therapies in patients with T2D, and all three guidelines recommend a RAAS inhibitor, at the maximum tolerated dose, as a standard of care for patients with T2D and albuminuria.

SGLT2is are recommended if eGFR is ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m 2 to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD, with the KDIGO and ADA guidelines also adding that patients are to have a UACR ≥ 200 mg/g. Where the combination of metformin and SGLT2i is insufficient to control blood glucose or cannot be tolerated by patients, GLP-1 RAs are recommended; AACE guidelines recommend GLP-1 RAs in patients with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 for glycemic control and to reduce risk of atherosclerotic CV disease and progression of albuminuria. GLP-1 RAs are generally preferred after consideration of several factors when selecting additional drugs to manage glycemia, such as patient preferences, comorbidities, eGFR, and cost.

Meta-analyses and effectiveness

In a recently updatedmeta-analysis of kidney outcome data from six of the above-mentioned CVOTs, Sattar and colleagues showed that the GLP-1 RA drug class as a whole appears to be associated with a 21% reduction in incident kidney risk (HR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.73–0.87) as evaluated using a composite kidney outcome that included macroalbuminuria. Conducting the meta-analysis for this review while leaving out the macroalbuminuria component gave a statistically significant HR of 0.84 (95% CI = 0.73–0.95) (Figure 2). In a different analysis (excluding ELIXA), Sattar et al. showed a statistically significant 18% relative risk reduction (HR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.69–0.98) for a worsening of kidney function.

Results from CVOTs and randomised controlled trials largely represent assessments of efficacy obtained in controlled settings and from certain, pre-defined trial populations; the real-world effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs on kidney outcomes may be different in clinical practice. Interestingly, database studies supplying real-world evidence have indeed corroborated the above-mentioned data from the controlled clinical trials. In a Scandinavian cohort of people seen in clinical practice in Denmark, Norway and Sweden, serious kidney events were fewer in individuals using GLP-1 RAs compared with those who were on DPP-IV inhibitors; the risk of such events was 24% lower with GLP-1 RAs (HR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.68–0.85). In a Swedish cohort study, the corresponding relative risk reduction (GLP-1 RA use versus DPP-IV use) was 28% (adjusted HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.53–0.98) for the evaluated composite kidney outcome (sustained doubling of creatinine, kidney failure or kidney death). Similarly, US military veterans using GLP-1 RAs had a 28% lower risk of a composite kidney outcome compared with those in the cohort who used sulfonylureas or DPP-VI inhibitors (HR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.63–0.74).

### GLP-1 receptor agonists vs DPP-4 inhibitors and mortality in diabetes and advanced CKD… [^116Tg5VT]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Question Is use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists among patients with diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease associated with better outcomes than use of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors. Findings This cohort study comprising 27 279 participants with type 2 diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease revealed that the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality and lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality than was use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Meaning In this study, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with better outcomes compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors among patients with type 2 diabetes and advanced-stage chronic kidney disease. Importance.

According to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2020 Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in Chronic Kidney Disease, 11, 12 GLP-1 receptor agonist treatment is suggested for individuals who are unable to use metformin or SGLT-2 inhibitors. Unlike SGLT-2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists can be used in patients with advanced-stage CKD or ESKD. The 2 major findings of this study can be summarized as follows: use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with diabetes and stage 5 CKD or EKSD was associated with lower all-cause mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors and use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower sepsis- and infection-related mortality compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors. A previous study reported that use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with lower all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, and kidney failure compared with placebo in the general population with diabetes.

7 In that study, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was also associated with improved outcomes compared with several traditional antidiabetic agents, including sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, and thiazolidinedione. In this cross-sectional study, in patients with type 2 diabetes and stage 5 CKD or ESKD, use of GLP-1 receptor agonists was associated with better outcomes, including all-cause mortality and sepsis- and infection-related mortality, compared with use of DPP-4 inhibitors. Additional large-scale, prospective studies are needed to examine our results.

### GLP1R expression and kidney disease progression… [^115H4tXQ]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

These findings support a nephroprotective role of GLP-1RAs. Importance Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists may have nephroprotective properties beyond those related to weight loss and glycemic control. Objective To investigate the association of genetically proxied GLP-1RAs with kidney disease progression. trial, studying effects of semaglutide in patients with chronic kidney disease and type 2 diabetes, demonstrated the efficacy of a GLP-1RA in reducing kidney disease progression. 5 However, the FLOW trial and similar studies have been limited to individuals with diabetes, leaving the efficacy of GLP-1RAs for reducing kidney disease progression in broader populations uncertain. 6, 7 The effect of genetic variants that influence GLP-1 receptor gene expression may serve as a proxy for GLP-1RA treatment, providing a detailed assessment of its effects on kidney function in different clinical contexts.

Our study assessed the association between genetically determined GLP1R gene expression in human tissues and kidney disease progression, leveraging the extensive biobank and genetic resources of the US Department of Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program. Through a survival analysis, we examined the association of this genetic proxy for GLP-1RAs with kidney disease progression, performing sequential adjustments and subgroup analyses to estimate the influence of its metabolic effects. Our results may help the design and interpretation of contemporary GLP-1RA clinical trials. Our study extends these findings by examining the nephroprotective potential of GLP-1RAs across a broad population. We demonstrated that higher genetic GLP1R expression was consistently associated with reduced kidney disease progression after adjusting for BMI and diabetes status.

Subgroup analyses demonstrated similar presence and direction of associations in subgroups with healthy weight and without diabetes, indicating that these therapies could benefit a broader range of patients than currently recognized. Although larger sample sizes would be needed to detect statistically significant effects in these subgroups, our findings warrant further investigation and support the potential for broader clinical applications of GLP-1RAs. This genetic association study demonstrated that higher genetic GLP1R expression was associated with a small reduction in risk of kidney disease progression and supported a nephroprotective role of GLP-1RAs. Dedicated clinical trials to further validate the utility of GLP-1RAs in broader contexts are needed. Accepted for Publication: August 23, 2024.
