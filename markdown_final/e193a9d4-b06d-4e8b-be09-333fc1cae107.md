## Question

What proton pump inhibitor regimen can cure psoriasis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) regimen can cure psoriasis and, if so, what it is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what PPIs are actually indicated for and whether dermatologic diseases fall within their approved uses. Then, I should verify evidence-based treatments for psoriasis to see if PPIs appear anywhere in guidelines or trials. Next, I will check for any mechanistic or clinical links between PPIs and psoriasis outcomes, including drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will synthesize a safe, guideline-concordant clinical answer and address common misconceptions. I will verify this against major dermatology guidelines and FDA labeling for PPIs to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic class and indications of PPIs, because if I get that wrong, everything downstream unravels; PPIs like pantoprazole and formulations such as Protonix I.V. are approved for acid-related gastrointestinal disorders, including GERD, peptic ulcer disease, upper GI bleeding adjunctive care, and as components of H. pylori eradication regimens — not for dermatologic conditions like psoriasis, and deprescribing guidance emphasizes avoiding chronic PPI use without a clear indication, so there is no labeled dermatologic role to begin with [^113xcsf1] [^113xcsf1] [^116mRu8j].

> Next, I should review what actually treats psoriasis; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions until I check the guidelines: evidence-based psoriasis care spans topical therapy (high-potency corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, combination products), phototherapy, conventional systemic agents (methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin), and biologics targeting TNF, IL-17, and IL-23 pathways, none of which include PPIs as therapeutic options in AAD/NPF or BAD recommendations [^115jNwGC] [^115SpEBs] [^112KZ7rw] [^112DGzBf].

> I will now examine any PPI–psoriasis connection in the documents; wait, let me verify the most clinically relevant link, which is actually a drug–drug interaction: concomitant PPI use can elevate and prolong serum methotrexate (and metabolite) levels, particularly with high-dose regimens, increasing toxicity risk and sometimes warranting temporary PPI withdrawal during high-dose methotrexate — a safety signal that argues against, not for, PPI use in psoriasis management [^115hCX3w] [^111Npu6q] [^115zDnt4].

> But wait, what if there were trials suggesting PPIs improve psoriasis via anti-inflammatory effects; hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check that — there are no psoriasis guidelines or credible trials endorsing PPIs for disease control, psoriasis remains a chronic immune-mediated dermatosis requiring immunomodulatory therapy, and in fact a small vonoprazan study even listed "psoriasis" as a treatment-emergent adverse event, which certainly does not support a therapeutic role for PPIs in psoriasis [^115SpEBs] [^114B6cQT].

> I should address the underlying misconception directly; let me consider two common confusions: first, conflating methotrexate (a cornerstone psoriasis therapy) with PPI coadministration for GI symptoms — the interaction cautions against routine pairing, especially at high methotrexate doses; second, assuming gastric acid suppression has systemic anti-psoriatic benefit — which lacks mechanistic and clinical support; if reflux protection is truly needed, I need to check alternatives like H2-receptor antagonists, which deprescribing guidance allows, and small trials have explored famotidine-based regimens for GI indications without implying benefit for psoriasis itself [^112xR2qe] [^1118T5yu].

> Conclusion and clinical takeaways: I need to ensure I am explicit — there is no PPI regimen that cures psoriasis, PPIs are not part of psoriasis treatment protocols, and they may complicate methotrexate pharmacokinetics at higher oncology-style doses; guideline-concordant care relies on topical therapy, phototherapy, conventional systemic agents, and biologics with appropriate monitoring, and if a patient on methotrexate requires acid suppression, clinicians should reassess the indication for PPIs and consider alternatives while following methotrexate safety labs and dermatology guideline recommendations [^115hCX3w] [^115SpEBs] [^113axBkP] [^112DGzBf].

There is **no evidence** that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) cure psoriasis, and **no clinical guidelines** recommend their use for psoriasis management. PPIs are indicated for **acid-related gastrointestinal conditions**, not dermatologic disease [^113xcsf1]. If a patient with psoriasis requires a PPI for a valid GI indication, **use the lowest effective dose** [^1169hHEv] and **monitor for potential interactions** with methotrexate [^111Npu6q] [^115hCX3w] or cyclosporine. Psoriasis should be treated with **evidence-based therapies** — such as topical agents, phototherapy, systemic agents, or biologics — according to disease severity and guideline recommendations [^113YjvfR] [^115SpEBs] [^114oZHA9].

---

## Evidence regarding PPIs and psoriasis

- **No evidence of efficacy**: There is no clinical evidence that PPIs improve or cure psoriasis; they are not recommended in any dermatology guidelines [^115SpEBs].

- **No anti-inflammatory effect**: PPIs do not have established anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory effects relevant to psoriasis pathogenesis.

- **No clinical trials**: There are no randomized controlled trials or observational studies supporting PPIs for psoriasis.

---

## Current clinical guidelines for psoriasis management

Psoriasis management is guided by disease severity, patient factors, and comorbidities, with **no role for PPIs**:

| **Severity** | **Recommended treatments** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - Topical corticosteroids <br/> - Vitamin D analogs <br/> - Topical calcineurin inhibitors [^112dbKg8] [^111Z5d8Y] [^111ngGUP] |
| Moderate | - Phototherapy (NB-UVB, PUVA) <br/> - Systemic agents (methotrexate, acitretin, cyclosporine) <br/> - Apremilast [^115SpEBs] [^114oZHA9] |
| Severe | - Biologic agents (TNF-alpha inhibitors, IL-17 inhibitors, IL-23 inhibitors) <br/> - Combination therapies [^114oZHA9] [^113YjvfR] |

---

PPIs [^114oZHA9] are **not included** in any guideline for psoriasis management [^114wAVDG].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of PPIs in psoriasis patients

PPIs have **known risks** [^113xcsf1] that may be relevant for patients with chronic inflammatory disease:

- **Gastrointestinal infections**: Increased risk of C. difficile and other infections.

- **Nutrient deficiencies**: Risk of vitamin B12, magnesium, and calcium deficiencies [^113xcsf1].

- **Bone health**: Increased fracture risk with long-term use [^113xcsf1].

- **Renal effects**: Risk of acute interstitial nephritis and chronic kidney disease [^113xcsf1].

- **Drug interactions**: PPIs can increase methotrexate levels [^111Npu6q] [^115hCX3w] and toxicity; caution is advised.

---

## Clinical scenarios where PPIs may be considered in psoriasis patients

PPIs may be used in psoriasis patients **only when there is a clear gastrointestinal indication** [^116mRu8j], such as **GERD or peptic ulcer disease**, and for **methotrexate-related GI symptoms**; in the latter scenario, short-term PPI therapy may be considered for GI protection with careful monitoring for interactions.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **No role in psoriasis**: PPIs do not cure or improve psoriasis and are not recommended for this purpose.

- **Use only for GI indications**: Prescribe PPIs only when there is a clear gastrointestinal indication [^116mRu8j].

- **Monitor for interactions**: Be vigilant for interactions with methotrexate [^111Npu6q] [^115hCX3w] and cyclosporine.

- **Follow evidence-based care**: Use topical, phototherapy, systemic, and biologic therapies [^112DGzBf] according to severity and guidelines [^115SpEBs] [^114oZHA9].

PPIs are **not a treatment for psoriasis**; manage the disease with guideline-directed therapies [^115SpEBs] and reserve PPIs for valid gastrointestinal indications [^116mRu8j].

The healthcare costs of matched vonoprazan-treated and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-treated patients were analyzed. Mean total all-cause healthcare costs were statistically significantly lower for patients treated with vonoprazan than for those treated with a PPI (185,378 ± 456,470 JPY, median: 94,262 JPY versus 230,876 ± 689,312 JPY, median: 101,988 JPY, p < 0.001). Mean costs of visits to gastroenterologists were also lower for patients treated with a vonoprazan-based regimen compared to those treated with a PPI-based regimen (8,194 ± 62,049 JPY versus 10,199 ± 107,213 JPY, both medians: 0, p < 0.001). Similar comparative trends were observed for Helicobacter pylori-related costs.

- **Healthcare costs**: Healthcare costs during follow-up were assessed for matched vonoprazan-treated and PPI-treated patients. Inpatient costs included inpatient claims and Diagnosis Procedure Combination (DPC), which is a comprehensive per-diem payment system for the inpatient setting.

- **Duration of assessment**: Healthcare costs were evaluated in the 12 calendar months including and after the index month. These costs were adjusted to 2020 JPY using the Consumer Price Index for medical care from the Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

- **H. pylori-related visits**: These visits were considered claims with a confirmed or suspected H. pylori diagnosis code.

### Comparative effectiveness and tolerance of treatments for Helicobacter pylori: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117VfxCv]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Treatment regimens have been evolving to find the most effective approaches. Some researchers have shown a sequential treatment consisting of five days of a proton pump inhibitor plus amoxicillin, followed by five additional days of a proton pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin and 5-nitroimidazole or amoxicillin, to be an alternative approach. A bismuth-based quadruple treatment, including bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor, and two antibiotics, was also accepted as an alternative first-line treatment in many studies.

Concomitant treatment with a proton pump inhibitor and three different antibiotics also showed acceptable efficacy in some circumstances. In this regimen, all drugs are given concomitantly and not in sequence. Some researchers believe that the principal advantage of this regimen is the worldwide availability of antibiotics, compared with bismuth compounds. In addition, the antibiotic selection or duration of treatment for this regimen is not standardized.

Levofloxacin is an effective alternative to standard antibiotics and tackles the primary resistance to macrolides and nitroimidazoles. Therefore, several studies also recommended a levofloxacin-based triple treatment, containing a proton pump inhibitor, levofloxacin, and one antibiotic. Previous studies reported that adding probiotics improved the effectiveness of H. pylori eradication during standard triple treatment in some circumstances. Therefore, a probiotic-supplemented triple treatment has also been considered as a treatment option.

- **Upper gastrointestinal Crohn's disease**: Mild gastroduodenal Crohn's disease may be treated with proton pump inhibitors. For moderate or severe disease, treatment may also require corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive or biological therapies, similar to Crohn's disease elsewhere in the gut (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence; Agreement: 92.7%).

	- Mild oesophageal Crohn's disease may be treated with proton pump inhibitors, with nutritional assessment and support being essential. A short course of corticosteroids may be necessary if symptoms worsen. However, early anti-TNF therapy should be considered for ongoing moderate to severe disease. Oesophageal dilatation should be used for strictures, and surgery should be the last resort for disease refractory to all medical therapy (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence; Agreement: 97.6%).

	- An international multidisciplinary expert panel (European Panel on the Appropriateness of Crohn's Disease Therapy, EPACT II) published guidance on managing special situations in Crohn's disease in 2009, including upper gastrointestinal disease. No discrimination was made between oesophageal, gastric, or duodenal disease, and limited evidence supported the recommendations. The guidance was split into recommendations for patients with and without stenosis, advocating that Helicobacter pylori be sought and eradicated in all cases.

	- In the absence of stenosis, proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were recommended as first-line therapy.

- **Treatments**: Treatments are summarized in Table 4, and the treatment trends are shown in Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7. Approximately 68.9% of the patients received topical therapy (males, 69.1%; females, 68.6%). Topical therapy included corticosteroids (61.7%; males, 62.9%; females, 59.3%), vitamin D3 (57.6%; males, 58.4%; females, 56.0%), corticosteroid/vitamin D3 combinations (52.8%; males, 52.2%; females, 53.8%), tacrolimus (0.7%; males, 0.7%; females, 0.6%), and others (4.0%; males, 3.9%; females, 4.2%).

- **Phototherapy**: Approximately 9.1% of the cases received phototherapy (males, 8.8%; females, 9.7%). Phototherapy included psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) (1.9%; males, 3.1%; females, 0.0%), narrowband (NB) ultraviolet B (UVB) (86.1%; males, 88.8%; females, 81.7%), broadband (BB)-UVB (0.6%; males, 1.0%; females, 0.0%), and targeted UVB (11.4%; males, 7.1%; females, 18.3%).

### Real-world outcomes associated with vonoprazan-based proton pump inhibitor-based therapy for infection in Japan [^114qfe8g]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Japanese guidelines recommend triple therapy with vonoprazan or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) in combination with antibiotics to treat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. While studies have shown improved eradication rates and reduced costs with vonoprazan versus PPIs, there is little data describing healthcare resource use (HCRU) and treatment patterns.

- **Objectives**: To compare patients treated with a vonoprazan-based or PPI-based regimen for H. pylori infection in Japan in terms of their characteristics, HCRU, healthcare costs, clinical outcomes, and treatment patterns.

- **Design**: Retrospective matched cohort.

- **Methods**: We used data from the Japan Medical Data Center claims database (July 2014–January 2020) to identify adult patients with H. pylori infection and a first observed use of vonoprazan or a PPI in 2015 or later (index date). Patients prescribed a vonoprazan-based or a PPI-based regimen were matched 1:1 using propensity score matching. HCRU, healthcare costs, diagnostic tests, a proxy for H. pylori eradication (i.e. no triple therapy with amoxicillin in combination with metronidazole or clarithromycin > 30 days after the index date), and second-line treatment were described during the 12-month follow-up period.

- **Results**: Among 25,389 matched pairs, vonoprazan-treated patients had fewer all-cause and H. pylori-related inpatient stays and outpatient visits than PPI-treated patients, resulting in lower all-cause healthcare costs [185,378 Japanese yen (JPY) versus 230,876 JPY, p < 0.001]. Over 80% of patients received a post-treatment test for H. pylori.

### Remicade [^112TSoCQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Remicade were assessed in three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies involving patients aged 18 and older with chronic, stable plaque psoriasis (Ps). These patients exhibited ≥ 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement and a minimum Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of 12. All were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Patients with guttate, pustular, or erythrodermic psoriasis were excluded. No concomitant anti-psoriatic therapies were permitted during the study, except for low-potency topical corticosteroids on the face and groin after Week 10.

- **Study I (EXPRESS)**: This study evaluated 378 patients who received either placebo or Remicade at a dose of 5 mg/kg at Weeks 0, 2, and 6 (induction therapy), followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. At Week 24, the placebo group switched to Remicade induction therapy (5 mg/kg), followed by maintenance therapy every 8 weeks. Patients initially randomized to Remicade continued to receive 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through Week 46. Among all treatment groups, the median baseline PASI score was 21, and the baseline Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) score ranged from moderate (52% of patients) to marked (36%) to severe (2%). Additionally, 75% of patients had a BSA > 20%. Seventy-one percent had previously received systemic therapy, and 82% had received phototherapy.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^114oVcxn]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Overall, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are irreplaceable drugs in the management of acid-related diseases. However, PPI treatment, like any form of drug therapy, is not without the risk of adverse effects. The overall benefits of therapy and improvement in quality of life significantly outweigh potential risks in most patients, but those without a clear clinical indication are only exposed to the risks of PPI prescription. Adhering to evidence-based guidelines represents the only rational approach to effective and safe PPI therapy.

### First- and second-line eradication with modified sequential therapy and modified levofloxacin-amoxicillin-based triple therapy [^115PCx8Z]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

**What the new findings are**: A modified 10-day sequential therapy, consisting of 3-day dual and 7-day triple therapy with increased proton pump inhibitor dose and antibiotic frequency (thrice instead of twice daily), achieved an eradication rate greater than 90% only at per protocol analysis (93.4%) but not at intention-to-treat analysis (85.9%). An intensified levofloxacin-amoxicillin 8-day regimen achieved disappointingly low eradication rates as a second-line therapy, suggesting that new levofloxacin-free therapy regimens are urged in Italy.

### Systemic pharmacological treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis: A network meta-analysis [^113u2TXo]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is an immune-mediated disease for which some people have a genetic predisposition. The condition manifests in inflammatory effects on the skin, joints, or both, and it has a major impact on the quality of life. Although there is currently no cure for psoriasis, various treatment strategies allow sustained control of disease signs and symptoms. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have compared the efficacy of different systemic treatments in psoriasis against placebo. However, the relative benefit of these treatments remains unclear due to the limited number of trials comparing them directly head to head, which is why we chose to conduct a network meta-analysis.

- **Objectives**: To compare the efficacy and safety of the following treatments for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and to provide a ranking of these treatments according to their efficacy and safety.
	- **Conventional systemic agents**: acitretin, ciclosporin, fumaric acid esters, methotrexate
	- **Small molecules**: apremilast, tofacitinib, ponesimod
	- **Anti-TNF alpha**: etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab
	- **Anti-IL12/23**: ustekinumab
	- **Anti-IL17**: secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab
	- **Anti-IL23**: guselkumab, tildrakizumab
	- **Other biologics**: alefacept, itolizumab

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases to December 2016: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) reports.

### Randomized study of two "rescue" therapies for Helicobacter pylori-infected patients after failure of standard triple therapies [^111Bsjns]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

A novel rifabutin-based therapy is able to cure Helicobacter pylori infection in most patients who have failed eradication after standard proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy. We compared this regimen with the quadruple therapy.

- **Methods**: A total of 135 patients were randomized into three groups who were treated for 10 days with pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., amoxycillin 1 g b.i.d., and rifabutin 150 mg o.d. (RAP50150 group), or 300 mg o.d. (RAP300 group), and pantoprazole 40 mg b.i.d., metronidazole 250 mg t.i.d., bismuth citrate 240 mg b.i.d., and tetracycline 500 mg q.i.d. (QT group). Before therapy, patients underwent endoscopy with biopsies for histology, culture, and antibiotic susceptibility tests. H. pylori eradication was assessed by the 13C-urea breath test.

- **Results**: On intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates (with 95% confidence intervals [CI]) were 66.6% (53–80%) in the RAP150 and QT groups, respectively, and 86.6% (76–96%) in the RAP300 group (p < 0.025). Most patients harboring metronidazole- and clarithromycin-resistant strains were eradicated at an equal rate by each of the three regimens. Side effects were observed in 9% and 11% of rifabutin-treated patients, and in 47% of those on quadruple therapy (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions**: In patients who failed standard eradicating treatments, a 10-day course of rifabutin with pantoprazole and amoxycillin is more effective and well tolerated than the quadruple therapy.

### Therapeutic regimens against infection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^111qMbUy]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

H. pylori treatment regimens have been tested in clinical trials that primarily involved patients with superficial non-atrophic gastritis. Until now, no data were available on the treatment efficacy of the commonly used eradication regimens without the concomitant use of PPI treatment. The real-life longitudinal observational study demonstrated that modified ABT and SPBT eradication regimens, without associating PPIs, are well tolerated and achieve successful infection cure in about 90% of patients with corpus atrophic gastritis. Notably, the eradication rates of the modified treatment regimens without PPIs in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis were not inferior to the commonly used regimens with PPIs in patients with H. pylori-positive superficial non-atrophic gastritis. Consequently, eradication regimens against H. pylori infection in corpus atrophic gastritis, avoiding PPIs, are feasible and effective, exceeding the 'borderline acceptable' eradication rates in clinical practice, which range from 85% to 89%.

PPIs are generally considered essential for enhancing the bioavailability and effectiveness of antibiotics in the eradication treatment of H. pylori. The benefits related to increased intragastric pH are deemed even higher with double, compared to single, doses daily of classic amoxicillin- plus clarithromycin- or metronidazole-based triple therapies. Conversely, the 'supporter' role of PPIs is not well established in quadruple treatments. A recent study based on the 'European Registry on Helicobacter pylori management' showed further insights into this area.

### High dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy for the treatment of infection: A systematic review with meta-analysis [^111Z73FX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori resistance to amoxicillin remains rare in many regions. Proton pump inhibitor-amoxicillin-containing high dose dual therapy (HDDT) has been proposed to treat H. pylori infection. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of PPI-amoxicillin HDDT for treatment of H. pylori infection in comparison with other regimens.

- **Methods**: Databases, including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials, were searched to find relevant publications. Randomized controlled trials comparing HDDT with control regimens for H. pylori eradication in adult patients were included. The primary outcome was eradication rate by intention-to-treat analysis. Adverse events were analyzed as the second outcome.

- **Results**: A total of 15 trials with 3,818 patients qualified for inclusion. The eradication rate of HDDT was neither significantly inferior nor superior to the recommended regimens such as triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy, and non-bismuth quadruple therapy [relative risk (RR): 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.96–1.05, p = 0.870]. This finding was robust through subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses. Trial sequential analysis showed that HDDT was equivalent to control regimens, and further similar trials were unlikely to alter the conclusions of this analysis. The frequency of adverse events was significantly lower in the HDDT group (RR: 0.48, 95% CI: 0.37–0.64, p < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: HDDT was equivalent to recommended first-line or rescue regimens with fewer adverse effects. The evidence from this meta-analysis supports the use of HDDT.

### Effective and safe proton pump inhibitor therapy in acid-related diseases - A position paper addressing benefits and potential harms of acid suppression [^113xcsf1]. BMC Medicine (2016). High credibility.

Despite proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) carrying, like any other class of drugs, some risks, they should not be denied to patients who are likely to benefit from them merely because of concerns about putative adverse effects. There is generally some equivalence between the acceptable burden of adverse effects and the severity of the illness being treated. However, patients with acid-related diseases are often otherwise "healthy" subjects, who take drugs for a given condition. What level of undesirable effects would be acceptable for them, and who will bear the cost of treating any ensuing iatrogenic disease? A number of simple and potentially effective preventive measures should be recommended for some, if not all, safety concerns to minimize them.

First of all, PPI therapy should be evidence-based. Decisions on whether or not to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be sound, and PPIs should only be prescribed when there is an appropriate clinical indication. Clinical guidelines can certainly help. In this position paper, we have reviewed the available guidelines, together with the systematic reviews and meta-analyses used to generate them, and synthesized the knowledge in a number of statements, i.e. summaries of the evidence.

- **Guidelines and clinical judgment**: Guidelines rely on both evidence and expert opinion; they are neither infallible nor a substitute for clinical judgment. However, they go beyond systematic reviews to recommend what should and should not be done in specific clinical circumstances.

### Treatments for psoriasis and the risk of malignancy [^116tvMeP]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

There are multiple therapeutic options for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. The process of choosing among potential treatment options requires both the physician and the patient to weigh the benefits of individual modalities against their potential risks. Traditional systemic therapies for psoriasis, including methotrexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CsA), have a well-documented array of toxicities, particularly end-organ toxicities. Over the past several years, the use of biologic therapies for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis has been a major clinical and research focus. With the advent of these novel immunosuppressive therapies, one of the central safety issues surrounding these agents is their potential to increase the risk of malignancy.

- **Objective**: Our objective was to review the risk of malignancy associated with therapies for moderate to severe psoriasis, including phototherapy, traditional systemic therapies, and biologic therapies. We reviewed the existing body of literature in order to define the known incidence of malignancy associated with psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA), narrowband and broadband ultraviolet B (UVB), MTX, CsA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and biologic therapies, including alefacept, efalizumab, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and ustekinumab.

- **Results**: PUVA, when given long term, is associated with increased risks of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma. Reviews of studies on UVB, both narrowband and broadband, do not indicate any increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer or melanoma.

### Therapeutic regimens against infection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: A real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^117HioGg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of eradication regimens in Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection is commonly reported alongside proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). However, in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis, characterized by impaired acid secretion, the necessity of PPI treatment is questionable.

- **Objectives**: The study aimed to assess, within clinical practice, the tolerability and eradication rate of modified eradication regimens without PPI as first-line treatment in patients with histologically Hp-positive corpus atrophic gastritis.

- **Design**: Real-life longitudinal observational study.

- **Methods**: Overall, 76 patients (77.6% females, age 58.5 [26–88] years) with histologically Hp-positive corpus atrophic gastritis were consecutively diagnosed (2001–2022). First-line eradication treatment was prescribed without PPIs: concomitant or sequential amoxicillin-based therapy (ABT) until 2016 (n = 30), then single-pill bismuth treatment (SPBT; n = 46). Treatment adherence and adverse events were clinically evaluated, and treatment efficacy was assessed by histopathology (updated Sydney system) at 6 ± 3 months after treatment.

- **Results**: Only mild adverse events not requiring medical treatment were observed in four patients treated with SPBT without PPIs (vomiting, self-limiting diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort) and in two treated with ABT without PPIs (vomiting and abdominal discomfort). Overall, 71/76 (93.4%) corpus atrophic gastritis patients completed the treatment: 43/46 (93.5%) SPBT without PPIs and 28/30 (93.3%) ABT without PPIs. Successful cure of Hp was observed in 64/71 patients, resulting in an overall eradication rate of 90.1%.

### Famotidine versus omeprazole, in combination with amoxycillin and tinidazole, for eradication of Helicobacter pylori infection [^1118T5yu]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

Eradication regimens combining two antibiotics with a proton pump inhibitor have been studied intensively. In contrast, only a few studies have focused on the possible role of H2-receptor antagonists in eradication therapy. The mechanism involved in the synergy between antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors is still controversial.

- **Objectives**: To compare the results of two triple-therapy regimens, different only in the antisecretory drugs used, in patients with Helicobacter pylori infection, and to assess the impact of primary resistance to metronidazole on treatment outcome.

- **Methods**: A total of 120 patients with peptic ulcer and non-ulcer dyspepsia were randomly assigned to a 2-week course of either famotidine 40 mg twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a day, and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (FAT group; n = 60); or omeprazole 20 mg twice a day, amoxycillin 1 g twice a day, and tinidazole 500 mg twice a day (OAT group; n = 60). Upper endoscopy was performed prior to treatment and at least 4 weeks after completion of treatment and discontinuation of the antisecretory therapy. H. pylori status was assessed by a biopsy urease test, histology, and culture.

- **Results**: In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication of H. pylori was achieved in 48 of the 60 patients (80%; 95% confidence interval: 70–90%) in the FAT group, compared to 50 of the 60 patients (83.3%; 95% confidence interval: 74–93%) in the OAT group. In the per protocol analysis, eradication therapy was achieved in 48 out of 53 patients (90.6%; 95% confidence interval: 83–98%) treated with FAT and 50 out of…

### Highlights of the updated Dutch evidence- and consensus-based guideline on psoriasis 2017 [^116ASsCd]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Treatment decisions in psoriasis: The majority of patients with psoriasis have mild disease in which topical therapy is sufficient to suppress the lesions. If necessary, different forms of phototherapy and/or conventional systemic therapy are considered, with or without topical agents. With the arrival of biologics, treatment options have increased and the effects of treatments have improved drastically.

It can be challenging to choose a suitable therapy for an individual patient. However, we expect that if the treatment is in line with patients' expectations, preferences, and lifestyle, adherence to the treatment and increased treatment satisfaction are more likely. We recommend that treatment decisions should therefore be made by patients and physicians together ('shared decision making'). In our opinion, it is important that all agents remain equally accessible and available. A preferred policy for the rigid application of one drug is undesirable.

### Cimzia [^116EiB3Y]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Study PS-3 randomized 559 subjects to receive a placebo, CIMZIA 200 mg every other week (following a loading dose of CIMZIA 400 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4), CIMZIA 400 mg every other week up to Week 16, or a biologic comparator (up to Week 12). Study PS-3 assessed the proportion of patients who achieved a PASI 75 at Week 12 as the primary endpoint. Other evaluated outcomes were the PGA of "clear" or "almost clear" at Week 16, PASI 75 at Week 16, PASI 90 at Week 16, and maintenance of efficacy to Week 48.

Of the 850 subjects randomized to receive a placebo or CIMZIA in these placebo-controlled studies, 29% of patients were naïve to prior systemic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Additionally, 47% had received prior phototherapy or chemophototherapy, and 30% had received prior biologic therapy for the treatment of psoriasis. Of the 850 subjects, 14% had received at least one TNF alpha agent and 16% had received an anti-IL agent. Eighteen percent of subjects reported a history of psoriatic arthritis at baseline.

Across all studies and treatment groups, the mean PASI score at baseline was 20, ranging from 12 to 69. The baseline PGA score ranged from moderate (70%) to severe (30%). Mean baseline BSA was 25%, with a range from 10% to 96%. Subjects were predominantly men (64%) and White (94%), with a mean age of 46 years.

- **Clinical response**: Examination of age, gender, prior use of biologics, and prior use of systemic therapies did not identify a difference in response to CIMZIA among these subgroups.

### Neoral [^1112KPGD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The initial dose of Neoral for treating psoriasis should be 2.5 mg/kg/day. Neoral should be administered twice daily as a divided oral dose of 1.25 mg/kg per dose. Patients should remain on this dose for at least 4 weeks, unless adverse events occur. If significant clinical improvement has not been observed by that time, the dosage should be increased at 2-week intervals. Based on patient response, dose increases of approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day should be made up to a maximum of 4.0 mg/kg/day.

Dose decreases of 25% to 50% should be implemented at any time to manage adverse events, such as hypertension, elevations in serum creatinine (≥ 25% above the patient's pretreatment level), or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. If dose reduction is not effective in addressing abnormalities, or if the adverse event or abnormality is severe, Neoral should be discontinued.

Patients typically show some improvement in the clinical manifestations of psoriasis within 2 weeks. Achieving satisfactory control and stabilization of the disease may require 12 to 16 weeks. Results from a dose-titration clinical trial with Neoral indicate that an improvement of psoriasis by 75% or more (based on PASI) was observed in 51% of patients after 8 weeks and in 79% of patients after 16 weeks. Treatment should be discontinued if a satisfactory response cannot be achieved after 6 weeks at 4 mg/kg/day or at the patient's maximum tolerated dose. Once a patient is adequately controlled and appears stable, the dose of Neoral should be lowered, and the patient treated with the lo

### A randomized study comparing levofloxacin, omeprazole, nitazoxanide, and doxycycline versus triple therapy for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori [^116w8KpX]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Resistance to standard Helicobacter pylori (HP) treatment regimens has led to unsatisfactory cure rates in HP-infected patients. This study was designed to evaluate a novel four-drug regimen (three antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor) for eradication of HP infection in treatment-naive patients.

- **Methods**: Patients with a diagnosis of HP gastritis or peptic ulcer disease, confirmed using endoscopy and stool antigen testing, were eligible for inclusion. All patients underwent a washout period of 6 weeks from any prior antibiotic or PPI usage. They were then randomized to either levofloxacin, omeprazole, nitazoxanide, and doxycycline (LOAD) therapy for 7 days (LOAD-7) or 10 days (LOAD-10), which included specific dosages of each medication, or to lansoprozole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (LAC) therapy for 10 days, with specified dosages. HP eradication was confirmed by stool antigen testing at least 4 weeks after cessation of therapy.

- **Results**: Intention-to-treat analysis revealed significant differences (P < 0.05) in the respective eradication rates of the LOAD therapies: 88.9% (80/90) for LOAD-10, 90% (81/90) for LOAD-7, and 89.4% (161/180) for combined LOAD, compared to 73.3% (66/90) for those receiving LAC. There were no differences in adverse effects between the groups.

- **Conclusions**: This open-label, prospective trial demonstrates that the LOAD therapies offer a higher eradication rate compared to the LAC protocol for the eradication of Helicobacter pylori.

### Therapeutic regimens against infection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: A real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^112hZC8v]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

We are aware of some limits of the study:

- **Long study duration**: The 21-year duration of this longitudinal observational study may represent a possible source of bias. However, the clinical management protocols and diagnostic methods during this period remained consistent. All patients were diagnosed based on histological assessment of gastric biopsies obtained during gastroscopy, following the updated Sydney system. The efficacy of eradication treatment was also assessed by histology using the same standards. Since 2015, gastroscopes equipped with narrow-band imaging have been available, potentially increasing the diagnostic reliability of gastritis and H. pylori infection, although eradication rates did not differ over the years.

- **First-line treatment protocol changes**: The availability of SPBT in 2016 in Italy made ABT less attractive due to the easier prescription, use, and adherence associated with the single pill treatment.

- **Study design limitations**: This study was not designed as a clinical trial to assess treatment efficacy; nevertheless, it reflects treatment efficacy of regimens derived from real-life clinical practice.

- **Follow-up challenges**: A significant number of patients (48%) were lost at follow-up or were unwilling to undergo a second gastroscopy for assessment of treatment efficacy. This was a necessary criterion for inclusion in the study because, in corpus atrophic gastritis, non-invasive tests for H. pylori may not be reliable due to increased intragastric pH, which is crucial in ascertaining the cure of the infection.

If the patient experiences flares during maintenance treatment, indicated by psoriasis developing on more than 5% of the originally involved body areas, the maintenance treatment schedule may be adjusted to the preceding maintenance or clearing schedule. The patient should remain on this schedule until reaching 95% clearance. If the original maintenance schedule fails to control psoriasis, it may be adjusted to a more frequent regimen.

If a flare occurs less than six weeks after the last treatment, utilize 25% of the maximum exposure received during the clearing phase, and then proceed with the clearing schedule previously followed for the patient. At 95% clearing, continue with regular maintenance until determining the optimum maintenance schedule for the patient. If more than six weeks have elapsed since the last treatment, treat the patient as if beginning therapy in terms of exposure dosages, as their threshold for erythema may have decreased.

Treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) improves clinical outcomes in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding. However, the optimal dose and route of administration of PPIs remain controversial.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of different regimens of PPIs in the management of acute peptic ulcer bleeding using evidence from direct comparison randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The study specifically intended to assess the differential effect of the dose and route of administration of PPIs on mortality, rebleeding, surgical intervention, further endoscopic haemostatic treatment (EHT), length of hospital stay, transfusion requirements, and adverse events.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 3), MEDLINE, and EMBASE (from inception to September 2010) as well as proceedings of major gastroenterology meetings (January 2000 to September 2010), without language restrictions. Original investigators were contacted to request missing data.

- **Selection criteria**: RCTs that compared at least two different regimens of the same or a different PPI in patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding, diagnosed endoscopically.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We synthesized data using the Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method and performed multivariate meta-regression with random permutations based on Monte Carlo simulation. We measured heterogeneity with the I² statistic and Cochrane Q test and assessed publication bias with funnel plots and Egger's test.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: A rapid update [^1148RSoM]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, specifically concerning the initiation of biologic therapy, the British Association of Dermatologists (BAD) 2020 guidelines recommend initiating biologic therapy in patients needing systemic treatment if methotrexate and cyclosporin have failed, are not tolerated, or are contraindicated. This is particularly relevant when the disease significantly impacts physical, psychological, or social functioning, such as a Dermatology Life Quality Index or Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index greater than 10, or the presence of clinically relevant depressive or anxiety symptoms. Additionally, one or more of the following disease severity criteria should apply:

- **Extensive psoriasis**: Defined as body surface area greater than 10% or a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index of 10 or more.

- **Severe psoriasis at localized sites**: Associated with significant functional impairment and/or high levels of distress, such as nail disease or involvement of high-impact and difficult-to-treat sites, including the face, scalp, palms, soles, flexures, and genitals.

### Therapeutic regimens against infection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^116utwVv]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

To better understand the performance, specifically the non-inferiority of modified treatment regimens without proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), we compared the eradication rates in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis to those of 49 patients with H. pylori-positive superficial non-atrophic gastritis treated with the same treatment regimens: SPBT (n = 40) and ABT (n = 9), but with PPIs.

As detailed in Table 3, all 40 patients with H. pylori-positive superficial non-atrophic gastritis treated with the modified SPBT with PPI completed the treatment, and 33 of them achieved the cure of infection. Thus, the eradication rate was 82.5% (95% CI 56.8%–115.9%). Of the nine patients with H. pylori-positive superficial non-atrophic gastritis treated with ABT with PPIs, eight completed the treatment and six of them were successfully cured of the infection, resulting in an eradication rate of 75% (95% CI 27.5%–163.2%).

The eradication rate of SPBT without PPI was non-inferior but even higher compared to that of SPBT with PPI (97.7% vs 82.5%, p = 0.02); also, the eradication rate of ABT without PPIs was non-inferior to that with PPIs (78.6% vs 75%, p = 0.83). No difference in age between treatment groups was observed.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: Section 4. Guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^116FWUkM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a common, chronic, inflammatory, multisystem disease with predominantly skin and joint manifestations affecting approximately 2% of the population. In this fourth of six sections of the guidelines of care for psoriasis, we discuss the use of traditional systemic medications for the treatment of patients with psoriasis. Treatment should be tailored to meet individual patients' needs.

We discuss in detail the efficacy and safety, and offer recommendations for the use of the three most commonly used, and approved, traditional systemic agents: methotrexate, cyclosporine, and acitretin. Additionally, we briefly discuss the available data for the use of azathioprine, fumaric acid esters, hydroxyurea, leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus, and 6-thioguanine in psoriasis.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^115VgCy6]. Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are among the most commonly used medications in the world. Developed for the treatment and prevention of acid-mediated upper gastrointestinal conditions, these agents are increasingly used for indications where their benefits are less certain. PPI overprescription imposes an economic cost and contributes to polypharmacy. Additionally, PPI use has been increasingly linked to a number of adverse events (PPI-associated adverse events [PAAEs]). Therefore, de-prescribing of PPIs is an important strategy to lower pill burden while reducing real costs and theoretical risks. This clinical update aims to provide best practice advice (BPA) statements about how to approach PPI de-prescribing in ambulatory patients.

Our guiding principle was that, although PPIs are generally safe, patients should not use any medication when there is not a reasonable expectation of benefit based on scientific evidence or prior treatment response. Prescribers are responsible for determining whether PPI use is absolutely or conditionally indicated and, when uncertainty exists, to incorporate patient perspectives into PPI decision making. We collaboratively outlined a high-level "process map" of the conceptual approach to de-prescribing PPIs in a clinical setting.

- **Key domains**: We identified the following three key domains that required BPA guidance:
	- Documentation of PPI indication
	- Identifying suitable candidates for consideration of de-prescribing
	- Optimizing successful de-prescribing

Co-authors drafted one or more potential BPAs, supported by lite.

### Non-antibiotic therapies for Helicobacter pylori infection [^111Ywfqj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Despite years of experience with Helicobacter pylori treatment, the ideal regimen for treating the infection has not been found. The most effective eradication treatment is the combination of a proton pump inhibitor with antibiotics, but 10–20% of patients fail to achieve eradication of the infection. Antibiotic resistance is a major factor affecting the outcome of treatment. Non-antibiotic therapies, including phytomedicines, probiotics, and antioxidants, have been increasingly investigated as potential alternatives for the treatment of H. pylori. In this article, we review the non-antibiotic therapies for H. pylori infection.

### AGA clinical practice update on de-prescribing of proton pump inhibitors: Expert review [^117AFx4X]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for deprescribing proton pump inhibitors, more specifically with respect to indications for discontinuation, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend deciding on discontinuing PPIs solely based on the lack of an indication for PPI therapy and not because of concern for PPI-associated adverse events. Do not use the presence of a PPI-associated adverse event, history of a PPI-associated adverse event in a PPI user, or the presence of underlying risk factors for the development of a PPI-associated adverse event as independent indications for PPI withdrawal.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^113ib2dw]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori causes several gastroduodenal diseases. Various antibiotic regimens are available that eradicate H. pylori in 80 to 90% of patients, but no regimen cures all patients. Dual therapy is now obsolete. Triple therapy, which includes two antibiotics and either a proton pump inhibitor or bismuth, is the regimen of choice. Metronidazole and clarithromycin are the two key antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance to these drugs is becoming more problematic and should be considered when choosing a regimen, as resistance is usually induced after treatment failure.

- **Quadruple therapy**: Used as a salvage regimen in failed cases, but it is the most complicated regimen. Several new agents are being studied, including a single capsule that contains bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline.

### Ppi use in the OTC era: who to treat, with what, and for how long [^113NY6YW]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been shown to be the most effective class of medication to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The availability of over-the-counter (OTC) and generic PPIs provides consumers with options other than antacids and histamine 2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) for self-medication of heartburn and acid regurgitation.

Medical concerns arising from these developments include the management of patients in whom symptoms persist despite OTC PPI use, proper administration of PPIs, and potential masking of more serious pathologies, such as malignancy. Studies indicate that different forms of PPI administration, such as on-demand and intermittent therapy, are likely to become more acceptable.

Prospective clinical trials show the efficacy of these noncontinuous PPI administration strategies and highlight the potential for cost reduction in GERD management. Newer agents, such as reversible acid pump antagonists, will compete for selected markets in the future, further expanding the role of alternative dosing regimens. Ultimately, therapy should be tailored to individual patients because no single strategy will be optimal for the entire population with GERD symptoms.

### Therapeutic regimens against infection without proton pump inhibitors in patients with corpus atrophic gastritis: a real-life single-centre longitudinal observational study [^116CwjVQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

The efficacy of eradication regimens in Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection is commonly reported with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In patients with corpus atrophic gastritis, characterized by impaired acid secretion, PPI treatment is questionable.

- **Objectives**: The study aimed to assess in clinical practice the tolerability and eradication rate of modified eradication regimens without PPI as first-line treatment in patients with histologically Hp-positive corpus atrophic gastritis.

- **Design**: Real-life longitudinal observational study.

- **Methods**: Overall, 76 patients (77.6% females, age 58.5 (26–88) years) with histologically Hp-positive corpus atrophic gastritis were consecutively diagnosed (2001–2022). First-line eradication treatment was prescribed without PPIs: concomitant or sequential amoxicillin-based therapy (ABT) until 2016 (n = 30), then single-pill bismuth treatment (SPBT; n = 46). Treatment adherence and adverse events were clinically evaluated, and treatment efficacy was assessed by histopathology (updated Sydney system) at 6 ± 3 months after treatment.

- **Results**: Only mild adverse events not requiring medical treatment were observed in four patients treated with SPBT without PPIs (vomiting, self-limiting diarrhea, nausea, abdominal discomfort) and in two treated with ABT without PPIs (vomiting and abdominal discomfort). Overall, 71/76 (93.4%) corpus atrophic gastritis patients completed the treatment: 43/46 (93.5%) SPBT without PPIs and 28/30 (93.3%) ABT without PPIs. Successful cure of Hp was observed in 64/71 patients, achieving an overall eradication rate.

Many systemic agents are used in the treatment of psoriasis. They provide good control of psoriasis in the majority of patients and have improved their life quality indices. Frequently, combination therapy is utilized to synergize the efficacy of these medications. Many dermatologists are hesitant to prescribe systemic agents because of their adverse effects. However, such potential toxicities arising from these medications can largely be avoided if proper patient selection and close monitoring are performed.

### Which antipsoriatic drug has the fastest onset of action? Systematic review on the rapidity of the onset of action [^1125jQrC]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

The time necessary for a treatment to become effective is crucial for patients and physicians but has been largely neglected in the reporting and comparison of clinical trials in dermatology. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the time until the onset of action (TOA) of systemic agents approved for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. The primary outcome is the TOA, defined as the weighted mean time until 25% of the patients achieved a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) 75 response.

Among the biologics, infliximab has the shortest TOA (3.5 weeks), followed by ustekinumab (high dose 4.6 weeks/low dose 5.1 weeks, not weight adapted), adalimumab (4.6 weeks), etanercept (high dose 6.6 weeks/low dose 9.5 weeks), and alefacept (high dose 15.4 weeks; low dose: no data). Among the conventional treatments, good data are available for cyclosporine A (CsA; TOA: 6.0 weeks) and limited data for methotrexate (MTX; TOA: high dose 3.2 weeks/low dose 9.9 weeks). No data are available for fumaric acid esters and retinoids.

This systematic review provides clinically relevant information on the onset of action of antipsoriatic agents, although the data currently available allow only a limited assessment. Psoriasis trials should consider including TOA as an additional outcome measure.

- **Safety and tolerability measures**: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 4 out of 9 (44.4%) patients in the 20 mg group and by 6 out of 10 (60.0%) patients in the 40 mg group. Drug-related TEAEs were reported by 1 out of 9 (11.1%) patients in the 20 mg group and by 1 out of 10 (10.0%) patients in the 40 mg group. The drug-related TEAEs reported were psoriasis in the 20 mg group and gastric mucosal lesion in the 40 mg group. All TEAEs reported were mild or moderate in intensity; no severe TEAEs or serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in either group during the study. There was no obvious increase in the incidence of TEAEs by preferred term in either group during the treatment period. One patient in the 40 mg group experienced four TEAEs (pyrexia, fall, and two instances of muscular weakness), which were unrelated to the study drug. These TEAEs resulted in the patient being discontinued from the study.

There were no clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory test values, vital signs, or ECG findings observed during the study. Increases were observed in the mean levels of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I, and pepsinogen II in both groups after the start of treatment. The increase in serum gastrin levels was greater in the 40 mg group throughout the study, except at week 4. The greatest increases in the levels of pepsinogen I and II were observed at week 2 in both groups.

### British Association of Dermatologists guidelines for biologic therapy for psoriasis 2020: a rapid update [^114wAVDG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for psoriasis, especially concerning the initiation of biologic therapy, the BAD 2020 guidelines recommend considering biologic therapy earlier in the treatment pathway. This consideration should be given if methotrexate has failed, is not tolerated, or is contraindicated for patients with psoriasis who meet the disease severity criteria and have active psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis that is persistent. Persistent psoriasis is defined as relapsing rapidly, with a > 50% baseline disease severity within 3 months of completing any treatment, off a therapy that cannot be continued long-term, such as NB-UVB and cyclosporin.
