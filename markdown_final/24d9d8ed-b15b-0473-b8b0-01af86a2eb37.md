## Question

What is the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the disease phenotype. Then, I should verify indications for definitive therapy versus observation. Next, I will examine surgical options, techniques, and outcomes. After that, I need to review medical management for patients who are not surgical candidates. Finally, I should consider special populations, monitoring, and synthesize a practical decision framework with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic foundation, because treatment hinges on getting the diagnosis right. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a biochemical diagnosis of hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal or elevated PTH, after excluding secondary causes and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and I should double-check that both total calcium corrected for albumin and ionized calcium are used to confirm hypercalcemia when needed [^99ad83de] [^63463a50]. I need to ensure I classify the phenotype correctly into symptomatic hypercalcemic, asymptomatic hypercalcemic, or normocalcemic PHPT, since this classification influences management decisions and counseling about progression risk [^687d7cf2] [^820553dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapy before establishing baseline organ involvement. I should confirm that all patients undergo DXA including distal one-third radius, renal imaging for stones or nephrocalcinosis, 24-hour urine calcium, and assessment of renal function, because these findings shape surgical indications and monitoring plans [^f63a169d] [^5ebc80cf]. I need to check vitamin D status and replete if low, since deficiency can worsen secondary hyperparathyroidism and confound interpretation, and I should target 25-hydroxyvitamin D above 30 ng/mL while avoiding supraphysiologic levels [^0ad657b7] [^c5728af7].

> Next, I should review who actually benefits from treatment, because overtreatment exposes patients to unnecessary risk. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive cure and is indicated for all symptomatic patients, and I should confirm that symptoms include nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, osteoporosis or fragility fracture, impaired renal function, or serum calcium more than 1.0 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, as well as age 50 years or younger regardless of symptoms [^109657c8] [^38894654] [^14c13acc] [^8aa7fdd8] [^b62daab9]. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for asymptomatic patients; contemporary guidelines increasingly support surgery in most asymptomatic patients with acceptable surgical risk, given improvements in quality of life and skeletal outcomes, though I should acknowledge that some data are observational and that shared decision-making is essential [^374f64ea] [^f63a169d].

> I will now examine surgical options and expected outcomes, and I need to ensure I distinguish focused from bilateral approaches. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy guided by preoperative localization and intraoperative PTH monitoring achieves cure rates of 97–99% in selected patients with single-gland disease, with lower rates of hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury compared with bilateral exploration, though bilateral exploration remains the gold standard when localization is negative or multigland disease is suspected [^358860f2] [^dee7aae2] [^02ebc9f4]. Let me verify the role of imaging; sestamibi and high-resolution neck ultrasound are first-line for localization, but imaging is not diagnostic and should be used to plan surgery rather than to establish the diagnosis [^6df1f788] [^fbb5e4c5].

> But wait, what if the patient is not a surgical candidate or declines surgery. I should confirm that medical therapy is reserved for such scenarios and is not a substitute for surgery when indications are present. Cinacalcet is the agent of choice to lower serum calcium and PTH, but it does not improve bone mineral density, so I need to pair it with antiresorptive therapy when bone disease is present, and I should monitor for hypocalcemia and gastrointestinal side effects [^c5728af7] [^5ba4a963]. Bisphosphonates or denosumab increase BMD at the spine and hip, with denosumab showing robust gains in a randomized trial, and combination therapy with cinacalcet plus an antiresorptive can address both hypercalcemia and osteoporosis when needed, albeit with limited high-quality comparative data [^c477dc93] [^5ba4a963]. I should double-check that estrogen therapy may increase BMD but has inconsistent effects on calcium and is not first-line for skeletal protection in PHPT [^4b1ec3e1].

> Let me consider special populations, because management nuances matter. In normocalcemic PHPT, I should confirm the diagnosis carefully and exclude secondary causes; surgery can normalize PTH and improve BMD in selected patients, but current guidelines find insufficient evidence to recommend routine surgery, so decisions should be individualized based on bone, renal, and quality-of-life considerations [^820553dd] [^ade371ef] [^87825e41]. In pregnancy, I need to ensure timely surgery, ideally in the second trimester, to mitigate maternal and fetal risks from hypercalcemia, and minimally invasive approaches can be considered when feasible [^17701ce8]. For MEN1, I should confirm that subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is recommended, and that minimally invasive strategies are generally not appropriate due to multigland disease [^c04e2509].

> Next, I should review monitoring for patients managed nonoperatively, and I need to ensure intervals are evidence-based. Annual assessment of serum calcium, renal function, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 24-hour urine calcium, and DXA every 1–2 years is reasonable, with closer follow-up if progression is suspected, and I should counsel patients to maintain adequate hydration and avoid thiazides, lithium, and high-dose calcium supplements when not indicated [^5599ec64] [^5ebc80cf]. Hold on, I should verify that progression can be silent; up to a quarter of asymptomatic patients may show biochemical or skeletal progression over time, which is why structured surveillance is essential [^2a8f5c95].

> I should double-check the cost-effectiveness argument, because it often influences shared decision-making. Multiple analyses indicate that parathyroidectomy is more effective and less costly than long-term observation or pharmacologic therapy in patients with a reasonable life expectancy, reinforcing a lower threshold for surgery when surgical risk is acceptable [^f1bffca5] [^7c517d3d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the Cochrane review showed clear BMD benefits at 1–2 years, but I need to correct that; the RCT synthesis found very low certainty for BMD differences at 1–2 years, highlighting the limitation of short follow-up and the need for longer-term trials, even though observational and meta-analytic data consistently show durable BMD gains after surgery [^9b6277be] [^502c5709].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework, and I should ensure it aligns with guidelines. If the patient is symptomatic or meets any surgical criterion, I should refer to an experienced endocrine surgeon for parathyroidectomy, using localization and ioPTH to guide a focused approach when appropriate; if the patient is asymptomatic and does not meet criteria, I can offer observation with structured monitoring or discuss elective surgery given potential quality-of-life and skeletal benefits; if the patient is not a surgical candidate, I should initiate cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and add an antiresorptive for low BMD, reassessing periodically for evolving indications or surgical candidacy [^f63a169d] [^374f64ea] [^5ba4a963]. I need to ensure that shared decision-making addresses trade-offs, including the high likelihood of cure with surgery versus the need for ongoing therapy and monitoring with medical management [^f63a169d].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan addresses modifiable contributors and follow-up logistics. Vitamin D repletion to at least 30 ng/mL, avoidance of dehydrating or hypercalcemia-promoting medications when possible, and coordination with experienced surgeons and endocrinologists improve outcomes, and I should arrange follow-up to document biochemical cure after surgery or to detect progression if managed medically, adjusting therapy accordingly [^0ad657b7] [^51e9ef6a] [^35a897e7]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent or recurrent disease is evaluated systematically, including confirmation of diagnosis, review of prior operative details, and assessment of vocal cord function before reoperation, ideally in high-volume centers [^d3b43c30] [^e42a7bbd].

Parathyroidectomy is the **definitive treatment** for primary hyperparathyroidism, with high cure rates and durable benefits [^9b6277be] [^358860f2]. Surgery is indicated for symptomatic patients, those with serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal, osteoporosis, fragility fracture, vertebral compression fracture, renal involvement (stones, nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, or eGFR < 60 mL/min), or age ≤ 50 years [^109657c8] [^38894654] [^14c13acc] [^b62daab9]. Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy with intraoperative PTH monitoring is preferred when localization is successful, achieving 97–99% cure with low complication rates [^358860f2] [^dee7aae2]. For patients who are not surgical candidates, medical therapy includes cinacalcet to lower calcium, bisphosphonates or denosumab to improve BMD, and vitamin D repletion to ≥ 30 ng/mL; observation with annual monitoring is reasonable for select asymptomatic patients who do not meet surgical criteria [^c5728af7] [^5ba4a963] [^0ad657b7] [^5599ec64]. Parathyroidectomy improves BMD, reduces fractures, and may improve quality of life, whereas medical therapy controls calcium and bone loss but does not cure the disease [^90483e54] [^c477dc93].

---

## Indications for treatment

Treatment decisions are guided by symptoms, biochemical severity, and evidence of end-organ involvement. The following are **established indications** for intervention:

| **Indication category** | **Specific indications** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic disease | - Nephrolithiasis <br/> - Nephrocalcinosis <br/> - Hypercalciuria (> 400 mg/24 h) <br/> - Impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min) <br/> - Osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) <br/> - Fragility fracture <br/> - Vertebral compression fracture <br/> - Serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal <br/> - Age ≤ 50 years [^109657c8] [^38894654] [^14c13acc] [^8aa7fdd8] [^b62daab9] |
| Asymptomatic disease | - Serum calcium > 1.0 mg/dL above normal <br/> - Osteoporosis or vertebral compression fracture <br/> - Reduced bone mineral density (T-score ≤ -2.5 at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, or distal one-third radius) <br/> - Hypercalciuria (> 400 mg/24 h) <br/> - Impaired renal function (eGFR < 60 mL/min) <br/> - Age ≤ 50 years [^109657c8] [^38894654] [^14c13acc] [^b62daab9] |

## Surgical management

### Parathyroidectomy

Parathyroidectomy is the **only definitive cure** for PHPT, with high success and low complication rates in experienced hands [^9b6277be] [^358860f2].

- **Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP)**: Preferred for single-gland disease with successful preoperative localization; intraoperative PTH monitoring confirms cure and guides extent of surgery [^dee7aae2] [^c9aa64cb].
- **Bilateral neck exploration (BNE)**: Standard for multigland disease, failed localization, or reoperative cases; remains a time-tested approach with excellent outcomes [^02ebc9f4] [^da9c4233].
- **Cure rates**: 97–99% for MIP and 98% for BNE in contemporary series [^358860f2] [^f63a169d].
- **Complications**: Low rates of hypocalcemia, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and infection; MIP has lower hypocalcemia and nerve injury rates than BNE [^358860f2].

---

### Preoperative localization

Imaging is used for localization, not diagnosis, and guides a focused surgical approach. Ultrasound and sestamibi are **first-line**, with 4D-CT or PET/CT reserved for reoperative or equivocal cases [^6df1f788] [^fbb5e4c5].

---

## Medical management

Medical therapy is indicated for patients who are not surgical candidates or decline surgery, and for those with **normocalcemic PHPT** without indications for surgery [^78864cf7] [^5599ec64].

- **Cinacalcet**: Lowers serum calcium and PTH; does not improve BMD; indicated for symptomatic hypercalcemia when surgery is not an option [^c5728af7] [^0ac52c41].
- **Bisphosphonates**: Improve BMD at lumbar spine and hip; do not lower calcium; consider alendronate or zoledronic acid [^5ba4a963] [^214d5a48].
- **Denosumab**: Increases BMD and lowers bone turnover; consider when bisphosphonates are contraindicated or ineffective [^c477dc93] [^5ba4a963].
- **Vitamin D**: Replete to ≥ 30 ng/mL to reduce PTH and improve BMD; monitor calcium during repletion [^0ad657b7] [^c5728af7].

---

## Observation

Observation is appropriate for select asymptomatic patients who do not meet surgical criteria, with **annual monitoring** of calcium, renal function, bone density, and clinical status [^5599ec64] [^5ebc80cf].

---

## Outcomes and benefits of treatment

Parathyroidectomy provides **durable normalization** of calcium and PTH, increases BMD by 8–12% at the lumbar spine and femoral neck, reduces fracture risk, and improves quality of life and neurocognitive symptoms [^90483e54] [^3c5664af]. Medical therapy controls calcium and improves BMD but does not cure the disease and requires ongoing treatment and monitoring [^c5728af7] [^c477dc93].

---

## Special considerations

- **Normocalcemic PHPT**: Manage similarly to hypercalcemic PHPT; surgery if bone or renal involvement is present, otherwise observe with close follow-up [^87825e41] [^5bb81a36].
- **Pregnancy**: Second-trimester surgery is preferred if symptomatic or calcium is significantly elevated [^notfound].
- **MEN1**: Subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is recommended [^c04e2509].

---

Parathyroidectomy is the **definitive treatment** for PHPT, with excellent outcomes; medical therapy is a reasonable alternative for those who cannot undergo surgery, and observation is appropriate for select asymptomatic patients.

### Who benefits from treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^e23c1131]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTx) is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), but is commonly underutilized. Most patients are medically observed, whereas approximately 30% of patients are treated operatively. PTx is a low-risk surgical procedure and the most cost-effective treatment option. An international consensus statement was published in 1990 to guide clinicians in the management of patients with PHPT, particularly those with asymptomatic disease. Most patients with PHPT and low perioperative risk benefit from surgical treatment, regardless of whether they meet consensus criteria, due to fracture risk reduction, health-related quality-of-life improvements, and prevention or mitigation of disease progression.

### What medical options should be considered for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^ab14eb79]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common, often asymptomatic, endocrine disorder characterized by hypercalcaemia in the face of a nonsuppressed parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. For those with symptomatic disease or who meet surgical criteria, parathyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. However, those patients who do not meet surgical criteria or who cannot undergo or refuse surgery must be managed medically. Medical management of PHPT involves continual assessment to determine who will benefit from surgical intervention, replacement of vitamin D, treatment of parathyroid bone disease and management of hypercalcaemia and renal stone disease.

### When would I use medical therapies for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism? [^2f5e8b0e]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi. The selection of a suitable therapy for each patient should be individualized.

### The landmark series: management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^bb8993a9]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Surgery is the only definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). The surgical management of PHPT has evolved over the past several decades in response to the continually growing body of evidence supporting its effectiveness in both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease. As imaging modalities for localization, operative approach, and intraoperative adjuncts, such as intraoperative parathyroid hormone testing, have been optimized, careful evaluation of the timing of parathyroidectomy in relationship to the disease's natural history has been pursued to limit the detrimental end-organ effects of untreated PHPT. Herein, we review select studies examining key aspects of PHPT management fundamental to the practicing surgical oncologist and endocrine surgeon caring for patients with PHPT.

### Medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop on the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism [^c5728af7]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The only available definitive therapy is parathyroidectomy, which is appropriate to consider in all patients. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on calcium and vitamin D supplementation and medical management for those patients with PHPT who cannot or do not want to undergo surgery.

Methods

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search was undertaken, and relevant articles published between 2008 and 2013 were reviewed in detail. The questions were addressed by the panel of experts, and consensus was established at the time of the workshop.

Conclusions

The recommended calcium intake in patients with PHPT should follow guidelines established for all individuals. It is not recommended to limit calcium intake in patients with PHPT who do not undergo surgery. Patients with low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D should be repleted with doses of vitamin D aiming to bring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) at a minimum, but a goal of ≥ 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) also is reasonable. Pharmacological approaches are available and should be reserved for those patients in whom it is desirable to lower the serum calcium, increase BMD, or both. For the control of hypercalcemia, cinacalcet is the treatment of choice. Cinacalcet reduces serum calcium concentrations to normal in many cases, but has only a modest effect on serum PTH levels. However, bone mineral density (BMD) does not change. To improve BMD, bisphosphonate therapy is recommended. The best evidence is for the use of alendronate, which improves BMD at the lumbar spine without altering the serum calcium concentration. To reduce the serum calcium and improve BMD, combination therapy with both agents is reasonable, but strong evidence for the efficacy of that approach is lacking.

### Nonsurgical management of mild primary hyperparathyroidism-a reasonable option [^54174790]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disorder which is often diagnosed incidentally and characterized in the majority of those affected by mild stable biochemical abnormalities and lack of symptoms. Nephrolithiasis and bone loss leading to an increased risk of fracture are generally accepted complications of PHPT. Some epidemiological studies report associations between PHPT and a wide range of common diseases, but these relationships may be confounded by the increased body weight observed in PHPT. Because there is a dearth of controlled clinical trial evidence in PHPT, optimal management is controversial. For individuals with mild stable PHPT, low fracture risk and no renal stones, observation without intervention is reasonable. Surgical treatment is clearly indicated for patients at risk of severe hypercalcaemia or with nephrolithiasis. For individuals with increased risk of fracture, antiresorptive therapies improve bone mineral density to a similar degree to surgical treatment. Calcimimetic agents may have a role in managing patients with symptomatic PHPT who cannot undergo, or fail, surgical treatment. There is a need for additional randomized clinical trials to inform management of PHPT.

### Cost-effectiveness of parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism [^f1bffca5]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Methods

The PubMed database was searched with the keywords "cost effectiveness" and "primary hyperparathyroidism". The results of all studies identified were reviewed to ensure that the cost-effectiveness data were reported using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, which are critical metrics for formal cost-effectiveness analysis.

Results

Six studies were identified that measured the cost-effectiveness of competing treatment strategies for PHPT with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Three studies were identified that compared surgical and medical treatment options for asymptomatic PHPT. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years. In these studies, the strategy of medical observation was less effective than surgery. Surgery was less costly and more effective than pharmacologic therapy. Minimally invasive surgery was a cost-effective alternative to traditional surgical approaches. Parathyroidectomy was cost-effective for asymptomatic patients with a predicted life expectancy of 5 years (outpatient parathyroidectomy) or 6.5 years (inpatient parathyroidectomy). For patients with a shorter life expectancy, observation was the optimal strategy. One study examined the cost-effectiveness of 3 strategies for the surgical treatment of symptomatic PHPT. A minimally invasive treatment strategy had the lowest rate of surgical complications (5.3%), and when compared with bilateral neck exploration, produced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $28,439 per complication avoided. Two studies examined the cost effectiveness of adjunctive preoperative imaging in patients with PHPT. The results of both analyses favored preoperative imaging over immediate bilateral neck exploration.

Conclusions

Parathyroidectomy has superior outcomes to observation, but it is more costly. Pharmacologic treatment strategies are quite costly, and offer limited benefits. The contemporary strategy of offering minimally invasive procedures with preoperative localization appears to be cost-effective.

### Indications for surgical management of hyperparathyroidism: a review [^fad39cfe]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is a common clinical entity, with approximately 100 000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States. Most patients with pHPT have a relatively mild form of the disease and present with few if any overt signs or symptoms. This has led to a dilemma regarding which patients should be considered for parathyroid surgery. In this article, we review the established literature on the indications for surgery in asymptomatic pHPT and discuss the most recent consensus conference guidelines.

Observations

The reviewed literature suggests that there were improved outcomes among patients with asymptomatic pHPT who underwent curative surgery.

Conclusions and Relevance

Most patients with pHPT should be considered for parathyroidectomy. More randomized clinical trials are needed to strongly support a surgical recommendation for all asymptomatic patients with pHPT.

### Methodology for the guidelines on evaluation and management of hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism [^91fa0396]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. © 2022 The Authors.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^687d7cf2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), the most common cause of hypercalcemia, is most often identified in postmenopausal women. The clinical presentation of PHPT has evolved over the past 40 years to include three distinct clinical phenotypes, each of which has been studied in detail and has led to evolving concepts about target organ involvement, natural history, and management.

Methods

In the present review, I provide an evidence-based summary of this disorder as it has been studied worldwide, citing key concepts and data that have helped to shape our concepts about this disease.

Results

PHPT is now recognized to include three clinical phenotypes: overt target organ involvement, mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia, and high PTH levels with persistently normal albumin-corrected and ionized serum calcium values. The factors that determine which of these clinical presentations is more likely to predominate in a given country include the extent to which biochemical screening is used, vitamin D deficiency is present, and whether parathyroid hormone levels are routinely measured in the evaluation of low bone density or frank osteoporosis. Guidelines for parathyroidectomy apply to all three clinical forms of the disease. If surgical guidelines are not met, parathyroidectomy can also be an appropriate option if no medical contraindications are present. If either the serum calcium or bone mineral density is of concern and surgery is not an option, pharmacological approaches are available and effective.

Conclusions

Advances in our knowledge of PHPT have guided new concepts in diagnosis and management.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: a medical perspective [^ef5fb96b]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical phenotype of primary hyperparathyroidism in the United States has changed markedly over the past century, with the majority of patients having minimal overt symptomatology. It has become clear, however, that "asymptomatic" primary hyperparathyroidism is a disease with distinct physiologic characteristics. Data accumulated over recent years suggest that asymptomatic patients meeting specific criteria can be safely followed without surgery. These guidelines are elucidated, and new options in the medical therapeutics of primary hyperparathyroidism are discussed.

### Surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism [^c9aa64cb]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the surgical treatment options for primary hyperparathyroidism with a focus on recent refinements in minimally invasive techniques and endoscopic and video- or robot-assisted parathyroidectomy.

Methods

We review the relevant surgical treatment options for primary hyperparathyroidism.

Results

Parathyroidectomy is the standard therapy for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Advancements in imaging, including technetium Tc 99m-sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography and ultrasonography, have improved preoperative localization, while intraoperative parathyroid hormone measurement provides a rapid test to confirm operative success. These adjuncts have enabled surgeons to perform an operation that is both safe and minimally invasive.

Conclusions

The minimally invasive approach to parathyroidectomy provides comparable cure rates to conventional bilateral neck exploration with reduced operative time and improved cosmetic results. The durability, safety, and success of these procedures make them valuable options in the current and future care of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Outcomes of parathyroidectomy in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^358860f2]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Parathyroidectomy is a definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients contemplating this intervention will benefit from knowledge regarding the expected outcomes and potential risks of the currently available surgical options.

Purpose

To appraise and summarize the available evidence regarding benefits and harms of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) and bilateral neck exploration (BNE).

Data Sources

A comprehensive search of multiple databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus) from each database's inception to September 2014 was performed.

Study Selection

Eligible studies evaluated patients with primary hyperparathyroidism undergoing MIP or BNE.

Data Extraction

Reviewers working independently and in duplicate extracted data and assessed the risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

We identified 82 observational studies and 6 randomized trials at moderate risk of bias. Most of them reported outcomes after MIP (n = 71). Using random-effects models to pool results across studies, the cure rate was 98% (95% CI 97–98%, I² = 10%) with BNE and 97% (95% CI 96–98%, I² = 86%) with MIP. Hypocalcemia occurred in 14% (95% CI 10–17% I² = 93%) of the BNE cases and in 2.3% (95% CI 1.6–3.1%, I² = 87%) with MIP (P < 0.001). There was a statistically significant lower risk of laryngeal nerve injury with MIP (0.3%) than with BNE (0.9%), but similar risk of infection (0.5 vs. 0.5%) and mortality (0.1 vs. 0.5%).

Limitations

The available evidence, mostly observational, is at moderate risk of bias, and limited by indirect comparisons and inconsistency for some outcomes (cure rate, hypocalcemia).

Conclusion

MIP and BNE are both effective surgical techniques for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism. The safety profile of MIP appears superior to BNE (lower rate of hypocalcemia and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury).

Since the last international guidelines were published in 2014 on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), new information has become available with regard to evaluation, diagnosis, epidemiology, genetics, classical and nonclassical manifestations, surgical and nonsurgical approaches, and natural history. To provide the most current summary of these developments, an international group, consisting of over 50 experts in these various aspects of PHPT, was convened. This paper provides the results of the task force that was assigned to review the information on the management of PHPT. For this task force on the management of PHPT, two questions were the subject of systematic reviews using the Gradingof Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. The full report addressing surgical and nonsurgical management of PHPT, utilizing the GRADE methodology, is published separately in this series. In this report, we summarize the results of that methodological review and expand them to encompass a much larger body of new knowledge that did not specifically fit the criteria of the GRADE methodology. Together, both the systematic and narrative reviews of the literature, summarized in this paper, give the most complete information available to date. A panel of experts then considered the last set of international guidelines in light of the newer data and assessed the need for their revision. This report provides the evidentiary background to the guidelines report. In that report, evidence from all task forces is synthesized into a summary statement and revised guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. © 2022 The Authors.

### Evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement and guidelines from the fifth international workshop [^ffd0f134]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The last international guidelines on the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) were published in 2014. Research since that time has led to new insights into epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, measurements, genetics, outcomes, presentations, new imaging modalities, target and other organ systems, pregnancy, evaluation, and management. Advances in all these areas are demonstrated by the reference list in which the majority of listings were published after the last set of guidelines. It was thus, timely to convene an international group of over 50 experts to review these advances in our knowledge. Four Task Forces considered: 1. Epidemiology, Pathophysiology, and Genetics; 2. Classical and Nonclassical Features; 3. Surgical Aspects; and 4. Management. For Task Force 4 on the Management of PHPT, Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology addressed surgical management of asymptomatic PHPT and non-surgical medical management of PHPT. The findings of this systematic review that applied GRADE methods to randomized trials are published as part of this series. Task Force 4 also reviewed a much larger body of new knowledge from observations studies that did not specifically fit the criteria of GRADE methodology. The full reports of these 4 Task Forces immediately follow this summary statement. Distilling the essence of all deliberations of all Task Force reports and Methodological reviews, we offer, in this summary statement, evidence-based recommendations and guidelines for the evaluation and management of PHPT. Different from the conclusions of the last workshop, these deliberations have led to revisions of renal guidelines and more evidence for the other recommendations. The accompanying papers present an in-depth discussion of topics summarized in this report. © 2022 The Authors.

### New perspectives in the management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^03dd2365]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a biochemical syndrome caused by the inappropriate or unregulated overproduction of parathyroid hormone, Leading to hypercalcae-mia. It was previously considered a relatively rare disorder, with clinical manifestations dominated by renal and/or bone disease. However, in modern times the diagnosis is most frequently recognized coincidentally on biochemical testing in patients evaluated for unrelated complaints. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative treatment for PHPT, with improved outcomes in symptomatic patients following this procedure. However, surgical intervention in patients with no clear clinical features remains controversial. The National Institutes for Health (NIH) have developed consensus guidelines giving specific indications for when surgery is recommended in patients with asymptomatic PHPT. This article examines the impact of treatment on asymptomatic PHPT, focusing on bone disease, neurocognitive function, quality of Life, cardiovascular disease and mortality. Medical treatment options, including bisphospho-nates and cinacalcet, are also discussed.

### The management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^905a3a9f]. Clinical Endocrinology (2002). Low credibility.

Recent improvements in parathyroid imaging have led to renewed interest in the criteria for, and the surgical approach to, parathyroidectomy. It therefore seemed appropriate to review current evidence relating to the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism for those working within a general endocrine service. The recommendations are based on an electronic search spanning the past decade using the search terms hyperparathyroidism, management and parathyroidectomy/surgery, but we have also included key publications outside this period. The findings have been graded systematically (Appendix), according to the quality of the information available, to indicate the level of evidence on which they are based.

### Analysis of time to diagnosis and outcomes among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^0ae31f72]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What outcomes are associated with delays in the diagnosis and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP)?

Findings

In this large database cohort study of 135 034 patients with hypercalcemia, those who were identified as high-risk and without a diagnosis and whose duration of workup or time from diagnosis to treatment exceeded 1 year experienced increased disease sequelae.

Meaning

These findings suggest that missed diagnoses and prolonged time to diagnosis and treatment of PHP are associated with increased disease burden.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common disorder of dysregulated calcium homeostasis. In 2013, its incidence in the US is estimated at 66 per 100 000 person-years among women and 25 per 100 000 among men. 1 The adoption of routine chemistry panel testing in the 1970s led to increased discovery of PHPT and changed its clinical presentation in developed nations from a rare, highly symptomatic disease to a milder, more subtle condition.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: new issues and new questions – bridging the past with the future [^2a8f5c95]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

The earliest clinical descriptions of PHPT pointed to an inexorably progressive disorder. Now, in many asymptomatic individuals who do not meet any surgical guidelines. PHPT in general, does not seem to be progressive. Most asymptomatic patients seem to remain asymptomatic over many years of observation. In those with major clinical manifestations, nephrolithiasis is by far the most common. In these patients, surgery is clearly indicated. Bone densitometry is an indispensable component of the evaluation as well as in monitoring because there is evidence of bone involvement in most patients. This contrasts with the skeletal X-ray, which is invariably negative. Nevertheless, patients with PHPT can show a bone mass measurement either at the cortical or cancellous skeleton that is more than 2 SDs below age- and sex-matched control subjects. Bone density, serum calcium concentration, and/or urinary calcium excretion per se can show evidence for progression in as many as 25% of patients with asymptomatic PHPT. There are newer pharmacologic approaches to PHPT that are the subject of intense investigation. The bisphosphonates and the calcimimetics show particular promise in this regard. Unanswered are such questions as whether the lower bone density in the milder patients will increase substantially as in those who undergo successful parathyroidectomy and whether fracture risk would therefore be reduced. Can medical therapy reduce serum calcium. parathyroid hormone levels, and other biochemical indices of PHPT? Can medical therapy improve bone density without the need for surgery. The issues outlined in this presentation and further amplified in other presentations given in this workshop lead to a series of questions that, in turn, may lead to modified guidelines for the management of these patients. The questions are as follows. (1) Should there be any changes in diagnostic criteria for PHPT? (2) Should the guidelines for surgery in PHPT be changed in light of new data over the past decade? What should those guidelines be? (3) At present, is there sufficient evidence of clinical benefit with specific medical therapies to recommend their use? In which patients? (4) Can some patients be followed without surgery? If so, how should they be monitored? (5) When surgery is the preferred option, what are the relative merits of minimally invasive procedures compared with more conventional surgery? (6) What is the role of localization techniques in identifying abnormal parathyroid tissue preoperatively and intraoperatively? Are they sufficiently helpful and cost effective to warrant their use in all patients who undergo parathyroid surgery? If not, in what patients should they be recommended? (7) What items should be placed on the research agenda for PHPT over the next decade?

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^90483e54]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2018). Medium credibility.

In this Review, we describe the pathogenesis, diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), with a focus on recent advances in the field. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder that is characterized by hypercalcaemia and elevated or inappropriately normal serum levels of parathyroid hormone. Most often, the presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic in regions of the world where serum levels of calcium are routinely measured. In addition to mild hypercalcaemia, PHPT can manifest with osteoporosis and hypercalciuria as well as with vertebral fractures and nephrolithiasis, both of which can be asymptomatic. Other clinical forms of PHPT, such as classical disease and normocalcaemic PHPT, are less common. Parathyroidectomy, the only curative treatment for PHPT, is recommended in patients with symptoms and those with asymptomatic disease who are at risk of progression or have subclinical evidence of end-organ sequelae. Parathyroidectomy results in an increase in BMD and a reduction in nephrolithiasis. Various medical therapies can increase BMD or reduce serum levels of calcium, but no single drug can do both. More data are needed regarding the neuropsychological manifestations of PHPT and the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to sporadic PHPT, as well as on risk factors for complications of the disorder. Future work that advances our knowledge in these areas will improve the management of the disorder.

### Parathyroidectomy for adults with primary hyperparathyroidism [^9b6277be]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), a disorder in which the parathyroid glands produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, is most common in older adults and postmenopausal women. While most people with PHPT are asymptomatic at diagnosis, symptomatic disease can lead to hypercalcaemia, osteoporosis, renal stones, cardiovascular abnormalities and reduced quality of life. Surgical removal of abnormal parathyroid tissue (parathyroidectomy) is the only established treatment for adults with symptomatic PHPT to prevent exacerbation of symptoms and to be cured of PHPT. However, the benefits and risks of parathyroidectomy compared to simple observation or medical therapy for asymptomatic and mild PHPT are not well established.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of parathyroidectomy in adults with PHPT compared to simple observation or medical therapy.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP from their date of inception until 26 November 2021. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing parathyroidectomy with simple observation or medical therapy for the treatment of adults with PHPT.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were 1. cure of PHPT, 2. morbidity related to PHPT and 3. serious adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were 1. all-cause mortality, 2. health-related quality of life and 3. hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, acute renal impairment or pancreatitis. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We identified eight eligible RCTs that included 447 adults with (mostly asymptomatic) PHPT; 223 participants were randomised to parathyroidectomy. Follow-up duration varied from six months to 24 months. Of the 223 participants (37 men) randomised to surgery, 164 were included in the analyses, of whom 163 were cured at six to 24 months (overall cure rate 99%). Parathyroidectomy compared to observation probably results in a large increase in cure rate at six to 24 months follow-up: 163/164 participants (99.4%) in the parathyroidectomy group and 0/169 participants in the observation or medical therapy group were cured of their PHPT (8 studies, 333 participants; moderate certainty). No studies explicitly reported intervention effects on morbidities related to PHPT, such as osteoporosis, osteopenia, kidney dysfunction, urolithiasis, cognitive dysfunction or cardiovascular disease, although some studies reported surrogate outcomes for osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. A post-hoc analysis revealed that parathyroidectomy, compared to observation or medical therapy, may have little or no effect after one to two years on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine (mean difference (MD) 0.03 g/cm², 95% CI -0.05 to 0.12; 5 studies, 287 participants; very low certainty). Similarly, compared to observation, parathyroidectomy may have little or no effect on femoral neck BMD after one to two years (MD -0.01 g/cm², 95% CI -0.13 to 0.11; 3 studies, 216 participants; very low certainty). However, the evidence is very uncertain for both BMD outcomes. Furthermore, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on improving left ventricular ejection fraction (MD -2.38%, 95% CI -4.77 to 0.01; 3 studies, 121 participants; very low certainty). Four studies reported serious adverse events. Three of these reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups; consequently, we were unable to include data from these three studies in the pooled analysis. The evidence suggests that parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on serious adverse events (RR 3.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 78.60; 4 studies, 168 participants; low certainty). Only two studies reported all-cause mortality. One study could not be included in the pooled analysis as zero events were observed in both the intervention and control groups. Parathyroidectomy compared to observation may have little or no effect on all-cause mortality, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 2.11, 95% CI 0.20 to 22.60; 2 studies, 133 participants; very low certainty). Three studies measured health-related quality of life using the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and reported inconsistent differences in scores for different domains of the questionnaire between parathyroidectomy and observation. Six studies reported hospitalisations for the correction of hypercalcaemia. Two studies reported zero events in both the intervention and control groups and could not be included in the pooled analysis. Parathyroidectomy, compared to observation, may have little or no effect on hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.20 to 4.25; 6 studies, 287 participants; low certainty). There were no reported hospitalisations for renal impairment or pancreatitis.

Authors' Conclusions

In accordance with the literature, our review findings suggest that parathyroidectomy, compared to simple observation or medical (etidronate) therapy, probably results in a large increase in cure rates of PHPT (with normalisation of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels to laboratory reference values). Parathyroidectomy, compared with observation, may have little or no effect on serious adverse events or hospitalisation for hypercalcaemia, and the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of parathyroidectomy on other short-term outcomes, such as BMD, all-cause mortality and quality of life. The high uncertainty of evidence limits the applicability of our findings to clinical practice; indeed, this systematic review provides no new insights with regard to treatment decisions for people with (asymptomatic) PHPT. In addition, the methodological limitations of the included studies, and the characteristics of the study populations (mainly comprising white women with asymptomatic PHPT), warrant caution when extrapolating the results to other populations with PHPT. Large-scale multi-national, multi-ethnic and long-term RCTs are needed to explore the potential short- and long-term benefits of parathyroidectomy compared to non-surgical treatment options with regard to osteoporosis or osteopenia, urolithiasis, hospitalisation for acute kidney injury, cardiovascular disease and quality of life.

Objective

The surgical management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) has undergone considerable advances over the past two decades. The purpose of this report is to review these advances.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee of the Fourth International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism to address key questions related to the surgical management of PHPT.

Evidence

Data since the last International Workshop were presented and discussed in detail. The topics included improvements in preoperative imaging, intraoperative adjuncts, refinements in local and regional anesthesia, and rapid intraoperative PTH assays.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup agreed on what recommendations should be made to the Expert Panel regarding surgical approaches to parathyroidectomy.

Conclusions

1) All patients with PHPT who meet surgical criteria should be referred to an experienced endocrine surgeon to discuss the risks, benefits, and potential complications of surgery. 2) Patients who do not meet surgical criteria and in whom there are no medical contraindications to surgery may request a visit with an experienced endocrine surgeon. Alternatively, a multidisciplinary endocrine conference with surgeon involvement could be employed to address all relevant issues. 3) Imaging is not a diagnostic procedure; it is a localization procedure to help the surgeon optimize the operative plan. 4) The frequency of hereditary forms of PHPT may be underappreciated and needs to be assessed with increased vigilance. And 5) surgery is likely to benefit patients due to high cure rates, low complication rates, and the likelihood of reversing skeletal manifestations.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in the older person [^91e6e3fa]. Age and Ageing (2003). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common condition which may have few symptoms. One of the principal concerns in the older person with minimally symptomatic PHPT is restoration of bone mineral density and prevention of fracture. Other important considerations are cardiovascular risk and quality of life. Surgery, the traditional treatment of choice, may not always correct these factors. We present a review of the literature and advice of medical therapies which should be of benefit, with emphasis on a multifaceted approach in protecting the patient from PHPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism [^66dea13c]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To review primary hyperparathyroidism and the key issues that are relevant to the practicing endocrinologist.

Methods

The latest information on the presentation, diagnosis, and traditional and nontraditional aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism is reviewed.

Results

The diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism is straightforward when the traditional hypercalcemic patient is documented to have an elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. Commonly, patients are identified who have normal serum calcium levels but elevated PTH levels in whom no secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed. Traditional target organs of primary hyperparathyroidism-the skeleton and the kidneys-continue to be a focus in the patient evaluation. Bone mineral density shows a typical pattern of involvement with the distal one-third radius being selectively reduced compared with the lumbar spine in which bone mineral density is generally well maintained. Neurocognitive and cardiovascular aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism, while a focus of recent interest, have not been shown to definitively aid in the decision for or against surgery. The recommendation for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism is based on guidelines that focus on the serum calcium level, renal function, bone mineral density, and age. In patients who do not meet guidelines, a nonsurgical management approach has merit.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism is continuing to show changes in its clinical profile, with normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism being a topic of great interest. Skeletal and renal features of primary hyperparathyroidism drive, in most cases, the decision to recommend surgery. In patients who do not meet any criteria for surgery, a conservative approach with appropriate monitoring is acceptable.

Monitor for recurrent disease if no causes are present.

### Hypoparathyroidism… [^4586c373]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and symptoms or signs should undergo surgical removal of their parathyroid gland. 25, 26 In some patients, medical comorbidities may preclude surgery, and controlling hypercalcemia alone may be the goal. In this situation, the calcimimetic cinacalcet effectively lowers serum calcium levels, but does not affect bone density. 27, 28 Age alone should not preclude parathyroidectomy.
29. The role of surgery in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism is not as clear. Younger patients and patients at risk of progression to symptomatic disease are the best candidates for parathyroidectomy. Recommendations from the Third International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic Primary Hyperparathyroidism include performing parathyroidectomy in asymptomatic persons with primary hyperparathyroidism and any one of the following.

15, 26 The management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease usually involves consultation with a nephrologist. Protein restriction and calcium supplementation have been shown to decrease the development of this complication, with a reduction in death from renal causes. Vitamin D supplements and calcimimetics, which inhibit PTH secretion, have been shown to improve biochemical markers. There are several evidence-based reviews for managing chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder; full discussion of these guidelines is beyond the scope of this article and is available from this referenced source.
34. 1, 4, 8, 24 It is important to ensure repletion to normal levels of vitamin D and magnesium in these patients. Serum levels of PTH, phosphorus, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D can help differentiate between disorders causing hypocalcemia.
22.

Figure 3 provides brief recommendations for the immediate treatment of severe hypocalcemia 1–4, 24; a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article. Long-term management of hypoparathyroidism should include at least initial involvement of an endocrinologist. Vitamin D analogues are essential, and thiazide diuretics and dietary modification are typically used as well. PTH therapy has been studied, but data are limited and PTH preparations are not approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for this purpose. 1, 35.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: an update on diagnostic and management challenges [^87825e41]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that can present with intermittent hypercalcemia or may evolve into hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism. This milder biochemical entity remains incompletely understood because of a lack of long-term health outcomes regarding both medical and surgical approaches to its management. Medical therapies have shown some efficacy. A limited number of studies have found that bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density, and calcimimetics may decrease the risk of nephrolithiasis in patients with normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism. Studies have also described patient outcomes after applying the same surgical criteria used for patients with hypercalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism to those with the normocalcaemic form of the disease. These studies suggest that parathyroid surgery appears to be effective in normalizing elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and decreasing adverse renal and skeletal outcomes in patients with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism. Given the available data and overall lack of consensus regarding the optimal management of these patients, a reasonable approach is to tailor treatment to the individual patient by considering their risk factors for new or accelerated bone loss, kidney stones, diminished quality of life, and cardiovascular disease.

### Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: diagnostic pitfalls and surgical intervention [^caea7dd7]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common disease, with a prevalence as high as 1 in 400 women and 1 in 1000 men, and most are asymptomatic. Patients with PHPT have hypercalcemia with inappropriately normal levels of parathyroid hormone. Parathyroidectomy is the only curative therapy, and the procedure has become more common and more safe. Among asymptomatic patients, parathyroidectomy halts the progression of disease, improves quality of life, and may decrease risk of fracture and adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Thus, surgery should be considered in all patients with asymptomatic PHPT who have minimal perioperative risk and sufficient life expectancy, regardless of chronologic age.

### Skeletal effects of interventions in mild primary hyperparathyroidism: a meta-analysis [^502c5709]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Uncertainty exists as to the optimal management and monitoring of the skeletal consequences of mild primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of surgical treatment, medical treatment and no treatment on bone mineral density (BMD) in mild PHPT.

Data Sources

Our sources were Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL prior to January 2009, and abstracts from meetings of international bone and mineral societies from 1987–2008.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were of at least 1-yr duration and included more than 10 participants with mild PHPT (serum calcium < 12 mg/dl) who had BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry while being observed without intervention, or treated with antiresorptive therapy or surgery. Primary analysis was of studies of up to 2-yr duration. Secondary analysis was of studies with follow-up beyond 2 yr.

Data Extraction

Data were extracted from the text of the retrieved articles or conference abstracts.

Data Synthesis

Increases in BMD in response to surgical intervention were comparable to those induced by antiresorptive therapies. Significant bone loss was observed in untreated subjects, but the rates of loss ranged from 0.6–1.0%/yr. Analysis of studies reporting data beyond 2 yr of follow-up demonstrated stable increases in BMD after surgery and stable BMD or slow loss (0.1–0.3%/yr) in untreated PHPT.

Conclusions

Surgical treatment and antiresorptive therapies increase BMD in mild PHPT to a similar degree, and each represents a reasonable option in a patient with mild PHPT and low BMD. Rapid bone loss does not occur in untreated mild PHPT, such that monitoring of BMD less frequently than every 1–2 yr is reasonable in individuals for whom intervention is not immediately required.

### Denosumab and cinacalcet for primary hyperparathyroidism (DENOCINA): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^c477dc93]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Medical treatment options for primary hyperparathyroidism are scarce. We aimed to assess the efficacy of denosumab and combined with cinacalcet in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Methods

In this randomised, single-centre, proof-of-concept, double-blind trial, patients aged at least 18 years with primary hyperparathyroidism were recruited from the Department of Endocrinology, Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark. Key eligibility criteria were a T-score between -1.0 and -3.5 at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip. Patients were assigned (1:1:1) via permuted block randomisation to receive 30 mg cinacalcet per day plus 60 mg denosumab subcutaneously every 6 months (n = 14; combination group) for 1 year, denosumab plus placebo (n = 16; denosumab group) for 1 year, or placebo plus placebo injection (n = 15; placebo group) for 1 year. Primary outcomes were changes in bone mineral density (BMD) measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and distal forearm after 1 year. Additionally, effects on bone-metabolic biochemistry were explored. Patients and investigators were masked. All enrolled patients were included in efficacy analyses. The trial was done in an outpatient setting and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03027557, and has been completed.

Findings

Between March 14, 2017, and March 16, 2018 we recruited 285 participants. 16 patients were randomly allocated to the denosumab group, 15 to the combination group, and 15 to the placebo group. Dropout was limited to one patient in the combination group. Compared with placebo, BMD improved in groups receiving denosumab: lumbar spine (combination group 5.4% [95% CI 2.7–8.1], denosumab group 6.9% [95% CI 4.2–9.6]; p < 0.0001), total hip (combination group 5.0% [3.0–6.9], denosumab group 4.1% [2.5–5.8]; p < 0.0001), and femoral neck (combination group 4.5% [1.9–7.9]; p = 0.0008, denosumab group 3.8% [1.4–6.3]; p = 0.0022]). Changes in BMD at the third distal forearm were borderline significant. Six non-fatal serious adverse events occurred (combination group [n = 2], denosumab group [n = 1], placebo group [n = 3]). The overall prevalence of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, and no fatal adverse events occurred.

Interpretation

Evidence suggested denosumab was effective in improving BMD and lowering bone turnover in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism irrespective of cinacalcet treatment and might be a valid option for patients in which surgery is undesirable.

### AAES guidelines for primary hyperparathyroidism management… [^f63a169d]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Findings Initial evaluation should include 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement, 24-hour urine calcium measurement, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and supplementation for vitamin D deficiency. Parathyroidectomy is indicated for all symptomatic patients, should be considered for most asymptomatic patients, and is more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment of pHPT. Symptomatic patients are expected to derive clear benefits from curative parathyroidectomy, and patients considered to be asymptomatic frequently report improvement in quality-of-life indexes. 11–14 Observation and pharmacologic therapy are less effective and less cost-effective than surgery, even when the patient is considered asymptomatic. 15 Long-term hypercalcemia should be avoided because of potential deleterious effects.

16–18 Referral to an experienced parathyroid surgeon is advised to determine whether the likelihood and benefits of cure outweigh the anticipated risks of the procedure. Quiz Ref IDRecommendation 3–1: Parathyroidectomy is indicated, and is the preferred treatment, for all patients with symptomatic pHPT. Recommendation 3–2: Parathyroidectomy is indicated when the serum calcium level is greater than 1 mg/dL above normal, regardless of whether objective symptoms are present or absent. Recommendation 5–4: Patients with pHPT who present with hypercalcemic crisis should be medically managed, followed by parathyroidectomy. Regardless of MIP technique, specific strategies are advised to improve the likelihood of success, including selection by imaging results.

Minimally invasive parathyroidectomy can achieve cure in 97% to 99% of selected patients when adjunctive IPM is used to confirm adequacy of resection. 31 During MIP, if IPM suggests residual hypersecreting tissue, conversion to bilateral exploration is warranted and has equivalent cure rates to planned BE. Recommendation 9–1: In patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1–associated pHPT, subtotal parathyroidectomy is recommended as the index operation. Recommendation 9–2: In multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A–associated pHPT, resection of only visibly enlarged glands is recommended.

### Medical management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the third international workshop [^214d5a48]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common endocrine disorder that is frequently asymptomatic. The 2002 International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT addressed medical management of asymptomatic PHPT and summarized the data on nonsurgical approaches to this disease. At the Third International Workshop on Asymptomatic PHPT held in May 2008, this subject was reviewed again in light of data that have since become available. We present the results of a literature review of advances in the medical management of PHPT.

Methods

A series of questions was developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies evaluating the management of PHPT with bisphosphonates, hormone replacement therapy, raloxifene, and calcimimetics was conducted. Existing guidelines and recent unpublished data were also reviewed. All selected relevant articles were reviewed, and the questions developed by the International Task Force were addressed by the Consensus Panel.

Results

Bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy are effective in decreasing bone turnover in patients with PHPT and improving bone mineral density (BMD). Fracture data are not available with either treatment. Raloxifene also lowers bone turnover in patients with PHPT. None of these agents, however, significantly lowers serum calcium or PTH levels. The calcimimetic cinacalcet reduces both serum calcium and PTH levels and raises serum phosphorus. Cinacalcet does not, however, reduce bone turnover or improve BMD.

Conclusions

Bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy provide skeletal protection in patients with PHPT. Limited data are available regarding skeletal protection in patients with PHPT treated with raloxifene. Calcimimetics favorably alter serum calcium and PTH in PHPT but do not significantly affect either bone turnover or BMD. Medical management of asymptomatic PHPT is a promising option for those who are not candidates for parathyroidectomy.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism: historical and contemporary perspectives [^0465e822]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a frequently diagnosed endocrine condition most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Our understanding of the epidemiology and management of PHPT have evolved in the past few decades. Asymptomatic PHPT has been the most common presentation in developed countries since the advent of routine biochemical screening. Symptomatic disease is now also decreasing in developing nations. Normocalcemic PHPT is a newer phenotype that can be diagnosed in the setting of elevated PTH concentrations with persistently normal serum calcium, however, evaluation for secondary causes of hyperparathyroidism is critical as it is a diagnosis of exclusion. Genetic testing can be helpful in patients younger than 30 years of age and/or patients with intermediate or equivocal ranges of the urinary calcium to creatinine ratio (between 0.01 and 0.02) to differentiate PHPT from FHH and to evaluate for other genetic etiologies that may affect management. Surgery is the recommended treatment modality for symptomatic PHPT, and patients with asymptomatic PHPT meeting recommended criteria should also be considered for parathyroidectomy. "Asymptomatic" patients should be screened for the presence of nephrolithiasis and/or vertebral fracture, since many will be reclassified as having symptomatic disease with further investigation. For poor surgical candidates or patients not meeting criteria for surgery, medical therapy includes cinacalcet for hypercalcemia and antiresorptive therapies for osteoporosis.

### Contemporary management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^a701f235]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be asymptomatic or symptomatic, as well as classic, normocalcemic, or normohormonal. It is important to rule out other causes of hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism. Preoperative localization with imaging is necessary for a minimally invasive approach and can be helpful even if planning 4-gland exploration. There are a variety of intraoperative techniques that can assist with localization as well as confirming success. Standard of care remains surgical resection of affected glands. However, there are less invasive management strategies that can be considered for poor surgical candidates.

### Surgical aspects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^da9c4233]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Parathyroidectomy (PTX) is the treatment of choice for symptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). It is also the treatment of choice in asymptomatic PHPT with evidence for target organ involvement. This review updates surgical aspects of PHPT and proposes the following definitions based on international expert consensus: selective PTX (and reasons for conversion to an extended procedure), bilateral neck exploration for non-localized or multigland disease, subtotal PTX, total PTX with immediate or delayed autotransplantation, and transcervical thymectomy and extended en bloc PTX for parathyroid carcinoma. The systematic literature reviews discussed covered (i) the use of intraoperative PTH (ioPTH) for localized single-gland disease and (ii) the management of low BMD after PTX. Updates based on prospective observational studies are presented concerning PTX for multigland disease and hereditary PHPT syndromes, histopathology, intraoperative adjuncts, localization techniques, perioperative management, "reoperative" surgery and volume/outcome data. Postoperative complications are few and uncommon (< 3%) in centers performing over 40 PTXs per year. This review is the first global consensus about surgery in PHPT and reflects the current practice in leading endocrine surgery units worldwide. © 2022 The Authors.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in adults-(part I) assessment and medical management: position statement of the Endocrine Society of Australia, the Australian&New Zealand endocrine surgeons, and the Australian&New Zealand bone and mineral society [^5ebc80cf]. Clinical Endocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To formulate clinical consensus recommendations on the presentation, assessment, and management of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in adults.

Methods

Representatives from relevant Australian and New Zealand Societies used a systematic approach for adaptation of guidelines (ADAPTE) to derive an evidence-informed position statement addressing nine key questions.

Results

PHPT is a biochemical diagnosis. Serum calcium should be measured in patients with suggestive symptoms, reduced bone mineral density or minimal trauma fractures, and in those with renal stones. Other indications are detailed in the manuscript. In patients with hypercalcaemia, intact parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, phosphate, and renal function should be measured. In established PHPT, assessment of bone mineral density, vertebral fractures, urinary tract calculi/nephrocalcinosis and quantification of urinary calcium excretion is warranted. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment and is warranted for all symptomatic patients and should be considered for asymptomatic patients without contraindications to surgery and with > 10 years life expectancy. In patients who do not undergo surgery, we recommend annual evaluation for disease progression. Where the diagnosis is not clear or the risk-benefit ratio is not obvious, multidisciplinary discussion and formulation of a consensus management plan is appropriate. Genetic testing for familial hyperparathyroidism is recommended in selected patients.

Conclusions

These clinical consensus recommendations were developed to provide clinicians with contemporary guidance on the assessment and management of PHPT in adults. It is anticipated that improved health outcomes for individuals and the population will be achieved at a decreased cost to the community.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: part two: surgical management [^c6086e75]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is caused by the overproduction of parathyroid hormone by 1 or more parathyroid glands resulting in hypercalcemia and its downstream clinical consequences. The definitive management of PHPT is surgery. Approaches to successful surgery include bilateral exploration or focused parathyroidectomy with intraoperative parathyroid hormone monitoring, which in experienced hands are both associated with a low risk of complications.

### Diagnosis and management of primary hyperparathyroidism across the VA health care system… [^3c5664af]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Meaning Primary hyperparathyroidism appears to be underdiagnosed despite the presence of chronic hypercalcemia, and it is undertreated with parathyroidectomy despite surgical indications. Importance Untreated primary hyperparathyroidism impairs quality of life and incurs substantial costs. Parathyroidectomy is a low-risk, high-success, definitive intervention. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for pHPT. It is a low-risk operation, commonly performed on an outpatient basis, with high cure rates and excellent long-term outcomes, including in elderly patients. 5–7 Surgical intervention for pHPT has been associated with increased bone mineral density, decreased risk of fracture, decreased progression of kidney disease, and decreased rates of associated cardiovascular. dysfunction, constipation, and impotence.

8–14 Parathyroidectomy is the preferred treatment for all patients with symptomatic/classic disease, but some controversy remains about its use in patients with mild, asymptomatic pHPT. 4 Accumulating evidence, though, shows benefits to patients undergoing parathyroidectomy. for mild, asymptomatic disease, including improved neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and overall quality of life. 15 Cost benefits of parathyroidectomy, even for patients with asymptomatic disease, have also been demonstrated. 16–18 This favorable risk to benefit ratio of the procedure has made it the primary recommended. treatment for pHPT, when surgery is possible. 19 Management guidelines have been periodically updated and reflect the growing evidence on the benefits of parathyroidectomy.

20–23 The most recent management guidelines released by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons suggest that parathyroidectomy should be considered in patients with mild, nonclassic symptoms, if surgical risk is not prohibitive.
19. Among patients who underwent parathyroidectomy, 359 had received cinacalcet prior to surgery, whereas 2898 medically treated patients with pHPT received cinacalcet prior to surgery. Underuse of parathyroidectomy remained significant, even when strong indications for surgery were present. Moreover, we observed a declining trend in the use of definitive surgical treatment. In the context of contemporary guidelines by the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons, which recommend consideration of parathyroidectomy for most patients with pHPT with either typical or atypical symptoms, these findings present an opportunity for system-wide improvement. 19.

### Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: summary statement from the fourth international workshop [^18d80efe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is routinely encountered in clinical practices of endocrinology throughout the world. This report distills an update of current information about diagnostics, clinical features, and management of this disease into a set of revised guidelines.

Participants

Participants, representing an international constituency, with interest and expertise in various facets of asymptomatic PHPT constituted four Workshop Panels that developed key questions to be addressed. They then convened in an open 3-day conference September 19–21, 2013, in Florence, Italy, when a series of presentations and discussions addressed these questions. A smaller subcommittee, the Expert Panel, then met in closed session to reach an evidence-based consensus on how to address the questions and data that were aired in the open forum.

Evidence

Preceding the conference, each question was addressed by a relevant, extensive literature search. All presentations and deliberations of the Workshop Panels and the Expert Panel were based upon the latest information gleaned from this literature search.

Consensus Process

The expert panel considered all the evidence provided by the individual Workshop Panels and then came to consensus.

Conclusion

In view of new findings since the last International Workshop on the Management of Asymptomatic PHPT, guidelines for management have been revised. The revised guidelines include: 1) recommendations for more extensive evaluation of the skeletal and renal systems; 2) skeletal and/or renal involvement as determined by further evaluation to become part of the guidelines for surgery; and 3) more specific guidelines for monitoring those who do not meet guidelines for parathyroid surgery. These guidelines should help endocrinologists and surgeons caring for patients with PHPT. A blueprint for future research is proposed to foster additional investigation into issues that remain uncertain or controversial.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism and the skeleton [^dc2e90ab]. Clinical Endocrinology (2008). Low credibility.

Today, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in the developed countries is typically a disease with few or no obvious clinical symptoms. However, even in the asymptomatic cases the endogenous excess of PTH increases bone turnover leading to an insidious reversible loss of cortical and trabecular bone because of an expansion of the remodelling space and an irreversible loss of cortical bone due to increased endocortical resorption. In contrast trabecular bone structure and integrity to a large extent is maintained and there may be a slight periosteal expansion. Most studies have reported decreased bone mineral density (BMD) in PHPT mainly located at cortical sites, whereas sites rich in trabecular bone only show a modest reduction or even a slight increase in BMD. The frequent occurrence of vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency in PHPT and increased plasma FGF23 levels may also contribute to the decrease in BMD. The effect of smoking is unsolved. Epidemiological studies have shown that the relative risk of spine and nonspine fractures is increased in untreated PHPT starting up to 10 years before the diagnosis is made. Successful surgery for PHPT normalizes bone turnover, increases BMD and decreases fracture risk based on larger epidemiological studies. However, 10 years after surgery fracture risk appears to increase again due to an increase in forearm fractures. There are no randomized controlled studies (RCTs) demonstrating a protective effect of medical treatment on fracture risk in PHPT. Less conclusive studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial effect on plasma PTH and BMD in vitamin D deficient PHPT patients. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and maybe SERM appear to reduce bone turnover and increase BMD. However, their nonskeletal side-effects preclude their use for this purpose. Bisphosphonates reduce bone turnover and increase BMD in PHPT as in osteoporosis and may be a therapeutical option in selected patients with low BMD. Obviously, there is a need for larger RCTs with fractures as end-points that appraise this possibility. Calcimimetics reduce plasma calcium and PTH in PHPT but has no beneficial effect on bone turnover or BMD. In symptomatic hypercalcaemic PHPT with low BMD where curative surgery is impossible or contraindicated a combination of a calcimimetic and a bisphosphonate may be an undocumented therapeutical option that needs further evaluation.

### Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism [^4052463e]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism have evolved since their original description. What was once a debilitating disease has now become one with few symptoms on initial presentation. Complications from these disorders have decreased significantly because of earlier detection. Improved management of patients with chronic renal disease has also limited complications among those with secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Appropriate management is essential even in the early phase of the disorder to minimize the morbidities that may result if left untreated.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® parathyroid adenoma [^6df1f788]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism is defined as excessive parathyroid hormone production. The diagnosis is made through biochemical testing, in which imaging has no role. However, imaging is appropriate for preoperative parathyroid gland localization with the intent of surgical cure. Imaging is particularly useful in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism whereby accurate localization of a single parathyroid adenoma can facilitate minimally invasive parathyroidectomy. Imaging can also be useful to localize ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid glands and detail anatomy, which may impact surgery. This document summarizes the literature and provides imaging recommendations for hyperparathyroidism including primary hyperparathyroidism, recurrent or persistent primary hyperparathyroidism after parathyroid surgery, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Recommendations include ultrasound, CT neck without and with contrast, and nuclear medicine parathyroid scans. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism: effects on bone health [^90762198]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the most common cause of chronic hypercalcemia. With the advent of routine calcium screening, the classic presentation of renal and osseous symptoms has been largely replaced with mild, asymptomatic disease. In hypercalcemia caused by PHPT, serum parathyroid hormone levels are either high, or inappropriately normal. A single-gland adenoma is responsible for 80% of PHPT cases. Less frequent causes include 4-gland hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma. Diminished bone mineral density and nephrolithiasis are the major current clinical sequelae. Parathyroidectomy is the only definitive treatment for PHPT, and in experienced hands, cure rates approach 98%.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — nonsurgical management includes the use of calcium-sensing receptor agonists such as cinacalcet, which has shown similar safety, tolerability, and efficacy in PHPT associated with MEN1 as seen with sporadic PHPT with a significant reduction in serum calcium as the primary benefit; percutaneous ethanol ablation (PEA) is an option in patients with recurrent PHPT, especially if there is concern for hypoparathyroidism with additional surgery or if cinacalcet is not a viable long-term treatment option; PEA is associated with normocalcemia in most patients, but recurrence of hypercalcemia is common and can require additional PEA treatment.

### Disparities in parathyroidectomy: who receives appropriate treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism? [^3ff47a27]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Parathyroidectomy is underperformed despite clear benefits in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). We evaluated disparities in receipt of parathyroidectomy following PHPT diagnosis to explore barriers to care.

Methods

Adults diagnosed with PHPT 2013–2018 at a health system were identified. Recommended indications for parathyroidectomy include age ≤ 50 y, calcium > 11 mg/dL, or the presence of nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, decreased glomerular filtration rate, osteopenia, osteoporosis, or pathological fracture 1 y prior to diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed rates of parathyroidectomy within 12 mo following diagnosis as well as median time to parathyroidectomy, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses assessed factors associated with undergoing parathyroidectomy.

Results

Of 2409 patients, 75% were females, 12% aged ≤ 50 y, and 92% non-Hispanic White, while 52% had Medicaid/Medicare, 36% were commercial/self-pay or uninsured, and 12% unknown. Parathyroidectomy was performed within 1 y in 50% of patients. Within the 68% that met recommendations, parathyroidectomy was performed within 1 y in 54%; median time from diagnosis to surgery was shorter for males, patients aged ≤ 50 y, commercial/self-pay/no insurance patients (versus Medicaid/Medicare), and those with fewer comorbidities, P < 0.05. Multivariable analysis demonstrated non-Hispanic White patients and those with commercial/self-pay/uninsured were more likely to undergo parathyroidectomy after adjusting for comorbidity, age, and facility site. Among those strongly indicated, patients not on Medicare/Medicaid and aged ≤ 50 y were more likely to undergo parathyroidectomy after adjusting for race, comorbidity, and facility site.

Conclusions

Disparities in parathyroidectomy for PHPT were observed. Insurance type was associated with undergoing parathyroidectomy; patients on governmental insurance were less likely to undergo surgery and waited longer for surgery despite strong indications. Barriers to referral and access to surgery should be investigated and addressed to optimize all patients' access to care.

### Imaging techniques in parathyroid surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism [^fbb5e4c5]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2011). Low credibility.

As more patients present with the incidental diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism due to biochemical screening, treatment guidelines have been developed for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. Management of primary hyperparathyroidism has evolved in recent years, with considerable interest in minimally invasive approaches. Successful localization of the diseased gland(s) by nuclear imaging and anatomical studies, along with rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone assay, has allowed for focused and minimally invasive surgical approaches. Patients in whom the localization studies have identified single-gland adenoma or unilateral disease are candidates for such focused approaches instead of the traditional approach of bilateral exploration. These imaging techniques have also been critical in the successful management of patients with persistent or recurrent disease.

### Surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism: are the consensus guidelines being followed? [^5ff444ac]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine parathyroidectomy (PTx) rates in patients who satisfy the consensus guidelines for surgical treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT).

Background

Surgery for PHPT is recommended for all symptomatic patients and select asymptomatic patients meeting established consensus criteria. Adherence to the consensus guidelines has not been examined systematically, because of inadequate information regarding patients managed nonoperatively.

Methods

All nonuremic patients with PHPT during the period 1995–2008 were identified using the Kaiser Permanente-Southern California laboratory database, encompassing 3.5 million individuals annually. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine predictors of PTx.

Results

We found 3388 patients with PHPT, of whom 265 (8%) were symptomatic (nephrolithiasis). Nephrolithiasis was predictive of PTx (OR 2.94 vs asymptomatic), with 51% of symptomatic patients undergoing surgery. Among asymptomatic patients, the proportion meeting consensus criteria was 39% during the early period (1995–2002) and 51% during the late period (2003–2008). The PTx rate for these patients exceeded that for asymptomatic patients not meeting consensus criteria but remained low (early 44% vs 19%, P < 0.0001; late 39% vs 16%, P < 0.0001). The following individual criteria were predictive of PTx: calcium > 11.5 mg/dL (OR 2.27), hypercalciuria (OR 3.28, P < 0.0001), and age < 50 years (OR 1.54, P < 0.0001). However, the absolute PTx rates associated with satisfaction of these criteria were in the 50% range. Bone density scores did not influence likelihood of PTx and renal impairment predicted against PTx (OR 0.35, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

The consensus guidelines regarding PHPT have not been followed in our study population. PTx appears to be underutilized in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.

### Is minimally invasive parathyroid surgery an option for patients with gestational primary hyperparathyroidism? [^17701ce8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational primary hyperparathyroidism (GPHPT) is a rare and often unrecognized condition. Surgical treatment is the optimal and definitive treatment for GPHPT, and has been shown to reduce the incidence of life threatening maternal and foetal complications such as preeclampsia, miscarriage and hypercalcaemic crisis. Surgery during pregnancy is indicated for all patients with GPHPT, even if hypercalcaemia is mild and there are no established complications. Open bilateral neck exploration represents the golden standard for the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, though in the last decade a variety of minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) techniques have been developed. In selected patients, MIP has shown similar cure rates to open bilateral neck exploration, but with less postoperative pain, postoperative stay, overall patient distress and better cosmetic outcome.

We review the clinical significance of GPHPT along with the indications and timing of surgery. Additionally, we review the different MIP options available for the treatment of GPHPT, and present one patient with GPHPT successfully treated, with bilateral neck exploration performed using a minimally invasive video-assisted technique.

Case report

A 38-years-old pregnant woman, at 9 weeks of gestation, was admitted to hospital with severe hyperemesis, thirst and polyuria. Routine investigations showed low TSH 0.04 mIU/l (0.4–4), mildly elevated free T4 23.4pmol/l (10.6–20.5), normal free T3 5.6pmol/l (3.3–6.2), elevated corrected calcium 2.61 mmol/l (2.17–2.46), elevated ionised calcium 1.28 mmol/l (1.04–1.24) and low phosphate 0.67 mmol/l (0.79–1.37). Her abnormal thyroid function was attributed to pregnancy itself and normalised without intervention. PTH was elevated 12.4pmol/l (0.8–8), and her vitamin D levels were subnormal 45 nmol/l (33–107). 24 hr urine calcium was elevated at 13.6 mmol/day (1.5–7.5), with urine volume of 1.7 litres in 24 hrs. Her previous 4 pregnancies were uneventful. She had no previous history of calcium disorders or family history of endocrine disorders. She was treated with intravenous fluids and antiemetics and was referred for dedicated parathyroid ultrasound (US) and surgical consult.

### Current issues in the presentation of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^98bae4e0]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This report summarizes data on traditional and nontraditional manifestations of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) that have been published since the last International Workshop on PHPT.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the presentation of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Data from the 5-year period between 2008 and 2013 were presented and discussed to determine whether they support changes in recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up.

Consensus Process

Questions were developed by the International Task Force on PHPT. A comprehensive literature search for relevant studies was undertaken. After extensive review and discussion, the subgroup came to agreement on what changes in the recommendations for surgery or nonsurgical follow-up of asymptomatic PHPT should be made to the Expert Panel.

Conclusions

1) There are limited new data available on the natural history of asymptomatic PHPT. Although recognition of normocalcemic PHPT (normal serum calcium with elevated PTH concentrations; no secondary cause for hyperparathyroidism) is increasing, data on the clinical presentation and natural history of this phenotype are limited. 2) Although there are geographic differences in the predominant phenotypes of PHPT (symptomatic, asymptomatic, normocalcemic), they do not justify geography-specific management guidelines. 3) Recent data using newer, higher resolution imaging and analytic methods have revealed that in asymptomatic PHPT, both trabecular bone and cortical bone are affected. 4) Clinically silent nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis can be detected by renal imaging and should be listed as a new criterion for surgery. 5) Current data do not support a cardiovascular evaluation or surgery for the purpose of improving cardiovascular markers, anatomical or functional abnormalities. 6) Some patients with mild PHPT have neuropsychological complaints and cognitive abnormalities, and some of these patients may benefit from surgical intervention. However, it is not possible at this time to predict which patients with neuropsychological complaints or cognitive issues will improve after successful parathyroid surgery.

### Management of primary hyperparathyroidism with severe hypercalcemia during the COVID-19 pandemic [^7d708f7d]. Clinical Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and severe hypercalcemia, parathyroidectomy remains the only curative therapy. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when many hospital visits are suspended and surgeries cannot be performed, the management of these patients represents a challenging clinical situation. This article presents a literature review and discussion of the pharmacologic management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia, which can be used as a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic until parathyroidectomy can be performed safely.

Methods

This narrative review was conducted by searching literature on the PubMed, Medline, and Google Scholar databases using the terms primary hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, cinacalcet, bisphosphonates, denosumab, vitamin D, raloxifene, hormone replacement therapy, coronavirus, and COVID-19.

Findings

Appropriate monitoring and remote medical follow-up of these patients are essential until the resolution of the pandemic. Cinacalcet is the drug of choice for controlling hypercalcemia, whereas bisphosphonate or denosumab is the drug for improving bone mineral density. Combined therapy with cinacalcet and bisphosphonates or cinacalcet and denosumab should be considered when the effects on serum calcium and bone mineral density are simultaneously desired.

Implications

Medical management of PHPT and severe hypercalcemia presents a reasonable alternative for parathyroid surgery during the COVID-19 outbreak and should be instituted until the pandemic ends and surgery can be performed safely.

### Skeletal effects of primary hyperparathyroidism [^4c8c347d]. Endocrine Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the effect of primary hyperparathyroidism on bone mass and occurrence of fractures as well as the advances in medical management of this relatively common condition.

Methods

We conducted a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed publications for the period from 1960 to 1999. Studies reviewed were those that evaluated bone mass and fracture risk in primary hyperparathyroidism in both male and female populations. Studies that assessed intervention with hormone replacement therapy, bisphosphonates, calcimimetic agents, and surgical treatment and their effect on bone mass and fracture were also reviewed. Preference was given to prospective studies, but retrospective, cross-sectional, and case-control studies were also evaluated.

Results

Most densitometry studies completed to date have been limited by their design. Some cross-sectional studies that used both single-photon absorptiometry and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry have demonstrated preferential bone loss at cortical skeletal sites. Bone density seems to be relatively well preserved at cancellous bone sites. The absence of large prospective controlled trials makes it difficult to evaluate fracture incidence associated with hyperparathyroidism. Retrospective and case-control studies have found conflicting results relative to fracture incidence in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroidectomy has been shown to be of value in improving bone mineral density at both the lumbar spine and the femoral neck. Hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women with primary hyperparathyroidism has also been effective in improving bone mineral density and decreasing bone turnover. Bisphosphonates are currently being evaluated for effectiveness in improving bone mineral density and reducing the risk of fracture. Early results with alendronate treatment have demonstrated improvements in bone mass. Calcimimetic agents are a new treatment option that may become useful in the medical management of primary hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusion

Although conflicting findings have been reported, bone loss has been noted in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, especially at cortical skeletal sites. Medical management does not seem to be associated with increased morbidity or mortality in patients with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Bone densitometry is advised, particularly for monitoring of bone mass at the midradius or femoral neck, in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^abcfc4ee]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism

In the absence of hypercalcemia, the therapeutic approach depends on investigations regarding end-organ involvement. The decision for surgery should be in line with the indications for PTX in asymptomatic patients (Table 2), hence patients without significant bone or renal disease should follow a structured observational policy. Successful removal of the responsible parathyroid gland seems to normalize postoperative PTH levels. Koumakis et al showed that successful PTX in NPHPT patients with osteoporosis leads to increase in BMD at the spine and hip at 1 year, comparable to that observed in hypercalcemic counterparts. However, due to limited evidence, current guidelines do not recommend surgery for NPHPT.

### Normocalcaemic primary hyperparathyroidism: what is the role of parathyroid surgery? [^fd3394e3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Does surgical referral differ for nPHPT patients?

A key question remains as to whether nPHPT should be considered a different entity to hPHPT, or if they can be managed using a single approach. Whilst studies have reported that nPHPT presents differently to hPHPT, such as with a higher incidence of multi-glandular disease,– studies have also shown that a proportion of normocalcaemic patients will progress to hypercalcaemia. In line with this, a standardised approach to managing PHPT irrespective of serum calcium appears appropriate and the aforementioned NICE guidance for PHPT surgical referral remains applicable for nPHPT. However, it is important that discussions regarding surgery are individualised and patient expectations are comprehensively explored. This involves counselling the patient to ensure adequate understanding of both the positive (a reduction in end-organ effects) and adverse (risk of surgical complications) outcomes that may occur following surgery.

For clinicians, it is also important to avoid routinely screening PTH levels unless there is evidence to suggest measurement would be appropriate. This includes evidence of calcium homeostasis disturbance, renal dysfunction and occasionally if there is vitamin D deficiency.

Limitations of the current literature

Many of the studies investigating the role of surgery in the treatment of nPHPT consist of a relatively small cohort of patients. This is compounded by comparative studies in the field generally having a significantly larger number of hPHPT patients relative to nPHPT patients. Future studies should aim to analyse larger nPHPT cohorts, with comparative studies providing equal representation to nPHPT and hPHPT patients. Moreover, there is a need for large consortia based prospective registries of those managed both surgically and medically, with an extended follow up period of more than 10 years. This would enable the true natural history and adverse events of treatment to be observed, providing much needed clarity to clinicians.
