Hanson disease

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Hansen's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "Hanson disease" refers to and confirm the correct terminology. Then, I should verify the etiologic agents and pathophysiology. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and classification. After that, I need to check transmission and risk factors. Then, I will examine diagnostic strategies, including pitfalls and when to suspect leprosy. Finally, I will outline evidence-based treatment, monitoring for reactions, public health considerations, and special scenarios like immigration screening and zoonotic reservoirs, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "Hanson disease" is a common misnomer. The correct name is Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy, caused by Mycobacterium leprae and, less commonly, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, and it is a chronic infectious disease primarily affecting skin and peripheral nerves with potential ocular and nasal involvement [^9c18aa3c] [^d8028ef0].

> I need to verify the etiologic agents and pathophysiology. Historically attributed to M. leprae, a slow-growing obligate intracellular mycobacterium, recent literature documents M. lepromatosis as a second species causing clinically indistinguishable disease, particularly reported in diffuse lepromatous leprosy in Mesoamerica; both species respond to standard multidrug therapy, which is important for management decisions [^d8028ef0] [^69ed7bdd]. Host cell-mediated immunity determines the clinical spectrum, with tuberculoid disease reflecting robust CMI and lepromatous disease reflecting CMI deficiency and high bacillary burden, explaining the polar clinical forms and the role of genetic susceptibility in IFNG, TLR1, SOD2, and IL10 pathways [^3836e199] [^400a6ef3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about transmission. I initially thought skin-to-skin contact was a major route, but wait, let me verify the dominant mechanism. Person-to-person transmission is primarily via respiratory droplets from untreated multibacillary cases, with nasal secretions carrying high bacillary loads; prolonged close contact increases risk, and casual contact is not considered high risk, which corrects my initial assumption about skin contact being a primary route [^12009870] [^9c18aa3c]. I should also confirm zoonotic reservoirs: armadillos in the southern U.S. and Brazil are recognized reservoirs, and exposure to armadillos or their meat has been linked to human cases, which is a key epidemiologic point in certain regions [^3836e199].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations and classification. Skin findings include hypopigmented or erythematous macules, papules, nodules, and plaques, often with anesthesia; nerve involvement manifests as sensory loss, enlarged peripheral nerves, and motor deficits, with classic sites including the ulnar, median, posterior tibial, and greater auricular nerves; ocular involvement can lead to lagophthalmos and blindness, and nasal deformity may occur in advanced disease [^d5ea0d98] [^6f1f1075]. Classification is dichotomous into paucibacillary (PB, ≤ 5 lesions, negative slit-skin smear) and multibacillary (MB, ≥ 6 lesions or positive smear), which guides therapy duration and intensity; the Ridley-Jopling spectrum (TT, BT, BB, BL, LL) remains useful for pathophysiologic understanding but WHO PB/MB guides treatment [^6f1f1075] [^400a6ef3].

> I will now examine diagnostic strategy, and I need to ensure I don't overstate test utility. There is no reliable serologic test in routine U.S. practice; diagnosis is clinical plus histopathology, with slit-skin smears for bacillary index in MB disease and targeted PCR where available; in tuberculoid disease, AFB stains are often negative, so a compatible biopsy with nerve involvement supports the diagnosis even without organisms seen [^c0825256] [^6f1f1075]. But wait, what if the biopsy is nondiagnostic? In that case, repeating biopsy or obtaining nerve tissue can be decisive when suspicion remains high, especially in paucibacillary presentations [^c0825256].

> Let me think about treatment, and I should double-check regimen details. Standard multidrug therapy (MDT) is curative: for PB disease, 6 months of dapsone plus rifampin; for MB disease, 12 months of dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine; U.S. clinicians may coordinate care through the National Hansen's Disease Program for access to medications and expertise [^9c18aa3c] [^6f1f1075]. I should confirm that single-drug therapy is inappropriate due to resistance risk; indeed, monotherapy is not recommended, and emerging regimens like monthly rifampin–moxifloxacin–minocycline lack sufficient evidence to replace MDT at this time, so I need to caution against off-label adoption outside trials [^c0825256] [^e7070f6a].

> Next, I should review reactions and monitoring, because missing these can cause harm. Type 1 reversal reactions reflect upgrading of CMI and can cause acute neuritis and functional loss; type 2 erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) is an immune complex phenomenon in MB disease; both require prompt recognition and treatment with corticosteroids and, for ENL, thalidomide in selected cases, alongside continuation of MDT unless contraindicated [^400a6ef3]. I need to ensure we monitor for neuropathy progression and educate patients on self-care of anesthetic limbs to prevent injury and disability, which is a cornerstone of long-term management [^d5ea0d98].

> I should confirm public health and epidemiologic considerations. In the U.S., incidence is low but stable, with most cases in foreign-born persons and delays in diagnosis more common in that group; clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion for chronic skin lesions with anesthesia or enlarged nerves, especially in patients from endemic regions or with armadillo exposure [^fd8f2128] [^acad2629]. For immigration medical examinations, untreated MB disease is Class A, but after 7 days of appropriate therapy including daily rifampin, patients are reclassified to Class B, which is a practical detail for travel medicine and public health screening [^6f1f1075].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios so I don't miss anything important. In areas of low endemicity, misclassification of relapse is common; careful clinical reassessment and, when needed, repeat biopsy or PCR can prevent unnecessary retreatment and clarify true treatment failure versus reaction or alternative diagnoses [^notfound]. I should also emphasize that while M. lepromatosis is less common globally, clinicians should be aware of its existence and the fact that MDT remains effective regardless of species, which avoids delays in therapy while awaiting speciation [^d8028ef0] [^69ed7bdd].

> In summary, I need to ensure the key messages are explicit: Hansen's disease is a chronic mycobacterial infection of skin and nerves with a broad clinical spectrum driven by host immunity; diagnosis is clinical plus histopathology and, when appropriate, smears or PCR; curative MDT regimens differ by bacillary load; reactions are common and treatable; and U.S. clinicians should suspect it in patients with chronic anesthetic skin lesions or neuropathy, particularly if foreign-born or with armadillo exposure, to avoid delays that lead to disability [^9c18aa3c] [^d5ea0d98] [^fd8f2128] [^3836e199].

Hansen's disease, also known as **leprosy**, is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae [^9c18aa3c] that primarily affects the skin, peripheral nerves, and mucous membranes. It is **treatable and curable** with multidrug therapy (MDT) [^9c18aa3c], and early diagnosis prevents permanent nerve damage and disability [^acad2629]. Transmission is thought to occur via prolonged close contact through respiratory droplets, and most people have natural immunity; risk is higher in endemic areas and among close contacts of untreated cases [^12009870] [^3836e199]. Modern treatment regimens are highly effective, and patients are non-infectious after a few days of therapy, allowing normal social integration [^9c18aa3c].

---

## Etiology and pathogenesis

- **Causative organism**: Mycobacterium leprae, a slow-growing, obligate intracellular bacillus [^400a6ef3].
- **Transmission**: Prolonged close contact via respiratory droplets; skin-to-skin contact is not a major route [^12009870] [^3836e199].
- **Immune response**: Host cell-mediated immunity determines clinical spectrum; tuberculoid (paucibacillary) disease reflects strong immunity, while lepromatous (multibacillary) disease reflects weak immunity [^400a6ef3].

---

## Clinical manifestations

Hansen's disease presents along a spectrum, with **two main forms** — paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB) — distinguished by bacterial load and immune response [^6f1f1075].

| **Clinical feature** | **Paucibacillary (pb)** | **Multibacillary (mb)** |
|-|-|-|
| Number of lesions | 1–5 | ≥ 6 |
| Lesion characteristics | Hypopigmented, anesthetic macules or plaques | Multiple, symmetric, infiltrated nodules or plaques |
| Nerve involvement | Limited, localized | Extensive, symmetric |
| Bacillary load | Low (few bacilli) | High (many bacilli) |
| Complications | Minimal nerve damage | Severe nerve damage, deformities, blindness |

---

Common symptoms include **hypopigmented skin lesions with sensory loss**, thickened peripheral nerves, and loss of eyebrows or eyelashes [^d5ea0d98]. Untreated disease can lead to **permanent nerve damage**, deformities, and disability [^acad2629].

---

## Diagnosis

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by:

- **Clinical examination**: Identify characteristic skin lesions and nerve enlargement [^6f1f1075].
- **Slit-skin smear**: Detects acid-fast bacilli in MB disease [^c0825256].
- **Histopathology**: Skin biopsy showing granulomatous inflammation and nerve involvement [^836de812].
- **PCR**: Molecular detection of M. leprae DNA in equivocal cases [^c0825256].

---

## Treatment

Treatment relies on **multidrug therapy (MDT)** recommended by WHO, with regimens tailored to disease classification:

- **Paucibacillary (PB)**: Dapsone + Rifampicin for 6 months [^c0825256].
- **Multibacillary (MB)**: Dapsone + Rifampicin + Clofazimine for 12 months [^c0825256].
- **Effectiveness**: High cure rates; patients become non-infectious within days of starting therapy [^9c18aa3c].

---

## Prevention and public health

Prevention focuses on **early case detection**, contact tracing, and public education to reduce stigma [^c3fba898]. BCG vaccination offers partial protection, and **single-dose rifampicin** is used for chemoprophylaxis in close contacts [^c3fba898].

---

## Social stigma and misconceptions

Historically, Hansen's disease carried significant stigma, but modern treatment and education have greatly reduced transmission and disability [^c3fba898]. Common myths — such as the disease being highly contagious or incurable — are now dispelled; patients can live normal lives during and after treatment [^9c18aa3c].

---

Hansen's disease is a chronic infectious disease that is **curable with MDT** [^9c18aa3c]; early diagnosis and treatment prevent disability, and patients quickly become non-infectious, enabling full social integration [^9c18aa3c].

### Point-counterpoint: the FDA has a role in regulation of laboratory-developed tests [^37540200]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Since the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released its draft guidance on the regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) in October 2014, there has been a flurry of responses from commercial and hospital-based laboratory directors, clinicians, professional organizations, and diagnostic companies. The FDA defines an LDT as an "in vitrodiagnostic device that is intended for clinical use and is designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory". The draft guidance outlines a risk-based approach, with oversight of high-risk and moderate-risk tests being phased in over 9 years. High-risk tests would be regulated first and require premarket approval. Subsequently, moderate-risk tests would require a 510(k) premarket submission to the FDA and low-risk tests would need only to be registered. Oversight discretion would be exercised for LDTs focused on rare diseases (defined as fewer than 4,000 tests, not cases, per year nationally) and unmet clinical needs (defined as those tests for which there is no alternative FDA-cleared or -approved test). There was an open comment period followed by a public hearing in early January of 2015, and we are currently awaiting the final decision regarding the regulation of LDTs. Given that LDTs have been developed by many laboratories and are essential for the diagnosis and monitoring of an array of infectious diseases, changes in their regulation will have far-reaching implications for clinical microbiology laboratories. In this Point-Counterpoint, Angela Caliendo discusses the potential benefits of the FDA guidance for LDTs whereas Kim Hanson discusses the concerns associated with implementing the guidance and why these regulations may not improve clinical care.

### Context matters for disability and priority setting for musculoskeletal diseases: revisiting the egalitarian approach to disability weights and disability-adjusted life-years [^3770bf6e]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Poverty as a disease modifier

In the 1990s, when the DALY was developed, global health primarily focused on under-5 mortality, maternal mortality and mortality related to infectious diseases. Three decades later the epidemiological transition in LMICs has shifted attention from merely reducing mortality to reducing morbidity due to a wide variety of non-communicable diseases in addition to infectious disease. For many surgical conditions, especially those that affect disability much more than life expectancy, we would go further, stating that disability cannot be assessed without considering context, the healthcare system, and the wider social security system.

Musculoskeletal conditions have a more significant impact on people living in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) compared with high-income countries (HICs). These results are not surprising given resources such as wheelchairs, ramps, special education and specialised medical care that are available in high-income settings though sparse or completely unattainable in LMICs.

The argument that the impact of certain diseases is more significant in poorer countries and among poorer populations is not new. Both Anand and Hanson and King and Bertino argued that the impact of blindness and neglected tropical diseases is modified by poverty and that both diseases are valued as more impactful in areas without an accessible health system. Limited data from paediatric musculoskeletal diseases show a similar disease-modifying impact of poverty on disease impact.

In this context, it is important to note that poverty does not impact the severity of the disease itself, but rather modifies the severity of the impact experienced by patients. Available data from Mongolia suggests that the disease severity distribution of DDH is not different in a middle-income country than that of a HIC such as Sweden. Therefore, calculating different DWs for different severity levels of DDH, which is occurring for several diseases like HIV and multiple sclerosis, will not be able to capture the impact of poverty as a disease modifier as it does not impact the disease severity itself.

### Adolescence as a key developmental window for nutrition promotion and cardiometabolic disease prevention [^15fa6466]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Adolescence, or the window between 10 and 19.9 years of age, is a critical period of rapid development where adverse exposures (e.g. poor nutrition) can potentially increase the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) like obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome later in life. This aligns with The Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework, also known as the "Barker hypothesis", where biological programming during critical periods of development can alter homeostatic mechanisms regulating appetite and energy output. These changes may contribute to long-term metabolic disruptions and, ultimately, lead to CMDs. Traditionally, DOHaD has emphasized the "first 1000 days" — the period from conception to age two years — as a window for nutritional programming and chronic disease prevention. More recently, DOHaD scholars have broadened this view to include adolescence as a biologically sensitive and socially meaningful life stage. For example, Hanson and Gluckman conceptualized adolescence as a key opportunity to influence both individual and intergenerational health trajectories. Paton et al. further detailed how pubertal and post-pubertal transitions represent windows for environmental imprinting.

However, despite these important theoretical contributions, adolescence remains underrepresented in the nutrition-specific operationalization of the DOHaD framework. Compared to early life stages, there are few global nutrition strategies, longitudinal cohorts, or interventional studies that explicitly position adolescence as a target for DOHaD-informed action. This gap is particularly striking given that adolescence is a period marked by increased nutritional demands, hormonal shifts, and behavioral transitions, all of which can influence long-term cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk. Described as an "invisible epidemic", the incidence of CMDs and the prevalence of related risk factors such as suboptimal diets are rapidly rising, creating global social and economic burdens. Addressing CMDs has emerged as a global priority in the Sustainable Development Goals (Target 3.4) and was the focus of a third UN high-level meeting; however adolescence has not been considered as a critical window for prioritized interventions.

Future research, policy and practice

Adolescence is a critical life stage where diet-related behaviors are formed, making interventions guided by DOHaD principles essential to curb cardiometabolic disease. Nutrition is one of the most well-studied factors in the human epigenome. However, research on the dynamic mechanisms behind the long-term health effects of adolescent dietary exposures, and how these might differ by sex, is still in its infancy. While conceptual models such as those presented by Hanson and Gluckman acknowledge adolescence as a key developmental stage, few global research agendas, public health strategies, or intergenerational DOHaD initiatives have translated this understanding into actionable frameworks. Our paper aims to bridge this gap by providing concrete evidence and mechanisms linking adolescent nutrition with both current and future health outcomes. We propose that future DOHaD research and programming must explicitly include adolescence in design, funding priorities, cohort studies, and mechanistic work.

First, high-quality longitudinal studies, especially in LMICs, are needed to investigate how nutritional exposures during adolescent influence the development of cardiometabolic diseases in adulthood. This also includes intergenerational studies to determine the intergenerational effects of adolescent nutrition by examining how parental nutrition during adolescence affects the health outcomes of future generations. Sex-driven effects also need to be investigated to understand whether nutritional exposures during adolescence have differential effects on males and females in terms of disease susceptibility, metabolic health, and developmental trajectories.

Second, nutritional interventions targeted at adolescents are needed to optimize health outcomes across the life course. This will evaluate the efficacy of dietary interventions, supplementation strategies, and lifestyle modifications in improving metabolic health, reducing disease risk, and promote overall well-being. In addition, food environment factors need to be considered to investigate how access to nutritious foods and food insecurity influence dietary patterns, nutritional intake, and health disparities during adolescence and beyond.

### Dynamic functional network reconfiguration underlying the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and autism spectrum disorder [^1fb2dc6f]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia (SZ) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are among many psychiatric and neurological disorders that share overlapping clinical features and similar brain alterations (Konstantareas & Hewitt, 2001). They are both associated with cognitive problems, social withdrawal, and communication impairment, neurodevelopment alterations, and genetic mutations (Association AP, 2013). Early on, they were regarded as the same disorder but in different stages, with ASD manifesting as an earlier phase of SZ (Eisenberg & Kanner, 1956). Individuals with ASD are more likely to have a family history of SZ (Sullivan et al. 2012) and also have increased liability for psychosis (Kincaid, Doris, Shannon, & Mulholland, 2017). Although current diagnostic approaches maintain a nosological distinction between SZ and ASD, their underlying relationship, and neural origins are far from clear. Functional connectivity derived from fMRI is one of the powerful neuroimaging techniques that allow brain configuration abnormalities to be assessed in mental disorders. Studies of brain connectivity have yielded many reliable indicators of brain disorders, with the potential to support early diagnosis and treatment (Arbabshirani, Plis, Sui, & Calhoun, 2017; Greicius, 2008; Koshino et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2008; Whitfield‐Gabrieli et al. 2009). Both SZ and ASD have functional connectivity abnormalities as core disease features reported in previous studies. However, only a few works favor both diseases within a single study, showing most of the common and divergent connectivity alterations in default mode, salience, and motor networks (Chen, Uddin, et al. 2017; Mastrovito, Hanson, & Hanson, 2018; Yoshihara et al. 2020). These studies also have limitations, given that they are based on static connectivity which unfortunately represents a gross oversimplification (Allen et al. 2014). Considering the dynamic nature of the brain, the time‐varying characteristics of functional connectivity are believed to unveil pathophysiology in brain disorders ignored by its static counterpart. Indeed, several existing studies have implied potential similar abnormalities in brain dynamics between SZ and ASD. For example, Damaraju et al. showed that SZ patients have significantly longer dwell times in sparse‐connected states and disrupted thalamocortical connectivity in a state‐specific manner (Damaraju et al. 2014). Similarly, an ASD study found that individuals with ASD have longer dwell time in the weak‐connected states and transient increased thalamic‐sensory connectivity within dynamic states (Fu et al. 2019). The larger variations of dynamic functional connectivity were identified in both SZ (Ma, Calhoun, Phlypo, & Adali, 2014; Yue et al. 2018) and ASD (Chen, Nomi, Uddin, Duan, & Chen, 2017; Harlalka, Bapi, Vinod, & Roy, 2019), showing strong correspondence with the disease‐related hypoconnectivity. The temporal patterns in functional connectivity were suggested to help distinguish SZ from ASD and controls in a recent study (Rabany et al. 2019). The above‐mentioned findings support that studying the dynamic brain reconfiguration for these two disorders, especially from different spatial perspectives is important for clarifying the relationship between SZ and ASD in their brain dynamics, behavioral aspects, and cognitive deficits.

### Echoes of early life: recent insights from mathematical modeling [^40850242]. Child Development (2018). Low credibility.

The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) framework is having interdisciplinary impact, inspiring research in diverse fields, such as medical and clinical science, developmental psychobiology, and public health. One influential hypothesis within DOHaD states that fetal and early postnatal experience prepare individuals for the environment they are likely to encounter in adulthood (Bateson, 2001; Bateson et al. 2004; Gluckman & Hanson, 2010; Gluckman, Hanson, & Spencer, 2005). Such predictive adaptive responses (PARs) are thought to be adaptive if early and adult environmental conditions match (e.g. intrauterine undernutrition reliably predicts famine in adulthood). If, however, conditions change during the lifetime, individuals might develop phenotypes that do not match their adult environment to some degree (developmental mismatch), which can produce detrimental outcomes, including impaired physical and mental health. We refer to this idea as the PAR‐mismatch hypothesis. Although scholars who promote adaptive hypotheses in the DOHaD literature view phenotype–environment mismatch as one of several reasons why evolved mechanisms of plasticity may produce maladaptive outcomes (Conradt et al. 2018; Hanson & Gluckman, 2014; Kuzawa & Quinn, 2009), it is a reason that is often given considerable explanatory prominence.

The best‐known application of the PAR‐mismatch hypothesis is the idea that intrauterine starvation prompts the development of altered insulin function and glucose metabolism (Barker, 1994). These changes can lead to diabetes and hypertension, and so are often seen as pathological. However, according to the PAR hypothesis, the negative effects are due not to the early conditions per se but the mismatch between the early conditions and the later environment (in which, in affluent societies, resources are usually plentiful). The metabolic changes would actually be beneficial if individuals went on to experience chronic or temporary starvation in adulthood (Bateson, 2001; Bateson et al. 2004; Gluckman & Hanson, 2010; Gluckman et al. 2005). Consistent with this view are studies showing that the harmful effects of early starvation are in some cases attenuated or even absent if, matching early‐life conditions, the adult environment continues to be lacking in resources (e.g. Stanner & Yudkin, 2001).

### Hansen's disease… [^6f1f1075]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Hansen's Disease Screening Overview Hansen's disease is an infectious, chronic bacterial disease that primarily affects the skin and peripheral nerves. Specific skin lesions are characteristic of the disease. Note: Patients with multibacillary or paucibacillary Hansen's disease are considered to be Class A. However, after 7 days of treatment, they may be re-classified as Class B. Disease categorization is based on clinical evaluation and follows the World Health Organization categorization scheme. Physical Examination The physical exam must include a search for signs and lesions consistent with Hansen's disease. These would include any of the following:

- Any anesthetic skin patches, with or without visible lesions
- Localized skin lesions
- Raised, flat, or nodular
- Light or pigmented
- Sensory loss in lesion or on fingers or toes
- Painless wounds or burns
- Thickened peripheral nerves.
- Loss of eyebrows
- Thickening of earlobes
- Atrophied hand muscles
- Lagophthalmos
- Perforated nasal septum
- Acid-fact bacilli in lesion.
- These Ridley-Jopling categories of Hansen's disease correspond to the WHO category of multibacillary disease assigned overseas to individuals with 6 or more lesions.
- Report untreated BB, BL, or LL disease as a Class A condition on the Medical Examination for Immigrant or Refugee Applicant Form.
- Report treated or partially-treated BB, BL, or LL disease as Class B condition on the I-693 form.
- Consider the applicant untreated unless he/she has had at least 7 days of recommended therapy which must include daily rifampin. Once the applicant has completed at least 7 days of therapy and appropriate treatment is considered underway, he/she should be reported as Class B for Hansen's disease. Indeterminate, tuberculoid, and borderline tuberculoid.
- Consider the applicant untreated unless he/she has had at least 7 days of recommended therapy which must include daily rifampin. Once the applicant has completed at least 7 days of therapy and appropriate treatment is considered underway, he/she should be reported as Class B for Hansen's disease.

### Reduced cone density is associated with multiple sclerosis [^a1aa471b]. Ophthalmology Science (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Up to 80% of patients with MS will experience ocular pathology during their disease course. In the eye, MS is reported to be associated with the degeneration of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). However, degeneration of the inner retinal layers does not fully explain the visual deterioration in MS patients. For example, the correlations between inner retinal thinning and impaired visual function are mild to moderate at best. In addition, Hanson et aldid not find a relationship between inner retinal layer thickness and electroretinogram values. However, previous studies did not report outer retinal changes in MS. In the Belfast Eye and MS study, we analyzed inner and outer retinal changes using OCT and examined photoreceptor changes using adaptive optics (AO) imaging. To our knowledge, this is the first report examining outer retinal changes, in detail, in patients with MS.

### Neuronal pentraxin 2: a synapse-derived CSF biomarker in genetic frontotemporal dementia [^611ff44a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study of a large international cohort of genetic FTD reports low levels of NPTX2, NPTX1 and NPTXR in the symptomatic stage, with correlations between NPTX2 and both disease severity and grey matter volume. We propose NPTX2 as a novel synapse-derived biomarker of disease progression in genetic FTD.

The decreased levels of CSF NPTXs in patients with GRN -associated, C9orf72 -associated and MAPT -associated FTD probably reflect a loss or dysfunction of their synaptic sources. Complexes of NPTXs accumulate at excitatory synapses between glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum.NPTXs modulate the strength of these synapses through recruitment of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) to the postsynaptic membrane, thereby regulating excitatory drive of pyramidal neurons onto PV-interneurons.PV-interneurons in turn contact surrounding pyramidal neurons and prevent neural circuits from becoming too active (diagram provided in Hanson). The expression of NPTX2 — but not NPTX1 or NPTXR — is induced by synapse activity, and the relative ratio of the NPTXs in the complex is dynamically dependent on the neuron's activity. Of the three proteins, NPTX2 is most effective at AMPAR recruitment, but their combined expression is synergistic. NPTX2 knockout mice have reduced AMPARs, resulting in less inhibitory PV-interneuron activity; the subsequent disruption of pyramidal neuron — PV-interneuron circuits is thought to underlie cognitive impairment, and NPTX2 loss has been hypothesised to drive neurodegeneration. Restoring these circuits is emerging as a potential treatment strategy in neurodegenerative disease; in this regard, measuring NPTX2 in CSF could be especially relevant to select and monitor patients with aberrant pyramidal neuron-PV interneuron circuits. The lack of correlation in the current study between NPTX2 and brain volume in healthy non-carriers reflects that NPTX2 is not merely a measure of synapse density.

### Human African trypanosomiasis in a rural community, democratic republic of Congo [^8eeb6966]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Calculating DALYs

Calculations were based on the recommendations of Murray. The total number of DALYs caused by a specific disease is defined as the sum of years lost by the premature death (years of life lost [YLL]) of patients and the number of years lived with the disability (YLD) adjusted for the severity of the disability. We used the calculation method, discount rate of 0.03, age weighting factor of 0.04, and age weight modulating factor of 1 proposed by Fox-Rushby and Hanson and present results with and without age weighting.

YLD for each patient was estimated from the questionnaire, and the results were combined to obtain the total number of YLD. To estimate YLL, age categories spanning 5 years were used.

The life tables for each age group were estimated by using Population Analysis Spreadsheets software (International Programs Center, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC, USA). Data on age distribution, sex ratio, and crude mortality rate were derived from the 2004 international database of the US Census Bureau.

When these calculations are used, the number of DALYs may be underestimated because of the poor sensitivity of the active case-finding rounds. Our exhaustive household survey and interviews with health workers did not entirely correct for this bias because the case definition used for verbal autopsy was specific and mainly applied to patients with more advanced disease. We tried to correct for this by supposing that each undetected case-patient will eventually die. On the basis of observations of Robays et al. we estimated that the effectiveness of the active case finding was 60% per round and that 40% of the cases could not be detected.

### Resting-state functional connectivity of the human hippocampus in periadolescent children: associations with age and memory performance [^76d8b717]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

Measuring periadolescent changes in brain networks is important because adolescence marks the last epoch of substantial cognitive and brain development prior to the relative stability of early adulthood (Dahl, 2004; Faghiri, Stephen, Wang, Wilson, & Calhoun, 2017; Fair et al. 2008; Giedd, 2008; Lenroot & Giedd, 2006; Stevens, Pearlson, & Calhoun, 2009). Concretely, periadolescent cognitive development has been hypothesized to rely on increased segregation between functional brain networks coupled with increased integration within those networks (Fair et al. 2008; Johnson, 2001; Menon, 2013; Stevens et al. 2009). This putative trajectory means that adolescence may present unique opportunities for identifying brain‐network measures related to developmental status (Nielsen et al. 2019) as well as for discriminating healthy normal development from neurological or psychiatric disease (Lenroot & Giedd, 2006; Uddin, Supekar, & Menon, 2010; Volkow et al. 2018). The hippocampus could have special relevance for the latter because the structure is vulnerable to many disease processes (e.g. epilepsy, depression, schizophrenia, and, in old age, Alzheimer's disease) (Hare et al. 2018; Joëls, 2009; MacMaster & Kusumakar, 2004; Mohamed et al. 2001; van Erp et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2008) and detrimental environmental influences (e.g. stress, trauma, and prenatal alcohol exposure) (Carrion, Weems, & Reiss, 2007; Hanson et al. 2015; Jackowski, de Araújo, de Lacerda, de Jesus, & Kaufman, 2009; Uecker & Nadel, 1996). These vulnerabilities further motivate the study of healthy normal hippocampal development — including its intrinsic functional connectivity — with the goal of beginning to establish normative expectations for adolescent variation. Notably, evaluating hippocampal intrinsic functional connectivity as a relevant, valid biomarker for disease in adolescent populations would be beyond the scope of a single study. However, the broader potential of intrinsic functional brain network measures as biomarkers has been discussed extensively (Damoiseaux, 2012; Hohenfeld, Werner, & Reetz, 2018; Zhang & Raichle, 2010) albeit with important caveats regarding the reliability of and approach to measuring resting‐state functional connectivity (rs‐FC; Ciric et al. 2017; Noble, Scheinost, & Constable, 2019).

### Genetic disease since 1945 [^99daeb3a]. Nature Reviews: Genetics (2000). Medium credibility.

Although hereditary disease has been recognized for centuries, only recently has it become the prevailing explanation for numerous human pathologies. Before the 1970s, physicians saw genetic disease as rare and irrelevant to clinical care. But, by the 1990s, genes seemed to be critical factors in virtually all human disease. Here I explore some perspectives on how and why this happened, by looking at two genetic diseases — familial dysautonomia and phenylketonuria.

### Fulminant hepatic failure associated with propylthiouracil [^6776f4b9]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 2 fatal cases of fulminant hepatic failure associated with propylthiouracil treatment against hyperthyroidism.

Case Summary

Two women, 30 and 32 years old with no previous liver disease, were treated with propylthiouracil against Graves' disease. Both patients developed jaundice after a 4- and 5-month treatment period, respectively. The disease was similar to viral hepatitis, with a progressive course to severe liver dysfunction and death, along with multisystem organ failure despite extensive therapeutic measures. One of the patients was pregnant and subsequently miscarried. Neither patient had a history of alcoholism, drug abuse, blood transfusion, or exposure to hepatitis A, B, or C. Extrahepatic obstruction was ruled out with an abdominal ultrasonogram. Serologic studies and immunologic tests were negative. A submassive necrosis was shown in a postmortem histologic study.

Discussion

Naranjo probability scale criteria applied to both cases confirm the adverse reactions as probable. These cases fit the requirements of drug hepatotoxicity proposed by Hanson and the Council of the International Organization of Medical Sciences. Eight deaths associated to propylthiouracil were found in our review of the medical literature up to December 2000.

Conclusions

Despite the widespread use of propylthiouracil, fulminant hepatitis with death is exceptionally rare; these 2 cases could be added to the fatal outcomes published to date.

### Prenatal influences on postnatal neuroplasticity: integrating DOHaD and sensitive / critical period frameworks to understand biological embedding in early development [^9a6f73b9]. Infancy (2024). Medium credibility.

The DOHaD framework of biological embedding emerged with a focus on how prenatal experiences change prenatal physiology and function with consequences for postnatal development and health outcomes into adulthood, especially with respect to the emergence of non‐communicable diseases and physical health conditions (Barker et al; Eriksson; Eriksson et al; Hanson; Jazwiec & Sloboda; Leguizamon; Silveira et al; Uauy et al; Wadhwa et al.). Extensive research within the DOHaD framework has linked prenatal environmental conditions such as nutritional profiles (e.g. protein‐energy malnutrition ‐ Ozanne & Hales; Remacle et al; iron deficiency ‐ Barks et al; Doom & Georgieff,) and substance exposures (e.g. alcohol ‐ Asiedu et al; Lunde et al; nicotine ‐ Aagaard‐Tillery et al.) to fetal and early postnatal phenotypes (e.g. birthweight ‐ Aagaard‐Tillery et al; Tellapragada et al.). These early postnatal phenotypes are then associated with subsequent adult health conditions (e.g. cardiovascular or metabolic disease; Alves & Alves; Asiedu et al; Barker et al; De Boo & Harding; Gluckman & Hanson; Hanson; Lunde et al; Remacle et al; Silveira et al.) to identify the lasting effects of those prenatal environmental conditions within the DOHaD framework. Postnatal environmental conditions also play a role within the DOHaD framework, in that prenatal changes and adaptations in response to experiences in utero may lead to especially poor health outcomes when the postnatal environmental cues do not match the prenatal environmental cues (Bateson et al; Gluckman & Hanson). However, there has been less focus on postnatal plasticity and adaptation within the DOHaD framework, especially with respect to the brain and mental health (though see Monk & Fernández; Van den Bergh).

### Visual impairment and retinal and brain neurodegeneration: a population-based study [^556c44e0]. Human Brain Mapping (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings are in line with previous studies reporting an association between visual impairment and transneuronal degeneration along the visual pathway (Boucard et al; Hanson et al; Hernowo et al; Malania et al.). Our finding of an association between visual impairment and both total and hippocampal atrophy corroborates previous reports of a link between visual and cognitive impairment (Chen et al; Lee et al.). We also observed that retinal neurodegeneration partly mediates the association between visual impairment and brain structural integrity. Although the association between visual impairment and retinal neurodegeneration is likely to be bidirectional, we specifically assessed mediation through GCL volume, which can be interpreted as how visual impairment could affect brain structure independently of (causes related to) inner retinal thinning, such as transneuronal neurodegeneration. Indeed, retinal neurodegeneration was associated with decreased structural integrity measures across the entire visual pathway, which also partly mediated the association between retinal neurodegeneration and both total brain and hippocampal atrophy. Our findings support the notion that retinal neurodegeneration, in part reflecting visual impairment, may reflect changes in the visual pathway up to and including the occipital lobe, leading to decreased activation and degeneration of other interconnected brain regions, ultimately resulting in cerebral atrophy and cognitive decline.

Several studies describing retinal changes in neurological diseases such as Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis, have hypothesized involvement of the visual system in the pathophysiology of these disorders (Chan et al; Mckee et al; Mirzaei et al.). For example, in Alzheimer disease, visual areas are a primary site of amyloid deposition, while visuospatial symptoms even predominate in the posterior cortical atrophy variant of the disease (Mckee et al; Mirzaei et al.). Moreover, retinal and brain amyloid deposition might be correlated, with the highest correlation seen in the pericalcarine lobe (Koronyo et al.). Our observation that the direct effect between retinal neurodegeneration and brain atrophy was consistently larger in magnitude than the indirect effect through visual pathway structures, suggests that apart from transneuronal degeneration, other (shared) etiopathological mechanisms may also account for part of the association. Neuronal damage, due to aging or other pathologies, might lead to neuronal death which is reflected in degeneration of both retinal and cerebral structures. Retinal neurodegeneration therefore also likely reflects central neurodegeneration, independently of visual pathway decay (Garzone et al.). Studies investigating retinal changes in brain diseases with predominant visual involvement and including more granular measures of visual function could further elucidate this relationship.

### Reduced anogenital distance, hematuria and left renal hypoplasia in a patient with 13q33.1–34 deletion: case report and literature review [^e64c4fdb]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Previously reported cases and studies suggested that 13q33.1–34 deletion was closely associated with congenital heart diseases (CHD) and approximately 50% of the patients had CHD. CHD in 13q deletion syndrome is more complex than in isolated cases and of the complexity comes from the presence of DORV, Tetralogy of Fallot, at least 2 heart anomalies in one patient or rare type complex heart anomalies. The complexity suggests that multiple genes may be involved in its pathogenesis. Huang et al. hypothesized that a 6 Mb region of 13q33.1-q34 may contain a critical region for cardiac development, and some researchers proposed COL4A1 and COL4A2 to be the possible candidate genes. These two OMIM genes may contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases. COL4A1 and COL4A2 are one of three pairs of paralogous genes that constitute type IV collagen. These two genes are ubiquitously expressed in the basement membrane, during early stages of development. Mutations of COL4A1 and COL4A2 are increasingly recognized as causes of multisystem disorders. The spectrum of COL4A1-related disorders includes: 1) brain small vessel disease 1 with or without ocular anomalies, 2) hereditary angiopathy with nephropathy, aneurysms, and muscle cramps, 3) susceptibility to intracerebral hemorrhage, 4) tortuosity of retinal arteries, 5) autosomal dominant pontine microangiopathy and leukoencephalopathy. The spectrum of COL4A2-related disorders includes brain small vessel disease 2 and susceptibility to intracerebral hemorrhage. Environmental factors or other genetic modifications may also influence the phenotypic expression and the severity of the organs' involvement in the related disease. The studies by Schenke Leyland et al. and Hanson et al. demonstrated that type IV collagen played a vital role in early cardiac development. Nonetheless, there was still no direct evidence that could prove the exact relationship between CHD and these 2 genes. Approximately 50% of patients with deletions of COL4A1 and COL4A2 did not have congenital heart defects but our patient belonged to the other 50% who did suffer from CHD (in her case were VSD and PDA). However, her heart defects healed spontaneously during the process of her development. Hence, we believe that children with chromosome abnormalities can also spontaneously recover from mild congenital heart disease the same way as normal children.

### Experiences, perspectives and expectations of adolescents with juvenile idiopathic arthritis regarding future work participation; a qualitative study [^caf7346b]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

This result confirmed earlier research which stated that plans after high school of patients with JIA did not deviate from healthy peers. Hanson et al. also mentioned that some young people were highly committed to their career choice and willing to overcome barriers caused by JIA. On the other hand, it contradicts a study by Walter et al. which showed around half of their participants (n = 154, mean age 20) had taken JIA into account when choosing their career. Additionally, Tong et al. identified the subtheme 'resourcefulness', roughly meaning accepting limitations and seeking alternative activities in leisure activities and vocational opportunities.

With this study, we purposively chose this age category to give insight in the perspectives before entering the labour market. Consequently we assume not all participants had reached vocational adaptability. Still, not considering JIA in future career planning seems a rather naïve attitude which appears to be in close association with the hope or belief that JIA will subside. Unfortunately many patients will not achieve remission, although the remission rate increases with disease duration, from 7% at 18 months, 40% after a minimum of 10 years up to 59% after a follow-up of 30 years. Another reason mentioned for patients not to consider JIA in their future plans, is the variability in disease course, which, at this point, cannot be predicted. RA is comparable in its variability. A study on behavioural coping in RA showed that letting the disease influence the choice of a job was a high preventive factor in withdrawal from the labour force. This underlines the need for discussing vocation with adolescents with JIA.

Transition includes disease education and support in self-management. The influence of the disease on everyday life and how this changes while becoming an adult, is thought to be equally important. The European League Against Rheumatism / Paediatric Rheumatology European Society (EULAR/PReS) considers the subject of vocation part of holistic care and therefore an important subject in the transition process towards adult care. Discussing vocational aspects with patients such as developing skills in disclosure and career prospects, are therefore recommended. Based on our study we advise healthcare professionals to start this conversation in early adolescence. Thus creating awareness for the barriers and opportunities in future work participation before choices are made regarding career planning.

### International consensus on differential diagnosis and management of patients with danon disease: JACC state-of-the-art review [^c8315a34]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Danon disease is a rare X-linked autophagic vacuolar cardioskeletal myopathy associated with severe heart failure that can be accompanied with extracardiac neurologic, skeletal, and ophthalmologic manifestations. It is caused by loss of function variants in the LAMP2 gene and is among the most severe and penetrant of the genetic cardiomyopathies. Most patients with Danon disease will experience symptomatic heart failure. Male individuals generally present earlier than women and die of either heart failure or arrhythmia or receive a heart transplant by the third decade of life. Herein, the authors review the differential diagnosis of Danon disease, diagnostic criteria, natural history, management recommendations, and recent advances in treatment of this increasingly recognized and extremely morbid cardiomyopathy.

### Mitochondrial disease: mimics and chameleons [^4aa21e55]. Practical Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Mitochondrial diseases are inherited disorders of oxidative phosphorylation that present with a multitude of clinical features in different combinations and with various inheritance patterns. To complicate the issue further, the clinical features of mitochondrial disorders overlap with common neurological and non-neurological diseases. This presents a diagnostic challenge: when is a rare mitochondrial disease responsible for a more 'common or garden' neurological presentation, and how often are neurologists missing them in routine clinical practice? Here, we briefly review some common clinical features associated with mitochondrial disease, and provide some clues as to how patients with these mitochondrial disorders might be identified. We discuss both 'chameleons'-mitochondrial disorders that may look like something else, and 'mimics'-other conditions that may clinically resemble mitochondrial disease. The diagnosis sometimes needs highly specialised tests, but the advent of 'next generation' sequencing will simplify the clinical approach over the next few years.

### Environmental epigenetics: prospects for studying epigenetic mediation of exposure-response relationships [^9f489e73]. Human Genetics (2012). Low credibility.

Metabolic diseases

Functional epigenetic changes have been observed in obesity (Campion et al.), diabetes (Reddy and Natarajan), cardiovascular disease (Wierda et al.), and the constellation of abnormalities known as metabolic syndrome (Bruce and Hanson). For example, adverse vascular effects of hyperglycemia can continue for several years following sufficient glycemic control, a phenomenon called metabolic memory (Siebel et al.), and there is evidence from animal studies that this effect is associated with epigenetic changes in the promoter of the NFκβ subunit of the p65 gene in aortic endothelial cells (El-Osta et al.) and increased acetylation at H3K9/K14 in a number of genes involved in endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation (Pirola et al.). In women, promoter-region methylation of GNSAS and INSIGF in leucocytes was reportedly associated with an increased incidence of myocardial infarction (Talens et al.), suggesting that epigenetic modification may be clinically relevant. Although various histone modifications have been demonstrated in vitro in relation to complications of hyperglycemia (Wierda et al.), permanence of individual changes has not been established.

Neurological disorders

Historically, the field of epigenetics has focused on elucidating mechanisms for maintaining DNA methylation in dividing cells. However, recent work has discovered dynamic DNA methylation changes in non-dividing cells including neurons (reviewed in Mill et al.), motivating studies of effects of environmental exposures on epigenetic marks in relation to neurological disorders.

Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorders show a variety of epigenetic anomalies (Akbarian; Mill et al; Nguyen et al; Schroeder et al.). An epigenetic mechanism has been proposed to explain the association between famine during the prenatal period and schizophrenia risk (Lumey et al.), as well as associations between expression of imprinted genes and both autism and schizophrenia (Badcock and Crespi). Recent studies, moreover, report associations of both conditions with DNA methylation in additional, non-imprinted genes (Dempster et al; Mill et al; Nagarajan et al; Schroeder et al.).

### The single nucleotide polymorphism rs11643718 in SLC12A3 is associated with the development of diabetic kidney disease in Chinese people with type 2 diabetes [^6d22eff8]. Diabetic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, nearly 425 million people are affected by diabetes mellitus, and the estimated population living with diabetes will be 629 million in 2045 [1]. With the rapid increase in type 2 diabetes incidence, the numbers of people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and end‐stage renal disease are also increasing [2]. Although glycaemic control and blood pressure management have reduced the proportion of individuals with diabetes who progress to DKD and end‐stage renal disease, these measures do not eliminate the risk of DKD [3, 4, 5]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that family aggregation exists in DKD [6], indicating that genetic factors may contribute to the development and progression of DKD.

In recent years, as a result of the development of genetic methods, numerous candidate gene association studies and genome‐wide association studies have been conducted, and some of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are related to DKD susceptibility have been identified [7]. The rs2268388 SNP in the ACACB gene is one of the most widely studied SNPs in DKD. The relationship of this SNP with DKD was first reported by a genome‐wide association study in Japan [8] and was then validated by candidate gene association studies in Asian Indian [9] and Chinese populations [10]. In addition, SNPs in genes such as ELMO1 [11, 12], CNDP1 [13], CNDP2 [13], MTHFR [14] and SLC12A3 [15, 16] were also recognized as DKD‐related SNPs. Nevertheless, the effects of some SNPs are still controversial. Leak et al. [17] and Hanson et al. [18] found that SNPs in ELMO1 (i.e. rs1345365, rs1981740 and rs10951509) were related to DKD. Unfortunately, the directions of association in these two studies were completely opposite. Moreover, due to racial differences and genetic backgrounds, whether these reported loci play a role in Chinese Han populations remains to be further confirmed.

In the present study, we selected 24 candidate SNPs mainly from studies in East Asian populations, the results of which mostly differed among studies or which had large reported odds ratios (ORs) suggesting deleteriousness, and aimed to verify the associations between these SNPs and DKD in a Chinese population with type 2 diabetes.

### Natural history of danon disease [^0a20edd3]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Danon disease is a rare but serious cardiac and skeletal myopathy leading to substantial morbidity and early mortality due to arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy. The X-linked nature of inheritance accounts for reported differences in phenotypic severity between men and women. The rarity of Danon disease has limited understanding of the complete phenotype. Clinical estimates of ages of disease onset and survival based on gender have not been published.

Methods and Results

We present data on 82 patients with Danon disease from 36 families, the largest series to date. Men were severely affected with cognitive disabilities (100%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (88%), and muscle weakness (80%). Men had a high morbidity and were unlikely to reach the age of 25 years without a cardiac transplantation. Women were less severely affected but reported higher than expected levels of cognitive (47%) and skeletal muscle complaints (50%) and manifesting an equal prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Combining our data with that of 63 other Danon disease case reports in the literature, the average ages of first symptom, cardiac transplantation, and death were 12.1, 17.9, and 19.0 years in men and 27.9, 33.7, and 34.6 years in women, respectively.

Conclusion

These data more broadly illuminate the Danon disease phenotype and should prove useful to physicians working with and providing genetic counseling to families with Danon disease. Women with Danon disease present with clinical symptoms and events approximately 15 years after men and report a higher proportion of cognitive and skeletal muscle problems than previously recognized.

### Exposure to the Chinese famine in early life and the risk of metabolic syndrome in adulthood [^b5b24aca]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

We found that exposure to Chinese famine during fetal life and early childhood was associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome in later life. These associations were stronger in subjects who had a Western dietary pattern and subjects who were overweight in adulthood.

Barker et al. and Gluckman and Hanson suggested that environmental factors during fetal life and infancy play a role in the origin of the metabolic syndrome and its components. A mismatch between fetal and postnatal environments might exacerbate this effect. To support this hypothesis, the Dutch famine study found that prenatal exposure to famine was associated with higher BMI, higher waist circumference, lower glucose tolerance, higher risk of coronary heart disease, more atherogenic lipid profile, and increased levels of plasma fibrinogen in later life. Men who had experienced the siege of Leningrad (1941–1944) during early life had increased mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke in their adulthood. Early life exposure to Chinese famine (1959–1961) was also associated with the increased risk of overweight, hyperglycemia, and hypertension in adult life. The current study provides further evidence that both fetal and infant exposure to severe famine increased the clustering of the metabolic risk factors that predispose a person to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

The association between fetal exposure to famine and higher risk of metabolic syndrome was exacerbated by a nutritionally rich environment in later life represented by Western dietary pattern and overweight. This dietary pattern was characterized by high intake of meat, eggs, dairy, sugary beverages, and edible oils and a low intake of vegetables. Our results provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the mismatch between the early life starve environment and later life rich environment magnified the risk of metabolic diseases in later life.

A potential limitation of this study is resident migration across different regions in China, which might lead to misclassification of famine exposure. However, the mobility of the population in rural China is relatively low because relocation of permanent residents needed to be approved by authorities. According to the 2000 China National Population Census, only 2.68% of the rural population lived in provinces other than their birthplaces. Therefore, we do not expect that intraprovince migration led to serious misclassification in famine exposure. Another limitation of our study is the lack of birth weight data, which precludes us from examining the interactions between birth weight and adult overweight or dietary patterns on risk of metabolic syndrome.

### Incidence of hansen's disease – United States, 1994–2011 [^acad2629]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

HD can lead to severe nerve and tissue damage if treatment is delayed for months or years; for this reason it is important to recognize this disease and begin treatment as early as possible. While most patients were diagnosed within 1 year of the onset of symptoms, many patients had symptoms for many years before diagnosis. Foreign-born persons were at the highest risk for delayed diagnosis.

The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, data are limited to those patients reported to NHDP. § This program not only collects information from outside providers regarding HD diagnoses, but also provides free medications to HD patients within the United States. As a result, it is expected that most patients with HD in the United States are reported to NHDP. Second, data regarding the onset of symptoms are limited by patient recall; many patients report the onset of symptoms many years before contact with NHDP. It is possible that some of the symptoms they attribute to HD might have been caused by other diseases or problems.

To decrease HD in the United States, diagnosis and treatment needs to be improved among persons in the United States who were born in countries where there is a high prevalence of HD and also in those countries themselves. Clinicians throughout the United States should be aware of the signs and symptoms of HD and know that HD exists in the United States. It is important to consider this disease when evaluating chronic skin conditions, especially those with associated loss of sensation. By diagnosing and treating patients early, it is possible to prevent further transmission and lifelong disability.

What is already known on this topic?

Hansen's disease (HD), or leprosy, is a reportable disease that can cause significant disability if not diagnosed and treated. During 1994–1996, the annual incidence of newly diagnosed HD in the United States was 0.52 cases per 1 million population. Clinicians in the United States are often unfamiliar with HD, resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment.

### Hunting human disease genes: lessons from the past, challenges for the future [^11b85f4e]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in the identification of the molecular bases of human disease. Indeed, for Mendelian disorders, it is conceivable that in the future we may possess a complete catalogue of the genetic basis for each of these conditions. Common diseases continue to be much more challenging to address, but recent advances in sequencing and genotyping methods are yielding exciting results. Next-generation sequencing has dramatically altered our ability to identify human disease genes, but many challenges remain. In particular, our ability to ascribe functional significance to a given DNA variant remains limited. Ultimately, the identification of the molecular causes of disease will continue to illuminate the pathophysiology of both common and rare conditions and offer opportunities for improvements in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease.

### Hunting human disease genes: lessons from the past, challenges for the future [^65daacf1]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

The concept that a specific alteration in an individual's DNA can result in disease is central to our notion of molecular medicine. The molecular basis of more than 3,500 Mendelian disorders has now been identified. In contrast, the identification of genes for common disease has been much more challenging. We discuss historical and contemporary approaches to disease gene identification, focusing on novel opportunities such as the use of population extremes and the identification of rare variants. While our ability to sequence DNA has advanced dramatically, assigning function to a given sequence change remains a major challenge, highlighting the need for both bioinformatics and functional approaches to appropriately interpret these data. We review progress in mapping and identifying human disease genes and discuss future challenges and opportunities for the field.

### Human disease genes [^72a0dc15]. Nature (2001). Excellent credibility.

The complete human genome sequence will facilitate the identification of all genes that contribute to disease. We propose that the functional classification of disease genes and their products will reveal general principles of human disease. We have determined functional categories for nearly 1,000 documented disease genes, and found striking correlations between the function of the gene product and features of disease, such as age of onset and mode of inheritance. As knowledge of disease genes grows, including those contributing to complex traits, more sophisticated analyses will be possible; their results will yield a deeper understanding of disease and an enhanced integration of medicine with biology.

Treatments and therapeutic targets — pharmacotherapy for Wilson disease uses oral agents originally for symptomatic disease but now including asymptomatic patients and long-term maintenance, and asymptomatic patients should remain asymptomatic on treatment. In symptomatic liver disease, improvement in synthetic function and signs such as jaundice and ascites begins during the first 2–6 months of treatment with further recovery possible, and failure to adhere to therapy has led to progression and liver failure in 1–12 months after discontinuation, resulting in death or liver transplantation.

### Hunting human disease genes: lessons from the past, challenges for the future [^8420afe6]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

The concept that a specific alteration in an individual's DNA can result in disease is central to our notion of molecular medicine. The molecular basis of more than 3,500 Mendelian disorders has now been identified. In contrast, the identification of genes for common disease has been much more challenging. We discuss historical and contemporary approaches to disease gene identification, focusing on novel opportunities such as the use of population extremes and the identification of rare variants. While our ability to sequence DNA has advanced dramatically, assigning function to a given sequence change remains a major challenge, highlighting the need for both bioinformatics and functional approaches to appropriately interpret these data. We review progress in mapping and identifying human disease genes and discuss future challenges and opportunities for the field.

Question 3: Which of the following is a risk factor for developing Hansen's disease?
A. Adult age
B. Exposure to rats
C. Genetic susceptibility
D. Skin-to-skin contact with an infected patient
E. Exposure to a patient with treated tuberculoid leprosy

Answers:
A. Adult age – Incorrect. Children and elderly patients are both at higher risk than adults for developing Hansen's disease following the exposure.
B. Exposure to rats – Incorrect. Rats are not hosts to M leprae. Armadillos, present in the southern United States and Brazil, are a natural reservoir for M leprae. Zoonotic infection following armadillo exposure (including the consumption of armadillo meat) has been documented.
C. Genetic susceptibility – Correct. Ninety-five percent of people have natural immunity and are not infected following the exposure. Genetic susceptibility is a major risk factor and is determined by risk alleles in the genes that are essential for cell-mediated immunity, including IFNG, TLR1, SOD2, and interleukin 10. In the minority of patients in whom the Hansen's disease develop following the exposure, host immunity further defines the type of leprosy. Tuberculoid leprosy occurs with sufficient cell-mediated immunity and suppression of bacterial proliferation, whereas lepromatous leprosy represents humoral-skewed immunity with increased bacterial proliferation and burden. The patient in this case presented with a widespread disease that was insufficient for the diagnosis of lepromatous leprosy and was thus diagnosed with borderline lepromatous leprosy.
D. Skin-to-skin contact with an infected patient – Incorrect. Infection by M leprae and M lepromatosis occurs through infectious respiratory droplets and requires a prolonged close contact. Nasal mucosa demonstrates significantly higher levels of bacteria than either blood or skin.
E. Exposure to a patient with treated tuberculoid leprosy – Incorrect. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy have fewer bacterial organisms in their nasal secretions, skin, and blood. Although all forms of Hansen's disease are contagious, contact with patients with lepromatous leprosy confers a higher risk of infection than the other forms of leprosy. Initiating treatment for both subtypes of leprosy rapidly decreases the transmission risk.

### About hansen's disease (leprosy) [^9c18aa3c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

More Information What it is Hansen's disease is caused by slow-growing bacteria called Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The disease can affect the nerves, skin, eyes, and lining of the nose. In some cases, body parts may lose their sense of touch and pain, increasing the likelihood of injuries such as cuts and burn. How long it takes for signs to show The bacteria that causes Hansen's disease grows very slowly. After contact with the bacteria, it may take up to 20 years for someone to develop signs of the disease. Risk factors In the United States, Hansen's disease is rare. Most people with Hansen's disease in the U. S. became infected in a country where it is more common. You may be at risk for the disease if you live in a country where the disease is widespread. According to WHO data from 2019: Treatment and recovery Hansen's disease is treated with a combination of antibiotics. Treatment usually lasts between one to two years.

The illness can be cured if treatment is completed as prescribed. In the U. S., people with Hansen's disease may be treated at specialized clinics run by the National Hansen's Disease. There are several federally supported outpatient clinics throughout the U. S. and Puerto Rico. Myths and misconceptions Myth: Hansen's disease is very contagious. Fact: Hansen's disease does not spread easily from person to person. You cannot get it through casual contact such as shaking hands, sitting next to, or talking to someone who has the disease. Myth: There is no cure for Hansen's disease. Fact: Hansen's disease is curable. People being treated for Hansen's disease can live a normal life among their family and friends and can continue to attend work or school. Myth: Hansen's disease makes your fingers and toes fall off. Fact: Fingers and toes do not just "fall off" due to Hansen's disease.

The bacteria that cause the disease attacks the nerves of the fingers and toes, causing them to become numb. Injuries like burns, ulcers, and cuts on numb parts can go unnoticed, which may lead to permanent damage or infection, causing loss of the digit. Sometimes, the nerve damage makes muscles in the fingers and toes so weak that the muscles and bones begin to disintegrate and be reabsorbed by the body.

### Next-generation glycogen storage diseases [^d7f08eea]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2018). Low credibility.

The glycogen storage diseases (GSD) are amongst the earliest recognized inborn errors of metabolism. After the Fulda Workshop on Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD) type I in 1990, international GSD conferences have been held in Fulda (2000), Milan (2010), Lyon (2012), and Heidelberg (2013). Since the start of the internet era, parent-led patient organizations have pushed for international guidelines for treatment and follow-up (Phillips). Subsequent international collaborative cohort studies have defined the phenotypes of GSDs and facilitated the development of internationally agreed clinical guidelines. This special edition of the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease discusses highlights of the International GSD conference held at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands, between 15 and 17 June 2017 (IGSD2017). Fifty-three oral presentations, 52 posters, 11 networking sessions, and 2 "Meet the Expert" sessions attended by 406 participants from 36 countries reflected the recent progress in individualized and novel therapies, monitoring, and empowerment for patients with muscle- and/or liver-specific GSD types.

### Hunting human disease genes: lessons from the past, challenges for the future [^4d735118]. Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Sequencing of human exomes was first reported in 2009 (Ng et al.) and the use of this technology to discover the genetic cause of a Mendelian disorder, Miller syndrome, followed soon after (Ng et al.). Importantly, this demonstrated that WES makes tractable those conditions that are too rare and in which appropriately sized families are not available for positional cloning strategies, illustrating the power of this approach in situations where only small numbers of affected individuals are available for study.

WES and WGS strategies have now been used to elucidate the molecular etiology of an ever-expanding list of Mendelian disorders, as reviewed elsewhere (Gonzaga-Jauregui et al; Ku et al; Bamshad et al.). While this undoubtedly represents a major advance for mapping human disease genes, several challenges remain. Capture methods remain imperfect and can result in unequal depth of coverage at different exonic regions. Our incomplete annotation of all human genes results in a necessarily incomplete view of the human exome. The analytical challenges are also significant. Each sequenced exome results in 20,000–25,000 variants relative to the reference sequence (Bamshad et al.). How do we go from this huge number of variants to a single pathogenic mutation? Typically a number of filtering steps are employed (Bamshad et al.), for instance, by ruling out any variants found in public databases such as dbSNP, 1000 Genomes Project, HapMap or locally available exome databases (Stitziel et al.). This rests on the assumption that the causative variant will be extremely rare and that any individual with the variant will be affected (i.e. the variant is fully penetrant). While this is an efficient method to rule out the vast majority of variants, and is reasonable in scenarios where the disease-causing variant is hypothesized to be novel, it may be overly restrictive. As more genome and exome sequences are deposited in public repositories, the assumption that any variant found in these databases can be ruled out as disease-causing becomes increasingly difficult to justify. This is especially the case for recessive conditions in which the carrier state is relatively common (e.g. HFE gene mutations associated with hereditary hemochromatosis) or in situations in which the causative mutation is not fully penetrant. As a result, many groups now set frequency-based tolerances for variants found in dbSNP or other databases, such that variants present in fewer than 1% of chromosomes are carried forward as candidates for a rare pathogenic mutation (McDonald et al.).

### Clinical and genetic landscape of optic atrophy in 826 families: insights from 50 nuclear genes [^18076ef4]. Brain (2025). Medium credibility.

In our cohort of patients with a clinical diagnosis of suspected HON caused by nuclear gene mutations, the diagnostic rate of nHON was 31.50%, which aligns closely with international findings, where rates were reported to be 27%and 36.9%. Looking forwards, our research aims to incorporate comprehensive mitochondrial sequencing for those patients with a negative nuclear gene diagnosis and four primary LHON variants, particularly to rule out cases of childhood-onset LHON in children whose parents may not recognize early visual impairment, yet who exhibit complete optic nerve atrophy at clinical presentation. The low percentage of nuclear genes in patients with suspected LHON-like disease suggests that the number of nuclear genes that can cause the LHON-like phenotype is relatively small and that the LHON-like phenotype is more likely to be the result of a combination of mitochondrial DNA mutations and the environment.

### Homozygosity mapping provides supporting evidence of pathogenicity in recessive mendelian disease [^ba7591d6]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The advent of high-throughput next-generation sequencing has been a boon to the study of Mendelian disease. It is now possible to screen thousands of genes in a single test. However, this generates an extensive list of variants. One of the greatest challenges currently facing those studying Mendelian disease is identifying the pathogenic variant amongst the myriad of other variants. To help with this task the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) has developed guidelinesfor variant interpretation, providing a process for classifying variants using all different types of potential available evidence.

Searching for shared regions of homozygosity between affected individuals has been used to identify genes causing recessive Mendelian diseases. Identifying target genes within shared regions of homozygosity is a critical step in consanguineous families with recessive disorders. Regions of homozygosity are created when identical-by-descent haplotypes are inherited from parents. A homozygosity map can be generated directly from next-generation sequencing data, identifying regions likely to contain the causative variant.

The number and size of homozygous regions within an individual's genome is influenced by ancestral population effects and recent consanguineous events. It is important to differentiate the two cases as disease-causing variants are likely to be in regions of recent homozygosity; variants in ancestral regions of homozygosity have been exposed to selection in a homozygous state for sufficient time for selection to act on them. Ancestral regions of homozygosity are likely to be smaller, less than a megabase, whereas homozygous regions that are the result of recent consanguinity tend to be multiple megabases in length. Thus we would expect variants that cause recessive Mendelian disease to be contained in the largest regions of homozygosity.

To test the hypothesis that homozygous pathogenic variants are more likely to be found in the largest regions of homozygosity in a sample, we used a data set of 99 consanguineous patients with previously identified homozygous pathogenic variants. We then replicated our findings in two further cohorts, with 17 and 63 patients respectively.

### Forgotten, but not gone: the threat of leprosy [^c3fba898]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

2020 is approaching and a leprosy-free world seems an improbable target in such a short time. In largely affected countries, early detection campaigns are needed, together with efforts to increase awareness among the population and fight the disease both on a clinical and social level. The WHO initiative to boost the reduction in cases thanks to single-dose rifampicin chemoprophylaxis shows great potential. For this to happen, it should be made available as soon as possible in areas at high risk, with the global support to cover its additional costs. Another matter that was not mentioned in the WHO Global Leprosy Strategy 2016–2020, but that deserves attention, is disability care and management of those affected. Currently, there is no programme in place to take care of patients with disabilities and their families. This remains an underdiscussed global health issue that should be considered to guarantee proper clinical support for affected patients.

Unfortunately, as The Herald article reminds us, Hansen's disease is still a reality for many countries. Leprosy might be eradicated, but it is certainly not yet eliminated, and it is now time to intensify global efforts to fight this disease and its stigma worldwide once and for all.

### Consensus guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency [^8932958c]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

8 Part III: Treatment

8.1 Available Evidence

The THD guideline group reviewed data about treatment in a total of 65 studies: 35 case reports and 30 case series (160 patients in total). We included studies that contained sufficient details about dosage, benefits, side effects, and treatment outcomes to inform judgments about medication use. We excluded 30 of the 190 total cases described in the literature from this analysis due to insufficient information.

The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to low. Limitations included the type of publications available, incomplete detail provided about clinical outcomes in many cases, and lack of standardized descriptions of outcomes between studies. In the case of L‐dopa, though, these limitations were counterbalanced by the large treatment effect described in most patients across many studies, and the detailed description of treatment and response provided in a few. Evidence for or against the use of medications other than L‐dopa is much scarcer in the literature, and thus recommendations are influenced by expert opinion here.

### Short report: treatment failure in hansen's disease [^c28aa053]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2003). Low credibility.

Areas of low endemicity of Hansen's disease, such as Texas, California, and Hawaii, exist due to immigration and rare autochthonous infections. Managing this disease in these areas of low endemicity is difficult, especially in observing for relapse. The accurate diagnosis of relapse is imperative so that appropriate therapy can be promptly reinstituted and unnecessary treatment can be avoided. To assess treatment failures in an area of low endemicity, we retrospectively evaluated 113 patients with Hansen's disease treated in southern Texas. Of 57 patients who completed therapy, 11 were later restarted on medications for this disease for presumed relapse. However, nine of the 11 were found not to have true relapses of Hansen's disease. The accurate diagnosis of relapse of this disease is essential not only in the individual patient but also for prospective treatment trials to establish best practices.

### Treatment of leprosy / hansen's disease in the early 21st century [^400a6ef3]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Leprosy, or Hansen's disease (HD), is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, a slowly dividing mycobacterium that has evolved to be an intracellular parasite, causing skin lesions and nerve damage. Less than 5% of people exposed to M. leprae develop clinical disease. Host cell-mediated resistance determines whether an individual will develop paucibacillary or multibacillary disease. Hansen's disease is a worldwide disease with about 150 new cases reported annually in the United States. Effective anti-mycobacterial treatments are available, and many patients experience severe reversal and erythema nodosum leprosum reactions that also require treatment. Leprosy has been the target of a World Health Organization multiple drug therapy campaign to eliminate it as a national public health problem in member countries, but endemic regions persist. In the United States, the National Hansen's Disease Program has primary responsibility for medical care, research, and information.

### Surveillance of leprosy in Kiribati, 1935–2017 [^12009870]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Leprosy (also called Hansen's disease) was well established in Kiribati by the early 20th century, possibly as a result of contact with Western and Chinese traders. Colonial records indicate that there were 28 known cases in 1925, when the population was ≈31,000. Kiribati, formerly the Gilbert Islands, is a country of 33 atolls, 21 of which are inhabited, spread over > 1 million square miles of ocean. The country covers an area on both sides of the International Date Line and north and south of the equator. The islands became a British colony in 1916, were occupied by Japan during 1942–1943, and became an independent country in 1979. The population in the 2015 census was 110,136, with the main population located in South Tarawa (39,058 persons) and Betio (17,330 persons). Betio, an islet with a deepwater port, is connected to South Tarawa by a causeway.

Leprosy, caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, is a chronic disease with an indolent onset, resulting in a long period between the manifestation of the disease and the person seeking healthcare. Its 2 clinical forms, paucibacillary disease (PB) and multibacillary disease (MB), may have long-term consequences if untreated and can result in peripheral nerve damage, chronic ulceration, blindness, and facial disfigurement, as well as social isolation and family discord. Complications are more common in MB leprosy.

Humans are the main reservoir of M. leprae. The primary mode of transmission is understood to be person to person by the respiratory route, but this route has not been proven conclusively. Patients with MB disease excrete M. leprae from their nasal mucosa and skin. Persons most at risk are close household contacts of those with MB, but social contacts are also at risk. Social and economic factors play a role in transmission. Poverty, undernutrition, crowding, and rapid uncontrolled internal migration have been associated with high rates of leprosy. Higher rates of leprosy were found in households of > 7 persons than those with < 4 persons and in homes in which > 2 shared a bedroom.

### Low disease risk and penetrance in leber hereditary optic neuropathy [^bda4b894]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

The risk of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) has largely been extrapolated from disease cohorts, which underestimate the population prevalence of pathogenic primary LHON variants as a result of incomplete disease penetrance. Understanding the true population prevalence of primary LHON variants, alongside the rate of clinical disease, provides a better understanding of disease risk and variant penetrance. We identified pathogenic primary LHON variants in whole-genome sequencing data of a well-characterized population-based control cohort and found that the prevalence is far greater than previously estimated, as it occurs in approximately 1 in 800 individuals. Accordingly, we were able to more accurately estimate population risk and disease penetrance in LHON variant carriers, validating our findings by using other large control datasets. These findings will inform accurate counseling in relation to the risk of vision loss in LHON variant carriers and disease manifestation in their family. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Lopez Sanchez et al. (2021), published in The American Journal of Human Genetics. See also the response by Mackey et al. (2022), published in this issue.

### A reappraisal of gaucher disease-diagnosis and disease management algorithms [^a8c9c59c]. American Journal of Hematology (2011). Low credibility.

Type 1 (non-neuronopathic) Gaucher disease was the first lysosomal storage disorder for which an effective enzyme replacement therapy was developed and it has become a prototype for treatments for related orphan diseases. There are currently four treatment options available to patients with Gaucher disease, nevertheless, almost 25% of Type 1 Gaucher patients do not gain timely access to therapy because of delays in diagnosis after the onset of symptoms. Diagnosis of Gaucher disease by enzyme testing is unequivocal, but the rarity of the disease and nonspecific and heterogeneous nature of Gaucher disease symptoms may impede consideration of this disease in the differential diagnosis. To help promote timely diagnosis and optimal management of the protean presentations of Gaucher disease, a consensus meeting was convened to develop algorithms for diagnosis and disease management for Gaucher disease.

### A systematic review and evidence-based guideline for diagnosis and treatment of menkes disease [^83191981]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Menkes disease is a rare X-linked neurodegenerative disorder caused by defect in copper metabolism. Parenteral copper supplementation has been used as a potential disease-modifying treatment of Menkes disease for decades. However, recent evidence suggests its efficacy only when treatment is started within days after birth, which also has important implications related to the techniques that enable early diagnosis. We aim at proposing a guideline for prenatal and neonatal diagnosis and for disease-modifying treatment of Menkes disease, guided by a systematic review of the literature, and built in conjunction with medical experts, methodologists and patient representatives. Thirteen articles were used for our recommendations that were based on GRADE system. Reviewed evidence suggests that prenatal genetic diagnosis in families with previous diagnosis of Menkes disease is feasible; analysis of plasma catecholamine levels is accurate for neonatal diagnosis of Menkes disease; treatment with copper-histidine is effective to increase survival and reduce neurologic burden of the disease if initiated in the neonatal period; and, treatment indication should not be guided by patient's genotype. In conclusion, our guideline can contribute to standardize some aspects of the clinical care of patients with Menkes disease, especially reducing disease burden and mortality and providers' and families' anxiety.

### Huntingtin-lowering therapies for Huntington disease: a review of the evidence of potential benefits and risks [^98961f5e]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Huntington's disease:

- **Definition**: HD is an adult-onset, autosomal dominant inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive development of chorea, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive impairment.
- **Pathophysiology**: Primary neuropathophysiology occurs in the neostriatum with atrophy, neuronal loss and gliosis in the caudate nucleus, thalamus, and, ultimately, the cortex. HD is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion at the 5' end of the huntingtin gene.
- **Epidemiology**: The cumulative incidence rate of HD in the US is estimated at 1.22 per 100,000 persons (95% CI 1.53–1.65). Mean age at onset ranges from 35–44 years.
- **Disease course**: Initial clinical manifestations include motor dysfunction (chorea, athetosis, oculomotor disorders), hyperreflexia and hyperhidrosis. Advanced stages progress to movement dysfunction (dystonia, rigidity, bradykinesia, dysarthria, gait disturbance, facial grimacing), cognitive decline (dementia), and psychiatric disturbances (major depressive disorder, psychosis, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, suicidal ideation). Additionally, ataxic gait and seizure may occur.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Huntington disease progresses to disability, and eventually death approximately 15–20 years after onset. Intercurrent illnesses such as aspiration pneumonia are the most common cause of death.

### Low disease risk and penetrance in leber hereditary optic neuropathy [^235ed276]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The risk of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) has largely been extrapolated from disease cohorts, which underestimate the population prevalence of pathogenic primary LHON variants as a result of incomplete disease penetrance. Understanding the true population prevalence of primary LHON variants, alongside the rate of clinical disease, provides a better understanding of disease risk and variant penetrance. We identified pathogenic primary LHON variants in whole-genome sequencing data of a well-characterized population-based control cohort and found that the prevalence is far greater than previously estimated, as it occurs in approximately 1 in 800 individuals. Accordingly, we were able to more accurately estimate population risk and disease penetrance in LHON variant carriers, validating our findings by using other large control datasets. These findings will inform accurate counseling in relation to the risk of vision loss in LHON variant carriers and disease manifestation in their family. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Lopez Sanchez et al. (2021), published in The American Journal of Human Genetics. See also the response by Mackey et al. (2022), published in this issue.

### Systematic review of hansen disease attributed to Mycobacterium lepromatosis [^d8028ef0]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Review Protocol and Searches

The protocol for this systematic review was defined in advance and registered with PROSPERO, an international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42021239268). Database searches were performed on October 4, 2022 (Appendix). We imposed no date, language, or publication type restrictions. We manually searched bibliographies of all included studies.

Screening, Inclusion/Exclusion, and Quality Assessment

We conducted initial screening by title and abstract. We included references if a primary research study or clinical case report reported human infection with M. lepromatosis investigated using laboratory testing of current or archived specimens, irrespective of whether those specimens were positive for M. lepromatosis. We excluded animal studies and studies from before 2008, predating identification of M. lepromatosis. We excluded reviews and opinion pieces after manually checking bibliographies. Pairs of reviewers in parallel performed qualitative assessments to rate the methodologic quality of each included study as good, fair, or poor (Appendix). Reviewers used the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool for Case Reports (https://jbi.global/critical-appraisal-tools) and, for specimen surveys, a 9-item quality assessment tool adapted from the National Institutes of Health's Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.

Data Extraction and Analysis

Pairs of reviewers in parallel transferred extracted data into predefined templates. Data extracted from case reports were date and geographic location of testing, patient demographics, medical history, diagnostic methods and findings, treatment, and outcome. Data extracted from surveys were case information, test methods, source and type of specimens, and how many specimens provided DNA and tested positive for M. lepromatosis, M. leprae, or both.

### Systematic review of hansen disease attributed to Mycobacterium lepromatosis [^69ed7bdd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

The narrowly focused scope, sensitivity, and specificity of lepromatosis as a search term and the relatively few references included in our review give us confidence that all relevant studies were identified. Quality of reporting was good in 61% of included studies and fair in the remainder. The tendency of studies to focus on DLL in Mesoamerica, possibly resulting in observational and publication biases for case reports and sampling bias for surveys, were the main sources of bias in our review, although there were several large studies from other regions with null findings for M. lepromatosis. A key quality item considered for this review was adequate description of PCR methods, which most, but not all, studies provided. Specimen surveys more consistently described PCR methods, including targets and primers, than did case reports, some of which covered time periods during which those methods were still being developed. M. lepromatosis does not manifest only as DLL, but most specimen surveys did not provide clinical data for the patients sampled. Even when HD type was stated, misclassification was possible unless HD specialists or reference centers were involved in diagnosis. Although we cannot entirely preclude the possibility of double counting, we identified only a few cases that were reported twice and contacted the authors of 2 studies when geography and time span suggested that possibility to confirm that there was no overlap.

It is perhaps remarkable that a new species causing an endemic disease of major public health impact has not prompted larger-scale studies to determine its true prevalence. Even if options for patient management are determined by clinical manifestations of HD rather than its etiologic agents, understanding disease attribution and distribution of a highly pathogenic species are clearly important, and the availability of validated PCR methods enables large-scale epidemiologic studies to be conducted.

In conclusion, clinicians need to be aware that Hansen disease of various forms can be caused by either M. leprae or M. lepromatosis. Current multidrug therapy regimens appear to be effective regardless of infecting species.

Cutaneous Leishmaniasis

IX. In a person with a consistent travel history and compatible skin lesion(s), is it necessary to obtain parasitologic confirmation of the diagnosis of leishmaniasis before starting treatment?

Recommendation
23. After a careful diagnostic evaluation in which neither leishmaniasis nor another diagnosis is confirmed, empiric treatment may be indicated on the basis of an individualized risk-benefit assessment [Weak, very low]. Remark: This should be discussed with the patient and reevaluated periodically, taking into account the clinical evolution.

X. Is treatment of clinically manifest cutaneous infection (CL) always indicated?

Recommendations
24. We recommend that immunocompetent persons with skin lesions that are caused by infection with Leishmania species that are not associated with increased risk for ML, that are defined as clinically simple lesions (Table 1), and that are healing spontaneously may be observed without treatment if the patient concurs with this management [Strong, moderate].
25. For persons with CL when the Leishmania species is not known but the infection was not acquired in an increased ML-risk region (Table 1, Figure 2 Figure 2: Maps of the Geographic Distribution of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL). Notes: Adapted and modified from Chapter 277, Leishmania species. Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases 1 In Guatemala, the reported cases of CL have been acquired in the northern departments (particularly, El Petén and Alta Verapaz but also Izabal, El Quiché, Baja Verapaz, and Jalapa). 2 The etiologic agents of CL in Israel primarily include L. major and L. tropica but also L. infantum-chagasi. 3 The species L. (Leishmania) martiniquensis, which was formally named in 2014, has been identified as the etiologic agent of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the French West Indies (Martinique Island) and Thailand, where it previously was referred to as " L. siamenensis " (not considered a taxonomically valid name). 4 In Sri Lanka, L. donovani has been identified as the etiologic agent of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. 5 Not all Leishmania species that cause CL are included in this map (eg, L. amazonensis in South America).), treatment of clinically simple or healing skin lesions is not required in an immunocompetent patient who concurs with this management [Strong, low; E.C. dissents, recommending that all persons with NWCL receive treatment]. Remark: See XXIV and XXV regarding the management of CL in immunocompromised persons.
26. We suggest that systemic treatment be offered for persons even with healing/recently healed CL lesions caused by increased ML-risk species or when the species is unknown but the infection was acquired in an increased ML-risk region. Risks and benefits of such treatment should be discussed with the patient [Weak, low]. Remark: In some cases, watchful waiting, with vigilance for signs and symptoms of ML, may be a reasonable approach.
27. We recommend that any decision to observe a patient with CL without treatment should be reevaluated periodically, and the decision not to treat should be reconsidered if healing does not progress as anticipated [Strong, very low].
28. In all cases of CL, wound care, individualized documentation of lesion evolution, and patient education regarding the manifestations and detection of local therapeutic failure/relapse and ML should be routine components of management (see III and XV) [Strong, low].

This article is based on an invited lecture entitled "Year-in-the-Adrenal: A Clinical Perspective", presented at the 92nd Annual Meeting of The Endocrine Society in Boston, Massachusetts, on June 7, 2011. The objective was to provide clinicians with a summary of key, clinically important advances in the field of adrenal disorders over the past 18 months. Paper selection was based on a comprehensive survey of all adrenal articles published in major endocrinology and high-impact general medical journals between December 2009 and May 2011. Participants in the selection process included 15 endocrinologists with expertise in adrenal disorders. The articles highlighted were those that: 1) constitute novel discoveries that may improve the understanding of pathophysiology; 2) address important clinical questions; and 3) most influence the way we diagnose and treat patients with adrenal disorders. An effort was made to include both adrenal cortical and medullary disorders.

### A hypopigmented and enlarging granulomatous eruption [^c0825256]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate next step?
A. Repeat biopsy and stains for acid-fast bacilli
B. Send serologic tests to confirm a diagnosis of leprosy
C. Initiate therapy with dapsone and rifampicin
D. Initiate therapy with dapsone
E. Initiate therapy with adalimumab

Answers:
A. Repeat biopsy and stains for acid-fast bacilli – Incorrect. A clinical diagnosis of BT leprosy was made given the anesthetic skin lesions in the setting of histopathology findings and the patient's history. Furthermore, in BT leprosy, staining for acid-fast bacilli is often negative.
B. Send serologic tests to confirm a diagnosis of leprosy – Incorrect. No reliable blood tests are available for the diagnosis of leprosy. The serologic test Phenolic glycolipid is unavailable in the United States, and patients with BT leprosy are typically seronegative. Diagnostic approaches include skin biopsies, slit skin smears, and polymerase chain reaction. Slit skin smear provides a bacteriologic index to estimate acid-fast bacilli count, aiding in determining the diagnosis and classification of leprosy by WHO classifications.
C. Initiate therapy with dapsone and rifampicin – Correct. The National Hansen's Disease Program recommends a 12-month regimen of dapsone and rifampicin for immunocompetent adults with BT leprosy, whereas the WHO recommends a 6-month regimen involving dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine.
D. Initiate therapy with dapsone – Incorrect. Multidrug therapy is a cornerstone of both the WHO and National Hansen's Disease Program treatment guidelines for leprosy. While dapsone is a component of therapy, single drug regimens are inappropriate in treating leprosy.
E. Initiate therapy with adalimumab – Incorrect. Adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor, is not a treatment for BT leprosy. tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor use may be a risk factor for developing leprosy or reactivating subclinical infection.

### Incidence of hansen's disease – United States, 1994–2011 [^fd8f2128]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Hansen's disease (HD), or leprosy, is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae and is reportable in many states. It is a chronic disease affecting the skin and nerves, commonly presenting as pale or reddish skin patches with diminished sensation. Without treatment, it can progress to a severely debilitating disease with nerve damage, tissue destruction, and functional loss. An important factor in limiting HD morbidity is early diagnosis and prompt initiation of therapy. Because HD is rare, clinicians in the United States are often unfamiliar with it; however, HD continues to cause morbidity in the United States. To better characterize at-risk U.S. populations, HD trends during 1994–2011 were evaluated by reviewing records from the National Hansen's Disease Program (NHDP). When the periods 1994–1996 and 2009–2011 were compared, a decline in the rate for new diagnoses from 0.52 to 0.43 per million was observed. The rate among foreign-born persons decreased from 3.66 to 2.29, whereas the rate among U.S.-born persons was 0.16 in both 1994–1996 and 2009–2011. Delayed diagnosis was more common among foreign-born persons. Clinicians throughout the United States should familiarize themselves with the signs and symptoms of HD and understand that HD can occur in the United States.

### Evidence-based treatment of leprosy and its reactions [^e7070f6a]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: All 3 of the case reports about leprosy (Hansen's Disease) published in the past 6 months, are valuable in educating clinicians in and beyond dermatology about leprosy in the United States.

Reference 1, a case in New York City, was treated with an evidence based, internationally accepted regimen for active leprosy and for erythema nodosum leprosum.

Reference Cases 2 and 3 were treated with a regimen of once-monthly rifampin, moxifloxacin, and minocycline. This regimen has not been evaluated in any carefully designed clinical trial and its safety and efficacy have not been determined. It is not recommended by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the International Federation of Leprosy Associations.

Leprosy is a serious infectious disease for which a standardized and universally recommended multiple drug treatment has proven safe and effective. While improved regimens are desirable, a medically conservative, evidence-based approach would advise caution in using the rifampin, moxifloxacin, and minocycline regimen until data from well-designed clinical trials — comparing rifampin, moxifloxacin, and minocycline directly to standard multiple drug treatment — show that its safety and efficacy are at least equivalent to multiple drug treatment. Evidence regarding safety and efficacy would include data on the incidence and severity of leprosy reactions and the development of drug-resistant organisms. This approach would be comparable to what is done to develop new treatment regimens for other serious infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.

The following constitutes key background information on Hodgkin's lymphoma:

- **Definition**: HL is a rare lymphatic neoplasm, typically of B-cell origin, characterized by large malignant lymphoid cells, and Reed-Sternberg cells.
- **Pathophysiology**: HL is most frequently caused by the EBV. Other causes include tuberculosis and genetic factors (HLA class II polymorphisms).
- **Epidemiology**: HL incidence in the US is estimated at 3.23 per 100,000 people per year.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include painless lymphadenopathy enlarging over months, mainly involving the mediastinum, left neck node, right neck node, splenic, axillary, abdominal, hilar, or inguinofemoral nodes in descending order. The clinically occult disease is characterized by severe unremitting pruritus without obvious skin pathology. B symptoms include fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss > 10% of body weight. Alcohol-induced lymph node pain is highly specific for HL.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis is determined by disease stage (i.e. best prognosis in early-stage HL) and pathology (i.e. better prognosis in Nodular sclerosis cHL).

### Morbihan disease-like presentation of tuberculoid leprosy [^836de812]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Leprosy is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The clinical manifestations of leprosy primarily involve the skin and the nervous system. It is characterized by 2 polar forms: tuberculoid or paucibacillary leprosy (few lesions and a competent immune system) at one end of the spectrum, and lepromatous or multibacillary leprosy at the other end (numerous lesions and a deficient immune system). Dermal granulomatous infiltrates are observed in the tuberculoid pattern of leprosy. In our case, the linear appearance of the granulomas on histology can be attributed to nerve involvement that is characteristic of tuberculoid leprosy (Fig 4). Additionally, lymphocytes surround epithelioid and Langhans giant cells, the cutaneous nerves can be edematous, and there is an absence of organisms, even with special stains.

Fig 4
Higher power of the skin biopsy shows collections of epithelioid histocytes around neurovascular bundle (hematoxylin-eosin stain; original magnification: ×400).

The etiopathogenesis of MD is not fully understood. According to a previous study, this is a clinical variation or complication of acne or rosacea. In our patient, age, clinical picture, and histopathologic results supported a correlation with rosacea, however, the additional presence of linear granuloma along the nerve was consistent with the diagnosis of leprosy. Moreover, the histopathologic characteristics of MD have been poorly described in the literature, with nonspecific findings which typically include edema in the dermis and dilated blood vessels, lymphocytes, neutrophils, perivascular, and perifollicular histiocytes, perifollicular fibrosis, and rarely, an increase in the number of mast cells. Whether tuberculoid leprosy induces the development of MD or whether the resulting tuberculoid leprosy granuloma leads to lymphatic obstruction with the subsequent development of MD-like features still needs to be adequately elucidated.
