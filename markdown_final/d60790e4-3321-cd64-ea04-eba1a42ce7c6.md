## Question

Is there interaction between strayers and zoloft

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether there is an interaction between "strayers" and Zoloft (sertraline). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "strayers" might refer to in this context. Then, I should verify the most likely intended drug and its interaction profile with sertraline. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and quantify the clinical effect. Finally, I will outline practical management and counseling points, including any exceptions or caveats that could change the risk assessment.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "strayers" does not map to a standard drug name. Wait, let me verify the common look‑alike or sound‑alike possibilities. The most plausible interpretation is St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), given its frequent co‑use with antidepressants and well‑documented interaction concerns, and the fact that pharmacists frequently field questions about sertraline–St. John's wort interactions, which supports this as the likely intended query [^b0413302].

> I will now examine the pharmacology to ensure the mechanism makes sense. St. John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P‑glycoprotein, and it has serotonergic activity via inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake; sertraline is an SSRI that increases synaptic serotonin and is metabolized by CYP pathways, so there is both a pharmacokinetic and a pharmacodynamic pathway for interaction, which aligns with established interaction warnings [^57731d8a] [^ff99a36f] [^9ac9d3d6].

> Next, I should review the clinical evidence for serotonin syndrome. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether the interaction is theoretical or documented. Multiple authoritative sources list St. John's wort among serotonergic agents that increase serotonin syndrome risk when combined with SSRIs, and case reports document serotonin syndrome with SSRIs plus St. John's wort, so the risk is real and clinically relevant, not merely hypothetical [^9ac9d3d6] [^57731d8a] [^14cea70e].

> I should also quantify the pharmacokinetic impact. Let me verify the magnitude of change. A randomized trial in healthy volunteers showed that a high‑hyperforin St. John's wort product reduced oxycodone exposure by about 50% via CYP3A4 induction, illustrating the strength of induction; while this is not a sertraline study, it demonstrates the clinical potency of CYP3A4 induction by St. John's wort, which would be expected to lower sertraline levels and potentially reduce efficacy, though the exact magnitude with sertraline can vary by formulation and dose [^c323e5ac] [^57731d8a].

> But wait, what if the St. John's wort product is low in hyperforin? I need to check whether low‑hyperforin extracts behave differently. A well‑controlled study of Ze 117, a low‑hyperforin extract, found no clinically relevant induction or inhibition of major CYPs or P‑gp, suggesting a lower interaction potential; however, most U.S.‑available products are not standardized to low hyperforin, so the default assumption in the U.S. should still be significant CYP3A4 induction and interaction risk unless the exact product is verified to be low‑hyperforin [^31fa92e7] [^a744a6b9] [^14cea70e].

> I should confirm the clinical consequences and management. The combination can precipitate serotonin syndrome, and St. John's wort can reduce sertraline exposure, potentially undermining antidepressant efficacy; therefore, the combination is generally contraindicated or at least strongly discouraged, and if St. John's wort is already on board, sertraline should be discontinued before starting an MAOI or other high‑risk serotonergic agent, with close monitoring for serotonin syndrome if any serotonergic co‑medication is unavoidable [^9ac9d3d6] [^156895b6] [^14cea70e].

> Let me consider practical counseling and documentation. I need to ensure the patient is asked explicitly about herbal use, because patients often do not volunteer St. John's wort; pharmacists frequently identify this interaction, yet underreport it, highlighting the need to proactively screen and counsel. If the patient is already combining them, I should assess for serotonin toxicity symptoms and consider tapering St. John's wort with monitoring for withdrawal or rebound depression, while watching sertraline response for any need to adjust the antidepressant dose after the herb is stopped [^b0413302] [^14cea70e].

> In summary, yes, there is a clinically important interaction between St. John's wort and sertraline, driven by serotonergic excess and CYP3A4/P‑gp induction. The risk is sufficiently high that the combination should be avoided in routine care, with exceptions only if a verified low‑hyperforin product is used under specialist supervision and with close monitoring, and even then caution remains prudent given variability in product quality and patient susceptibility to serotonin syndrome [^9ac9d3d6] [^57731d8a] [^31fa92e7] [^14cea70e].

---

There is a **clinically significant interaction** between St. John's wort and sertraline (Zoloft) [^9ac9d3d6] due to additive serotonergic effects and CYP3A4 induction by St. John's wort, which can cause **serotonin syndrome** [^d6c6b945] and reduce sertraline efficacy [^e0dece45]. This combination is **contraindicated**; avoid concurrent use and monitor for serotonin toxicity if combined inadvertently [^156895b6].

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms of interaction

### Pharmacodynamic interaction

St. John's wort inhibits serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake, and when combined with sertraline, an SSRI, there is **additive serotonergic activity** that increases the risk of serotonin syndrome — a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by mental status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular abnormalities [^9ac9d3d6] [^d6c6b945].

---

### Pharmacokinetic interaction

St. John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, which accelerates sertraline metabolism and reduces its plasma concentrations, potentially leading to **subtherapeutic levels and diminished antidepressant efficacy** [^e0dece45] [^57731d8a].

---

## Clinical evidence of interaction

Multiple case reports and clinical studies document **serotonin syndrome** with concomitant St. John's wort and SSRIs, including sertraline [^57731d8a]. Pharmacokinetic studies show St. John's wort significantly reduces exposure to sertraline, compromising therapeutic efficacy [^e0dece45].

---

## Clinical consequences and risks

- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk of severe serotonin toxicity, including agitation, confusion, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, tremor, rigidity, and seizures [^9ac9d3d6] [^d6c6b945].
- **Reduced antidepressant efficacy**: Lower sertraline levels can worsen depressive symptoms and increase relapse risk [^e0dece45].
- **Other adverse effects**: Gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness, fatigue, and photosensitivity are common with St. John's wort [^7a06c1eb].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Contraindication**: Concomitant use of St. John's wort and sertraline is contraindicated due to serotonin syndrome risk and reduced sertraline efficacy [^notfound].
- **Patient counseling**: Patients should be educated about the risks of combining St. John's wort with sertraline and advised to avoid such combinations [^0c4f9bc4].
- **Monitoring**: If inadvertent co-administration occurs, monitor closely for serotonin syndrome and adjust sertraline therapy as needed [^9ac9d3d6].

---

## Management strategies

- **Discontinuation**: Stop St. John's wort immediately if combined with sertraline.
- **Monitoring**: Watch for serotonin syndrome symptoms for several weeks after stopping St. John's wort.
- **Dose adjustment**: Consider increasing sertraline dose if subtherapeutic levels are suspected after St. John's wort cessation.

## Summary of interaction

| **Interaction parameter** | **Clinical implication** |
|-|-|
| Pharmacodynamic | Increased risk of serotonin syndrome |
| Pharmacokinetic | Reduced sertraline efficacy due to CYP3A4 induction |
| Clinical evidence | Well-documented cases and studies |
| Recommendation | Contraindicated combination |

---

St. John's wort and sertraline should not be co-administered due to the **high risk of serotonin syndrome** and reduced antidepressant efficacy. If combined inadvertently, discontinue St. John's wort and monitor closely for adverse effects.

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of ZOLOFT with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John’s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Patients should contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Increased Risk of Bleeding

Inform patients about the concomitant use of ZOLOFT with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

5.2	Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including ZOLOFT, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone .

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of ZOLOFT with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate ZOLOFT in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking ZOLOFT, discontinue ZOLOFT before initiating treatment with the MAOI [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Monitor all patients taking ZOLOFT for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with ZOLOFT and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of ZOLOFT with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

Renal Impairment

Sertraline is extensively metabolized and excretion of unchanged drug in urine is a minor route of elimination. In volunteers with mild to moderate (CLcr=30-60 mL/min), moderate to severe (CLcr=10-29 mL/min) or severe (receiving hemodialysis) renal impairment (N=10 each group), the pharmacokinetics and protein binding of 200 mg sertraline per day maintained for 21 days were not altered compared to age-matched volunteers (N=12) with no renal impairment. Thus sertraline multiple dose pharmacokinetics appear to be unaffected by renal impairment [See Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] .

Pimozide

In a controlled study of a single dose (2 mg) of pimozide, 200 mg ZOLOFT (once daily) co-administration to steady state was associated with a mean increase in pimozide AUC and Cmaxof about 40%, but was not associated with any changes in ECG. The highest recommended pimozide dose (10 mg) has not been evaluated in combination with ZOLOFT. The effect on QTc interval and PK parameters at doses higher than 2 mg of pimozide are not known [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

Many antidepressant drugs (e.g., SSRIs, including ZOLOFT, and most tricyclic antidepressant drugs) inhibit the biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme CYP2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase), and, thus, may increase the plasma concentrations of co-administered drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6. The drugs for which this potential interaction is of greatest concern are those metabolized primarily by CYP2D6 and that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tricyclic antidepressant drugs and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). The extent to which this interaction is an important clinical problem depends on the extent of the inhibition of CYP2D6 by the antidepressant and the therapeutic index of the co-administered drug. There is variability among the drugs effective in the treatment of MDD in the extent of clinically important 2D6 inhibition, and in fact ZOLOFT at lower doses has a less prominent inhibitory effect on 2D6 than some others in the class. Nevertheless, even ZOLOFT has the potential for clinically important 2D6 inhibition [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Phenytoin

Clinical trial data suggested that ZOLOFT may increase phenytoin concentrations [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sertraline hydrochloride PO (also known as Zoloft, Zoloft): 
- Acute angle-closure glaucoma: use caution in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. Avoid use if possible.
- Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome: do not discontinue abruptly in any patient.
- Bleeding: use caution in patients taking aspirin, NSAIDs, antiplatelet, or anticoagulant therapy.
- Hyponatremia, SIADHs: use caution in all patients, especially in the elderly and in patients with volume depletion or taking diuretics.
- Mania: use caution in patients with bipolar disorder. Screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder before initiating sertraline.
- Seizure: use caution in patients with seizure disorder.
- Serotonin syndrome: use caution in patients taking other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, TCAs, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort).
- Sexual dysfunction: maintain a high level of suspicion, as SSRIs have been associated with decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, and ejaculatory delay or failure in males, and decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm in females.
- Torsades de pointes, ventricular arrhythmias: use extreme caution in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, uncompensated HF, or taking other QT-prolonging drugs.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Protein-bound drugs: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of ZOLOFT or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. (7.1, 12.3)
CYP2D6 substrates: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. (7.1, 12.3)

7.1	Clinically Significant Drug Interactions

Table 5 includes clinically significant drug interactions with ZOLOFT [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.2	Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ZOLOFT

Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of ZOLOFT is necessary when used in combination with cimetidine. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is required for diazepam, lithium, atenolol, tolbutamide, digoxin, and drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, when ZOLOFT is administered concomitantly [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.3	False-Positive Screening Tests for Benzodiazepines

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking ZOLOFT. This finding is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of ZOLOFT. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish sertraline from benzodiazepines.

4 CONTRAINDICATIONS

ZOLOFT is contraindicated in patients:

Taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs, (including the MAOIs linezolid and intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
Taking pimozide [See Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
With known hypersensitivity to sertraline (e.g., anaphylaxis, angioedema) [See Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2)] .

In addition to the contraindications for all ZOLOFT formulations listed above, ZOLOFT oral solution is contraindicated in patients:

Taking disulfiram. ZOLOFT oral solution contains alcohol, and concomitant use of ZOLOFT and disulfiram may result in a disulfiram-alcohol reaction.

Concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or use within 14 days of stopping MAOIs (4, 7.1)
Concomitant use of pimozide (4, 7.1)
Known hypersensitivity to sertraline or excipients (4, 5.4)
ZOLOFT oral solution only: Concomitant use of disulfiram (4)

### Preventable adverse drug reactions: a focus on drug interactions (...) [^28cf6c58]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

These 4 drugs were removed from the market or restricted in their use because it became clear that they continued to be prescribed in an unsafe manner, even after multiple warning letters were disseminated by the manufacturer and the FDA to health care professionals concerning their proper use. Each of these drugs has value in the pharmaceutical marketplace, and each has value to patients. However, because the manufacturer and the FDA could not prevent co-prescription of these drugs with interacting drugs resulting in fatal interactions, the risk associated with continued widespread availability could not be justified. 5 This problem persists as shown in the 2000 paper by Smalley et al. on prescription errors with cisapride.
6. Several commonly used medications inhibit CYP2D6. These include quinidine 3 as well as haloperidol and some other antipsychotics.

4, 5 The well-described pharmacokinetic interaction between selective serotonin reputake inhibitor antidepressants and tricyclic antidepressants appears to be due to the fact that fluoxetine and paroxetine are both potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 6, 7 and render patients metabolically equivalent to people who do not have the enzyme. The azole antifungal agent fluconazole is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C9. Fluconazole, at conventional doses, abolishes CYP2C9 activity. An interaction between fluconazole and warfarin results in at least a two-fold increase in warfarin blood level, a reduction in warfarin clearance, and increased anticoagulation. 1 Clinical studies have identified a significant interaction between fluconazole and celecoxib, leading to a twofold increase in celecoxib plasma concentrations.

2 A clinical pharmacokinetic study demonstrated an increase in phenytoin area under the plasma concentration curve following fluconazole administration, 3 and symptomatic phenytoin toxicity has been reported with concomitant administration of fluconazole and phenytoin.
4. Ketoconazole 6 and omeprazole 7 are inhibitors of CYP2C19 and have the potential for clinically significant interactions with substrates of CYP2C19 such as diazepam 8 or phenytoin. 9 Isoniazid, used to treat tuberculosis, is an inhibitor of CYP2C19 10 and should be prescribed cautiously to patients taking phenytoin and other drugs metabolized by CYP2C19.

5.3	Increased Risk of Bleeding

Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including ZOLOFT, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymosis, hematoma, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages .

Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of ZOLOFT and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio.

5.4	Activation of Mania or Hypomania

In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with ZOLOFT or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. In controlled clinical trials, patients with bipolar disorder were generally excluded; however, symptoms of mania or hypomania were reported in 0.4% of patients treated with ZOLOFT. Prior to initiating treatment with ZOLOFT, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania.

5.5	Discontinuation Syndrome

Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [See Dosage and Administration (2.6)] .

5.6	Seizures

ZOLOFT has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with a history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. ZOLOFT should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder.

Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4

In three separate in vivo interaction studies, ZOLOFT was co-administered with CYP3A4 substrates, terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride under steady-state conditions. The results of these studies indicated that ZOLOFT did not increase plasma concentrations of terfenadine, carbamazepine, or cisapride. These data indicate that ZOLOFT’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance. Results of the interaction study with cisapride indicate that ZOLOFT 200 mg (once daily) induces the metabolism of cisapride (cisapride AUC and Cmaxwere reduced by about 35%) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Microsomal Enzyme Induction

Preclinical studies have shown ZOLOFT to induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. In clinical studies, ZOLOFT was shown to induce hepatic enzymes minimally as determined by a small (5%) but statistically significant decrease in antipyrine half-life following administration of 200 mg of ZOLOFT per day for 21 days. This small change in antipyrine half-life reflects a clinically insignificant change in hepatic metabolism.

Cimetidine

In a study assessing disposition of ZOLOFT (100 mg) on the second of 8 days of cimetidine administration (800 mg daily), there were increases in ZOLOFT mean AUC (50%), Cmax(24%) and half-life (26%) compared to the placebo group [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Diazepam

In a study comparing the disposition of intravenously administered diazepam before and after 21 days of dosing with either ZOLOFT (50 to 200 mg/day escalating dose) or placebo, there was a 32% decrease relative to baseline in diazepam clearance for the ZOLOFT group compared to a 19% decrease relative to baseline for the placebo group (p<0.03). There was a 23% increase in Tmaxfor desmethyldiazepam in the ZOLOFT group compared to a 20% decrease in the placebo group (p<0.03) [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Lithium

In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, the administration of two doses of ZOLOFT did not significantly alter steady-state lithium levels or the renal clearance of lithium [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Tolbutamide

In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of ZOLOFT for 22 days (including 200 mg/day for the final 13 days) caused a statistically significant 16% decrease from baseline in the clearance of tolbutamide following an intravenous 1000 mg dose. ZOLOFT administration did not noticeably change either the plasma protein binding or the apparent volume of distribution of tolbutamide, suggesting that the decreased clearance was due to a change in the metabolism of the drug [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Atenolol

ZOLOFT (100 mg) when administered to 10 healthy male subjects had no effect on the beta-adrenergic blocking ability of atenolol [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Digoxin

In a placebo-controlled trial in normal volunteers, administration of ZOLOFT for 17 days (including 200 mg/day for the last 10 days) did not change serum digoxin levels or digoxin renal clearance [See Drug Interactions (7.2)] .

Patients should contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [See Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Increased Risk of Bleeding

Inform patients about the concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the-counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [See Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline HCl) [^6e5da2fc]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

SSRIs, including Sertraline HCl Capsules, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Sertraline HCl Capsules in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral ingestion or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Sertraline HCl Capsules, discontinue Sertraline HCl Capsules before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Monitor all patients taking Sertraline HCl Capsules for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Sertraline HCl Capsules and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Sertraline HCl Capsules with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

### Interaction of ST John's wort with conventional drugs: systematic review of clinical trials [^e0dece45]. BMJ (2004). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the methodological quality of clinical trials that examined possible interactions of St John's wort with conventional drugs, and to examine the results of these trials.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Electronic databases from inception to April 2004, reference lists from published reports, and experts in the field.

Study Selection

Eligible studies were prospective clinical trials evaluating the pharmacokinetic effect of St John's wort on the metabolism of conventional drugs.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers selected studies for inclusion and independently extracted data.

Data Synthesis

22 pharmacokinetic trials studied an average of 12 (SD 5) participants; 17 trials studied healthy volunteers and five studied patients. Most (17) studies used a "before and after" design; four studies used control groups other than the active group. Three studies randomised the sequence of administration or the participants to study arms or periods; three studies blinded participants or investigators. In 15 trials, investigators independently assayed the herb. Of 19 trials with available plasma data, three found no important interaction (change in area under the curve < 20%) and 17 found a decrease in systemic bioavailability of the conventional drug; in seven studies the 95% confidence interval excluded a decrease of < 20%.

Conclusion

Clinicians and patients should beware of possible decreases in the systemic bioavailability of conventional drugs when taken concomitantly with St John's wort.

5.2 Serotonin Syndrome

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including sertraline hydrochloride, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate sertraline hydrochloride in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride tablets, discontinue sertraline hydrochloride tablets before initiating treatment with the MAOI [See Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1)] .

Monitor all patients taking sertraline hydrochloride for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment.

St. John's wort—effectiveness, tolerability, regulation, adverse effects, and interactions: Low-quality evidence showed that St. John’s wort may be as effective as SGAs for treating major depressive disorder, and moderate-quality evidence showed that St. John’s wort was better tolerated than SGAs; in older persons, St. John’s wort was equally effective and had similar rates of adverse events compared with SGAs. However, St. John’s wort is not currently regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there is no current standard regarding contents and potency, and patients in the United States may not be able to obtain quality-controlled preparations comparable to those studied. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, skin reactions, fatigue, sedation, restlessness, dizziness, headache, and dry mouth; it has many drug interactions and is known to induce cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4, may reduce the bioavailability or efficacy of drugs such as oral contraceptives and immunosuppressants, and is contraindicated in patients receiving monoamine oxidase or serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Community identification of natural health product-drug interactions [^b0413302]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The majority of Canadians use natural health products (NHPs), most of which are purchased in pharmacies. Community pharmacists regularly field inquiries regarding NHPs. As such, pharmacists are ideally placed to answer questions about NHP use and interactions with other medications.

Objective

To identify community pharmacists' familiarity with NHPs and NHP-related adverse events (AEs) and their knowledge and ability to counsel on potential and known NHP-drug interactions.

Methods

Survey questions were derived from a literature review of previous surveys, data collected from Health Canada, and in consultation with clinicians, pharmacists, policy-makers, and researchers. A convenience sample of 321 community pharmacists in Alberta and British Columbia were asked to participate.

Results

We received responses from 132 pharmacists, resulting in a response rate of 41% (132/321). A total of 19% of the sample had previously reported an adverse event to Health Canada. When asked specifically about NHP-drug interactions/AEs, 47% of pharmacists stated that they had identified a potential interaction; however, only 2 of these reported it to Health Canada. Pharmacists were most familiar (76% of respondents) with the interaction between sertraline and St. John's wort and were least familiar with interactions between NHPs and anti-retrovirals.

Conclusions

This survey provides evidence to suggest that pharmacists encounter reportable NHP-drug interactions, yet rarely choose to report these events. The current lack of available data on NHP AEs makes it difficult to provide patients and healthcare providers with useful strategies for managing AEs and drug interactions. Changes to the current system of monitoring AEs due to NHPs and further education of healthcare professionals regarding NHP-drug interactions is required.

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^f5b181cf]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

Serotonin Syndrome: The development of a potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome has been reported with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Sertraline hydrochloride, alone but particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John’s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).

Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms(e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). Patients should be monitored for the emergence of serotonin syndrome.

The concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders is contraindicated. Sertraline hydrochloride should also not be started in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. All reports with methylene blue that provided information on the route of administration involved intravenous administration in the dose range of 1 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. There may be circumstances when it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking sertraline hydrochloride. Sertraline hydrochloride should be discontinued before initiating treatment with the MAOI (see CONTRAINDICATIONS and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If concomitant use of sertraline hydrochloride with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, tryptophan, and St. John’s Wort is clinically warranted, patients should be made aware of a potential increased risk for serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.

Treatment with Sertraline hydrochloride and any concomitant serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately if the above events occur and supportive symptomatic treatment should be initiated.

Drug Interactions

CNS-depressants

Coadministration of Zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Zolpidem Tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs. Imipramine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance.

A study involving haloperidol and Zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration.

An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral Zolpidem was demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Following five consecutive nightly doses at bedtime of oral Zolpidem Tartrate 10 mg in the presence of sertraline 50 mg (17 consecutive daily doses, at 7:00 am, in healthy female volunteers), Zolpidem Cmaxwas significantly higher (43%) and Tmaxwas significantly decreased (-53%). Pharmacokinetics of sertraline and N-desmethylsertraline were unaffected by Zolpidem.

Laboratory Tests

There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.

Drug InteractionsTryptophan

As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are coadministered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of headache, nausea, sweating, and dizziness, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking paroxetine. Consequently, concomitant use of paroxetine with tryptophan is not recommended (see WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome).

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

See CONTRAINDICATIONS and WARNINGS .

Pimozide

In a controlled study of healthy volunteers, after paroxetine was titrated to 60 mg daily, co-administration of a single dose of 2 mg pimozide was associated with mean increases in pimozide AUC of 151% and Cmax of 62%, compared to pimozide administered alone. The increase in pimozide AUC and Cmax is due to the CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine.  Due to the narrow therapeutic index of pimozide and its known ability to prolong the QT interval, concomitant use of pimozide and paroxetine is contraindicated (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Serotonergic Drugs

Based on the mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs, including paroxetine hydrochloride, and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when paroxetine is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as triptans, lithium, fentanyl, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS, Serotonin Syndrome).

Regarding the use of sertraline hydrochloride PO (also known as Zoloft, Zoloft) in pregnant patients for third trimester: consider safer alternatives. Evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor neonates for direct toxic effects of the drug, serotonin syndrome and discontinuation syndrome. The use of SSRIs in late pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, and symptoms of poor adaptation in the neonate. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for perinatal depression and anxiety, with sertraline being a reasonable first-line option. The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments recommends sertraline as a second-line option for major depressive disorder during pregnancy. The drug sertraline hydrochloride PO (also known as Zoloft, Zoloft) is classified under category C in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations.

St. John’s wort dosing and safety—St. John’s wort is not FDA-approved, and therefore there is a risk that the dosing may not be consistent across formulations; commonly studied extracts were standardized to hypericin (0.1 – 0.3%) or hyperforin (1 – 6%) and used at therapeutic dosages ranging from 500 – 1,800 mg daily, with dosing commonly given three times daily and initiated at a total daily dose of 900 mg. St. John’s wort should not be used in pregnant or breastfeeding women; adverse effects include gastrointestinal upset, mild sedation, restlessness, and increased risk of photosensitivity at higher doses. Drug interactions are emphasized: St. John’s wort can result in serotonin syndrome when combined with SSRIs or other serotonergic agents, and it induces cytochrome P450 3A4 leading to reduced efficacy of various medications including oral contraceptives, TCAs, and anti-epileptic drugs. In addition, it is important to ensure that providers are recommending the standardized extracts that have been studied.

7.1 CNS-Active Drugs

CNS Depressants

Coadministration of Zolpidem with other CNS depressants increases the risk of CNS depression. Concomitant use of Zolpidem with these drugs may increase drowsiness and psychomotor impairment, including impaired driving ability [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]. Zolpidem Tartrate was evaluated in healthy volunteers in single-dose interaction studies for several CNS drugs.

Alcohol

An additive adverse effect on psychomotor performance between alcohol and oral Zolpidem was demonstrated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)]

Opioids

The concomitant use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets with opioids may increase the risk of respiratory depression. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of Zolpidem Tartrate Tablets and opioids [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]

Imipramine, Chlorpromazine

Imipramine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with Zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Sertraline

Concomitant administration of Zolpidem and sertraline increases exposure to Zolpidem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Fluoxetine

After multiple doses of Zolpidem Tartrate and fluoxetine an increase in the Zolpidem half-life (17%) was observed. There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Haloperidol

A study involving haloperidol and Zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of Zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Pharmacokinetic interactions of drugs with ST John's wort [^57731d8a]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2004). Low credibility.

There is a worldwide increasing use of herbs which are often administered in combination with therapeutic drugs, raising the potential for herb-drug interactions. St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is one of the most commonly used herbal antidepressants. A literature search was performed using Medline (via Pubmed), Biological Abstracts, Cochrane Library, AMED, PsycINFO and Embase (all from their inception to September 2003) to identify known drug interaction with St John's wort. The available data indicate that St John's wort is a potent inducer of CYP 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (PgP), although it may inhibit or induce other CYPs, depending on the dose, route and duration of administration. Data from human studies and case reports indicate that St John's wort decreased the blood concentrations of amitriptyline, cyclosporine, digoxin, fexofenadine, indinavir, methadone, midazolam, nevirapine, phenprocoumon, simvastatin, tacrolimus, theophylline and warfarin, whereas it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, dextromethorphan, mycophenolic acid and pravastatin. St John's wort decreased the plasma concentration of the active metabolite SN-38 in cancer patients receiving irinotecan treatment. St John's wort did not alter the pharmacokinetics of tolbutamide, but increased the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Several cases have been reported that St John's wort decreased cyclosporine blood concentration leading to organ rejection. St John's wort caused breakthrough bleeding and unplanned pregnancies when used concomitantly with oral contraceptives. It also caused serotonin syndrome when coadministered with selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (e.g. sertaline and paroxetine). Both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic components may play a role in these interactions. Because the potential interaction of St John's wort with other drugs is a major safety concern, additional systematic research on herb-drug interactions and appropriate regulation in herbal safety and efficacy is needed.

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^ff99a36f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

St. John's wort dry extract Ze 117 is approved in several countries for the short‐term treatment of mild‐to‐moderate depressive disorders (ICD‐10 F32.0 and F32.1). Various clinical studies have shown that St. John's wort preparations are as efficacious as synthetic antidepressants but are usually better tolerated than their chemical counterparts 1 and were granted with the well‐established use status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 2, 3 Major constituents in St. John's wort extracts are hypericin, hyperforin, various flavonoids, and procyanidines. 4 According to the monograph of the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (HMPC) of the EMA, 2, 3 Hypericum extracts can contain variable amounts of constituents up to a maximum of 6.0%, 0.1–0.3% hypericin, and a minimum of 6.0% flavonoids. The commercial extract Ze 117 contains up to 0.3% hypericin and low amounts of hyperforin (≤ 0.2%).

The mechanism of action of St. John's wort is still not fully elucidated in detail, but the accepted hypothesis is that St. John's wort exerts its antidepressant effects by inhibiting a reuptake of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine in the presynaptic cleft and through a modulating effect on neurotransmitters at the post‐synaptic membrane. 5, 6

However, the contribution of individual Hypericum constituents to the overall efficacy is still a matter of debate. In vitro and in vivo data are either in favor or against hyperforin being the major active principle, but based on published data, a definite conclusion is still not possible. 6 Considering the clinical data, extracts devoid of hyperforin have been proven to be efficacious, and thus it appears that hyperforin is not an essential constituent in Hypericum preparations. These studies demonstrated that Hypericum extract (Ze 117) is as efficacious as imipramine and fluoxetine and superior to placebo 7, 8, 9 in the treatment of depressive disorders.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Advise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .

Serotonin Syndrome

Caution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of paroxetine tablets with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John’s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7)] .

Concomitant Medications

Advise patients to inform their physician if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, since there is a potential for drug-drug interactions [see Warning and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7)] .

### Citalopram hydrobromide (Celexa) [^12a57bc1]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their 
prescriber if these occur while taking Celexa.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert 
to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, 
hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), 
hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, 
and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when 
the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be 
advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since 
changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's 
prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in 
onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as 
these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and 
behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in 
the medication.

Laboratory Tests

There are no specific laboratory tests recommended.

Drug Interactions

Serotonergic Drugs : Based on the 
mechanism of action of SNRIs and SSRIs including Celexa, and the potential for 
serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when Celexa is coadministered with other 
drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems, such as 
triptans, linezolid (an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), 
lithium, tramadol, or St. John's Wort (see WARNINGS-Serotonin Syndrome). The concomitant use of Celexa with other SSRIs, SNRIs or tryptophan is not 
recommended (see PRECAUTIONS - Drug 
Interactions).

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^60f66f68]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Tolerability

There was also evidence to suggest SSRIs may increase the likelihood of dropout due to treatment (RR 2.59, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.94; I 2 = 0%; 3 studies, 1270 participants; Analysis 14.3). When the four included studies were subgrouped into two of fluoxetine (Niaura 2002 ; Spring 2007), and one of sertraline (Covey 2002), there was no evidence of a subgroup difference (I 2 = 0%).

There was some evidence that there may be an increased risk of discontinuation in the MAOI groups, and this persisted when we removed one study judged to be at high risk of bias. However, there was substantial imprecision in this analysis (Analysis 16.7).

One study each assessed dropout due to treatment for venlafaxine versus placebo (Cinciripini 2005 ; Analysis 17.2), St John's wort versus placebo (Parsons 2009 ; Analysis 18.4), and SAMe versus placebo (Sood 2012 ; Analysis 19.4). These studies did not provide sufficient evidence to draw clear conclusions.

### Antidepressants for smoking cessation [^5f34a5da]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Depression

Of the three studies conducting post hoc analyses of fluoxetine (Saules 2004 ; Spring 2007) and paroxetine (Killen 2000) to assess the interaction between depression and antidepressant quit rates, none provided evidence to support this interaction (George 2003 ; Kahn 2012).

The two studies conducting post hoc analyses of selegiline to assess the interaction between depression and antidepressant quit rates also did not provide evidence to support this interaction (George 2003 ; Kahn 2012).

Harms

There was insufficient evidence to indicate whether SSRIs increased the risk of AEs relative to placebo. Only two trials of fluoxetine investigated this, one of which provided data that could be analysed (NCT00578669 ; Analysis 14.2). Minami 2014 found that those in the fluoxetine group reported more symptoms the day before the set quit date, in comparison to those in the placebo group. Further, failure to quit on the target quit date could be significantly predicted by levels of side effects.

For the comparison of MAOIs relative to placebo, there was no clear evidence of increased risk of experiencing either AEs (Analysis 16.2), psychiatric AEs (Analysis 16.3), or SAEs (Analysis 16.6). However, the latter two analyses suffered from substantial imprecision and should be treated with caution. Substantial imprecision and heterogeneity also meant that we were unable to draw conclusions regarding insomnia and anxiety (Analysis 16.4 ; Analysis 16.5).

The one study assessing harm outcomes for St John's wort versus placebo did not provide sufficient evidence to assess whether it increased the likelihood of SAEs or all‐cause mortality specifically (Parsons 2009 ; Analysis 18.2 ; Analysis 18.3). A study of SAMe versus placebo did not provide sufficient evidence on AEs or insomnia (Sood 2012 ; Analysis 19.2 ; Analysis 19.3).

### Structural basis of thiamine transport and drug recognition by SLC19A3 [^665364f9]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Drug interactions of SLC19A3

Previous studies identified a broad spectrum of FDA-approved drugs that act as thiamine uptake inhibitors (TUIs) by blocking hSLC19A3,,. This has important clinical implications, as many of these drugs are widely prescribed over extended periods of time. Among these drugs are antidepressants, such as sertraline (Zoloft® and others) and amitriptyline, the antiparasitic hydroxychloroquine and the Janus-kinase (JAK) inhibitor fedratinib (Inrebic®). The inhibition of SLC19A3 can lead to organism-wide and tissue-specific thiamine deficiencies. In the latter case, the deficiencies would not be reflected in serum thiamine levels and remain undetected in standard diagnostics. As BTBGD-causing mutations and the example of SLC19A3 knock-out mice illustrate, this can lead to the decline of entire cell populations in vital organs, particularly in the brain,. Studying recombinantly purified hSLC19A3 in thermal shift assays, we explored the interaction space of the transporter with six known TUIs and eleven pharmacologically related drugs (Fig. 3). The corresponding screen confirmed physical binding of known inhibitors to hSLC19A3, and further led to the identification of nine previously unknown drug interactions, of which seven show inhibitor function (Fig. 3). To begin with, several drugs that are structurally related to thiamine were probed. The known hSLC19A3 inhibitors amprolium and trimethoprim strongly stabilised the transporter against heat unfolding in a concentration-dependent manner. This effect was exceeded by the antiparasitic pyrimethamine tested here (Fig. 3a). Even at a concentration of 20 μM, this compound led to a thermostabilisation of 9.3 ± 0.5 °C and reduced thiamine-uptake through hSLC19A3 by about 50% in cell-based assays.

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^31fa92e7]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort) is used to treat mild-to-moderate depression. Its potential safety risks are pharmacokinetic drug interactions via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and P-glycoprotein, presumably caused by hyperforin. In a phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, single-sequence study, the low-hyperforin Hypericum extract Ze 117 was investigated using a drug cocktail in 20 healthy volunteers. No pharmacokinetic interactions of Ze 117 were observed for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and P-glycoprotein. Area under the curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C max ) of the used probe drugs showed 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios of the drugs taken together with Ze 117 vs. probe drug alone, well within the predefined bioequivalence range of 80-125%. Though Ze 117 did not induce dextromethorphan metabolism by CYP2D6, it weakly increased dextromethorphan AUC ratio (mean 147.99, 95% CI 126.32-173.39) but not the corresponding metabolic ratio. Ze 117 does not show clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions with important CYPs and P-glycoprotein.

### Opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions: from the perspectives of evidence based on randomized controlled trials and clinical risk management [^c323e5ac]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Ticlopidine–tramadol

An RCT assessed possible drug interactions of tramadol 50 mg after 4 days of pretreatment with ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily) alone or along with itraconazole (200 mg once daily) in healthy subjects. Results showed that ticlopidine could significantly increase the mean AUC (0–infinity) of tramadol by 2.0-fold and C max by 1.4-fold, reduce its oral and renal clearance, and inhibit the formation of active M1 from tramadol. The ticlopidine–tramadol pharmacokinetic DDI is most likely due to inhibition of CYP2B6 and/or CYP2D6 by ticlopidine. Itraconazole has no marked effect on the ticlopidine–tramadol interaction.Concomitant use of ticlopidine and tramadol may enhance the risk of serotonergic effects, especially when higher doses of tramadol are used.

St John’s wort–oral oxycodone

Combination use of opioids and herbal antidepressant St John’s wort is possible because chronic pain is usually associated with depression. An RCT in healthy participants assessed the effects of a high hyperforin-containing product of St John’s wort 300 mg t.i.d. for 15 days on the CYP3A-mediated metabolism and behavioral and analgesic effects of oral oxycodone hydrochloride 15 mg. Results showed that St John’s wort could significantly reduce oxycodone AUC by 50%, shorten elimination half-life, and decrease the self-reported drug effect of oxycodone despite no alternation in cold pain threshold.Due to risk of subtherapeutic concentrations of oxycodone, attention should be drawn to the concomitant use of St John’s wort and oxycodone. Dose titration may be needed when St John’s wort treatment is added or discontinued. Further studies are needed to extend the results to chronic pain patients receiving oxycodone or verify the findings when low hyperforin-containing St John’s wort extracts are comedicated.

### Opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions: from the perspectives of evidence based on randomized controlled trials and clinical risk management [^86511a61]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Multimorbidity results in complex polypharmacy which may bear a risk of drug interactions. A better understanding of opioid analgesics combination therapy used for pain management could help warrant medication safety, efficacy, and economic relevance. Until now there has been no review summarizing the opioid analgesics-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions from the perspective of evidence based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Method

A literature search was performed using PubMed, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library, using a PRISMA flowchart.

Results

Fifty-two RCTs were included for data interpretation. Forty-two RCTs (80.8%) were conducted in healthy volunteers, whereas 10 RCTs (19.2%) enrolled true patients. None of the opioid-drug/herb pairs was listed as contraindications of opioids involved in this review. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as a precipitant drug include morphine-P2Y12 inhibitors, morphine-gabapentin, and methadone-zidovudine. Circumstances in which opioid is comedicated as an object drug include rifampin-opioids (morphine, tramadol, oxycodone, methadone), quinidine-opioids (morphine, fentanyl, oxycodone, codeine, dihydrocodeine, methadone), antimycotics-opioids (buprenorphine, fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, methadone, tilidine, tramadol), protease inhibitors-opioids (ritonavir, ritonavir/lopinavir-oxycodone, ritonavir-fentanyl, ritonavir-tilidine), grapefruit juice-opioids (oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone), antidepressants-opioids (paroxetine-tramadol, paroxetine-hydrocodone, paroxetine-oxycodone, escitalopram-tramadol), metoclopramide-morphine, amantadine-morphine, sumatriptan-butorphanol nasal sprays, ticlopidine-tramadol, St John's wort-oxycodone, macrolides/ketolides-oxycodone, and levomepromazine-codeine. RCTs investigating the same combination, almost unanimously, drew consistent conclusions, except two RCTs on amantadine-intravenous morphine combination where a different amantadine dose was used and two RCTs on morphine-ticagrelor combination where healthy volunteers and true patients were enrolled, respectively. RCTs investigating in true patients may reflect a realistic clinical scenario and overcome the limitation of RCTs performed in healthy volunteers under standardized conditions. Further research opportunities are also presented in this review.

Conclusion

Effective and safe combination therapy of opioids can be achieved by promoting the awareness of potential changes in therapeutic efficacy and toxicities, prescribing alternatives or changing administration strategy, tailoring dose, reviewing the appropriateness of orders, and paying attention to medication monitoring.

Major depressive disorder (MDD)—SGAs versus nonpharmacologic interventions—Low-quality evidence from network meta-analysis showed that SGAs (fluoxetine) were associated with a greater response than ω-3 fatty acids; low-quality evidence from network meta-analysis showed no difference in response between escitalopram and SAMe after 12 weeks of treatment; low-quality evidence from 9 trials showed no difference in response or remission when comparing SGAs with St. John's wort in patients with MDD after 4 to 12 weeks of treatment; for exercise, low-quality evidence from network meta-analysis showed no difference in response for SGAs versus exercise and moderate-quality evidence from 2 trials showed no difference in remission for sertraline compared with exercise in patients with MDD after 16 weeks of treatment; the evidence is insufficient to compare SGAs with meditation or yoga because there were no eligible studies; for combination therapy, low-quality evidence from 1 trial showed no difference in remission for sertraline compared with combination therapy of sertraline and exercise in patients with MDD after 16 weeks of treatment.

### Ziprasidone [^5fe913bd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug-drug interactions can be pharmacodynamic (combined pharmacologic effects) or pharmacokinetic (alteration of plasma levels). The risks of using ziprasidone in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below. All interactions studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone. Based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of ziprasidone, possible interactions could be anticipated:

7.1 Metabolic Pathway

Approximately two-thirds of ziprasidone is metabolized via a combination of chemical reduction by glutathione and enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Less than one-third of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation.

7.2 In Vitro Studies

An in vitro enzyme inhibition study utilizing human liver microsomes showed that ziprasidone had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and thus would not likely interfere with the metabolism of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. There is little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval [see Contraindications (4.1)].
Given the primary CNS effects of ziprasidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.
Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
Risk of serotonin syndrome with concomitant therapy with other serotonergic drugs such as SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort [see Contraindications (4.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### Effect of hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) in major depressive disorder: a randomized controlled trial [^00ece2eb]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Extracts of Hypericum perforatum (St John's wort) are widely used for the treatment of depression of varying severity. Their efficacy in major depressive disorder, however, has not been conclusively demonstrated.

Objective

To test the efficacy and safety of a well-characterized H perforatum extract (LI-160) in major depressive disorder.

Design and Setting

Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 12 academic and community psychiatric research clinics in the United States.

Participants

Adult outpatients (n = 340) recruited between December 1998 and June 2000 with major depression and a baseline total score on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) of at least 20.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive H perforatum, placebo, or sertraline (as an active comparator) for 8 weeks. Based on clinical response, the daily dose of H perforatum could range from 900 to 1500 mg and that of sertraline from 50 to 100 mg. Responders at week 8 could continue blinded treatment for another 18 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Change in the HAM-D total score from baseline to 8 weeks; rates of full response, determined by the HAM-D and Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) scores.

Results

On the 2 primary outcome measures, neither sertraline nor H perforatum was significantly different from placebo. The random regression parameter estimate for mean (SE) change in HAM-D total score from baseline to week 8 (with a greater decline indicating more improvement) was -9.20 (0.67) (95% confidence interval [CI], -10.51 to -7.89) for placebo vs -8.68 (0.68) (95% CI, -10.01 to -7.35) for H perforatum (P =.59) and -10.53 (0.72) (95% CI, -11.94 to -9.12) for sertraline (P =.18). Full response occurred in 31.9% of the placebo-treated patients vs 23.9% of the H perforatum-treated patients (P =.21) and 24.8% of sertraline-treated patients (P =.26). Sertraline was better than placebo on the CGI improvement scale (P =.02), which was a secondary measure in this study. Adverse-effect profiles for H perforatum and sertraline differed relative to placebo.

Conclusion

This study fails to support the efficacy of H perforatum in moderately severe major depression. The result may be due to low assay sensitivity of the trial, but the complete absence of trends suggestive of efficacy for H perforatum is noteworthy.

### ST John's wort (hypericum perforatum) in major depression [^9818f6d6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The herb St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical illnesses. In certain areas of Europe, St John's wort has been a commonly prescribed treatment for depression, but, in the United States, it is available for purchase over the counter as an herbal supplement. Some researchers believe that specific chemical constituents of St John's wort produce change in depression in a way similar to that of antidepressant medications, yet this hypothesis is problematic. In addition, studies that support the efficacy of St John's wort in patients with mild-to-moderate depression have limitations that may affect the accuracy of their conclusions. Studies measuring the effect of St John's wort in major depression have reported conflicting results and need to be reexamined. Because St John's wort is considered by some to be an alternative to conventional therapies, clinicians need to know whether it is an effective and safe treatment for different levels of severity of depression. Current evidence does not support its use, and, because of potential drug interactions, St John's wort is not a benign treatment.

Tolerability

Sixteen participants reported 31 treatment‐emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of mild to moderated intensity (the most prevalent being headache and fatigue). Ze 117 given alone and in combination with the cocktail probe drugs was well tolerated. Four participants (21.1%) reported six Ze 117‐related TEAEs after dosing of the Ze 117 on Days 10 to 16, when Ze 117 was administered alone; and four participants (20.0%) reported four probe drug–related TEAEs on Day 1. One participant was withdrawn because of adverse effects on Day 5 (tonsillitis), and this was deemed unrelated to the study medication. No drug‐related TEAEs started after the last dose of Ze 117 administered together with the Geneva cocktail.

The most frequently reported TEAE was headache (overall four participants (20.0%) reported six TEAEs), followed by fatigue (overall three participants (15.0%) reported three TEAEs).

All TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity and recovered/resolved by the end of the study.

Vital signs showed no clinically relevant changes after dosing, except for an increased body temperature in three participants (15.0%) during the period between the first cocktail administration and before the start of the Ze 117 dosing. These were considered unlikely to be related to probe drug administration.

All electrocardiograms were without any clinically significant findings.

### The clinical effectiveness of sertraline in primary care and the role of depression severity and duration (PANDA): a pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial [^e69aedb5]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Statistical analyses

When originally devised, the primary aim of the PANDA trial was to investigate the severity and duration of depressive symptoms associated with a clinically important response to sertraline, as stated in the protocol paperand on. However, towards the later stages of designing the trial and when formulating the detailed(uploaded before any analyses were done to UCL Discovery and approved by the trial steering committee), it became apparent that we would have insufficient statistical power to estimate plausible interaction effects that would allow us to investigate those aims. Therefore, our power calculationand primary analysis (as stated in the analysis plan) are based on a primary aim to examine the clinical effectiveness of sertraline versus placebo. Interactions between severity and duration at baseline and treatment allocation were planned as exploratory. Our protocol paper has described the power calculation in detail.Assuming a two-sided α of 5%, power of 90%, and 10% attrition, 547 participants were required to detect an 11% (relative) difference in scores between sertraline and placebo.

Analyses and reporting were in line with CONSORT guidelines. Primary and secondary outcomes were described in the approved protocol before the study started (appendix pp 59). The measure of self-reported improvement was added as a secondary outcome after the study started but before any analyses were done (appendix pp 25). When the study was registered on ISCRTN, the primary outcome was listed. Secondary outcomes were added later and were described and approved in the study protocol. All analyses compared groups as randomised (intention-to-treat). We compared the proportion of patients in each group who were categorised as adherent with Pearson's χ 2 test. Physical symptoms that could be SSRI side-effects were compared by group with independent t -tests. Analyses of adherence and physical symptoms were done at each follow-up visit. We report serious adverse events during the trial according to treatment allocation.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^ddbedd99]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

General adult population—initial and combined treatment guidance: For the initial treatment of adult patients with depression, the panel recommends that clinicians offer either psychotherapy or second-generation antidepressants and use a shared decision-making approach to consider options. For the choice among models of psychotherapy, the panel does not make a recommendation for a specific therapy for initial treatment among behavioral therapy, cognitive therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, psychodynamic therapy, and supportive therapy. If considering combined treatment, the panel recommends cognitive-behavioral therapy or interpersonal psychotherapy plus a second-generation antidepressant. Beyond these recommendations the panel conditionally suggests several treatments based on particular nuanced situations and notes several treatments for which there is insufficient evidence to be able to make a recommendation; regarding complementary and alternative treatments, the panel gave no higher than a conditional recommendation for use, specifically suggested starting with exercise and St. John’s Wort, and urges caution when using over-the-counter agents to prevent unintended drug-drug interactions particularly given variable manufacturing practices.

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^a50b9447]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

PK and statistical end points

Using Phoenix WinNonlin 7.0 (Certara, Princeton, NJ), the following non‐compartmental PK end points were calculated from the individual blood concentration–time data of the probe drugs and their metabolites on Days 1, 8, and 17: AUC 0– t (AUC from time 0 to the last sample drawn), AUC 0–inf (AUC extrapolated to infinite time), C max (peak plasma concentration), λ z (terminal elimination rate constant), t 1/2 (terminal elimination half‐life) and t max (time to reach C max). PK end points were calculated by noncompartmental or model‐free methods, e.g. linear trapezoidal rule for AUC, log‐linear regression for λ z, etc. Missing data were not replaced or imputed in any way. Concentrations below the lower limit of quantification were treated as zero. In cases with multiple peaks, C max and t max referred to the highest measured concentration even if earlier peaks were present. In cases with two or more samples having the same concentration, t max referred to the earliest reading. The data points to be used for calculation of λ z were determined by visual inspection of concentration‐time curves in log‐linear scaling. The calculation was considered sufficiently reliable in case where the coefficient of determination r 2 > 0.85 and unreliable in cases where r 2 < 0.8. Cases in between were considered on a case‐by‐case basis. The value of AUC 0–inf was considered unreliable but was reported if the terminal area beyond the last quantified sample was >20% of the total AUC 0–inf.

To estimate the changes in the activity of the investigated enzymes, the metabolic ratios based on AUC 0– t (metabolite/parent compound) were calculated for each probe drug. These ratios were compared (Day 1 vs. Day 8 and Day 1 vs. Day 17) by linear mixed model analysis (IBM SPSS Software, version 25, IBM, Zürich, Switzerland).

### Effectiveness of ST John's wort in major depression: a randomized controlled trial [^bf8baf71]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Extracts of St John's wort are widely used to treat depression. Although more than 2 dozen clinical trials have been conducted with St John's wort, most have significant flaws in design and do not enable meaningful interpretation.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of a standardized extract of St John's wort with placebo in outpatients with major depression.

Design and Setting

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted between November 1998 and January 2000 in 11 academic medical centers in the United States.

Participants

Two hundred adult outpatients (mean age, 42.4 years; 67.0% female; 85.9% white) diagnosed as having major depression and having a baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score of at least 20.

Intervention

Participants completed a 1-week, single-blind run-in of placebo, then were randomly assigned to receive either St John's wort extract (n = 98; 900 mg/d for 4 weeks, increased to 1200 mg/d in the absence of an adequate response thereafter) or placebo (n = 102) for 8 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome measure was rate of change on the HAM-D over the treatment period. Secondary measures included the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A), the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scale, and the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales (CGI-S and CGI-I).

Results

The random coefficient analyses for the HAM-D, HAM-A, CGI-S, and CGI-I all showed significant effects for time but not for treatment or time-by-treatment interaction (for HAM-D scores, P<.001, P =.16, and P =.58, respectively). Analysis of covariance showed nonsignificant effects for BDI and GAF scores. The proportion of participants achieving an a priori definition of response did not differ between groups. The number reaching remission of illness was significantly higher with St John's wort than with placebo (P =.02), but the rates were very low in the full intention-to-treat analysis (14/98 [14.3%] vs 5/102 [4.9%], respectively). St John's wort was safe and well tolerated. Headache was the only adverse event that occurred with greater frequency with St John's wort than placebo (39/95 [41%] vs 25/100 [25%], respectively).

Conclusion

In this study, St John's wort was not effective for treatment of major depression.

### Coronary artery disease and depression [^41e6aa81]. European Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) as well as depression are both highly prevalent diseases. Both cause a significant decrease in quality of life for the patient and impose a significant economic burden on society. There are several factors that seem to link depression with the development of CAD and with a worse outcome in patients with established CAD: worse adherence to prescribed medication and life style modifications in depressive patients, as well as higher rates in abnormal platelet function, endothelial dysfunction and lowered heart rate variability. The evidence is growing that depression per se is an independent risk factor for cardiac events in a patient population without known CAD and also in patients with established diagnosis of CAD, particularly after myocardial infarction. Treatment of depression has been shown to improve patients' quality of life. However, it did not improve cardiovascular prognosis in depressed patients even though there is open discussion about the trend to better outcome in treated patients. Large scale clinical trials are needed to answer this question. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to be preferable to tricyclic antidepressants for treatment of depressive patients with comorbid CAD because of their good tolerability and absence of significant cardiovascular side effects. Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort), an increasingly used herbal antidepressant drug should be used with caution due to severe and possibly dangerous interaction with cardioactive drugs.

### Safety of hypericum extract in mildly to moderately depressed outpatients: a review based on data from three randomized, placebo-controlled trials [^d1e6e95e]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2004). Low credibility.

Rationale

Hypericum extracts have been regarded as antidepressant drugs without specific side effects by patients, medical professionals and researchers alike. Recently there has been discussion about potential interactions between St. John's wort and other drugs.

Objectives

To investigate the tolerability of Hypericum extract by comparing adverse event rates observed during clinical trials with the herbal drug to those observed under placebo and synthetic antidepressants.

Methods

A data review was performed based on the original data of three double-blind, randomised multicenter trials, during which 594 out-patients suffering from mild to moderate depression according to DSM-IV criteria received 3 x 300 mg/day Hypericum extract (WS 5570, WS 5572, WS 5573) or placebo over a double-blind treatment period of 6 weeks. For the polled data from the three trials, the risk ratios and risk differences versus placebo for single and grouped adverse events were determined along with their 95% confidence intervals. The data were inspected for relevant differences between Hypericum extract and placebo and were compared to trials involving the administration of several synthetic antidepressants.

Results

For the polled data of the three trials, the percentage of patients with any adverse events under Hypericum extract exposition was comparable to placebo. The drug was also found to be devoid of effects of sedation, anticholinergic reactions, gastrointestinal disturbances and sexual dysfunction often found in patients treated with tricyclic antidepressants or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Conclusion

The analysis did not reveal any specific effects of Hypericum extract.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^8a2c2830]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs)—drug interactions: Under antimicrobial therapy, broad-spectrum antibiotics (category 1) are noted as not affecting contraceptive effectiveness; antifungals (category 1) and antiparasitics (category 1) have not demonstrated clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions; rifampin or rifabutin therapy is category 3 with the clarification that effectiveness of CHCs is likely reduced and, if a combined oral contraceptive (COC) is chosen, a preparation containing a minimum of 30 μg ethinyl estradiol should be used. For psychotropic medications, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are category 1 based on limited clinical and pharmacokinetic data indicating no decrease in CHC effectiveness. St. John’s wort is category 2 with evidence of increased metabolism of hormonal contraceptives and decreased hormone concentrations associated with breakthrough bleeding and ovulation.

### Economic evaluation of st. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) for the treatment of mild to moderate depression [^5e4952b0]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The burden of rising health care expenditures has created a demand for information regarding the clinical and economic outcomes associated with Complementary and Alternative Medicines. Clinical controlled trials have found St. John's wort to be as effective as antidepressants in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. The objective of this study was to develop a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of St. John's wort based on this evidence.

Methods

A Markov model was constructed to estimate health and economic impacts of St. John's wort versus antidepressants. Outcomes were treatment costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and Net Monetary Benefits (NMB). Probabilistic analyses were conducted on key model parameters.

Results

The average NMB across 5000 simulations identified St. John's wort as the strategy with the highest net benefit. The total cost savings for SJW were $359.66 and $202.56 per individual for venlafaxine and sertraline respectively, with a gain of 0.08 to 0.12 QALYs over the 72 weeks of the model.

Limitations

A lack of direct comparative clinical trial data comparing SJW to venlafaxine and limited data with sertraline as a comparator was a major limitation.

Conclusions

In this model, St. John's wort was shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants. Patients are more likely to receive treatment for a duration consistent with professional guidelines for treatment of major depression due to reduced incidence of adverse effects, improving outcomes. This represents an important option in the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder.

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^a744a6b9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Nevertheless, the widely differing hyperforin amounts in commercial Hypericum extracts need to be considered when focusing on drug interactions with St. John's wort.

Several studies have shown that, in a dose‐proportional manner, hyperforin is responsible for many of the observed drug interactions. 10, 11, 12 There is thus reasonable evidence to suggest that low‐dose hyperforin extracts exert no significant effects on cytochrome (CYP) enzymes, such as CYP3A4, or on transport proteins such as P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp). 13, 14, 15, 16 Therefore, due to its low hyperforin content, Ze 117 might present with a lower potential for drug interactions than other St. John's wort preparations. Since in vitro data are not always predictive of in vivo behavior of the compound tested, a study in healthy human participants was performed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the Hypericum extract Ze 117 (low in hyperforin) on the interaction potential with relevant CYP enzymes and P‐gp transporter.

The study design was standard for drug–drug interaction studies and was based on US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 17, 18 and EMA 19 regulatory guidance (see Figure 3 for study design).

Cocktail approaches for phenotyping involving the administration of multiple CYP‐specific or P‐gp‐specific probe drugs were used to simultaneously assess the activities of these enzymes and the transporter P‐gp. Many phenotyping cocktails have been developed and used in recent years. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 For this study, the compilation of the probe drugs was selected according to a validated phenotyping cocktail (Geneva cocktail 26, 27), which also included a probe drug for P‐gp (fexofenadine). To our knowledge, this is the first seven‐probe drug cocktail interaction study investigating St. John's wort.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^87c05936]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn: • For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category. • Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder. • Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss. • Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

There have been no formal studies of the interaction of AMELUZ with other drugs. It is possible that concomitant use of other known photosensitizing agents such as St. John’s wort, griseofulvin, thiazide diuretics, sulfonylureas, phenothiazines, sulphonamides, quinolones and tetracyclines may enhance the phototoxic reaction to PDT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] .

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^57d51d8a]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

☑ St. John's wort preparations may induce cytochromes and transport proteins such as P‐glycoprotein (P‐gp), which could result in drug–drug interactions (DDIs). The constituent hyperforin has been demonstrated to be responsible for many of these DDIs.

WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

☑ Evidence suggests that low‐dose hyperforin extracts have a reduced risk of DDIs. Therefore, the low‐hyperforin extract Ze 117 might have a lower potential for DDIs than other high‐hyperforin St. John's wort preparations.

WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

☑ No evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction (neither induction nor inhibition) of the low‐hyperforin extract Ze 117 was observed for CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4, and P‐gp. Ze 117 likewise showed no induction of CYP2D6 but rather a weak and not clinically relevant inhibition of this enzyme.

HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

☑ Low‐hyperforin St. John's wort extracts such as Ze 117 might have a major advantage in drug safety compared with high‐hyperforin St. John's wort preparations, avoiding unnecessary safety risks in co‐medication therapy.

### The treatment of minor depression with st. John's wort or citalopram: failure to show benefit over placebo [^669a53c2]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2011). Low credibility.

This paper presents new data addressing two important controversies in psychiatry: the construct of Minor Depression (MinD) and the efficacy of St. John's Wort for milder forms of depressive disorders. Data are from a three-arm, 12 week, randomized clinical trial of investigating the efficacy of St. John's Wort (810 mg/day), citalopram (20 mg/day), or placebo for acute treatment of MinD. Due to a high placebo response on all outcome measures, neither St. John's Wort nor citalopram separated from placebo on change in depressive symptom severity, quality of life, or well-being. However, systematic assessment of potential adverse effects (AEs) led to three important observations: (1) prior to the administration of study compound, 60% of subjects endorsed items that would be characterized as AEs once study compound was administered, (2) St. John's Wort and citalopram were each associated with a significant number of new or worsening AEs during treatment, and (3) using a structured interview for identifying AEs at baseline and during treatment is informative. MinD was not responsive to either a conventional antidepressant or a nutraceutical, and both compounds were associated with a notable side effects burden. Other treatment approaches for MinD should be investigated.

Demographics

Twenty healthy participants of European ancestry (10 men, 10 women) entered the study. Participants were eligible if they were aged between 18 and 55 years, had a mean body weight of 72.3 kg (range 53.6–88.9 kg), and had a mean body mass index between 19.5 and 28.3 kg/m. 2

Pharmacokinetics

Table 1 summarizes the PK results of probe drugs and the main metabolites: median plasma concentration/time curves are displayed in Figure 1 and Figures S1 and S2.

Primary and secondary end points of probe drugs and metabolites

Figure 1 
Median plasma concentrations of probe drugs (n = 19–20).

With regard to the ratio of geometric least square means (%) and their 90% confidence interval (CI), neither an inhibition (AUC 0– t Day 8/Day 1) nor an induction (AUC 0– t Day 17/Day 1) of metabolism for caffeine, bupropion, flurbiprofen, omeprazole, or midazolam was observed, nor was an effect on fexofenadine transport seen. When the drugs were given with and without Ze 117, the AUC ratios of the probe drugs and their respective metabolites were generally within the extended bioequivalence ranges. Dextromethorphan fulfilled the criteria for weak inhibition after acute administration (162.23% (141.02–186.64%)) and 10‐day treatment with Ze 117 (147.99% (126.32–173.39%)) (see Table 1).

Metabolic ratios (see Table 2) did not change among the different treatments. Although a larger decrease in the metabolic ratio was observed for dextromethorphan, thereby reflecting weak CYP2D6 inhibition, this was not statistically significant either for the comparison of Day 8 vs. Day 1 or when comparing Day 17 vs. Day 1.

Genotyping

Genotyping was performed for CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and ABCB1 (P‐gp) (for details see Table S1): All 20 participants were extensive metabolizers for CYP2B6 according to Turpeinen and Zanger. 28 Two intermediate metabolizers (IMs) and one poor metabolizer (PM) were identified for CYP2C9 according to Deenen, 29 and according to Hicks, 30 two ultrarapid metabolizers, six rapid metabolizers, two IMs, and one PM were detected for CYP2C19, 30 and one ultrarapid metabolizer, one IM, and one PM were determined for CYP2D6.

Three polymorphisms were investigated for P‐gp (rs2032583, rs2235015, and rs2235015). Based on Hicks, 30 the rs2032583 haplotypes showed only normal activity, for rs2235015, five intermediate activity and 15 normal activity were observed, and for rs1045642, six intermediate, five reduced and nine normal activity were seen. The AUC 0– t did not significantly change between Day 1, Day 8, and Day 17 for any of the probe drugs (see Figure 2). Despite this genetic variability, no alterations in the PK of the probe drugs or interactions with Ze 117 were observed for CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or ABCB1 (P‐gp).

17.2 Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance

Clinical studies were performed to examine the effects of venlafaxine on behavioral performance of healthy individuals. The results revealed no clinically significant impairment of psychomotor, cognitive, or complex behavior performance. However, since any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking, or motor skills, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that venlafaxine therapy does not adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

17.3 Concomitant Medication

Patients should be advised to inform their physicians if they are taking, or plan to take, any prescription or over-the-counter drugs, including herbal preparations and nutritional supplements, since there is a potential for interactions.

Patients should be cautioned about the risk of serotonin syndrome with the concomitant use of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, amphetamines, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John’s Wort supplements or other serotonergic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Drug Interactions (7.10)].

Patients should be cautioned about the concomitant use of venlafaxine extended-release tablets and NSAID's, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation since combined use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and these agents has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) and Drug Interactions (7.11)].

17.4 Alcohol

Although venlafaxine has not been shown to increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking venlafaxine.

17.5 Allergic Reactions

Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they develop a rash, hives, or a related allergic phenomenon.

17.6 Pregnancy

Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with venlafaxine extended-release tablets. Advise patients that venlafaxine extended-release tablets use during mid to late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for preeclampsia and may increase the risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Advise patients that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to venlafaxine extended-release tablets during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Herbal and dietary supplement – drug interactions in patients with chronic illnesses [^b0fcfae1]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Herbs, vitamins, and other dietary supplements may augment or antagonize the actions of prescription and nonprescription drugs. St. John's wort is the supplement that has the most documented interactions with drugs. As with many drug-drug interactions, the information for many dietary supplements is deficient and sometimes supported only by case reports. Deleterious effects are most pronounced with anticoagulants, cardiovascular medications, oral hypoglycemics, and antiretrovirals. Case reports have shown a reduction in International Normalized Ratio in patients taking St. John's wort and warfarin. Other studies have shown reduced levels of verapamil, statins, digoxin, and antiretrovirals in patients taking St. John's wort. Physicians should routinely ask patients about their use of dietary supplements when starting or stopping a prescription drug, or if unexpected reactions occur.

In 2001, the Canadian Psychiatric Association and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) partnered to produce evidence-based clinical guidelines for the treatment of depressive disorders. A revision of these guidelines was undertaken by CANMAT in 2008-2009 to reflect advances in the field. There is widespread interest in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Methods

The CANMAT guidelines are based on a question-answer format to enhance accessibility to clinicians. An evidence-based format was used with updated systematic reviews of the literature and recommendations were graded according to Level of Evidence using pre-defined criteria. Lines of Treatment were identified based on criteria that included evidence and expert clinical support. This section on "Complementary and Alternative Medicine Treatments" is one of 5 guideline articles.

Results

There is Level 1 evidence to support light therapy in seasonal MDD and St. John's wort in mild to moderate MDD. There is also some evidence for the use of exercise, yoga and sleep deprivation, as well as for omega-3 fatty acids and SAM-e . Support for other natural health products and therapies is still limited.

Limitations

The evidence base remains limited and studies often have methodological problems, including small samples, variability in dose, short duration of treatment, unknown quality of the agent and limited long-term data. Safety data are also sparse with little information about drug interactions.

Conclusions

Some CAM treatments have evidence of benefit in MDD. However, problems with standardization and safety concerns may limit their applicability in clinical practice.

### Pediatric integrative medicine [^492e1cd8]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Herbal products in pediatric populations warrant caution, as “due caution must be taken with herbal remedies, especially for individuals with allergic reactions to certain plants,” and “Recognition and avoidance of potential herb-drug interactions will help pediatricians optimize patient safety.” A serious interaction example is “the combination of prescription drugs with St. John’s wort, which can affect therapeutic dose of medications that are substrates of cytochrome P450s and/or P-glycoprotein, such as oral contraceptives, anticoagulants, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, and benzodiazepines.”

### St. John's wort [^0280bee4]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

St. John's wort has been used to treat a variety of conditions. Several brands are standardized for content of hypericin and hyperforin, which are among the most researched active components of St. John's wort. St. John's wort has been found to be superior to placebo and equivalent to standard antidepressants for the treatment of mild to moderate depression. Studies of St. John's wort for the treatment of major depression have had conflicting results. St. John's wort is generally well tolerated, although it may potentially reduce the effectiveness of several pharmaceutical drugs.

### Interactions with herbal products: what do we know? [^9db46440]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing use of herbal remedies by the general public presents several challenges to healthcare professionals who may be asked to give advice on the use of such products in conjunction with other medicines. In particular, the pharmacological properties and potential interactions of herbal products are often less well understood than those of conventional medicines, increasing the risk of adverse effects and drug interactions. In addition, good quality data on herbal medicines are often lacking. Here we highlight the problem of drug-herb interactions and consider the nature of the evidence supporting drug interactions with herbal products.

### U.S. medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use, 2024 [^247809b0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2024). High credibility.

U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for progestin-only contraceptives (POC)—St. John’s wort interaction classifications—assign implant 2, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) 1, and progestin-only pills (POP) 2. Evidence states that no studies specifically examined the use of POCs with St. John’s wort, and that any interactions might depend on the St. John’s wort dose and the concentration of active ingredients, with preparations varying. The comment notes that any potential effect on contraceptive effectiveness is likely to be lower with DMPA than with other POCs because of the higher dose of DMPA.

### Buyer beware? Does the information provided with herbal products available over the counter enable safe use? [^fb9b17a0]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The public should be able to expect full disclosure of key safety information when they purchase products herbal medicines over the counter. This study has shown that, among five herbal products commonly purchased over the counter in the UK, most contained little or no information regarding what to check for in order to avoid harm before using the product. Three-quarters of the preparations contained no safety information, and only three contained most or all of the points of information studied. For St John's wort, which has generated the most publicity regarding safe use, two-thirds of the preparations failed to mention any of the possible interactions with conventional medicines such as the oral contraceptive or warfarin. This is consistent with the findings of Clauson et al. in the USA, where the manufacturers of the vast majority of St John's wort preparations failed to adequately address clinically relevant safety issues.

This study provides evidence supporting the need to strengthen regulation of herbal medicines in the EU. Our results show that where a product (here, St John's wort) was registered as a THR, over 85% of the safety information studied was included in the information for the consumer. That this figure was not 100% reflects, as stated above, the lack of consensus on the safety information associated with individual herbal medicines. The information provided with these THR products reflects the MHRA's assessment and is consistent with data in the European Medicines Agency's Community Herbal Monographs.

The number of THR remains small; in this study, the majority of products were not registered, and by April 2011 the MHRA had received 211 applications for THR, among which 104 applications had so far been granted and the remainder were under assessment (R Woodfield, personal communication).

### How effective is ST John's wort? The evidence revisited [^acec7313]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) has been identified as an effective treatment for depression in controlled studies and subsequent meta-analyses. However, 3 recently published large studies failed to demonstrate robust efficacy. Updated meta-analysis and assessment of publication bias may help determine the true effect of St. John's wort.

Method

Meta-analysis to reevaluate the effectiveness of St. John's wort as an antidepressant, funnel plot analysis, and meta-regression to assess the impact of publication bias, small-study effects, and variation in trial characteristics were performed. We conducted 2 analyses: a reproduction of a recent meta-analysis including 15 studies (Meta-15) and a meta-analysis extended by the 3 studies published since then (Meta-18). The studies in Meta-15 were identified through MEDLINE and EMBASE searches conducted in June 2000. The search terms used were St. John's wort, hypericum, hypericin, depression, and antidepressant, and no language restrictions were applied. For both meta-analyses, we compared funnel plots, Begg's rank correlation, Egger's regression, trim and fill method, and meta-regression.

Results

In both analyses, effect sizes in recent studies were smaller than those reported in earlier studies; the addition of more recent studies into the analyses resulted in reduced effect size. In Meta-15, St. John's wort was significantly more effective than placebo with a risk ratio (RR) of 1.97 (CI = 1.54 to 2.53). In Meta-18, the RR was reduced to 1.73 (CI = 1.40 to 2.14). On funnel plot analysis, the Meta-18 plot proved to be much more skewed than the Meta-15 plot. Meta-regression showed that increase in effect size was associated with smaller sample size only. The impact of baseline severity of depression could not be evaluated as the studies used different versions of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.

Conclusion

St. John's wort may be less effective in the treatment of depression than previously assumed and may finally be shown to be ineffective if future trials confirm this trend.

### Update and critique of natural remedies as antidepressant treatments [^9b3cc8a2]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Natural medications such as St. John's Wort, SAMe, and omega-3 fatty acids eventually may prove to be valuable additions to the psychiatrist's pharmacologic armamentarium, both as monotherapy and as adjunctive therapy for mood disorders. Current research data are compelling, from a standpoint of both efficacy and safety, but before clinicians can recommend these as first-line treatments, more well-designed controlled studies in large patient populations are needed. During the past decade, the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute for Mental Health, and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine have widened their support for research on the efficacy and safety of alternative treatments, and increasing numbers of academic institutions are undertaking large-scale, multicenter studies on the natural medications reviewed here, as well as others. These studies should help answer some of the yet-unsettled questions about natural medications. Psychiatrists who are considering recommending natural antidepressants to their patients should emphasize that these treatments are relatively unproven and that it remains to be seen whether they would be appropriate or preferable to the conventional psychotropic agents. in the absence of more conclusive data, the best candidates for alternative treatments may be patients for whom a delay in adequate treatment would not be devastating(eg, the mildly symptomatic patient who has a strong interest in natural remedies). Other good candidates may include patients who have been unresponsive to conventional antidepressants or particularly intolerant of side effects; these patients, however, often are the most difficult to treat, and alternative agents seem best suited for the mildly ill. Care should be taken with patients who are taking multiple medications, in view of adverse drug-drug interactions that have emerged with increased use of alternative treatments. Finally, as with all psychotropic agents, natural medications should be used preferably under the supervision of a physician.

### No clinically relevant interactions of st. John's wort extract Ze 117 low in hyperforin with cytochrome P450 enzymes and P-glycoprotein [^3755a2e5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary objective of this study was to evaluate a possible interaction (induction or inhibition) of St. John's wort dry extract Ze 117 on several cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzymes and P‐gp. We therefore compared the pharmacokinetic (PK) end points (area under the curve from time 0 to the last sample drawn (AUC 0– t) and metabolic ratios) of selective substrates for specific CYPs and P‐gp administered as a cocktail obtained on Day 8 (reflecting inhibition) and on Day 17 (reflecting induction) with Day 1.

Furthermore, the safety of Ze 117 alone and in combination with the probe drugs was also evaluated.

### Nonpharmacologic versus pharmacologic treatment of adult patients with major depressive disorder: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^b79bf45f]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline—harms and clinical considerations in adults with major depressive disorder—notes that SGAs commonly cause constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia, nausea, sexual adverse events, and somnolence; psychotherapy harms were sparsely reported; St. John’s wort adverse effects included gastrointestinal symptoms, dizziness or confusion, and tiredness or sedation; and none were reported with exercise. Similar rates of adverse events and discontinuation were observed across methods except for increased overall discontinuation with SGA compared to CBT monotherapy, increased overall discontinuation with SGA + psychodynamic therapy (PSYD) compared with SGA monotherapy, increased overall discontinuation and discontinuation due to adverse events with SGA compared with third-wave CBT monotherapy, increased overall risk of adverse events with SGAs compared with acupuncture, increased discontinuation (overall and due to adverse events) with SGA compared with St. John’s wort, and increased discontinuation due to adverse events with SGA compared with exercise. Preparations of St. John’s wort differ widely with no standards for purity or potency in the United States, the evidence on efficacy is limited to preparations used in the included studies, and St. John’s wort is associated with drug–drug interactions and is known to induce CYP 3A4.
