intrinsic pathway

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the intrinsic coagulation pathway, including its components, activation mechanisms, distinction from the extrinsic pathway, physiological versus pathological roles, disease associations, and therapeutic implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the intrinsic pathway and its core components. Then, I should verify the activation mechanisms and feedback loops. Next, I will compare intrinsic versus extrinsic pathways and reconcile the classic cascade with modern cell-based models. After that, I need to evaluate the physiological role versus pathological contributions, including specific disease contexts. Finally, I will examine therapeutic strategies targeting the intrinsic pathway and summarize key takeaways with appropriate caveats and references.

> Let me first confirm the definition and core components of the intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic pathway, also called the contact activation system, is initiated by factor XII (FXII, Hageman factor) and sequentially activates factor XI (FXI) and factor IX (FIX), culminating in activation of factor X and thrombin generation; its key components are FXII, prekallikrein (PK), high-molecular-weight kininogen (HK), FXI, and FIX, with FVIII serving as the cofactor for FIXa in the intrinsic tenase complex [^112e4KCu] [^111J6vi1].

> I need to check the activation mechanism next. Contact activation begins when FXII binds negatively charged surfaces (for example, glass in vitro, polyphosphate released from activated platelets, or sulfatides), undergoes conformational change, and autoactivates to FXIIa; FXIIa then activates PK to kallikrein, which reciprocally activates more FXII, forming an amplification loop, while FXIIa also directly activates FXI to FXIa, which in turn activates FIX to FIXa, assembling the FIXa–FVIIIa intrinsic tenase complex that activates FX and drives thrombin generation [^112e4KCu] [^117Kfviu] [^116ZBPcW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about redundancy with the extrinsic pathway. I should verify the distinctions. The extrinsic pathway is initiated by tissue factor (TF) with FVIIa, generating small amounts of FXa and FIXa and initiating thrombin formation. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway is surface-activated and classically viewed as amplifying thrombin generation rather than initiating it, though both converge on FX activation and share common downstream steps including the prothrombinase complex (FXa–FVa) and fibrin formation [^112ifyXv] [^1133TEsk].

> Wait, let me verify the modern cell-based model because it reframes the classic cascade. Contemporary models describe initiation on TF-bearing cells (extrinsic), amplification on platelet surfaces, and propagation phases with explosive thrombin generation. In this framework, the intrinsic pathway contributes to amplification and propagation rather than primary initiation, and TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) provides critical negative regulation of TF–FVIIa–FXa complexes, shaping the threshold and magnitude of thrombin generation [^114utpRF] [^112x16fb].

> I should confirm the physiological role of the intrinsic pathway in hemostasis. Congenital FXII deficiency does not cause bleeding, and severe FXI deficiency generally causes only mild, injury- or surgery-related bleeding, indicating the intrinsic pathway is not essential for baseline hemostasis; instead, TF-driven initiation and platelet-dependent processes suffice for hemostasis, with intrinsic factors playing a supportive, context-dependent role in certain tissues or scenarios [^112e4KCu] [^113teAvZ].

> But wait, what if the intrinsic pathway is disproportionately important in thrombosis? I will now examine that. Multiple lines of evidence show FXII and FXI contribute to arterial and venous thrombosis in animal models, with FXII/FXI deficiency or inhibition reducing thrombus formation without markedly impairing hemostasis; human epidemiology links elevated FXI to increased VTE and stroke risk, and severe FXI deficiency appears protective against thrombosis, supporting a pathogenic role of the intrinsic pathway in thrombosis [^1146t2x6] [^1139RnN9] [^113JnvQ9].

> Let me consider specific disease contexts where the intrinsic pathway is implicated. In COVID-19, contact/intrinsic pathway activation is documented by elevated FXIIa, FXIa, and FIXa–antithrombin complexes and correlates with severity and thrombotic outcomes. In ANCA-associated vasculitis, intrinsic pathway activation predominates during active disease and associates with thrombin generation and VTE. In atherothrombosis, FXIIa bound to thrombi contributes to thrombus stability, complementing TF-driven initiation. And in cancer, tumor-derived extracellular vesicles can activate FXII, linking intrinsic activation to cancer-associated thrombosis [^117J2CvZ] [^111cJeQX] [^1124FNLa] [^112LsDwq] [^111MANqh].

> I should double-check regulatory mechanisms that modulate intrinsic pathway activity. Endothelial PAI-1 can bind and neutralize FXIa, promoting its clearance and thereby restraining intrinsic pathway propagation. Annexin A4 inhibits sulfatide-induced FXII activation. And histidine-rich glycoprotein binds FXIIa and suppresses contact activation, illustrating multiple negative regulators that can dampen intrinsic activation in vivo [^115dPQdA] [^116ZBPcW] [^113V8yRi].

> Next, I should review therapeutic implications and where the field is heading. Because intrinsic pathway factors are less critical for hemostasis but contribute to thrombosis, FXII and FXI have become attractive targets; antisense oligonucleotides and monoclonal antibodies against FXI/FXIa reduce thrombosis with low bleeding liability in early trials, and selective intrinsic pathway inhibitors are in development; notably, a recent high-credibility report describes fucoidan sulfates that selectively inhibit the intrinsic FXase complex, providing a targeted antithrombotic approach with potential safety advantages over common-pathway blockade [^112SvBML] [^117MU12T] [^1135uKCJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially implied the intrinsic pathway is entirely dispensable for hemostasis; I should correct that nuance. While FXII deficiency is not associated with bleeding and FXI deficiency is typically mild, FXI can be activated by thrombin during hemostasis and may support sustained thrombin generation in select settings, so a more precise statement is that the intrinsic pathway is nonessential for basal hemostasis but can modulate hemostatic robustness in certain tissues or injuries, reinforcing its distinction from thrombosis pathways [^113teAvZ] [^114utpRF].

> Let me synthesize the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. The intrinsic pathway is a surface-activated cascade initiated by FXII that amplifies coagulation via FXI and FIX, contributing minimally to normal hemostasis yet disproportionately to pathological thrombosis; this hemostasis–thrombosis uncoupling underpins FXII/FXI-targeted strategies as potentially safer anticoagulants, with growing preclinical and early clinical support and mechanistic validation across inflammatory and thrombotic diseases [^1146t2x6] [^112SvBML] [^112e4KCu].

---

The intrinsic pathway is a **surface-initiated cascade** [^112e4KCu] that begins with factor XII activation on negatively charged surfaces, leading to sequential activation of XI, IX, and X, and culminating in thrombin and fibrin formation [^114aQ4j8]. It is **not essential for normal hemostasis** [^115HWnYY] — FXII deficiency does not cause bleeding — but it drives thrombosis via amplification loops and cross-talk with inflammation [^114Qam9f] [^112B8ip2]. Key regulators include C1 inhibitor, antithrombin, and TFPI [^116tFtLM] [^111SbDEn]; targeting FXII/FXI is a promising antithrombotic strategy with minimal bleeding risk [^1146t2x6] [^112SvBML].

---

## Initiation and activation

- **Trigger**: Contact with negatively charged surfaces (glass, kaolin, collagen, polyphosphate, NETs) [^111qdRAH] [^111DsVy5] [^111LyrXL] [^117Kfviu] [^111WpyNQ] activates FXII to FXIIa [^113WTtM7].

- **Amplification**: FXIIa activates FXI to FXIa, which activates FIX to FIXa [^111J6vi1].

- **Tenase complex**: FIXa with FVIIIa (activated by thrombin or FXa) activates FX to FXa [^1133TEsk].

- **Common pathway**: FXa with FVa forms prothrombinase, generating thrombin and fibrin [^111Mx5fu].

---

## Key components and cofactors

| **Factor** | **Role** |
|-|-|
| FXII | Initiates cascade; activated by contact [^112e4KCu] |
| FXI | Activated by FXIIa; activates FIX [^111J6vi1] |
| FIX | Activated by FXIa; forms intrinsic tenase [^1133TEsk] |
| FVIII | Cofactor for FIXa; activated by thrombin or FXa [^111SbDEn] |
| FX | Activated by intrinsic tenase; forms prothrombinase [^111Mx5fu] |
| FV | Cofactor for FXa; activated by thrombin or FXa [^117FEM5K] |
| thrombin | Converts fibrinogen to fibrin; amplifies cascade [^112y5bCN] |

---

## Regulation and inhibition

- **C1 inhibitor**: Inactivates FXIIa, FXIa, and kallikrein [^112PHSf1].

- **Antithrombin**: Inhibits FXIIa, FXIa, FIXa, FXa, and thrombin [^notfound].

- **TFPI**: Inhibits FXa and the TF-FVIIa complex, indirectly limiting intrinsic pathway amplification [^112x16fb].

---

## Clinical significance

- **Hemostasis**: Not essential; FXII deficiency does not cause bleeding [^115HWnYY].

- **Thrombosis**: Central driver via amplification and inflammation; FXII/FXI inhibition reduces thrombosis with minimal bleeding [^1146t2x6] [^112SvBML].

- **Inflammation**: Linked to bradykinin and complement; FXII/FXI inhibitors may reduce inflammatory thrombosis [^114Qam9f] [^112B8ip2].

---

## Therapeutic implications

FXII/FXI inhibitors are under development and offer **antithrombotic efficacy with low bleeding risk** [^1146t2x6] [^112SvBML]. Antisense and monoclonal approaches targeting FXI show promise in early trials [^111XMAFM] [^113JnvQ9]. Selective intrinsic pathway blockade is a **key strategy** to separate thrombosis from hemostasis [^1135uKCJ].

---

The intrinsic pathway is a **surface-initiated cascade** that amplifies coagulation and links to inflammation; it is not required for normal hemostasis but is a major driver of thrombosis, making FXII/FXI attractive therapeutic targets [^112e4KCu] [^1146t2x6].

### Intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation contributes to thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic plaque [^1166ziZf]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

Thrombosis is the major mechanism underlying acute complications of atherosclerosis. Although thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic plaques has been ascribed to activation of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation, in the present study we investigated contribution of the intrinsic factor VIII (fVIII)-dependent pathway. We found that in vitro exposure of human macrophages and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) enhances their ability to support activity of 2 major complexes of the intrinsic pathway, Xase and prothrombinase, leading to a 20- and 10-fold increase in thrombin formation, respectively. In contrast, human aortic endothelial cells were less responsive to oxLDL. The increase in the intrinsic procoagulant activity was related to formation of additional fVIII binding sites due to enhanced translocation of phosphatidylserine to the outer surface of oxLDL-treated cells and a 5-fold higher affinity of interaction between components of the Xase complex, activated factors VIII and IX. Processes occurring at early apoptotic stages, including changes in the cell membrane induced by free radicals, may be related to activation of the intrinsic pathway as suggested by effects of inhibitors of early apoptosis on thrombin formation. Immunohistochemical studies on human atherectomy specimens revealed the presence of fVIII in the vicinity of macrophages and SMCs in atheromatous regions with massive deposits of oxLDL, supporting the possible involvement of the intrinsic pathway in thrombus formation in vivo. Our data predict that the intrinsic pathway significantly enhances thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic lesions after removal of the endothelial layer and exposure of SMCs and macrophages to blood flow.

### The intrinsic coagulation pathway plays a dominant role in driving hypercoagulability in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^1124FNLa]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The risk of a venous thrombotic event (VTE) is increased in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV); however, a detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of hypercoagulability is limited. We assessed prospectively different coagulation parameters in 71 patients with active AAV at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up. D-dimers and fibrinogen were increased in most patients at presentation and remained elevated in half of the patients. Particularly, thrombin-antithrombin (T:AT) complex and activated coagulation factors in complex with their natural inhibitors of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (ie, activated FXII:C1 esterase inhibitor [FXIIa:C1Inh], FXIa:AT, and FXIa:alpha1-antitrypsin [FXIa:α1AT]) were profoundly elevated in patients at baseline. Thrombin formation was dominantly correlated with coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway (ie, FXIIa:AT, FXIa:AT, FXIa:α1AT, and FXIa:C1Inh) compared to the extrinsic pathway (ie, FVIIa:AT). Hypercoagulability correlated with higher disease activity, ANCA levels, C-reactive protein, serum creatinine, and proteinuria. VTEs were observed in 5 out of 71 (7%) patients within 1 month (interquartile range, 1–5) after inclusion. Baseline T:AT levels were significantly higher in patients with VTE than in those without VTE (P = 0.044), but other clinical or laboratory markers were comparable between both groups. Hypercoagulability is dominantly characterized by activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and elevated D-dimers in active AAV. The driving factors of hypercoagulability are yet to be studied but are most likely related to an interplay of increased disease activity, vascular inflammation, and endothelial damage. Future targets for intervention could include inhibitors of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and compounds specifically reducing the hyperinflammatory state.

### Factor XI deficiency – resolving the enigma? [^114pboxn]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

The management of factor XI deficiency is not straightforward for three reasons: firstly, the role of this factor in the coagulation pathway is not clearly understood; secondly, the bleeding tendency, although mild, is unpredictable and does not clearly relate to the factor XI level; and thirdly, all treatment products, although available, have some potentially serious side effects. These factors (or enigmas) contribute to the variable management of patients with this coagulation factor deficiency, but recent research is helping to clarify some of these areas.

### Coagulation procofactor activation by factor XIa [^111Z2Cg9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary Background

In the extrinsic pathway, the essential procofactors factor (F) V and FVIII are activated to FVa and FVIIIa by thrombin. In the contact pathway and its clinical diagnostic test, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay, the sources of procofactor activation are unknown. In the APTT assay, FXII is activated on a negatively charged surface and proceeds to activate FXI, which activates FIX upon the addition of Ca²⁺. FIXa feeds thrombin generation through activation of FX. FIXa is an extremely poor catalyst in the absence of its FVIIIa cofactor, which, in the intrinsic FXase complex, increases FXa generation by approximately 10⁷. One potential APTT procofactor activator in this setting is FXIa.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that FXIa can activate FVIII and FV.

Methods

Recombinant FVIII and plasma FV were treated with FXIa, and the activities and integrities of each procofactor were measured using commercial clotting assays and sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).

Results

Kinetic analyses of FXIa-catalyzed activation and inactivation of FV and FVIII are reported, and the the timing and sites of cleavage are defined.

Conclusions

FXIa activates both procofactors at plasma protein concentrations, and computational modeling suggests that procofactor activation during the preincubation phase of the APTT assay is critical to the performance of the assay. As the APTT assay is the primary tool for the diagnosis and management of hemophilias A and B, as well as in the determination of FVIII inhibitors, these findings have potential implications in the clinical setting.

### Contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways are activated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 [^1175Z8LK]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The mechanism underlying coagulation activation and its contribution to adverse outcomes in severe SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) remain elusive. In this exploratory study, circulating levels of protease:serpin complexes indicative of contact and intrinsic pathway activation were observed to be elevated in patients with COVID-19. We demonstrated that levels of the various FXIa:serpin complexes and, to a lesser extent, PKa:C1 complexes were positively correlated with FIXa:AT level, suggesting that both FXIa and PKa might contribute to FIX activation in vivo. Furthermore, in agreement with previous reports, we observed that MVTF level was also elevated at baseline and also correlated with level of FIXa:AT, suggesting that the activation of FIX occurs via both the contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Whatever the mechanism of initial FIX activation, the resultant downstream thrombin generation may then activate FXI, thereby promoting further FIX activation.

### Engineered factor Xa variants retain procoagulant activity independent of direct factor Xa inhibitors [^111Mx5fu]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The human hemostatic system protects against thrombosis and bleeding by balancing pro- and anticoagulant stimuli through an intricate network of enzymatic reactions governed by (pro)enzymes, (pro)cofactors, and inhibitors, collectively known as the coagulation cascade. Blood coagulation factor X (FX) plays a pivotal role in this system as it, once activated and assembled into the prothrombinase complex, converts prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin is the key regulatory enzyme of the coagulation cascade and, among others, converts soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin strands, which serve to stabilize the platelet-based primary blood clot. The spatiotemporal assembly of the prothrombinase complex is tightly regulated and occurs exclusively on negatively charged membrane surfaces (of activated cells or platelets), where activated factor X (FXa) assembles with its cofactor activated factor V (FVa) in the presence of calcium ions. This process is initiated through the activation of FX by the extrinsic (tissue factor (TF)-factor VIIa (FVIIa)-mediated) or intrinsic (factor VIIIa (FVIIIa)-factor IXa (FIXa)-mediated) pathways of coagulation. Once activated, FXa also propagates coagulation by activating other factors, including plasma FV in a phospholipid-dependent manner. The interaction of FXa with its cofactor FVa is essential as it results in physiologically relevant catalytic rates of prothrombin activation.

### Thrombin and vascular development: a sticky subject [^112PJP73]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2003). Low credibility.

Formation of the vasculature is an essential step in embryogenesis. It was observed decades ago that the vasculature and the intravascular blood compartment, which uses the former as a means of transportation, develop in a close spatial and temporal relationship. In this review, we discuss the role of the blood coagulation system as a tool to coordinate angiogenesis. Several mouse models lacking coagulation factors result in impaired thrombin generation and display a phenotype of disturbed cardiovascular development. Similar phenotypes are observed in mouse models of impaired thrombin binding to its cellular receptor, protease-activated receptor-1, or of disrupted signaling via G proteins. Most interestingly, the available data provide evidence that thrombin signaling in vascular development cannot be explained by a model based only on the classic extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. Because angiogenesis in adults follows the same signaling patterns as angiogenesis in embryos, it is important to learn about these pathways, hoping that they may serve as therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.

### Interpretable machine learning models for predicting venous thromboembolism in the intensive care unit: an analysis based on data from 207 centers [^115tuevp]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings indicated that lower PTT, PT and INR were associated with an increased risk of VTE in critically ill patients. PTT was a blood test that characterizes blood coagulation and was related to the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. Several population-specific studies have also shown that low levels of PTT were associated with an increased risk of VTE. Lower PTT may be due to increased coagulation factor activity in the intrinsic or common pathway or resistance to activated protein C, increasing the risk of thrombosis. PT was another coagulation test to assess tissue factors and common coagulation pathways. Lower levels of PT were associated with an increased risk of VTE, possibly due to increased activity of coagulation factors II, V, VII, X and fibrinogen. INR was a mathematical conversion form of PT and was related to VTE similarly to PT.

Key Points

Contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation are both activated in COVID-19 and likely contribute to FIX activation in vivo.
FIXa:AT complex level may be an adverse prognostic biomarker.

Contact and intrinsic pathway activation

Circulating levels of protease:serpin complexes in patients and controls at baseline are shown in Figure 1. The levels of all complexes in the contact and intrinsic pathways, with the exception of FXIa:AT, were significantly elevated in patients with COVID-19 compared with healthy individuals. These results are indicative of systemic activation of the contact and intrinsic pathways. FIXa:AT level correlated with other protease:serpin complexes in the contact pathway, particularly FXIIa:C1 (Spearman correlation coefficient [r s] = 0.54; P < .001) and FXIa:C1 (r s = 0.41; p = 0.001), supporting the hypothesis that activation of the contact pathway contributes at least in part to the downstream activation of FIX (Figure 2). Of note, no differences were observed in FIXa:AT level between patients allocated to any of the 3 treatment arms, either on admission or at the end of treatment with study drug (day +4; supplemental Figure 1). These data support the fact that the experimental treatment arms had no influence on FIXa:AT level. Lastly, we noted that 14 of the 30 enrolled patients received a single prophylactic 40-mg dose of enoxaparin before baseline laboratory results were obtained. However, neither the serine protease:serpin levels nor any of the other biomarkers demonstrated any trends when comparing those who did vs those did not receive enoxaparin (data not shown).

Mean ± standard deviation or median (horizontal bars) depicted for Gaussian and non-Gaussian data, respectively; similarly, P values are from t or Mann-Whitney test according to data distribution (n = 28–30 per group). Notably, because the standard curve typically spans 4 logs for FXIa:α1-antitrypsin complex, many patient samples exceeded the upper limit of detection. Samples from 2 patients were not processed because of critical preanalytic issues (low volume).

### Thrombin formation via the intrinsic coagulation pathway and von Willebrand factor reflect disease severity in COVID-19 [^111cJeQX]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been characterized by hyperinflammation, vascular damage, and thrombosis. Hyperinflammation causes a vasculopathy, particularly in the lungs. Von Willebrand factor (vWF), a marker of the vasculopathy, indeed, is associated with mortality. Vascular damage triggers activation of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation via exposure of tissue factor (TF). Moreover, activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation on the background of neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation appears to be key for COVID-19's hypercoagulability to occur. Yet, the relative contribution of the extrinsic pathway has not been studied in relation to the intrinsic pathway in COVID-19's hypercoagulability and thus, firm conclusions cannot be drawn. Here, we assessed markers of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway in a large and well-defined prospective cohort of patients with COVID-19. The dynamics of coagulation were studied during the first wave of the pandemic using a longitudinal design. Also, associations between activation markers of coagulation, vascular damage, and disease severity (i.e. intensive-care unit [ICU] admission, thrombosis, and mortality) were studied.

### Annexin A4 inhibits sulfatide-induced activation of coagulation factor XII [^116ZBPcW]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Factor XII (FXII) is a plasma serine protease that initiates the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation upon contact with anionic substances, such as the sulfated glycolipid sulfatide. Annexins (ANXs) have been implicated in the regulation of the blood coagulation reaction by binding to anionic surfaces composed of phospholipids and sulfated glycoconjugates, but their physiological importance is only partially understood.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that ANXs are involved in suppressing the intrinsic pathway initiated by sulfatide, we examined the effect of eight recombinant ANX proteins on the intrinsic coagulation reaction and their sulfatide binding activities.

Methods

Recombinant ANXs were prepared in Escherichia coli expression systems and their anticoagulant effects on the intrinsic pathway initiated by sulfatide were examined using plasma clotting assay and chromogenic assay. ANXA4 active sites were identified by alanine scanning and fold deletion in the core domain.

Results and Conclusions

We found that ANXA3, ANXA4, and ANXA5 strongly inhibited sulfatide-induced plasma coagulation. Wild-type and mutated ANXA4 were used to clarify the molecular mechanism involved in inhibition. ANXA4 inhibited sulfatide-induced auto-activation of FXII to FXIIa and the conversion of its natural substrate FXI to FXIa but showed no effect on the protease activity of FXIIa or FXIa. Alanine scanning showed that substitution of the Ca ²⁺ -binding amino acid residue in the fourth fold of the core domain of ANXA4 reduced anticoagulant activity, and deletion of the entire fourth fold of the core domain resulted in complete loss of anticoagulant activity.

### Regulation of coagulation by tissue factor pathway inhibitor: implications for hemophilia therapy [^112x16fb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

3 TFPI INHIBITS COAGULATION THROUGH DISTINCT BIOCHEMICAL MECHANISMS

TFPI inhibits coagulation proteases at several steps of the blood coagulation cascade (Figure 2). The direct binding of K2 to the FXa active site provides the foundation for its anticoagulant activities, the inhibition of TF‐FVIIa performed by TFPIα and β, and the inhibition of early forms of prothrombinase performed by only TFPIα. These catalytic complexes assemble early in a procoagulant response, and their inhibition is unique to TFPI because they are relatively resistant to inhibition by other anticoagulant proteins, such as antithrombin, and activated protein C. The inability to overcome TFPI inhibitory activity through generation of additional FXa via the FVIIIa‐FIXa catalytic complex reduces thrombin generation and results in the bleeding experienced by hemophilia patients. This provides the mechanistic basis for inhibition of TFPI as a treatment for hemophilia bleeding.

FIGURE 2
Presence of TFPI isoforms result in the inhibition of the TF‐FVIIa‐FXa ternary complex. (A) The TF‐FVIIa complex activates FIX (part of the intrinsic coagulation pathway) and FX (part of the common coagulation pathway). This results in plasma membrane association of FXa and FVa, forming the prothrombinase complex, and subsequent cleavage of prothrombin to thrombin. (B) The K2 domain of TFPIα binds to FXa, which supports inhibition of the TF‐FVIIa complex. The binding of the K3 domain to PS supports membrane association of TFPIα and thus further promotes inhibition of the TF‐FVIIa complex. The basic C‐terminus of TFPIα can also interact with FVa, resulting in inhibition of the early prothrombinase complex. (C) TFPIβ localizes to the cell surface via its GPI anchor, increasing its ability to inhibit FXa. a, active; C, carboxy; F, factor; GPI, glycophosphatidylinositol; K, Kunitz; N, amino; TF, tissue factor; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor

### The intrinsic pathway of coagulation: a target for treating thromboembolic disease? [^115HWnYY]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

The classic intrinsic pathway of coagulation is triggered by contact activation of the plasma protease factor (F)XII, followed by sequential proteolytic activation of FX1 and FIX. While a key mechanism for initiating coagulation in some clinically useful in vitro assays, the absence of abnormal bleeding associated with congenital FXII deficiency indicates that the intrinsic pathway is not important for normal blood coagulation in vivo. However, recent work with mice lacking FXII or FXI suggest that these proteases make important contributions to formation of pathologic intravascular thrombi. In models of arterial injury, FXII or FXI null mice are protected from formation of platelet rich occlusive thrombi to a degree similar to that seen in FIX deficient mice (a model for the severe bleeding disorder hemophilia B) or to wild type mice treated with high dose heparin. FXII or FXI deficiency does not appear to prevent the initiation of thrombus formation in these models, but instead causes significant thrombus instability that prevents occlusion of the vessel. These findings raise the possibility that a pathway similar or identical to the intrinsic pathway may operate in vivo under some circumstances. Furthermore, the disproportionate importance of FXII and FXI to occlusive thrombus formation compared to normal hemostasis makes these proteases attractive candidates for therapeutic inhibitors to treat or prevent thromboembolic disorders.

### Treatment of cancer-associated thrombosis: recent advances, unmet needs, and future direction [^111MANqh]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Next-Generation Anticoagulants

Factor XI (FXI) inhibitors have the potential to be safer than DOACs. FXI is a key component of the intrinsic coagulation pathway (Fig. 2). Intrinsic pathway plays an important role in cancer-associated hypercoagulability, as shown by a recent study that extracellular vesicles from various cancer cell lines can activate FXII and initiate the intrinsic pathway.FXI can be activated by FXIIa or by thrombin. Thrombosis is triggered by tissue factor, which induces the generation of small amounts of thrombin. Feedback activation of FXI amplifies thrombin generation, which drives thrombus expansion and stabilization. Therefore, FXI is thought to be essential for thrombosis.

Figure 2.
The role of factor XI (FXI)in the coagulation cascade in physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. Thrombosis: Thrombus growth depends on activation of FXI to amplify the process (the color-highlighted pathways are the predominant pathways here, including intrinsic and common pathways, while the non-dominant pathways are grayed-out). Thrombin and FXIIa are important activator of FXI. Hemostasis: FVII or FVIIa binds to extravascular TF leading to explosive thrombin generation to convert fibrinogen to fibrin (the color-highlighted pathways are extrinsic and common pathways and are the predominant pathways here, while the non-dominant pathways are grayed-out). While FXI is also activated by thrombin generated early in hemostasis and contributes to sustained thrombin generation, the intrinsic pathway is not predominantly needed, explaining why FXI is not as crucial in hemostasis.

### Blocking of platelets or intrinsic coagulation pathway-driven thrombosis does not prevent cerebral infarctions induced by photothrombosis [^114kzjeS]. Stroke (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Models of photochemically-induced thrombosis are widely used in cerebrovascular research. Photothrombotic brain infarctions can be induced by systemic application of photosensitizing dyes followed by focal illumination of the cerebral cortex. Although the ensuing activation of platelets is well established, their contribution for thrombosis and tissue damage has not formally been proved.

Methods

Infarction to the cerebral cortex was induced in mice by Rose Bengal and a cold light source. To assess the functional role of platelets, animals were platelet-depleted by anti-GPIbalpha antibodies or treated with GPIIb/IIIa-blocking F(ab)(2) fragments. The significance of the plasmatic coagulation cascade was determined by using blood coagulation factor XII (FXII)-deficient mice or heparin. Infarct development and infarct volumes were determined by serial MRI and conventional and electron microscopy.

Results

There was no difference in development and final size of photothrombotic infarctions in mice with impaired platelet function. Moreover, deficiency of FXII, which initiates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and is essential for thrombus formation, or blockade of FXa, the key protease during the waterfall cascade of plasmatic coagulation, by heparin likewise did not affect lesion development.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that platelet activation, factor XII-driven thrombus formation, and plasmatic coagulation pathways downstream of FX are not a prerequisite for ensuing tissue damage in models of photothrombotic vessel injury indicating that other pathomechanisms are involved. We suggest that this widely used model does not depend on platelet- or plasmatic coagulation-derived thrombosis.

### Recent advances in haemostasis and thrombosis [^1129geY5]. Retina (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review recent advances in hemostasis and thrombosis.

Methods

A review of recent studies that have changed our understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis.

Results

The cascade model of coagulation divided coagulation into extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Factor VIIa/tissue factor complex of the extrinsic system is the major initiating event of hemostasis in vivo. The intrinsic pathway (the contact system) does not play a physiologic role in hemostasis. The cascade model has been replaced with a cell-based model with three overlapping phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation. Although Factors XI and XII of the intrinsic system are not involved in hemostasis, they may have a key role in abnormal hemostasis or thrombosis. The pathways of coagulation and inflammation are intertwined at numerous points. The procoagulant factors, VIIa, Xa, and thrombin can activate members of the protease-activated receptor family, which play an important role in coagulation, inflammation, and vascular hemostasis. Factor V plays a crucial role in both the procoagulant and anticoagulant systems.

Conclusion

New insights into hemostasis provide greater understanding of the causes of both venous and arterial thrombosis.

### Aptamer ARC19499 mediates a procoagulant hemostatic effect by inhibiting tissue factor pathway inhibitor [^117MjydZ]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Hemophilia A and B are caused by deficiencies in coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and factor IX, respectively, resulting in deficient blood coagulation via the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic coagulation pathway, mediated by factor VIIa and tissue factor (TF), remains intact but is negatively regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which inhibits both factor VIIa and its product, factor Xa. This inhibition limits clot initiation via the extrinsic pathway, whereas factor deficiency in hemophilia limits clot propagation via the intrinsic pathway. ARC19499 is an aptamer that inhibits TFPI, thereby enabling clot initiation and propagation via the extrinsic pathway. The core aptamer binds tightly and specifically to TFPI. ARC19499 blocks TFPI inhibition of both factor Xa and the TF/factor VIIa complex. ARC19499 corrects thrombin generation in hemophilia A and B plasma and restores clotting in FVIII-neutralized whole blood. In the present study, using a monkey model of hemophilia, FVIII neutralization resulted in prolonged clotting times as measured by thromboelastography and prolonged saphenous-vein bleeding times, which are consistent with FVIII deficiency. ARC19499 restored thromboelastography clotting times to baseline levels and corrected bleeding times. These results demonstrate that ARC19499 inhibition of TFPI may be an effective alternative to current treatments of bleeding associated with hemophilia.

### Bradykinin: inflammatory product of the coagulation system [^1165Nzhe]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

Factor XII as a Coagulation Factor

When blood comes into contact with negatively charged surfaces, FXII activates spontaneously. FXIIa subsequently activates FXI, thereby providing an alternative trigger for coagulation that is independent of TF — the intrinsic pathway. FXII does not take part in the positive feedback mechanism of thrombin. As a result of the discovery of this in vitro mechanism, FXII is generally regarded as a coagulation factor.

Mysteriously, FXII deficiency is a seemingly asymptomatic condition in both mice and human (Hageman's disease), as it is not associated with a bleeding tendency, unlike deficiencies of other coagulation factors. The same holds for the other components of the contact system cascade; their deficiency does not result in bleeding. This makes the relevance of FXII and the contact system for physiological hemostasis debatable. This logic raises a pertinent question: should FXII be regarded as a coagulation factor, as far as angioedema is concerned? It has been demonstrated that the bradykinin-producing contact system machinery can be fully activated in plasma without evidence of coagulation. This might be explained by the physical properties of FXII(a): in a sequence of cleavage events, FXIIa is progressively fragmented. The fragment that remains after multiple cleavages (βFXIIa or FXIIf) has lost its potential for coagulation while its bradykinin-forming potential remains intact.

### The extrinsic coagulation cascade and tissue factor pathway inhibitor in macrophages: a potential therapeutic opportunity for atherosclerotic thrombosis [^113k8G6D]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The coagulation protease cascade plays the central requisite role in initiation of arterial atherothrombosis. However, the relative participation of the extrinsic as compared to the intrinsic pathway is incompletely resolved. We have investigated in vivo the relative importance of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways to define which is more essential to atherothrombosis and therefore the preferable prophylactic therapeutic target. We further addressed which type of plaque associated macrophage population is associated with the thrombotic propensity of atherosclerotic plaques.

Methods

Both photochemical injury and ferric chloride vascular injury models demonstrated arterial thrombosis formation in ApoE deficient mice. We found that direct interference with the extrinsic pathway, but not the intrinsic pathway, markedly diminished the rate of thrombus formation and occlusion of atherosclerotic carotid arteries following experimental challenge. To explore which plaque macrophage subtype may participate in plaque thrombosis in regard to expression tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), bone marrow derived macrophages of both M and GM phenotypes expressed tissue factor (TF), but the level of TFPI was much greater in M- type macrophages, which exhibited diminished thrombogenic activity, compared to type GM-macrophages.

Results and Conclusions

Our works support the hypothesis that the TF-initiated and direct extrinsic pathway provides the more significant contribution to arterial plaque thrombogenesis. Activation of the TF driven extrinsic pathway can be influenced by differing colony-stimulating factor influenced macrophage TFPI-1 expression. These results advance our understanding of atherothrombosis and identify potential therapeutic targets associated with the extrinsic pathway and with macrophages populating arterial atherosclerotic plaques.

### Factor XII: a novel target for safe prevention of thrombosis and inflammation [^11244gH8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Plasma protein factor XII (FXII) activates the procoagulant and proinflammatory contact system that drives both the kallikrein-kinin system and the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. When zymogen FXII comes into contact with negatively charged surfaces, it auto-activates to the serine proteaseactivated FXII (FXIIa). Recently, various in vivo activators of FXII have been identified including heparin, misfolded protein aggregates, polyphosphate and nucleic acids. Murine models have established a central role of FXII in arterial and venous thrombosis. Despite its central function in thrombosis, deficiency in FXII does not impair haemostasis in animals and humans. In a preclinical cardiopulmonary bypass system in large animals, the FXIIa-blocking antibody 3F7 prevented thrombosis; however, in contrast to traditional anticoagulants, bleeding was not increased. In addition to its function in thrombosis, FXIIa initiates formation of the inflammatory mediator bradykinin. This mediator increases vascular leak, causes vasodilation, and induces chemotaxis with implications for septic, anaphylactic and allergic disease states. Therefore, targeting FXIIa appears to be a promising strategy for thromboprotection without associated bleeding risks but with anti-inflammatory properties.

### The dirty side of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation [^1154zcfx]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Whereas the extrinsic pathway of coagulation seals off bleeding at the cut tissue edges, it is proposed that the intrinsic pathway exploits the dirt from the skin surface to generate an outer coagulum of the oozing blood. Activated Factor XII (FXIIa) in this outer cap generates Factor XIa, which triggers clotting, and kallikrein that feeds back to form more FXIIa to promote the process. This dirty-wound hypothesis of coagulation function by the intrinsic pathway is supported by the use of dirt-based compounds in activated partial thromboplastin time assays as well as the evolutionary record where marine life that do not have skin-adherent dirt lack Factor XII, including marine mammals that have returned to sea life.

### Characterization of organ dysfunction and mortality in pediatric patients with trauma with acute traumatic coagulopathy [^1142NQ5a]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2020). Medium credibility.

It is unclear why this particular pattern is seen in the pediatric population. It may suggest that the extrinsic pathway as measured by INR is an important driver of organ dysfunction and mortality in pediatric ATC. Components of the coagulation system including Factors VII and X, which are important in the extrinsic pathway, do not develop fully until late childhood or early adolescence. This lack of reserve may impact both organ dysfunction and mortality whereas factors in the intrinsic pathway may be more robust. Complicating this further, though the incidence of ATC is similar in adult and pediatric populations, children are much less likely to bleed in the presence of this coagulopathy than their adult counterparts. Therefore, the differences in INR and PTT may be more reflective of global hemostatic and endothelial dysfunction. Taken together, there may be key biologic differences in the development of ATC between children and adults even though the end result of poor outcomes is similar and these biologic differences require further mechanistic investigation in future studies.

### Contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways are activated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 [^116tFtLM]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Components of the contact system (ie, factor XII [FXII] and FXI) have increasingly been recognized as key mediators in the prothrombotic states observed in multiple clinical contexts, such as sepsis and cancer, despite their lesser roles in hemostasis. Both FXIa and kallikrein (PKa) can activate FIX after contact activation, and the TF:FVIIa complex can also directly activate FIX. Similarly, FXI may be activated not only by FXIIa but also by thrombin. FXIa is irreversibly inactivated by several serpins, including C1 inhibitor, α1-antitrypsin, and (in the presence of heparin) antithrombin (AT), whereas PKa is primarily inactivated by C1. In turn, FIXa is primarily inactivated by AT, forming a stable covalent FIXa:AT complex. Meticulous sampling techniques and processing must be considered when evaluating plasma for these complexes, because the principal activator of the contact pathway, FXII, undergoes accelerated autoactivation upon contact with an anionic surface. Although growing interest in the contact pathway has raised the question of targeting its component proteins for the prevention of thrombotic complications, the laboratory characterization of these complexes as indices of coagulation activation continues to be challenging.

To address the mechanism of coagulation activation in individuals presenting with COVID-19, we used a recently described strategy to assess activation of the contact and intrinsic pathwaysand also measured MVTF levels as a biomarker of extrinsic pathway activation. In a preliminary secondary analysis, we then sought to determine the associations between levels of these biomarkers and adverse clinical outcomes in a well-characterized study cohort.

### Coagulation disorders and hemostasis in liver disease: pathophysiology and critical assessment of current management [^1154yUu3]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Normal coagulation has classically been conceptualized as a Y-shaped pathway, with distinct "intrinsic" and "extrinsic" components initiated by factor XII or factor VIIa/tissue factor, respectively, and converging in a "common" pathway at the level of the FXa/FVa (prothrombinase) complex. Until recently, the lack of an established alternative concept of hemostasis has meant that most physicians view the "cascade" as a model of physiology. This view has been reinforced by the fact that screening coagulation tests (APTT, prothrombin time — INR) are often used as though they are generally predictive of clinical bleeding. The shortcomings of this older model of normal coagulation are nowhere more apparent than in its clinical application to the complex coagulation disorders of acute and chronic liver disease. In this condition, the clotting cascade is heavily influenced by numerous currents and counter-currents resulting in a mixture of pro- and anticoagulant forces that are themselves further subject to change with altered physiological stress such as super-imposed infection or renal failure. This report represents a summary of a recent multidisciplinary symposium held in Charlottesville, VA. We present an overview of the coagulation system in liver disease with emphasis on the limitations of the current clinical paradigm and the need for a critical re-evaluation of the current tenets governing clinical practice. With the realization that there is often limited or conflicting data, we have attempted to represent diverse opinion and experience from the perspectives of both hepatology and hematology beginning with a brief update on the physiology of normal coagulation.

### Intrinsic coagulation pathway, history of headache, and risk of ischemic stroke [^1142Z3fX]. Stroke (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose- Hypercoagulable states in migraine patients may play a role in the pathophysiology underlying the association between migraine and ischemic stroke. This study aims to provide more insight into the potential association of headache, ischemic stroke, and the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Methods- We included patients from the RATIO study (Risk of Arterial Thrombosis in Relation to Oral Contraceptives), a Dutch population-based case-control study including young women (age < 50) with ischemic stroke and healthy controls. We defined a headache group based on a questionnaire on headache history. Intrinsic coagulation proteins were measured through both antigen levels (FXII, FXI, prekallikrein, HK [high molecular weight kininogen]) and protein activation, determined by measuring activated protein complex with C1esterase-inhibitor (FXIIa-C1-INH, FXIa-C1-INH, Kallikrein-C1-INH) or antitrypsin-inhibitor (FXIa-AT-INH). We calculated adjusted odds ratios and performed an interaction analysis assessing the increase in stroke risk associated with high levels of intrinsic coagulation and history of headache. Results- We included 113 ischemic stroke cases and 598 healthy controls. In total, 134 (19%) patients had a history of headache, of whom 38 were cases and 96 controls. The combination of headache and high intrinsic coagulation protein levels (all but FXII antigen level and both FXIa-inhibitors) was associated with an increase in ischemic stroke risk higher than was expected based on their individual effects (adjusted odds ratio FXI antigen level alone: 1.7, 95% CI, 1.0–2.9; adjusted odds ratio headache alone: 2.0, 95% CI, 1.1–3.7; combination: 5.2, 95% CI, 2.3–11.6) Conclusions- Headache and high intrinsic coagulation protein levels may biologically interact, increasing risk for ischemic stroke.

### Sirtilins-the new old members of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor family [^111J6vi1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

The VK‐dependent proteases have highly specific functions in blood coagulation 1, 5, 6. This is shown by unique activation patterns and tightly regulated substrate specificities. Indeed, cofactors are crucial for the interaction between Gla–EGF1–EGF2–SP proteases and their substrates. The complex of activated FVII (FVIIa) and tissue factor (TF) initiates the TF pathway (also called the extrinsic pathway), cleaving and thus activating FX to form activated FX (FXa). FXa, together with its activated cofactor activated FV (FVa), forms the prothrombinase complex, converting prothrombin (FII) to active thrombin (activated FII [FIIa]). The alternative contact activation pathway (also called the intrinsic pathway) leads to the proteolytic activation of FIX to activated FIX (FIXa). FIXa, together with its cofactor activated FVIII, is a highly efficient activator of FX. FX represents a junction point in the blood coagulation system, acting as a target molecule of a positive feedback loop driven by the intrinsic pathway 5. Thereby, the downstream effector thrombin activates FXI, whose active form (activated FXI [FXIa]), in turn, activates FIX and thus boosts FXa and finally thrombin accumulation. Thrombin further proteolytically activates both the procoagulatory cofactors FV and FVIII of FIXa and FXa, respectively, and the inhibitory PC. Activated PC, together with its cofactor protein S, inactivates the upstream cofactors by proteolytic cleavage, and thus triggers a regulatory negative feedback loop. The intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways converge in the activation of fibrinogen by thrombin 7. This results in accumulation and polymerization of fibrin at the site of vessel injury, the final step of hemostasis. Efficient fibrin formation in humans depends largely on the positive feedback loop triggered by FIX and FVIII. Indeed, dysfunction of FIX or FVIII causes the bleeding disorders hemophilia B and hemophilia A, respectively 8.

### Selective factor VIII activation by the tissue factor-factor VIIa-factor Xa complex [^115U4e5y]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Safe and effective antithrombotic therapy requires understanding of mechanisms that contribute to pathological thrombosis but have a lesser impact on hemostasis. We found that the extrinsic tissue factor (TF) coagulation initiation complex can selectively activate the antihemophilic cofactor, FVIII, triggering the hemostatic intrinsic coagulation pathway independently of thrombin feedback loops. In a mouse model with a relatively mild thrombogenic lesion, TF-dependent FVIII activation sets the threshold for thrombus formation through contact phase-generated FIXa. In vitro, FXa stably associated with TF-FVIIa activates FVIII, but not FV. Moreover, nascent FXa product of TF-FVIIa can transiently escape the slow kinetics of Kunitz-type inhibition by TF pathway inhibitor and preferentially activates FVIII over FV. Thus, TF synergistically primes FIXa-dependent thrombin generation independently of cofactor activation by thrombin. Accordingly, FVIIa mutants deficient in direct TF-dependent thrombin generation, but preserving FVIIIa generation by nascent FXa, can support intrinsic pathway coagulation. In ex vivo flowing blood, a TF-FVIIa mutant complex with impaired free FXa generation but activating both FVIII and FIX supports efficient FVIII-dependent thrombus formation. Thus, a previously unrecognized TF-initiated pathway directly yielding FVIIIa-FIXa intrinsic tenase complex may be prohemostatic before further coagulation amplification by thrombin-dependent feedback loops enhances the risk of thrombosis.

### Crosstalk of the plasma contact system with bacteria [^113QYeTM]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Activation of the plasma contact system triggers several cascade systems such as the kallikrein-kinin system, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, the classical complement cascade and the fibrinolytic system. Recent studies have shown a critical role of the contact system for arterial and venous thrombus formation and thromboembolic disease. In contrast, the function of the contact system for host-defense reactions and its physiological functions have remained enigmatic. Experimental animal studies and clinical data have linked the contact system to bacterial infections with implications for sepsis disease. The present review summarizes the role of the contact system and its activation for bacterial infections.

### Blood clotting and the pathogenesis of types I and II hereditary angioedema [^114gQg6u]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

The plasma contact system is the initiator of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and the main producer of the inflammatory peptide bradykinin. When plasma is exposed to a negatively charged surface the two enzymes factor XII (FXII) and plasma prekallikrein (PK) bind to the surface alongside the co-factor high molecular weight kininogen (HK), where PK is non-covalently bound to. Here, FXII and PK undergo a reciprocal activation feedback loop that leads to full contact system activity in a matter of seconds. Although naturally occurring negatively charged surfaces have shown to be involved in the role of the contact system in thrombosis, such surfaces are elusive in the pathogenesis of bradykinin-driven hereditary angioedema (HAE). In this review, we will explore the molecular mechanisms behind contact system activation, their assembly on the endothelial surface, and their role in the HAE pathophysiology.

### Comparative sequence analysis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors [^1133TEsk]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Blood coagulation is initiated either extrinsically through exposure of tissue factor at the site of injury and complex formation with factor (F) VIIaor intrinsically through contact activation where a cascade of proteolytic reactions (involving the proteases FXIIa, kallikrein and FXIa) results in FIX activation. Both pathways lead to FX activation and subsequent thrombin formation, which amplifies its own generation through activation of FV and FVIII. Once activated, FVIIIa associates with FIXa to increase formation of FXa, which in turn assembles with FVa on membrane surfaces to form the prothrombinase complex responsible for an explosive conversion of prothrombin into thrombin. Besides its procoagulant function that promotes fibrin clot formation, thrombin also performs an important anticoagulant function through activation of protein C (PC) in a reaction enhanced by thrombomodulin. Activated PC (APC) down‐regulates the coagulation response through inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa.

Protein C, FVII, FIX, and FX are vitamin K (VK)‐dependent coagulation factors whose multidomain architecture comprises an N‐terminal‐carboxyglutamic acid (Gla) domain that promotes membrane binding, two epidermal growth factor (EGF1 and EGF2) domains that serve as spacers and a serine protease domain that hosts the active site (Figure S1). Prothrombin also belongs to the family of VK‐dependent coagulation proteins, but its structure comprises a Gla, kringle 1, kringle 2, and serine protease domains (Figure S1). All VK‐dependent coagulation proteins circulate in plasma as inactive zymogens. Activation proceeds through proteolytic cleavage at a conserved site, creating a new N‐terminus at position 16 (chymotrypsin numbering) that ion pairs to the conserved D194 and organizes the active site architecture. Activation of PC, FVII, FIX, and FX proceeds with retention of the Gla and EGF domains, which remain connected to the protease domain through a disulfide linkage. In contrast, the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin proceeds with shedding of the Gla and kringle domains. The physiological importance of releasing these auxiliary domains is documented by the compromised procoagulant activity of meizothrombin, a thrombin precursor that retains the Gla and kringle domains.

### Tissue factor and tissue factor pathway inhibitor [^111a2Hqb]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

The classical 'cascade/waterfall' hypothesis formulated to explain in vitro coagulation organised the amplification processes into the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Recent molecular biology and clinical data indicate that tissue factor/factor-VII interaction is the primary cellular initiator of coagulation in vivo. The process of blood coagulation is divided into an initiation phase followed by a propagation phase. The discovery of tissue factor pathway inhibitor further supports the revised theory of coagulation. Tissue factor is also a signalling receptor. Recent evidence has shown that blood-borne tissue factor has an important procoagulant function in sepsis, atherosclerosis and cancer, and other functions beyond haemostasis such as immune function and metastases.

### Intrinsic pathway of coagulation and arterial thrombosis [^114YbbV3]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Formation of a fibrin clot is mediated by a group of tightly regulated plasma proteases and cofactors. While this system is essential for minimizing blood loss from an injured blood vessel (hemostasis), it also contributes to pathologic fibrin formation and platelet activation that may occlude vessels (thrombosis). Many antithrombotic drugs target key elements of the plasma coagulation mechanism such as thrombin and factor Xa, based on the premise that plasma elements contributing to thrombosis are primarily those involved in hemostasis. Recent studies with genetically altered mice raise questions about this paradigm. Deficiencies of the intrinsic pathway proteases factor XII and factor XI are not associated with abnormal hemostasis in mice, but impair formation of occlusive thrombi in arterial injury models, indicating that pathways not essential for hemostasis participate in arterial thrombosis. If factor XII or factor XI make similar contributions to thrombosis in humans, these proteases could be ideal targets for drugs to treat or prevent thromboembolic disease with minimal risk of therapy-associated bleeding.

HEMLIBRA affects intrinsic pathway clotting-based laboratory tests, including activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and all assays based on aPTT, such as one-stage factor VIII (FVIII) activity (Table 1). Therefore, intrinsic pathway clotting-based laboratory test results in patients treated with HEMLIBRA should not be used to monitor HEMLIBRA activity, determine dosing for factor replacement or anti-coagulation, or measure FVIII inhibitor titers [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

### The inflammatory response to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): a review of the pathophysiology [^114aQ4j8]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation

Contact system activation eventually leads to triggering of the intrinsic coagulation pathway. Factor XIIa, formed as a product of contact activation, activates factor XI to XIa. In the following step, factor XIa converts factor IX to IXa, which in turn activates factor X. This is the intrinsic coagulation pathway (Fig. 1). Conversion of factor X is the first common step in the coagulation cascade between the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway was traditionally felt to play a lesser role during extracorporeal circulation, due in part to the requirement for tissue injury and the subsequent exposure of tissue factor (TF), although TF may be present within extracorporeal circuits, in pro-inflammatory conditions, despite the absence of tissue injury. The ability of activated complement to induce the expression of TF by monocytes may be one way in which this effect is mediated. Alternatively, Szotowski et al. have described the ability of TNF-α and IL-6 to induce the endothelial cell expression of soluble TF.

By whichever means the common pathway is arrived at, activated factor X (FXa) converts prothrombin to thrombin, which then cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin, resulting in subsequent clot formation. In addition to its role in coagulation, thrombin plays a major part in inflammation. It is known to increase the expression of P-selectin and E-selectin by endothelial cells, increasing neutrophil adherence and activation. Thrombin also induces endothelial cells to produce platelet activating factor (PAF), another potent activator of neutrophils, and directly influences neutrophils to express pro-inflammatory cytokines. Attempts have been made to limit thrombin generation during extracorporeal circulation using biocompatible circuitry. Several coating materials are utilised in commercially available ECMO circuits, most commonly heparin and heparin-like compounds. Studies have demonstrated reduced levels of thrombin when heparin-bonded minimal extracorporeal circulation systems (MECC) are used, and these are functionally similar to ECMO.

### Structure-function of anticoagulant TIX-5, the inhibitor of factor Xa-mediated FV activation [^117FEM5K]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The blood coagulation cascade is characterized by a series of enzymatic reactions that result in the thrombin‐dependent conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin fibers. The fibrin fibers are pivotal to stabilizing the initial hemostatic platelet plug formed in a blood vessel lesion that prevents bleeding, but also underlies thrombus formation and potential subsequent ischemia associated with a myriad of pathophysiological processes. Thrombin generation proceeds by the successive activation of various coagulation factors, either by the tissue factor (TF)‐dependent extrinsic, or factor XII (FXII)‐dependent intrinsic pathway. Both pathways culminate in the generation of activated factor X (FXa), with the latter being capable of proteolytic activation of the zymogen prothrombin (FII) into the serine protease thrombin (FIIa). Because FXa is an inefficient enzyme by itself, interaction with its cofactor activated factor V (FVa) on a negatively charged phospholipid layer in the presence of calcium ions to form the prothrombinase complexallows for the efficient and physiologically relevant conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The cofactor FVa is generated following cleavage at Arg708, Arg1018, and Arg1545 to remove the central B‐domain that separates the heavy (a.a. 1–708) and light (a.a. 1546–2145) chains of the procofactor FV. Structurally, the central B‐domain appears to cover the FXa binding site of FV by cooperation of acidic (a.a. 1493–1537) and basic (a.a. 963–1008) autoinhibitory sequences guarding the procofactor state of FV. Although both FXa and thrombin are known to be capable of activating purified FV, trace amounts of thrombin formed by FXa alone during the initiation of coagulation have long been recognized as the primary activator of FV. However, we recently challenged this paradigm and demonstrated that FXa‐dependent activation of FV is a crucial event in the initiation of blood coagulation.

### Regulation of coagulation by tissue factor pathway inhibitor: implications for hemophilia therapy [^116d9945]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is an alternatively spliced anticoagulant protein present in plasma, platelets, and extracellular matrix, as well as on the surface of endothelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages. It is a multifunctional Kunitz‐type serine protease inhibitor that acts at several steps of the blood coagulation cascade.TFPI primarily inhibits initiation of coagulation, dampening procoagulant stimuli before thrombin is generated. As such, it is an important regulator of bleeding in hemophilia, and antibodies that block TFPI activity are under development for hemophilia treatment. In phase 2 clinical studies, an anti‐TFPI antibody prevented bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A and B, with or without inhibitors. As an inhibitor of blood coagulation, TFPI also alters cellular trafficking and signaling pathways driven by coagulation proteases of the TF pathway. Here, we review the biochemistry and physiology underpinning the effects of TFPI in blood coagulation and cellular signaling pathways, and how these may be altered by anti‐TFPI therapeutic strategies.

### Contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways are activated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 [^115khErS]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Coagulation activation is a prominent feature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) infection. Activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway has increasingly been implicated in the prothrombotic state observed in both sterile and infectious inflammatory conditions. We therefore sought to assess activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway in individuals with COVID-19 infection. Baseline plasma levels of protease:serpin complexes indicative of activation of the contact and intrinsic pathways were measured in samples from inpatients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals. Cleaved kininogen, a surrogate for bradykinin release, was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and extrinsic pathway activation was assessed by microvesicle tissue factor-mediated factor Xa (FXa; MVTF) generation. Samples were collected within 24 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty patients with COVID-19 and 30 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Contact system and intrinsic pathway activation in COVID-19 was demonstrated by increased plasma levels of FXIIa:C1 esterase inhibitor (C1), kallikrein:C1, FXIa:C1, FXIa:α1-antitrypsin, and FIXa:antithrombin (AT). MVTF levels were also increased in patients with COVID-19. Because FIXa:AT levels were associated with both contact/intrinsic pathway complexes and MVTF, activation of FIX likely occurs through both contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Among the protease:serpin complexes measured, FIXa:AT complexes were uniquely associated with clinical indices of disease severity, specifically total length of hospitalization, length of intensive care unit stay, and extent of lung computed tomography changes. We conclude that the contact/intrinsic pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of the prothrombotic state in COVID-19. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm whether FIXa:AT complexes are a clinically useful biomarker of adverse clinical outcomes.

### Coagulation testing in the core laboratory [^111qdRAH]. Laboratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Primary hemostasis begins with endothelial injury. VWF, produced by endothelial cells, binds to platelets and links them to subendothelial collagen. Platelet-derived ADP and thromboxane activate non-adhered platelets via their GPIIb/IIIa receptors, allowing these platelets to participate in platelet aggregation. Secondary hemostasis is initiated with the binding of factor VII to extravascular tissue factor (TF). Factors II, VII, IX and X are vitamin K-dependent factors. The role of vitamin K is to assist in the addition of gamma carboxylate groups to glutamic acids in the "GLA" domains of these factors. In vitro the intrinsic pathway is initiated when fresh whole blood is placed in a glass tube. The negative charge of the glass initiates the "contact pathway" where FXII is activated and then FXIa cleaves FIX to FIXa. The extrinsic pathway is triggered when tissue factor, phospholipid and calcium are added to plasma anticoagulated with citrate. In vitro, FVII is activated to FVIIa, and TF-FVIIa preferentially converts FX to FXa activating the common pathway. The prothrombin time is commonly used to monitor warfarin anticoagulant therapy. To correct for differences in reagent and instrument, the international normalized ratio was developed to improve standardization of PT reporting globally. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is used to evaluate the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. The aPTT is useful clinically as a screening test for inherited and acquired factor deficiencies as well as to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy although the anti-Xa assay is now the preferred measure of the effects of unfractionated heparin. The Clauss assay is the most commonly performed fibrinogen assay and uses diluted plasma where clotting is initiated with a high concentration of reagent thrombin. The mixing study assists in the assessment of an abnormally prolonged PT or aPTT. An equal volume of citrated patient plasma is mixed with normal pooled plasma and the PT or aPTT are repeated on the 1:1 mix. Factor activity assays are most commonly performed as a one-stage assay. The patient's citrated plasma is diluted and mixed 1-to-1 with a single factor-deficient substrate plasma. A PT or aPTT is performed on the above mix, depending on the factor being tested. Factor inhibitors are antibodies that are most commonly diagnosed in male patients with severe hemophilia A (FVIII deficiency) where they are induced by factor replacement therapy. Factor inhibitors can also appear in the form of spontaneous autoantibodies in both male and female individuals who were previously well. This is an autoimmune condition called "acquired hemophilia". Most coagulation laboratories can measure the plasma concentration of VWF protein (VWF antigen) by an immunoturbidimetric technique. Testing the functional activity of VWF, utilizes the drug ristocetin. The state of multimerization of VWF is important and is assessed by electrophoresis on agarose gels. Type 2a and 2b VWD are associated with the lack of intermediate- and high molecular weight multimers. The antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS) is an acquired autoimmune phenomenon associated with an increased incidence of both venous and arterial thromboses, as well as fetal loss. Typically, there is a paradoxical prolongation of the aPTT in the absence of any clinical features of bleeding. This is the so-called "lupus anticoagulant (LA) effect". The laboratory definition of the APLS requires the presence of either a "lupus anticoagulant" or a persistent titer of antiphospholipid antibodies. There are now 2 broad classes of direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs): [1] The oral direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) such as dabigatran; and [2] The oral direct factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and apixaban. The PT and aPTT are variably affected by the DOACs and are generally unhelpful in monitoring their concentrations. Most importantly, a normal PT or aPTT does NOT exclude the presence of any of the DOACs.

### An analysis of the sensitivity of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) assay, as used in a large laboratory network, to coagulation factor deficiencies [^1169jYig]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To advance knowledge in using the ex vivo method to identify factor sensitivity of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), using data from a hemophilia and reference hemostasis laboratory; to evaluate application of inclusion and exclusion criteria to eliminate data outliers; and to discuss outcomes with reference to comparable studies.

Methods

An ex vivo, retrospective analysis was performed on patient samples with conjointly ordered APTT and intrinsic pathway factors (VIII, IX, XI, XII) for application to a large network of laboratories. The relationship between factor levels and APTT, before and after application of exclusion criteria, is demonstrated.

Results

Curvilinear relationships were found between all factor levels and APTTs, which demonstrated both similarities and differences with available studies. Factor sensitivity data are presented. Study strengths include large sample size and use of real-world data. Limitations include inability to exclude all residual outliers and paucity of patient samples singularly deficient in factors other than FVIII.

Conclusions

This ex vivo, retrospective analysis of the sensitivity of the APTT assay to intrinsic pathway factor deficiencies using real-world data from a hemophilia and reference hemostasis laboratory contains the largest sample size using this approach to date. The outcomes assist in informing practice in this area and can be used as a reference for further studies.

### Coagulation pathways in atherothrombosis [^112Cs8q3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Atherosclerosis is a disease recognized as the main cause of death in industrial countries. The current paradigm establishes thrombosis to be the major reason for complications of atherosclerosis, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and the major factor responsible for atherosclerosis-related mortality. Development of adequate treatment of patients with risk of atherothrombosis requires the comprehensive understanding of mechanisms underlying coagulation processes at the site of atherosclerotic lesion. The present review discusses contribution of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of blood coagulation in thrombogenicity of atherosclerotic plaque and factors determining the overall procoagulant/anticoagulant balance.

### Inhibiting the intrinsic pathway of coagulation with a factor XII-targeting RNA aptamer [^117DsVV8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Exposure of the plasma protein factor XII (FXII) to an anionic surface generates activated FXII that not only triggers the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation through the activation of FXI but also mediates various vascular responses through activation of the plasma contact system. While deficiencies of FXII are not associated with excessive bleeding, thrombosis models in factor-deficient animals have suggested that this protein contributes to stable thrombus formation. Therefore, FXII has emerged as an attractive therapeutic target to treat or prevent pathological thrombosis formation without increasing the risk for hemorrhage.

Objectives

Using an in vitro directed evolution and chemical biology approach, we sought to isolate a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer that binds specifically to FXII and directly inhibits FXII coagulant function.

Methods and Results

We describe the isolation and characterization of a high-affinity RNA aptamer targeting FXII/activated FXII (FXIIa) that dose dependently prolongs fibrin clot formation and thrombin generation in clinical coagulation assays. This aptamer functions as a potent anticoagulant by inhibiting the autoactivation of FXII, as well as inhibiting intrinsic pathway activation (FXI activation). However, the aptamer does not affect the FXIIa-mediated activation of the proinflammatory kallikrein-kinin system (plasma kallikrein activation).

Conclusions

We have generated a specific and potent FXII/FXIIa aptamer anticoagulant that offers targeted inhibition of discrete macromolecular interactions involved in the activation of the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation.

### Contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways are activated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 [^113dvabo]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The critical role of coagulation pathways in the pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19) is supported by a growing number of studies demonstrating alterations of several biomarkers of coagulation activation, some of which have been associated with disease severity, elevated risk of venous thromboembolism, and/or presence of pulmonary microvascular thrombi. Activation of coagulation in the context of infectious disease has long been recognized as an integral part of the host response to pathogensand involves a complex interplay of immune cells, coagulation factors, and other bioactive compounds, which has recently been termed immunothrombosis. In the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, D-dimer was identified as a biomarker correlating with disease severity. However, plasma D-dimer generation is dependent upon both the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, and as such, it does not address the mechanism of coagulopathy in COVID-19. Tissue factor (TF) is a principal trigger of immunothrombosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and plasma microvesicle-associated TF (MVTF) activity has been demonstrated to correlate with mortality in respiratory viral infections. Recently, the association of MVTF with COVID-19 severitywas reported, suggesting a role for extrinsic activation in this disease. However, because of the lack of an international TF standard, standardization of this assay has not been possible. In addition, the assay operates at the limits of sensitivity, with undetectable levels in many healthy individuals. For these reasons, its use has been limited to research laboratories.

### Achieving higher efficacy without compromising safety with factor XI inhibitors versus low molecular weight heparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in major orthopedic surgery-systematic review and meta-analysis [^113JnvQ9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

On further subgroup evaluation comparing FXI inhibitors to LMWH, despite showing a lower absolute rate of necessity of blood transfusion the difference did not meet statistical significance. This result and heterogeneity present are probably justified by the low number of events and studies included in this analysis. Moreover, the incidence of adverse events and major adverse events did not differ between groups, with both analyses showing non‐significant heterogeneity. All in all, no sign of harm associated with the use of FXI inhibitors was raised by this meta‐analysis.

The results of FXI inhibitors compared to LMWH in patients undergoing total knee replacement challenge the paradigm of anticoagulant therapy. Higher efficacy in the reduction of thrombotic events is typically obtained at the expense of increased risk of bleeding. This paradigm has even been compared to navigating between Scylla and Charybdis from Greek mythology, a metaphor for thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks using anticoagulant therapy. This model results from conventional anticoagulant therapy that blocks the common pathway represented by factors X and II. All anticoagulants available in clinical practice, administered orally or parenterally, act in the common pathway of the coagulation cascade. This pharmacodynamic effect ensures the inhibition of fibrin generation, essential for the formation of venous, arterial, or intracardiac pathological thrombus, but blocks hemostasis in cases of vascular injury associated with hemorrhage. The initiation of hemostasis is mainly driven by the extrinsic pathway with the exposure of subendothelial TF and activation of circulating factor VII that triggers the common pathway (Figure 1). Thrombin (factor IIa) can activate the intrinsic pathway through FXI to amplify the common pathway in cases of insufficient hemostasis. This role of the intrinsic pathway in hemostasis is described by some authors as minor, but of paramount importance in joints and skeletal muscle that express low levels of TF. On the other hand, animal studies of gene‐specific knockout of coagulation factors denote that the intrinsic pathway plays a major role in thrombosis. Mice deficient for factor XII, the initiating link of the intrinsic pathway, and FXI demonstrated reduced thrombus formation in thrombosis models. Epidemiological evidence also supports the crucial role of the intrinsic pathway in thrombosis. Indeed, patients with congenital FXI deficiency have a reduced risk of VTE, and elevated plasma FXI levels are associated with an increased risk of VTE. In this context, inhibition of the intrinsic pathway through reduced FXI activity can decrease the risk of thrombosis without compromising hemostasis through maintenance of the extrinsic pathway.

### Factor XI deficiency in animal models [^113a99jR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The blood coagulation system forms fibrin to limit blood loss from sites of injury, but also contributes to occlusive diseases such as deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In the current model of a coagulation balance, normal hemostasis and thrombosis represent two sides of the same coin; however, data from coagulation factor XI-deficient animal models have challenged this dogma. Gene targeting of factor XI, a serine protease of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, severely impairs arterial thrombus formation but is not associated with excessive bleeding. Mechanistically, factor XI may be activated by factor XII following contact activation or by thrombin in a feedback activation loop. This review focuses on the role of factor XI, and its deficiency states as novel target for prevention of thrombosis with low bleeding risk in animal models.

### Role of the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation in hemostasis and thrombosis [^112ifyXv]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2007). Low credibility.

Hemostasis requires both platelets and the coagulation system. At sites of vessel injury, bleeding is minimized by the formation of a hemostatic plug consisting of platelets and fibrin. The traditional view of the regulation of blood coagulation is that the initiation phase is triggered by the extrinsic pathway, whereas amplification requires the intrinsic pathway. The extrinsic pathway consists of the transmembrane receptor tissue factor (TF) and plasma factor VII/VIIa (FVII/FVIIa), and the intrinsic pathway consists of plasma FXI, FIX, and FVIII. Under physiological conditions, TF is constitutively expressed by adventitial cells surrounding blood vessels and initiates clotting. In addition so-called blood-borne TF in the form of cell-derived microparticles (MPs) and TF expression within platelets suggests that TF may play a role in the amplification phase of the coagulation cascade. Under pathologic conditions, TF is expressed by monocytes, neutrophils, endothelial cells, and platelets, which results in an elevation of the levels of circulating TF-positive MPs. TF expression within the vasculature likely contributes to thrombosis in a variety of diseases. Understanding how the extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation contributes to hemostasis and thrombosis may lead to the development of safe and effective hemostatic agents and antithrombotic drugs.

### Dysregulation of complement and coagulation pathways: emerging mechanisms in the development of psychosis [^112B8ip2]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Complement and coagulation pathway activation

Complement and coagulation proteins commonly circulate in plasma as zymogens or procofactors that must be converted into active enzymes or cofactors via limited proteolysis through pathway-specific activation mechanisms. Complement activation relies on recognition of localized molecular patterns, which triggers proteolysis, while regulatory components support clearance of inflammatory mediators after elimination of the trigger. Once triggered, a powerful cascade-like activation of proteins result in: opsonization (C3b, iC3b (AP); C4b (CP, LP)) of pathogens or cells marked for phagocytic clearance; generation of signaling molecules promoting chemotaxis of leukocytes (C5a); and direct cell lysis and killing (C5b-9). In addition to pathogen killing, complement activation also promotes clearance of immune complexes, or apoptotic cells, and acts as an interface between innate and adaptive immunity. The coagulation TF pathway requires exposure of TF with plasma, while the intrinsic (FXII-mediated) pathway is triggered by contact with anionic surfaces, both converging at thrombin-mediated fibrin clot formation. Coagulation is linked to innate immunity as it also contributes to host–pathogen defenses by limiting pathogen dissemination and supporting pathogen killing. Dysregulation of the complement and coagulation systems is caused by continuous activation of either proteolytic pathway (e.g. through unresolved, prolonged infection) or inadequate regulation (e.g. as a result of inherited or acquired deficiencies). This may lead directly to pathology or contribute to infection-related complications such as thrombosis. Pathway-specific dysregulation leads to different phenotypes seen in several diseases, which further vary with genetic or nongenetic risk factors predisposing to disease.

### The intrinsic coagulation pathway plays a dominant role in driving hypercoagulability in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^116cm4mT]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective study, we uniquely characterized hypercoagulability in detail in a well-characterized cohort of patients with AAV. We observed that activated coagulation markers of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways are elevated in patients with active disease. These elevated levels persisted in a subgroup of patients after 6 months of follow-up. T:AT formation and increased D-dimers were predominantly associated with activation of the intrinsic pathway at the time of active AAV and linked to disease activity and inflammation.

Patients with AAV are at an increased risk of developing VTE because of a hypercoagulable state, especially during active disease. This is indicated by elevated levels of D-dimers and fibrinogen, as well as by increased levels of activated coagulation factors with their natural inhibitors in our study. Our findings extend previous studies that reported elevated D-dimers and fibrinolysis in patients with active AAV. After achieving remission, not all patients showed an improvement in their prothrombotic state as assessed by the levels of coagulation markers at 6 months. This is in line with findings of Hilhorst et al on sustained hypercoagulability in patients with AAV in remission, indicated by an increased endogenous thrombin potential, elevated factor VIII, and tissue factor (TF) pathway inhibitor levels. Ongoing low-grade inflammation and subsequent endothelial damage may contribute to hypercoagulability, although patients were assumed to be in remission as based on clinical and laboratory markers.

To understand the mechanism of hypercoagulability, we investigated the coagulation cascade. We primarily focused on the impact of the assessed coagulation markers on T:AT and D-dimers rather than studying the intricate in-between interactions of the coagulation markers because the interpretation of such associations can be challenging under pathological conditions. At the time of active disease, thrombin generation was associated with activation of the intrinsic rather than extrinsic pathway, as illustrated by increased levels of complexes involving FXIIa and FXIa. T:AT and D-dimers, indeed, were associated with coagulation markers of the intrinsic pathway. In contrast, FVIIa:AT, was found to be normal in the majority of patients with active disease, and its association with T:AT was limited. These findings point toward an important role of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in hypercoagulability in patients with active AAV.

### Sirtilins-the new old members of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor family [^111Vsrd2]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

A characteristic feature of T. sirtalis sirtilin is the enlarged activation peptide as compared with the other Gla–EGF1–EGF2–SP family members. Interestingly, it is readily cleaved at several sites by FXIa, resulting in the activation of the protease. The activation scheme of the coagulation proteases determines the exact sequence of the coagulation cascade, and thus is substantially connected to their function. Strikingly, FXIa is found only in mammals, so an alternative physiological activator of sirtilin has to come into play in lower vertebrates. Because it is found in many organisms lacking the intrinsic pathway, sirtilin might fulfil a function as an ancient intrinsic coagulation factor. The intrinsic pathway in higher mammals is initiated by autoactivation of FXII 42. This process is triggered by platelet‐derived polyphosphates in vivo and by negatively charged surfaces in vitro. Although it is tempting to speculate about a similar autoactivation mechanism of sirtilin, this has not been observed so far.

In conclusion, a new member of the VK‐dependent proteases was identified, and a deeper understanding of the functions of sirtilin could provide novel insights into blood coagulation of vertebrates as well as into the evolution of coagulation factors.

### Coagulation factor XII in thrombosis and inflammation [^114Qam9f]. Blood (2018). Low credibility.

Combinations of proinflammatory and procoagulant reactions are the unifying principle for a variety of disorders affecting the cardiovascular system. The factor XII-driven contact system starts coagulation and inflammatory mechanisms via the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and the bradykinin-producing kallikrein-kinin system, respectively. The biochemistry of the contact system in vitro is well understood; however, its in vivo functions are just beginning to emerge. Challenging the concept of the coagulation balance, targeting factor XII or its activator polyphosphate, provides protection from thromboembolic diseases without interfering with hemostasis. This suggests that the polyphosphate/factor XII axis contributes to thrombus formation while being dispensable for hemostatic processes. In contrast to deficiency in factor XII providing safe thromboprotection, excessive FXII activity is associated with the life-threatening inflammatory disorder hereditary angioedema. The current review summarizes recent findings of the polyphosphate/factor XII-driven contact system at the intersection of procoagulant and proinflammatory disease states. Elucidating the contact system offers the exciting opportunity to develop strategies for safe interference with both thrombotic and inflammatory disorders.

### Increase of coagulation potential in chronic spontaneous urticaria [^112xS9r3]. Allergy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The pathogenesis of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CU) has recently been conceived to be associated with thrombin generation through the extrinsic coagulation pathway. However, little is known about the components of the intrinsic coagulation pathway potentially involved.

Methods

To investigate the whole process of coagulation, both classical coagulation assays and a global coagulation test, the intrinsic coagulation pathway-dependent activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) clot waveform analysis, were performed using plasma of 36 patients with CU who had various severities.

Results

Classical coagulation assays revealed that levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, and fibrin and fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and positive rates of soluble fibrin monomer complex (SFMC) were significantly elevated in patients with CU, whereas the elevation of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 was not statistically significant. On the other hand, all parameters of a global coagulation test, APTT clot waveform analysis, evidently showed a hypercoagulable pattern and were significantly correlated to disease severity of CU.

Conclusions

CU is characterized by elevated blood coagulation potential with involvement of the intrinsic coagulation factors, which may contribute in vivo to the generation of fibrin even by small amounts of thrombin.

### Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of abelacimab (MAA868), a novel dual inhibitor of factor XI and factor XIa [^112SvBML]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), bleeding remains a clinical concern. There remains an unmet medical need for novel anticoagulants with a superior safety profile over existing agents, in particular for patients at risk for thrombosis who may be undertreated or not treated at all because of an increased risk of bleeding due to advanced age, severe kidney disease, or other chronic medical conditions.

Targeting Factor XI (FXI), a blood coagulation factor that is part of the intrinsic pathway, may offer the potential for effective anticoagulation that spares hemostasis and thus carries a lower risk of bleeding. Existing anticoagulants, such as DOACs and warfarin, exert their effects by targeting components of the common coagulation pathway. These components, however, are also important for physiologic hemostasis. Consequently, these agents have all been associated with an increased risk of bleeding events, some of which can be severe and sometimes fatal.

There is a growing appreciation, however, that coagulation factors of the intrinsic pathway, such as FXI, play a non‐essential role in physiologic hemostasis even though they strongly contribute to pathologic thrombosissuggesting that the pathways involved in hemostasis and thrombosis are distinct and separable. The uncoupling of physiologic hemostasis from pathologic thrombosis is illustrated by individuals with severe FXI deficiency. Individuals with severe FXI deficiency appear to be protected from developing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and ischemic stroke compared to the general population. Spontaneous bleeding in FXI deficiency, however, has been reported to be uncommon and not clearly related to the FXI level. Bleeding in FXI deficient patients has been reported following injury or in association with surgery and more frequently at anatomic regions with increased fibrinolytic activity such as the nasopharynx or genitourinary system. Furthermore, population studies have shown that elevated levels of FXI are associated with an increased risk of VTE, stroke, and myocardial infarction, suggesting that FXI plays an important role in pathologic thrombosis.

### In vivo generation of thrombin in patients with liver disease without apparent evidence of activation of the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway of coagulation [^112PHSf1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with liver diseases are in a hypercoagulable state, as evidenced by enhanced in vitro thrombin generating capacity and elevated plasma levels of markers of in vivo thrombin generation. However, it is unknown by which mechanism in vivo activation of coagulation occurs.

Objectives

We aimed to clarify the mechanisms underlying enhanced in vivo thrombin generation to provide a rationale for targeted anticoagulant therapy.

Patients/Methods

Overall, 191 patients diagnosed with stable or acutely decompensated cirrhosis, acute liver failure or injury, acute-on-chronic liver failure, or sepsis without underlying chronic liver disease were recruited from King's College Hospital, London, from 2017 to 2021 and compared with reference values of 41 healthy controls. We measured levels of markers of in vivo activation of coagulation and activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, their respective zymogens, and natural anticoagulants.

Results

Thrombin-antithrombin complexes, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), and D-dimer levels were increased in acute and chronic liver disease, proportional to disease severity. Plasma levels of free activated factor XII (FXIIa), C1-esterase-inhibitor (C1inh)-FXIIa, C1inh-factor XI, C1inh-plasma kallikrein, factor-VIIa-antithrombin-complexes, and activated FVII were reduced in acute and chronic liver disease, even after adjusting for zymogen levels, which were also substantially reduced. Natural anticoagulants antithrombin and protein C were profoundly reduced in liver patients.

Conclusions

This study provides evidence of enhanced thrombin generation in liver disease without detectable activation of the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. We propose that defective anticoagulant mechanisms highly amplify the low-grade activation of coagulation by either pathway.

### Immune factors in deep vein thrombosis initiation [^116CdBd1]. Trends in Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Blood Coagulation Cascade and Thrombus Development

Blood clotting is based on a protein polymer called fibrin, produced by cleavage of its precursor, fibrinogen, by the protease thrombin (Figure 1). Thrombin is formed by activated Factor X (FXa)-mediated processing of prothrombin. Activation of FX can occur via two mechanisms designated as extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. The former one is initiated by a protein designated as tissue factor (TF), which may be exposed by the tissues or blood cells, predominantly monocytes. The intrinsic pathway starts from contact of FXII with a negatively charged surface. Both pathways trigger a cascade of enzymatic transformations converging on FX. Upon formation, fibrin is stabilized by a transglutaminase, FXIII.

Figure 1
Blood Coagulation Cascade and Major Targets of Current Antithrombotic Therapy. There are two pathways of blood coagulation initiation: intrinsic and extrinsic. The intrinsic pathway starts from activation of FXII by contact with a negatively charged surface, whereas the external one commences with FVII activation by interaction with TF on the surface of monocytes, microparticles, activated endothelial cells, or cells in the injured vessel wall. Both pathways converge on activation of FX (prothrombinase), which converts inactive thrombin precursor prothrombin into active enzyme. Thrombin, a central molecule in the cascade, cleaves fibrinogen turning it into fibrin that consititutes basis for a thrombus. Fibrin crosslinking by active FXIII with subsequent clot retraction make the clot more solid, firm and resistant to fibrin-degrading enzymes. Major targets of the contemporary antithrombotic therapy are depicted.

### Intrinsic pathway of coagulation and thrombosis [^1146t2x6]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

Activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation contributes to the pathogenesis of arterial and venous thrombosis. Critical insights into the involvement of intrinsic pathway factors have been derived from the study of gene-specific knockout animals and targeted inhibitors. Importantly, preclinical studies have indicated that targeting components of this pathway, including FXI (factor XI), FXII, and PKK (prekallikrein), reduces thrombosis with no significant effect on protective hemostatic pathways. This review highlights the advances made from studying the intrinsic pathway using gene-specific knockout animals and inhibitors in models of arterial and venous thrombosis. Development of inhibitors of activated FXI and FXII may reduce thrombosis with minimal increases in bleeding compared with current anticoagulant drugs.

### The crosstalk between nephropathy and coagulation disorder: pathogenesis, treatment, and dilemmas [^116oDuma]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As an important part of physiological hemostasis, coagulation is a complex process involving a series of cascade reactions between coagulation factors, which finally transform fibrinogen into insoluble fibrin, causing blood clotting (Figure 1). Abnormalities in coagulation factors lead to coagulation disorders, resulting in thrombosis or bleeding.

Figure 1
Coagulation cascade and the targets of anticoagulants. The coagulation process consists of a cascade of coagulation factors. Coagulation is initiated by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. In the intrinsic pathway, negatively charged surfaces, such as phospholipids and polyphosphates from activated platelets, activate FXII, triggering cascade reactions that ultimately activate FX. In the extrinsic pathway, tissue injury or inflammatory factors induce the expression of TFs that form complexes with activated FVII, thereby activating FX. Activated FX promotes the production of thrombin, which catalyzes fibrinogen (Fg) to soluble fibrin. FXIII promotes cross-linking of fibrin, resulting in the formation of blood clots. Anticoagulants inhibit thrombosis by disturbing the coagulation cascade. Warfarin inhibits the production of vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors (including FII, FVII, IX, and X) in the liver. Heparin primarily promotes the activity of AT-III. DOACs, including apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban, function as the inhibitor of FX, while dabigatran is the inhibitor of thrombin. Novel anticoagulants, including ISIS 416858 and BAY2976217, are FXI antisense oligonucleotides, while BAY1213790 is the monoclonal antibody to FXI a.

### Dysregulation of complement and coagulation pathways: emerging mechanisms in the development of psychosis [^111VuDLs]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The physiological role of complement and coagulation pathways

The complement and coagulation pathways (KEGG: hsa04610) are central to host defense against pathogen infection and injury. The complement system is a key component of the innate immune defense. It is composed of plasma and cell-bound proteins, which are activated via three distinct pathways: the classical pathway (CP, antibody–antigen complex), lectin pathway (LP, carbohydrates), and alternative pathway (AP, contact activation), which converge at the level of C3 activation leading to formation of a membrane-attack complex. Innate immune defense mechanisms can trigger coagulation to limit the invasiveness of the pathogens as well as respond to injury, through fibrin formation either by intrinsic (contact activation) or extrinsic (tissue factor (TF)) pathway activation. This is subsequently regulated by plasminogen activation-mediated fibrinolysis. Increased evidence of molecular crosstalk between coagulation and inflammation suggests that coagulation activation can increase inflammation, which in turn amplifies coagulation.

### Inhibition of factor XI using RBD4059: a novel galNAc-siRNA with potent and durable antithrombotic effects [^112tqHcV]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Thromboembolic diseases represent the leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally, and are estimated to account for 1 in 4 deaths worldwide. The mainstay for treatment and prevention of thromboembolic conditions is anticoagulation therapy. Currently existing anticoagulants, including vitamin K antagonists, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins, and direct oral anticoagulants, can, however, be associated with serious bleeding complications as they target components of the extrinsic or common pathways of the coagulation cascade that are important for hemostasis and wound repair. Therefore, there is a major unmet medical need for developing novel antithrombotic strategies for safer treatment and prevention of thromboembolic diseases.

Components of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation have become attractive targets for the development of novel antithrombotic drugs, because their inhibition is less likely to cause bleeding complications. Factor XI (FXI) is the zymogen of the serine protease activated factor XI (FXIa) and is a major component of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation with a fundamental role in thrombosis. Previous studies have shown that patients with increased FXI levels have an increased risk of ischemic stroke and deep vein thrombosis. In contrast, inherited FXI deficiency (hemophilia C) may lead to a reduced risk of ischemic stroke and venous thromboembolism while it rarely manifests as spontaneous bleedings. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of FXI with antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides, or small molecules has antithrombotic effects without increased risk of bleeding. These facts propose that components of the intrinsic coagulation pathway, particularly FXI, contribute to the pathogenesis in thromboembolic diseases, therefore making FXI a promising target for the development of safer anticoagulants.

### Tissue factor pathway inhibitor and the revised hypothesis of blood coagulation [^1145iEk6]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The recent rediscovery, isolation, and characterization of an endogenous coagulation inhibitor termed tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) has provided new insight into the regulation of in vivo coagulation. TFPI is a multivalent, Kunitz-type, protease inhibitor that directly binds and inactivates factor Xa and, in a factor-Xa-dependent fashion, produces feedback inhibition of the factor VIIa-tissue factor catalytic complex. The demonstrated in vitro properties of TFPI have led to the formulation of a revised theory of blood coagulation. In the revised model, coagulation proceeds through a single pathway rather than the alternative and redundant "extrinsic" and "intrinsic" pathways that had previously been postulated.

### Comprehensive synthesis and anticoagulant evaluation of a diverse fucoidan library [^1135uKCJ]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots within blood vessels, is the main underlying pathology of cardiovascular diseases, which remain the leading global cause of mortality. Anticoagulants are widely used in both medical and surgical settings to manage thrombotic events. Beyond the classical drugs such as heparin and warfarin, a range of heparin derivatives (e.g. enoxaparin and fondaparinux) and direct oral anticoagulants (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) have been developed. However, all the currently available anticoagulants target coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and/or thrombin (FIIa), which are located in the common pathway, downstream of the coagulation cascade, and are essential to hemostasis function. Despite their efficacy and widespread use, these anticoagulants are associated with a high risk of bleeding. This prompts researchers to search for safer alternatives. Particularly, emerging evidence underscores the critical role of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in coagulation propagation and thrombosis, while having a limited contribution to hemostasis. Therefore, targeting intrinsic coagulation factors is recognized as a promising strategy for achieving safer and more effective antithrombotic therapies.

### Endothelial PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1) blocks the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, inducing the clearance and degradation of FXIa (activated factor XI) [^115dPQdA]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective- Activation of coagulation FXI (factor XI) by FXIIa (activated factor XII) is a prothrombotic process. The endothelium is known to play an antithrombotic role by limiting thrombin generation and platelet activation. It is unknown whether the antithrombotic role of the endothelium includes sequestration of FXIa (activated factor XI) activity. This study aims to determine the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in the regulation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Approach and Results- Using a chromogenic assay, we observed that human umbilical veins ECs selectively blocked FXIa yet supported kallikrein and FXIIa activity. Western blotting and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that FXIa formed a complex with endothelial PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor-1). Blocking endothelial PAI-1 increased the cleavage of a chromogenic substrate by FXIa and the capacity of FXIa to promote fibrin formation in plasma. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses showed that FXIa-PAI-1 complexes were either released into the media or trafficked to the early and late endosomes and lysosomes of ECs. When baboons were challenged with Staphylococcus aureus to induce a prothrombotic phenotype, an increase in circulating FXIa-PAI-1 complex levels was detected by ELISA within 2 to 8 hours postchallenge. Conclusions- PAI-1 forms a complex with FXIa on ECs, blocking its activity and inducing the clearance and degradation of FXIa. Circulating FXIa-PAI-1 complexes were detected in a baboon model of S. aureus sepsis. Although ECs support kallikrein and FXIIa activity, inhibition of FXIa by ECs may promote the clearance of intravascular FXIa. Visual Overview- An online visual overview is available for this article.

### The intrinsic pathway of coagulation as a target for antithrombotic therapy [^111jjhU1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Plasma coagulation in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay is initiated by sequential activation of coagulation factors XII, XI, and IX. While this series of proteolytic reactions is not an accurate model for hemostasis in vivo, there is mounting evidence that factor XI and factor XII contribute to thrombosis, and that inhibiting them can produce an antithrombotic effect with a small effect on hemostasis. This article discusses the contributions of components of the intrinsic pathway to thrombosis in animal models and humans, and results of early clinical trials of drugs targeting factors IX, XI, and XII.

### Paradoxical enhancement of the intrinsic pathway-induced thrombin generation in human plasma by melagatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, but not edoxaban, a direct factor Xa inhibitor, or heparin [^111DsVy5]. Thrombosis Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

The blood coagulation cascade consists of two pathways, the tissue factor (TF)-dependent extrinsic pathway and the contact factor-dependent intrinsic pathway. We have previously shown that a direct thrombin inhibitor, melagatran, paradoxically increased TF-induced thrombin generation (TG) in thrombomodulin (TM)-containing human plasma in vitro. However, the effect of melagatran on the intrinsic pathway-induced TG remains to be investigated. We investigated whether melagatran enhances the intrinsic pathway-induced TG.

Methods and Results

TG was induced by kaolin in human plasma and assayed by the calibrated automated thrombography method. Melagatran at 150 and 300 nM significantly increased the peak level (2.40-fold) and endogenous thrombin potential of TG in normal plasma in the presence of 5 nM TM. In the absence of TM or in protein C (PC)-deficient plasma, the paradoxical enhancement of TG by melagatran disappeared. A direct FXa inhibitor, edoxaban, and an antithrombin-dependent anticoagulant, unfractionated heparin (UFH), did not increase, but simply decreased TG under each condition in a concentration dependent manner.

Conclusion

Melagatran enhanced the intrinsic pathway-induced TG as well as the extrinsic pathway-induced TG in human plasma under the condition where PC system is active. In contrast, edoxaban and UFH showed concentration-dependent decrease of TG, but no enhancement. These results indicated that edoxaban and UFH may have a low risk of the paradoxical enhancement of TG by both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway activation.

### Unraveling coagulation factor-mediated cellular signaling [^115TPoXA]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood coagulation is initiated in response to blood vessel injury or proinflammatory stimuli, which activate coagulation factors to coordinate complex biochemical and cellular responses necessary for clot formation. In addition to these critical physiologic functions, plasma protein factors activated during coagulation mediate a spectrum of signaling responses via receptor-binding interactions on different cell types. In this review, we describe examples and mechanisms of coagulation factor signaling. We detail the molecular basis for cell signaling mediated by coagulation factor proteases via the protease-activated receptor family, considering new insights into the role of protease-specific cleavage sites, cofactor and coreceptor interactions, and distinct signaling intermediate interactions in shaping protease-activated receptor signaling diversity. Moreover, we discuss examples of how injury-dependent conformational activation of other coagulation proteins, such as fibrin(ogen) and von Willebrand factor, decrypts their signaling potential, unlocking their capacity to contribute to aberrant proinflammatory signaling. Finally, we consider the role of coagulation factor signaling in disease development and the status of pharmacologic approaches to either attenuate or enhance coagulation factor signaling for therapeutic benefit, emphasizing new approaches to inhibit deleterious coagulation factor signaling without impacting hemostatic activity.

### The role of the contact pathway in thrombus propagation [^114rUEyR]. Thrombosis Research (2014). Low credibility.

The continued search for the ideal antithrombotic agent that would prevent or reduce thrombus growth inside blood vessels without an effect on the essential hemostatic functions of blood, including extraluminal thrombin generation and platelet activation, has been going in new directions in the past decade. These directions include studies suggesting that activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade through contact activation of factor XII, and the resultant thrombin generation is a pathologic event that leads to undesirable consequences. Recent animal studies of contact pathway inhibitors in experimental thrombogenesis suggest that the contact activation pathway of blood coagulation may play a pathogenic role in thrombosis, and pharmacologic inhibition of contact activation may have antithrombotic effects. Development of reasonably potent selective inhibitors of contact activation pathway components or activities now allow for the conduct of studies in various animal species, including primates. These studies have generated interesting data that now support the hypothesis that thrombogenesis in humans may also involve the pathological activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade. Moreover, baboons, mice, and rabbits, pretreated with antibodies that selectively inhibit factor XII activation, procoagulant factor XIIa activity, or all enzymatic activities of factor XIIa show significantly reduced propensity for occlusive thrombus propagation in various models of acute thrombogenesis on vascular grafts, membrane oxygenators, and even on injured arteries. Since contact activation of blood does not play a demonstrable role in normal hemostasis, and there has been no evidence generated to date suggesting that activation of factor XII has a physiologic function, current research now supports the original concept, developed over 2 decades ago, that temporal pharmacologic inhibition of thrombin generation through the contact pathway may have therapeutic potential and could produce beneficial antithrombotic activities without hemostasis impairment.

### Involvement of the contact phase and intrinsic pathway in herpes simplex virus-initiated plasma coagulation [^116fCmxM]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Summary Background

A hemostatic response to vascular injury is initiated by the extrinsic pathway of coagulation and amplified by the intrinsic pathway. We previously reported that purified herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV1) has constitutive extrinsic pathway tissue factor (TF) and anionic phospholipid on its surface derived from the host cell, and can consequently bypass strict cellular control of coagulation.

Objective

The current work addresses the hypothesis that HSV1-induced plasma coagulation also involves intrinsic pathway, factor VIII (FVIII), and upstream contact activation pathway, factor XII (FXII).

Results

HSV1-initiated clotting was accelerated when purified FVIII was added to FVIII-deficient plasma and in normal plasma attenuated by an inhibitory anti-FVIII antibody (Ab). High HSV1 concentrations predictably reduced the effect of FVIII due to the availability of excess viral TF. To further define TF-independent clotting mechanisms initiated by HSV1, the extrinsic pathway was disabled using factor VII-deficient plasma. The intrinsic pathway is triggered by activation of FXII associated with surface-bound kallikrein, which subsequently activates factor XI. Here we found that an inhibitor of activated FXII, corn trypsin inhibitor, and anti-FXII, anti-kallikrein and anti-FXI Abs inhibited HSV1-initiated clotting. HSV1-enhanced activation of purified FXII was confirmed by Western blot, but required prekallikrein.

Conclusion

The current work shows that HSV1 can trigger and amplify coagulation through the contact phase and intrinsic pathway, and suggests an additional mechanism that may contribute to vascular pathology.

### The role of leukocytes in thrombosis [^111z6KG7]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

In recent years, the traditional view of the hemostatic system as being regulated by a coagulation factor cascade coupled with platelet activation has been increasingly challenged by new evidence that activation of the immune system strongly influences blood coagulation and pathological thrombus formation. Leukocytes can be induced to express tissue factor and release proinflammatory and procoagulant molecules such as granular enzymes, cytokines, and damage-associated molecular patterns. These mediators can influence all aspects of thrombus formation, including platelet activation and adhesion, and activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. Leukocyte-released procoagulant mediators increase systemic thrombogenicity, and leukocytes are actively recruited to the site of thrombus formation through interactions with platelets and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. Additionally, phagocytic leukocytes are involved in fibrinolysis and thrombus resolution, and can regulate clearance of platelets and coagulation factors. Dysregulated activation of leukocyte innate immune functions thus plays a role in pathological thrombus formation. Modulation of the interactions between leukocytes or leukocyte-derived procoagulant materials and the traditional hemostatic system is an attractive target for the development of novel antithrombotic strategies.

### Dual role of collagen in factor XII-dependent thrombus formation [^111LyrXL]. Blood (2009). Low credibility.

In vivo mouse models have indicated that the intrinsic coagulation pathway, initiated by factor XII, contributes to thrombus formation in response to major vascular damage. Here, we show that fibrillar type I collagen provoked a dose-dependent shortening of the clotting time of human plasma via activation of factor XII. This activation was mediated by factor XII binding to collagen. Factor XII activation also contributed to the stimulating effect of collagen on thrombin generation in plasma, and increased the effect of platelets via glycoprotein VI activation. Furthermore, in flow-dependent thrombus formation under coagulant conditions, collagen promoted the appearance of phosphatidylserine-exposing platelets and the formation of fibrin. Defective glycoprotein VI signaling (with platelets deficient in LAT or phospholipase Cgamma2) delayed and suppressed phosphatidylserine exposure and thrombus formation. Markedly, these processes were also suppressed by absence of factor XII or XI, whereas blocking of tissue factor/factor VIIa was of little effect. Together, these results point to a dual role of collagen in thrombus formation: stimulation of glycoprotein VI signaling via LAT and PLCgamma2 to form procoagulant platelets; and activation of factor XII to stimulate thrombin generation and potentiate the formation of platelet-fibrin thrombi.

### Contact and intrinsic coagulation pathways are activated and associated with adverse clinical outcomes in COVID-19 [^115toHdg]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Although activation of the contact pathway by bacterial infection has been described in humans and in animal models, few studies have investigated whether this pathway is activated in viral infection. Hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 results in activation of innate immune cells (neutrophils and monocytes) that interact with platelets and the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to micro- and macrothrombosis. Generation of neutrophil extracellular trapsand/or release of platelet-derived polyphosphatemay promote activation of the contact pathway in COVID-19 during immunothrombosis in the microvasculature of the lung and other vascular beds. In addition to its contribution to thrombin generation, contact activation leads to an inflammatory cascade mediated by BK as a product of PKa cleavage of HK. Indeed, the phrase BK storm was coined to describe the dysregulated generation of BK (and its metabolite des-Arg9-BK) in COVID-19 infection, which may enhance pulmonary inflammation and increase vascular permeability. Although the very short half-life of BK makes it challenging to measure directly in plasma, BK generation can be inferred by quantitation of the more stable cleaved form of HK. Our data suggest that in the early stages of infection, levels of cleaved HK are significantly increased in those with COVID-19 compared with healthy individuals, but this is accompanied by an increased concentration of the intact form of HK, likely as a compensatory response. This interpretation is compatible with other data shown here indicating that increased zymogen levels of the other contact factors are also associated with elevated levels of the respective serine protease:serpin complexes (eg, elevated FXII:C and increased FXIIa:C1 complexes were observed in the same samples).

### Zymogen-like factor Xa variants restore thrombin generation and effectively bypass the intrinsic pathway in vitro [^114U2oa2]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Inhibitory antibodies to factors VIII or IX represent a serious complication for hemophilia patients. Treatment involves products that bypass the intrinsic pathway and promote thrombin generation. Direct infusion of factor Xa should also restore hemostasis; however, it has a short half-life in plasma and could activate systemic coagulation in an uncontrolled fashion. Here we show that factor Xa mutants with zymogen-like properties (FXa(I16L) and FXa(V17A)) circumvent these limitations. In the absence of factor Va, the FXa variants are poor enzymes for a range of physiological ligands and are resistant to inactivation by antithrombin III and tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Notably, assembly of FXa(I16L) and FXa(V17A) on activated platelets with factor Va to form prothrombinase completely restores biologic activity. In hemophilic plasma, FXa(I16L) and FXa(V17A) have prolonged half-lives compared with wild-type factor Xa (approximately 60 minutes vs approximately 1 minute) and promote robust thrombin generation that bypasses the intrinsic pathway. The variants require factor Va generated in situ for procoagulant function, and cofactor inactivation by the protein C pathway regulates their activity. The efficacy, extended half-life, and mechanism of action suggest that novel zymogen-like forms of factor Xa might prove useful as new therapeutic procoagulants to treat deficiencies upstream of the common pathway.

### Sirtilins-the new old members of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor family [^1119QLcw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2019). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fishes and lower vertebrates have only FIX, and lack the other proteases of the intrinsic pathway 9, 10, 11. In the lamprey, for instance, FIX and its upstream activators are completely missing 10, 12. This fact indicates an earlier appearance of the extrinsic pathway in evolution than of the intrinsic pathway. Consequently, the absence of the latter also implies functional differences in the coagulation systems between these organisms. The VK‐dependent proteases probably emerged from a common ancestor via multiple gene duplication events 9, 11, 13. This resulted in early divergence of PC, FVII and FX in vertebrate evolution, which is, for example, reflected by the situation found in the lamprey 10, 12. FIX diverged from FX later in evolution, as exemplified by cartilaginous fishes and bony fishes 10, 12. This process probably also triggered the emergence of the intrinsic coagulation pathway in mammals, including plasma kallikrein, activated FXII, and FXIa, the upstream activator of FIX.

Here, we describe an additional class of VK‐dependent coagulation proteases, which we found to exist in organisms ranging from jawless fish to marsupials. These proteases appeared in evolution even before the divergence of FVII and FX, shedding new light on the emergence and function of the vertebrate blood coagulation system.

### Contact system revisited: an interface between inflammation, coagulation, and innate immunity [^117Kfviu]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

The contact system is a plasma protease cascade initiated by factor XII (FXII) that activates the proinflammatory kallikrein-kinin system and the procoagulant intrinsic coagulation pathway. Anionic surfaces induce FXII zymogen activation to form proteolytically active FXIIa. Bacterial surfaces also have the ability to activate contact system proteins, indicating an important role for host defense using the cooperation of the inflammatory and coagulation pathways. Recent research has shown that inorganic polyphosphate found in platelets activates FXII in vivo and can induce coagulation in pathological thrombus formation. Experimental studies have shown that interference with FXII provides thromboprotection without a therapy-associated increase in bleeding, renewing interest in the FXIIa-driven intrinsic pathway of coagulation as a therapeutic target. This review summarizes how the contact system acts as the cross-road of inflammation, coagulation, and innate immunity.

### Characterizing coagulation responses in humans and nonhuman primates following kidney xenotransplantation – A narrative review [^117BRt5L]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Overview of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, basic regulatory mechanisms including primary and secondary hemostasis. These mechanisms are functionally similar in both humans and NHP. Including the procoagulant intrinsic, extrinsic, and common pathways and clot dissolving fibrinolytic pathway. AT‐III, antithrombin‐III; PAI, plasminogen activator inhibitor; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; tPA, tissue plasminogen activator; uPA, urokinase‐type plasminogen activator.

Regulation of coagulation is maintained by a group of natural inhibitors (Figure 1). Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a Kunitz‐type serine protease inhibitor from ECs that inhibits the TF/VIIa complex. It is regarded as the most important endogenous inhibitor of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation. Antithrombin, produced by hepatocytes, is another inhibitor that inactivates mainly thrombin and to less extent factors IXa, Xia, and XIIa in the tenase complex. Protein C, a zymogen activated by thrombomodulin (a membrane protein expressed on ECs, with high affinity binding to thrombin) forming the thrombin‐thrombomodulin complex, requires protein S as a cofactor and inactivates FVIIIa and FVa. Finally, fibrinolysis, mediated by plasminogen activators, uPA and tPA, converting plasminogen into plasmin, breaks down the fibrin clot (Figure 1). This process is controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), ensuring proper fibrinolysis balance.

### The intrinsic coagulation pathway plays a dominant role in driving hypercoagulability in ANCA-associated vasculitis [^114ze9jr]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The risk of a venous thrombotic event (VTE) is increased in patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis (AAV), with a frequency of up to 14% and an incidence rate of 2.11 per 100 patient years. The risk is highest among patients with active disease involving the skin, lungs, and those with impaired kidney function at presentation. Most VTEs occur during active disease, suggesting that vascular inflammation and/or endothelial damage trigger hypercoagulability. Markers of hypercoagulability and endothelial damage, however, remained elevated in patients with AAV in clinical remission, indicating low-grade inflammation that persists during quiescent disease. In addition, impaired fibrinolysis has been demonstrated in a subset of patients with active AAV. However, knowledge on the specific pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to hypercoagulability in patients with AAV and its translation into clinical guidance for the identification of patients at highest risk is limited.

We, therefore, investigated the coagulation cascade in a well-defined prospective cohort of patients with active AAV, using state-of-the-art assays to test extensively for activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation, at presentation and follow-up.

### Histidine-rich glycoprotein binds factor XIIa with high affinity and inhibits contact-initiated coagulation [^113V8yRi]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) circulates in plasma at a concentration of 2μM and binds plasminogen, fibrinogen, and thrombospondin. Despite these interactions, the physiologic role of HRG is unknown. Previous studies have shown that mice and humans deficient in HRG have shortened plasma clotting times. To better understand this phenomenon, we examined the effect of HRG on clotting tests. HRG prolongs the activated partial thromboplastin time in a concentration-dependent fashion but has no effect on tissue factor-induced clotting, localizing its effect to the contact pathway. Plasma immunodepleted of HRG exhibits a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time that is restored to baseline with HRG replenishment. To explore how HRG affects the contact pathway, we examined its binding to factors XII, XIIa, XI, and XIa. HRG binds factor XIIa with high affinity, an interaction that is enhanced in the presence of Zn²⁺, but does not bind factors XII, XI, or XIa. In addition, HRG inhibits autoactivation of factor XII and factor XIIa-mediated activation of factor XI. These results suggest that, by binding to factor XIIa, HRG modulates the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, particularly in the vicinity of a thrombus where platelet release of HRG and Zn²(+) will promote this interaction.

### Is the neutrophil a' prima donna' in the procoagulant process during sepsis? [^111WpyNQ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Activation of the coagulation system is a fundamental host defense mechanism. Microorganisms that have invaded the body are trapped and disposed of in clots. Monocytes/macrophages are widely accepted as the main players in the procoagulant process; however, recent evidence suggests that neutrophils also play important roles. Tissue factor, which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade, is reportedly expressed on the surface of neutrophils, as well as on microparticles derived from neutrophils. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are another source of tissue factor. The components of NETs, such as DNA, histones, and granule proteins, also provide procoagulant activities. For instance, DNA initiates the intrinsic pathway, histones are a strong generator of thrombin, and granule proteins such as neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G and myeloperoxidase contribute to the suppression of the anticoagulation systems. Although understanding of the mechanisms that are involved in coagulation/fibrinolysis in sepsis has gradually progressed, the impact of neutrophils on thrombogenicity during sepsis remains to be addressed. Since the importance of the connection between coagulation and inflammation is advocated nowadays, further research on neutrophils is required.

### What is all that thrombin for? [^112y5bCN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

The hemostatic process initiated by the exposure of tissue factor to blood is a threshold limited reaction which occurs in two distinct phases. During an initiation phase, small amounts of factor (F)Xa, FIXa and thrombin are generated. The latter activates the procofactors FV and FVIII to the activated cofactors which together with their companion serine proteases form the intrinsic FX activator (FVIIIa-FIXa) and prothrombinase (FVa-FXa) which generate the bulk of FXa and thrombin during a propagation phase. The clotting process (fibrin formation) occurs at the inception of the propagation phase when only 5–10 nM thrombin has been produced. Consequently, the vast majority (greater than 95%) of thrombin is produced after clotting during the propagation phase of thrombin generation. The blood of individuals with either hemophilia A or hemophilia B has no ability to generate the intrinsic FXase, and hence is unable to support the propagation phase of the reaction. Since clot based assays conclude before the propagation phase they are not sensitive to hemophilia A and B. The inception and magnitude of the propagation phase of thrombin generation is influenced by genetic polymorphisms associated with thrombotic and hemorrhagic disease, by the natural abundance of pro- and anticoagulants in healthy individuals and by pharmacologic interventions which influence thrombotic pathology. Therefore, it is our suspicion that the performance of the entire process of thrombin generation from initiation through propagation and termination phases of the reaction are relevant with respect to both hemorrhagic and thrombotic pathology.

### Epidemiology and pathophysiology of cancer-associated thrombosis [^114NMSV1]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

A simplified overview of the coagulation cascade is shown in Figure 4. The major role of the coagulation cascade is the production of fibrin – the meshwork that holds together the clot – which is produced through a cleavage of fibrinogen by thrombin. Coagulation is initiated by tissue damage, exposing the transmembrane glycoprotein tissue factor (TF). Tissue factor is expressed on the subendothelial surface of blood vessels and is normally exposed only when normal vasculature is disrupted. Factor VII binds TF, and the TF–factor VII complex directly activates factor X to factor Xa and some factor IX to factor IXa. In the presence of factor Xa, tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits further generation of factor Xa and factor IXa. After inhibition by TFPI, the amount of factor Xa produced is insufficient to maintain coagulation. Additional factor Xa (which allows haemostasis to progress to completion) can only be generated by the factor IX–factor VIII pathway. Enough thrombin exists at this point to activate factor VIII, and together with factor IXa (generated by TF–factor VIIa) to further activate factor X. Factor IX activation is also augmented by thrombin activation of the factor XI pathway. Without the amplification and consolidating action of factor VIII/factor IX, there is insufficient generation of factor Xa to produce sufficient thrombin. When sufficient thrombin is generated, this endolytic serine protease selectively cleaves the Arg–Gly bonds of fibrinogen to form fibrin, releasing fibrinopeptides A and B and so forms the meshwork of the clot.

It is of note that the above physiological description omits the classic extrinsic pathway (factor VII-TF initiated coagulation to common pathway at factor X) and intrinsic pathways activated by factor XII (and through factors XI, IX, and VIII to common pathway at factor X). Although factor XII has no role in physiological blood coagulation, it has been considered that it may have a role in cancer-related thrombosis (see below). Indeed most, if not all, aspects of the complex integrated haemostatic system have been considered to function pathologically in the setting of cancer.

### Can complement activation be the missing link in antiphospholipid syndrome? [^115xeA22]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Coagulation and complement activation interplay

Coagulation and complement activation are interlinked with both pathways able to activate each other through multiple components.

Blood clotting results from a complex sequence of events and from the interplay between different cell populations, the exposed subendothelial tissue, the extracellular matrix (ECM), coagulation factors and complement components. Briefly, upon tissue damage, platelets adhere to the exposed collagen on the damaged vessel wall, which leads to their activation. Platelet adhesion starts with interactions between platelets surface receptors and ECM components. Upon adhesion and activation, platelets undergo a conformational change that redistributes the membrane phospholipids, increasing the exposure of phosphatidylserine and chondroitinsulphate, which support complement activation. Activated platelets degranulate, releasing coagulation factors [prothrombin, factor (F) V, FXI, FXIII] and complement components. Secondary haemostasis is initiated with either the tissue factor (TF) pathway or the contact pathway, both merging at production of activated FX (FXa) that subsequently cleaves prothrombin to thrombin. Fibrinogen is then cleaved by thrombin to fibrin resulting in fibrin deposition and strengthening of the initial platelet plug. Both primary and secondary haemostasis occur simultaneously and can be influenced by the activity of complement components. Blood clotting can occur in the absence of vessel injury for instance in the presence of aPL.

Regarding the complement–coagulation interplay, factor H (FH), a complement regulator, modulates some coagulation factors of the intrinsic and common pathways. In vitro observations suggest that thrombin generation might also be mediated by MBL (mannose-binding lectin)-associated serine protease 2 (MASP-2), a protease of the lectin pathway, whereas MASP-1 cleaves factor XIII, high-molecular weight kininogen and fibrinogen, and initiates the contact pathway of coagulation.

End products of complement activation (C3a, C5a, C5b-9) can induce release of procoagulant and proinflammatory cytokines from endothelial cells and monocytes that lead to overexpression of TF and molecules favouring platelet adhesion and coagulation (Fig. 1).

In aPL-positive individuals, aPL can, by themselves, activate some of the cell populations involved in blood clotting, mainly endothelial cells and platelets, and induce monocyte TF expression and FXa release upon TF pathway activation.

### Comprehensive synthesis and anticoagulant evaluation of a diverse fucoidan library [^117MU12T]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The fucoidan sulfates we have developed selectively inhibit the intrinsic coagulation pathway without interfering with the extrinsic and common pathways. By specifically targeting iFXase, the rate-limiting enzyme complex in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, our compounds enable safe and effective antithrombosis. This is particularly crucial for patients requiring long-term anticoagulant therapy, such as those with chronic conditions like venous thromboembolism. This targeted approach is particularly beneficial for patients who may have contraindications or intolerances to extrinsic pathway inhibitors like warfarin. Thus, selective inhibition of the intrinsic pathway provides a valuable alternative for patients who need tailored anticoagulant therapy.

### Factor XI: hemostasis, thrombosis, and antithrombosis [^116yTgNv]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor FXI (FXI), a plasma serine protease zymogen, has important roles in both intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways and bridges the initiation and amplification phases of plasmatic hemostasis. Recent studies have provided new insight into the molecular structure and functional features of FXI and have demonstrated distinct structural and biological differences between activated factor XII (FXIIa)-mediated FXI activation and tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation. The former is important in thrombosis; the latter is more essential in hemostasis. Activated partial thromboplastin tine (aPTT) artificially reflects FXIIa-initiated intrinsic coagulation pathway in vitro. Conversely, FXIIa-inhibited diluted thromboplastin time assay may reflect tissue factor/thrombin-mediated FXI activation in vivo. Further explication of the genetic mutations of FXI deficiency has improved the understanding of the structure-function relationship of FXI. Besides its procoagulant activity, the antifibrinolytic activity of FXI was well documented in a wealth of literature. Finally, the new emerging concept of inhibiting FXI as a novel antithrombotic approach with an improved benefit-risk ratio has been supported through observations from human FXI deficiency and various animal models. Large- and small-molecule FXI inhibitors have shown promising antithrombotic effects. The present review summarizes the recent advancements in the molecular physiology of FXI and the molecular pathogenesis of FXI deficiency and discusses the evidence and progress of FXI-targeting antithrombotics development.

### Identification of the factor XII contact activation site enables sensitive coagulation diagnostics [^112e4KCu]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Blood coagulation is essential to terminate bleeding at sites of vascular injury (haemostasis). However, uncontrolled coagulation contributes to vascular occlusion (thrombosis) that remains the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world.

Blood coagulation can be initiated by two principal mechanisms, namely the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. The extrinsic pathway is triggered by the transmembrane protein tissue factor (TF) exposed on subendothelial tissues at sites of vascular injury. In contrast, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation commences intravascularly through activation of circulating coagulation factor XII (FXII, Hageman Factor, EC:3.4.21.38), in a reaction that involves high molecular weight kininogen (HK) and plasma prekallikrein (PK). These three factors are collectively referred to as the plasma contact activation system, a name that originates from the unique mode of FXII activation. FXII circulates in plasma in a zymogen form, however, binding ("contact") to negatively charged surfaces induces a conformational change in zymogen FXII leading to proteolytic activity and formation of the activated protease FXIIa ("contact activation"). FXIIa activation of PK forms plasma kallikrein (PKa) that reciprocally activates FXII, thereby amplifying FXIIa formation in solution ("fluid phase activation"). FXIIa contributes to coagulation via its substrate coagulation factor XI (FXI) – and targeting the FXIIa protease in experimental murineand large animalmodels provides protection from thrombosis (reviewed in,–) indicating a critical role of FXIIa-triggered coagulation in thrombus formation. Since FXIIa impacts thrombosis but does not influence haemostasis, its pharmacologic inhibition has emerged as a potential target for thrombosis prevention without bleeding risk.

### Coagulation factor XI as a novel target for antithrombotic treatment [^1139RnN9]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2010). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor (F)XI was first described as a member of the contact pathway of coagulation. However, the 'classic' theory of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathway has been revised and FXI was found to be activated by thrombin and to play a role in sustained thrombin generation and fibrinolysis inhibition. Recent studies have pointed to a disproportionate role of FXI in thrombosis and hemostasis. The observations that human congenital FXI deficiency is generally accompanied by mild and injury-related bleeding, and that experimental, provoked bleeding in animals is unaffected by FXI deficiency or FXI inhibition, suggest that the FXI amplification pathway is less important for normal hemostasis in vivo. In contrast, elevated plasma levels of FXI may contribute to human thromboembolic disease and the antithrombotic efficacy of FXI inhibition has been demonstrated in numerous animal models of arterial, venous and cerebral thrombosis. Whether severe FXI deficiency in humans protects against thromboembolic events remains unclear, although some evidence exists that the occurrence of ischemic stroke or venous thrombosis is low in severely FXI-deficient patients. Because of its distinctive function in thrombosis and hemostasis, FXI is an attractive target for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolism. A novel strategy for FXI inhibition is the use of antisense technology which has been studied in various thrombosis and bleeding animal models. The results are promising and support the concept that targeting FXI might serve as a new, effective and potentially safer alternative for the treatment of thromboembolic disease in humans.

### Regulation of coagulation by tissue factor pathway inhibitor: implications for hemophilia therapy [^111SbDEn]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

3.1 TFPI inhibition of TF‐FVIIa

TF‐FVIIa initiates the blood coagulation cascade by activating FX of the common blood coagulation pathwayand FIX of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway(Figure 2). The inhibition of TF‐FVIIa is mediated by direct binding of K1 to the FVIIa active site. However, K1 is a poor inhibitor of TF‐FVIIa and efficient inhibition requires FXa. Thus, TFPI has been described as a two‐stage inhibitor where K2 binds to FXa, and in a subsequent inhibitory step the TFPI‐FXa complex inhibits TF‐FVIIa. However, the rate‐limiting step for inhibition of TF‐FVIIa is the inhibition of FXa. This indicates that instead of occurring in a two‐step process, TFPI simultaneously inhibits the ternary TF‐FVIIa‐FXa complex in a single reaction occurring immediately after FX is activated by TF‐FVIIa but before FXa dissociates from the ternary TF‐FVIIa‐FXa complex. In this manner, TFPI blocks TF‐FVIIa mediated generation of prothrombinase, FVa‐FXa, in the common blood coagulation pathway. However, because TFPI does not inhibit activation of FIX by TF‐FVIIa, TF‐FVIIa‐mediated initiation of blood coagulation can also proceed through the intrinsic pathway. Additionally, the TF‐FVIIa‐FXa ternary complex can directly activate FVIII in a process that is poorly inhibited by TFPI and occurs before the dissociation of the nascent product FXa. This provides a mechanism for TF‐FVIIa–mediated activation of both antihemophilic factors and production of the FVIIIa‐FIXa intrinsic tenase complex independent of thrombin providing feedback activation of FVIII.

### What does it take to make the perfect clot? [^114utpRF]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2006). Low credibility.

The coagulation process has been conceptualized as being primarily dependent on adequate levels of the coagulation proteins. This concept was based on the clear relationship between the bleeding tendency and factor levels in hemophilia. The field is now evolving toward conceptualizing coagulation as being actively regulated by the specialized cellular components of the process. Rather than conceiving coagulation as only a "cascade" of proteolytic reactions, the coagulation reactions occur as overlapping steps on cell surfaces. Components of the old "extrinsic'" and "intrinsic" pathways of coagulation can be thought of as participating in the initiation and propagation of coagulation reactions, respectively. Thus, these pathways are not redundant as they are portrayed in the cascade model, but play distinct and complementary roles. Our understanding of how specific cellular features control the processes of hemostasis and thrombosis is developing rapidly. This review discusses some aspects of the cellular control of coagulation.

### Factor XI as a therapeutic target [^111XMAFM]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2016). Low credibility.

Factor XIa is a plasma serine protease that contributes to thrombin generation primarily through proteolytic activation of factor IX. Traditionally considered part of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, several lines of evidence now suggest that factor XIa serves as an interface between the vitamin-K-dependent thrombin generation mechanism and the proinflammatory kallikrein-kinin system, allowing the 2 systems to influence each other. Work with animal models and results from epidemiological surveys of human populations support a role for factor XIa in thromboembolic disease. These data and the clinical observation that deficiency of factor XI, the zymogen of factor XIa, produces a relatively mild bleeding disorder suggest that drugs targeting factor XI or XIa could produce an antithrombotic effect while leaving hemostasis largely intact. Results of a recent trial comparing antisense-induced factor XI reduction to standard-dose low molecular-weight heparin as prophylaxis for venous thrombosis during knee replacement are encouraging in this regard. Here, we discuss recent findings on the biochemistry, physiology, and pathology of factor XI as they relate to thromboembolic disease.

### Factor XII regulates the pathological process of thrombus formation on ruptured plaques [^112LsDwq]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Atherothrombosis is the main cause of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Although the extrinsic (tissue factor-factor VIIa [FVIIa]) pathway is considered as a major trigger of coagulation in atherothrombosis, the role of the intrinsic coagulation pathway via coagulation FXII herein is unknown. Here, we studied the roles of the extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways in thrombus formation on atherosclerotic plaques both in vivo and ex vivo.

Approach and Results

Plaque rupture after ultrasound treatment evoked immediate formation of subocclusive thrombi in the carotid arteries of Apoe(-/-) mice, which became unstable in the presence of structurally different FXIIa inhibitors. In contrast, inhibition of FVIIa reduced thrombus size at a more initial stage without affecting embolization. Genetic deficiency in FXII (human and mouse) or FXI (mouse) reduced ex vivo whole-blood thrombus and fibrin formation on immobilized plaque homogenates. Localization studies by confocal microscopy indicated that FXIIa bound to thrombi and fibrin particularly in luminal-exposed thrombus areas.

Conclusions

The FVIIa- and FXIIa-triggered coagulation pathways have distinct but complementary roles in atherothrombus formation. The tissue factor-FVIIa pathway contributes to initial thrombus buildup, whereas FXIIa bound to thrombi ensures thrombus stability.

### The hemostatic role of factor XI [^113teAvZ]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Coagulation factor (F)XI has been described as a component of the early phase of the contact pathway of blood coagulation, acting downstream of factor XII. However, patients deficient in upstream members of the contact pathway, including FXII and prekallikrein, do not exhibit bleeding complications, while FXI-deficient patients sometimes experience mild bleeding, suggesting FXI plays a role in hemostasis independent of the contact pathway. Further complicating the picture, bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients is difficult to predict because bleeding symptoms have not been found to correlate with FXI antigen levels or activity. However, recent studies have emerged to expand our understanding of FXI, demonstrating that activated FXI is able to activate coagulation factors FX, FV, and FVIII, and inhibit the anti-coagulant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). Understanding these activities of FXI may help to better diagnose which FXI-deficient patients are at risk for bleeding. In contrast to its mild hemostatic activities, FXI is known to play a significant role in thrombosis, as it is a demonstrated independent risk factor for deep vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction. Recent translational approaches have begun testing FXI as an antithrombotic, with one promising clinical study showing that an anti-sense oligonucleotide against FXI prevented venous thrombosis in elective knee surgery. A better understanding of the varied and complex role of FXI in both thrombosis and hemostasis will help to allow better prediction of bleeding risk in FXI-deficient patients and also informing the development of targeted agents to inhibit the thrombotic activities of FXI while preserving hemostasis.

### HIV replication alters the composition of extrinsic pathway coagulation factors and increases thrombin generation [^1129LMzR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Figure 2.
Schematic of the extrinsic pathway of coagulation represented in a mathematical model. The 2 pathways to initiate coagulation are shown: the primary extrinsic pathway (on the right), and the contact, intrinsic pathway (on the left). These multicomponent processes are illustrated as enzymes (open circles), inhibitors (hatched circles), zymogens (open boxes), or complexes (open ovals). The contact pathway has no known bleeding etiology associated with it and thus is considered accessory to hemostasis. The shaded area represents what kinetic reactions are included in our mathematical model. On injury to the vessel wall, tissue factor, the cofactor for the extrinsic tenase complex, is exposed to circulating factor VIIa and forms the extrinsic tenase complex. Factor IX and factor X are converted to their serine proteases, factor IXa (FIXa) and factor Xa (FXa), which then form the intrinsic tenase and the prothrombinase complexes, respectively — the combined actions of which lead to an explosive burst of the enzyme thrombin (IIa). In addition to its multiple procoagulant roles, thrombin also acts in an anticoagulant capacity when combined with the cofactor thrombomodulin in the protein Case complex. The protein Case reaction generates activated protein C (APC), which inactivates the cofactors factors Va and VIIIa, which then no longer support the respective procoagulant activities of the prothrombinase and intrinsic tenase complexes. The procoagulant response is also downregulated by the stoichiometric inhibitors tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and antithrombin (AT). AT directly inhibits thrombin, FIXa, and factor Xa. FPA indicates fibrinopeptide A; FPB, fibrinopeptide B; mz‐IIa, meizothrombin.

### Blood clotting and the pathogenesis of types I and II hereditary angioedema [^114CNuE7]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Activation of the plasma contact system can lead to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation and the formation of the inflammatory peptide bradykinin. While the contact system is immaterial for normal hemostasis, in vivo models show a central role for FXII in thrombosis. Inhibition or knocking out FXII can prevent thrombosis in these models, but whether this can be translated to humans is not yet clear. In comparison, the role of the contact system as the producer of bradykinin in hereditary angioedema has been proven in both in vivo models and patients. Nonetheless, coagulation, fibrinolysis, and bradykinin production seems to be intertwined in HAE, where D-Dimer levels correlate with disease activity. In this review we explored the molecular mechanism of contact system assembly and activation on the endothelial surface. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that bradykinin production may indirectly lead to the activation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation via activation of the bradykinin receptor of by activation of FIX by PKa. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility that bradykinin production can be facilitated/augmented by secretion of endothelial cell products such as HSP-90 or prolylcarboxypeptidase and that activation of FIX by PKa (bypassing FXI) is yet another contact activation-dependent pathway leading to thrombin formation.

Collectively, these mechanisms may explain the complicated blood clotting pathogenesis of bradykinin driven diseases such as seen in HAE.

### Identification of the factor XII contact activation site enables sensitive coagulation diagnostics [^113WTtM7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Contact activation refers to the process of surface-induced activation of factor XII (FXII), which initiates blood coagulation and is captured by the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay. Here, we show the mechanism and diagnostic implications of FXII contact activation. Screening of recombinant FXII mutants identified a continuous stretch of residues Gln317–Ser339 that was essential for FXII surface binding and activation, thrombin generation and coagulation. Peptides spanning these 23 residues competed with surface-induced FXII activation. Although FXII mutants lacking residues Gln317–Ser339 were susceptible to activation by plasmin and plasma kallikrein, they were ineffective in supporting arterial and venous thrombus formation in mice. Antibodies raised against the Gln317–Ser339 region induced FXII activation and triggered controllable contact activation in solution leading to thrombin generation by the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The antibody-activated aPTT allows for standardization of particulate aPTT reagents and for sensitive monitoring of coagulation factors VIII, IX, XI.

### Clinical and laboratory… [^113iWd5K]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

2 Facilitated by factor VIII–vWF, platelets adhere to the endothelial cells of the damaged vessel wall and, in response to the exposed subendothelial collagen, release adenosine diphosphate and thromboxane A 2. 3 The released ADP and thromboxane A 2 cause further platelet aggregation and the formation of a platelet plug that is responsible for primary hemostasis. 2, 3. Secondary hemostatic mechanisms consist of a series of sequential enzymatic reactions involving various coagulation factors and leading to the formation of a fibrin clot. The intrinsic pathway is activated by the exposed collagen, and the extrinsic pathway is activated by tissue thromboplastin.
3. In hemolytic-uremic syndrome, thrombocytopenia may result from platelet destruction, increased consumption of platelets, intrarenal aggregation of platelets, sequestration of platelets in the liver or spleen, or a combination of these factors.

8 The remaining platelets in the circulation appear to be "exhausted" and circulate in a degranulated form, depleted of nucleotide and granule contents. From a functional perspective, these platelets demonstrate a pattern characteristic of impaired aggregation. Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy is characterized by generalized activation of the plasma coagulation pathways within small blood vessels, with the formation of fibrin and the depletion of all coagulation factors and platelets. This disorder may result from overwhelming sepsis, incompatible blood transfusion, snake bite, giant hemangioma and malignancy. Children with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy are generally quite ill and may present with extensive purpuric lesions and petechiae, as well as multifocal hemorrhage. Congenital Etiologies. Glanzmann's thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by congenital deficiency in the platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb and IIIa.

9 The result is defective binding of platelet fibrinogen and a decrease in platelet aggregation with all stimulants except ristocetin. ACQUIRED CAUSES Acquired causes of vasculogenic purpura include Henoch-Schönlein purpura, infections, mechanical causes and psychogenic conditions. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an IgA-mediated systemic vasculitis of small blood vessels. The hallmarks are nonthrombocytopenic purpura, abdominal pain, arthritis and nephritis.

Coagulation and sepsis

Historically, two pathways describe the initiation of coagulation (figure 1). The intrinsic or contact pathway begins with the activation of coagulation factor XII; the extrinsic or tissue factor (TF) pathway begins with TF release usually after endothelial injury. In the common final pathway of coagulation, activated factors V and X, calcium, and prothrombin unite to generate thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin. In turn, fibrin activates platelets, which crosslink to augment clot strength. Altogether, these pathways constitute the 'coagulation cascade', and form the basis of hemostasis.

Figure 1
Alterations to the known coagulation cascade in severe sepsis. Factors highlighted in red indicate a downregulation, and green indicates an upregulation during sepsis. These alterations have been shown to persist during chronic critical illness.

Excessive thrombosis, on the other hand, is a process in which coagulation and platelet activation impede vascular blood flow, causing tissue malperfusion, ischemia, injury, and necrosis. Driven by an exaggerated systemic inflammatory response, numerous physiologic alterations favor thrombosis during sepsis (figure 1). There is upregulation of procoagulant pathways initiated by a surge of circulating TF, which interacts with inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Platelet activating factor accelerates thrombus formation through increased TF secretion and platelet and leukocyte adhesion, creating an activated surface for further thrombin propagation. The hypercoagulability of acute sepsis is further bolstered by an acute endotheliopathyand dampening of native anticoagulation mechanisms, including TF pathway inhibitor, activated protein C (APC), and antithrombin (AT). Finally, the rise in plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) and formation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor enhances clot firmness during acute sepsis. Altogether, the decreased native anticoagulation pathways, along with upregulation of factors that promote clot firmness, lead to an overall resistance to fibrinolysis.

GSC Produce all the Coagulation Factors of the Extrinsic and Intrinsic Cascades

We next investigated whether GSCs produce the coagulation factors of the extrinsic, and or intrinsic cascades. GSCs endogenously expressed the coagulation factors of the extrinsic coagulation cascade including tissue factor (TF) and factor Vll (FVll) at both the mRNA (Supplementary Figure S8a–b) and protein levels (Figure 4h–I, Supplementary Figure S9, Supplementary Figure S10). FVll was present in both its precursor form (FVII) and in its active, cleaved form (FVlla) (Supplementary Figure S10b).

GSCs also co-expressed FXll, FXl, and FlX, which comprise the entire intrinsic coagulation cascade, at the mRNA (Supplementary Figure S8c–e, respectfully) and protein levels (Figure 4j–l, Supplementary Figure S11, and Supplementary Figure S12, respectfully). FXll, FXl, and FlX were present in their active cleaved forms (Supplementary Figure S12a–c). Although GSCs are responsible for the treatment-resistant seen in GBM, we also confirmed expressed of all these coagulation factors in the differentiated form of these GSCs (DGCs) (Supplementary Figure S13). Collectively, these results show that GSCs inherently express the coagulation factors of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways, as well as the prothrombinase complex. The presence of these cascades serves as the basis for the unprecedented plasma-independent Flla generation and secretion that occurs in GSCs and provides the framework for a mechanism of GSC-induced platelet activation (Figure 4a).
