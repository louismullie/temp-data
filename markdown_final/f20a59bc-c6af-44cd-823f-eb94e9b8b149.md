## Question

On pelvic Examination of patient with vaginal candidiasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to perform and interpret the pelvic examination in suspected vulvovaginal candidiasis, including when to test, what to look for, how to confirm the diagnosis, and how to handle special scenarios like recurrent disease and pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why a pelvic exam is indicated. Then, I should verify the key elements of the history that shape pretest probability. Next, I will examine the external genitalia and speculum findings, followed by targeted office testing with pH, saline/KOH microscopy, and when to culture. After that, I need to interpret results and classify disease as uncomplicated versus complicated. Finally, I should consider special populations, documentation, and follow-up, making sure I double-check guideline concordance at each step.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the role of the pelvic examination. Vulvovaginal candidiasis typically presents with pruritus, soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal discharge, but none of these symptoms is pathognomonic, so I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions based on symptoms alone [^116q8d1D]. ACOG recommends a complete history and physical examination of the vulva and vagina for patients with vaginitis symptoms, and guidelines emphasize that history alone is insufficient for accurate diagnosis, reinforcing the need for exam plus objective testing rather than empiric treatment based on symptoms [^1154vk9y] [^115QbQcF].

> Wait, let me verify the key historical elements that raise or lower suspicion for VVC before I examine. I should ask about the character of discharge, intensity of itching, recent antibiotic use, diabetes or immunosuppression, pregnancy status, prior episodes, and sexual history to consider STIs, because these factors influence both the likelihood of VVC and whether the disease may be complicated or mixed [^115QbQcF] [^116q8d1D]. I need to check for red flags such as recurrent episodes, severe symptoms, or treatment failures that would push me toward culture and broader evaluation rather than relying solely on microscopy [^113sdd9D].

> Next, I will examine the external genitalia carefully. I should look for erythema, edema, excoriations, fissures, and satellite lesions, and I need to remember that the presence of inflammatory signs increases the likelihood of candidiasis, although signs alone are not definitive and must be integrated with testing [^113LrPTr]. Hold on, I should verify that I also inspect for alternative or coexisting pathology such as herpetic ulcers, warts, lichen sclerosus, or contact dermatitis that could mimic or complicate VVC, because missing these will derail management [^111T7j1U].

> Now, I will perform the speculum examination and assess the vagina and cervix. Let me consider the classic VVC discharge, which is typically thick, white, and curdy or cottage cheese–like, often adherent to the vaginal walls, and I should confirm that the vaginal mucosa looks erythematous and edematous when disease is present [^113sdd9D]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a fishy odor might support VVC, but that would be misleading; a positive whiff or fishy odor points toward bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis rather than candidiasis, so I should correct that assumption and use odor to help differentiate etiologies rather than to support VVC [^113LrPTr] [^1168cCT1].

> I should double-check the cervix for discharge characteristics and look for mucopurulent discharge or friability that would suggest cervicitis from gonorrhea or chlamydia, because coexisting STIs can coexist and alter management plans, and cervical motion tenderness on bimanual exam would raise concern for PID and warrant STI testing and treatment pathways [^117KAapd]. Let me verify that I also assess for atrophic changes in postmenopausal patients, since atrophic vaginitis can mimic or compound candidal symptoms and changes pH-based interpretation [^114f75g4].

> Next, I should review office-based diagnostic testing. I need to check vaginal pH because VVC typically has a normal pH less than or equal to 4.5, whereas an elevated pH greater than 4.5 suggests BV or trichomoniasis, though pH alone is nonspecific and must be interpreted with microscopy and clinical findings [^1168cCT1]. I will now examine a saline wet mount for epithelial cells, WBCs, clue cells, and motile trichomonads, and a KOH preparation to look for budding yeast, pseudohyphae, or hyphae, noting that KOH improves visualization by clearing cellular debris; I should confirm that guidelines recommend these point-of-care tests in the initial evaluation of vaginitis symptoms [^113t5FRM] [^114nfuvL]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions if microscopy is negative; sensitivity is limited, so in symptomatic patients with negative wet mount, I should consider culture, especially for recurrent or complicated disease or if non-albicans species are suspected [^117YDxta] [^113a5e7j].

> Let me think about how to interpret the findings and make the diagnosis. A diagnosis of VVC is supported when a symptomatic patient has a normal pH and microscopy shows yeast forms, or when culture or a validated commercial test is positive; I need to ensure I do not treat asymptomatic colonization, given that 10–20% of women harbor Candida without disease [^113sdd9D]. But wait, what if microscopy is negative and suspicion remains high? Then I should obtain yeast culture, because it remains the reference standard and can detect non-albicans species that are less readily visualized on wet mount, guiding therapy selection in refractory cases [^113FPMWu] [^112ter2e].

> I should confirm disease classification because it drives treatment. Uncomplicated VVC is sporadic, mild-to-moderate, likely C. albicans, and in immunocompetent women, whereas complicated VVC includes severe disease, recurrent episodes, non-albicans species, or host factors such as diabetes or immunosuppression; this distinction matters for regimen selection and follow-up intensity [^116q8d1D]. Hold on, I should verify that I plan broader diagnostics for complicated cases, including culture with speciation and, when available, molecular panels, to identify non-albicans species and coinfections that alter management [^113FPMWu].

> Next, I should review special populations and contexts. In pregnancy, I need to ensure topical azoles are preferred and avoid oral fluconazole, particularly in the first trimester, given fetal risk signals, and I should consider longer topical courses for persistent symptoms while confirming the diagnosis with microscopy or culture when needed [^114CjmaX]. In patients with HIV, let me verify that lower CD4 counts correlate with higher VVC rates and that management of acute episodes is the same, but suppressive strategies may be considered for recurrent disease, aligning with HIV-specific guidance [^115UiV8k] [^114CjmaX] [^112xeyZm]. For adolescents, I should confirm the opportunity for confidential history and tailor examination to minimize trauma, recognizing that speculum may be deferred when appropriate and that urine or self-collected swabs can substitute in selected cases, though a full pelvic exam is needed if PID is suspected [^114Vnx7S] [^1129nVbp].

> I need to ensure my documentation captures objective findings and test results. I should record the presence or absence of vulvar erythema, edema, excoriations, and fissures, describe the discharge characteristics, note pH, and report microscopy results clearly, including yeast morphology and whether pseudohyphae or hyphae were seen; if culture is sent, I should document the indication and follow-up plan for result-directed therapy [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that I also record any alternative diagnoses considered and any coinfections tested or treated to support continuity and quality metrics [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider common pitfalls and quality gaps so I do not replicate them. Underuse of pH testing and microscopy in routine care leads to frequent misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy; where available, validated molecular panels can improve sensitivity and reduce repeat visits, but I should balance this with the risk of detecting low-level colonization and avoid overtreatment in asymptomatic patients [^111ZASZa] [^112piRdS]. I should double-check that I do not rely on Pap test results to diagnose VVC, as ACOG advises confirming incidental Pap findings before treating, given poor diagnostic reliability of cytology for yeast [^115HuS86].

> Finally, I should confirm the follow-up plan. For uncomplicated VVC, clinical response is expected within a few days. Persistent or recurrent symptoms should prompt repeat examination, pH and microscopy, and culture with speciation to guide therapy, including consideration of non-albicans species and maintenance regimens for recurrent disease per guideline pathways [^113sdd9D] [^112Qp4CV]. I need to ensure patient education on avoiding irritants, reviewing diabetes control if relevant, and discussing sexual partner management, even though VVC is not considered sexually transmitted, to prevent delays in care and reduce unnecessary anxiety [^115QbQcF].

On pelvic examination of a patient with vaginal candidiasis, expect **erythema and edema of the vulva and vagina** [^111Qun81] with **thick, white, curdy discharge** adherent to the vaginal walls, and often vulvar excoriations or fissures from scratching [^117YDxta]. The vaginal pH is typically normal (** ≤ 4.5**) [^117YDxta], and KOH wet mount shows budding yeast or pseudohyphae [^117YDxta]. These findings, together with pruritus and irritation, are highly suggestive of candidiasis but should be confirmed with microscopy or culture [^117YDxta] [^113FPMWu].

---

## Key pelvic examination findings

### External genitalia (vulva)

- **Erythema**: Diffuse redness of the vulvar skin and mucosa, reflecting inflammation [^113sdd9D].

- **Edema**: Swelling of the vulvar tissues, often pronounced.

- **Excoriations**: Linear scratch marks or erosions from scratching due to pruritus [^117YDxta].

- **Fissures**: Small linear cracks, especially at the posterior fourchette, from scratching and friction [^111Qun81].

- **Satellite lesions**: Small erythematous papules or pustules beyond the main inflamed area, characteristic of candidiasis [^notfound].

---

### Vaginal mucosa

- **Erythema**: Diffuse redness of the vaginal mucosa, often with edema [^111Qun81].

- **Discharge**: Thick, white, curdy or cottage cheese-like discharge adherent to the vaginal walls; may be scant or abundant [^117YDxta].

- **Adherent plaques**: White, curdy patches that may be difficult to remove without gentle scraping [^notfound].

---

### Cervix

The cervix is typically **normal in appearance**, though it may appear mildly erythematous due to surrounding inflammation.

---

## Diagnostic tests and laboratory findings

### Vaginal pH measurement

A **normal pH** of ≤ 4.5 is expected, as VVC is associated with normal vaginal acidity [^117YDxta].

---

### Microscopic examination (wet mount)

On KOH preparation, **budding yeast or pseudohyphae** are seen — the microscopic hallmark of candidiasis [^117YDxta]. Saline preparation may show **budding yeast or pseudohyphae** but with less clarity than KOH [^117YDxta].

---

### Fungal culture

Culture is indicated for recurrent or complicated cases, for **species identification**, or when microscopy is negative but suspicion remains high [^113sdd9D] [^111x3dZw].

---

## Differential diagnosis

It is essential to differentiate VVC from other causes of vaginitis, including:

| **Condition** | **Discharge characteristics** | **Vaginal ph** | **Other findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Bacterial vaginosis | Thin, gray, homogeneous discharge | > 4.5 | Positive whiff test, clue cells [^11342oLa] |
| Trichomoniasis | Frothy, yellow-green discharge | > 4.5 | Motile trichomonads, cervical petechiae ("strawberry cervix") [^1168cCT1] |
| Atrophic vaginitis | Thin, clear or bloody discharge | > 4.5 | Pale, dry mucosa, loss of rugae [^notfound] |
| Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis | Purulent discharge | > 4.5 | Vaginal mucosal erythema, epithelial cell loss [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications of pelvic examination findings

Pelvic examination findings in VVC **guide diagnosis and management** by:

- **Confirming diagnosis**: Visualization of characteristic discharge and mucosal changes supports clinical diagnosis [^117YDxta].

- **Guiding treatment**: Identifying severity and extent of inflammation helps tailor antifungal therapy [^1157kAV5].

- **Identifying complications**: Excoriations or fissures indicate severe inflammation, necessitating careful management and follow-up [^notfound].

---

## Limitations of pelvic examination

While pelvic examination is valuable, it has limitations:

- **Subjectivity**: Clinical judgment varies among clinicians, potentially leading to misdiagnosis [^114dj9HN].

- **Coinfections**: Mixed infections may be missed without laboratory confirmation [^112piRdS].

- **Asymptomatic colonization**: Candida may be present without symptoms, requiring careful interpretation [^113sdd9D].

---

Pelvic examination in vaginal candidiasis typically reveals **erythema, edema, and thick white discharge** with possible excoriations or fissures, and a normal pH with yeast on microscopy supports the diagnosis [^113sdd9D]. These findings should be confirmed with **laboratory testing** to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment [^113FPMWu].

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are frequently encountered in clinical practice. Recent advances have furthered understanding of pathophysiology. Proper diagnosis, based on appropriate office and, in complicated cases, laboratory tests is the key to rational selection of therapy. For women who have routine uncomplicated episodes of VVC or BV, a variety of effective treatment options exists. Recurrent disease remains a challenge for these conditions but can often be managed successfully.

Vaginitis multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) — commercial panels intended for symptomatic women using a single self‑collected or clinician‑collected vaginal swab — are explicitly not intended for screening asymptomatic patients, not for prognostic purposes, and not for test‑of‑cure, and they have shown higher sensitivity and negative predictive value than clinician diagnosis or point‑of‑care tests (POCTs), with statistically higher overall percent agreement and greater sensitivity for detecting coinfections including bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Some tests detect coinfections among BV, VVC, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) as well as with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). Outcome data indicate that primary testing with NAATs yields fewer repeat visits, more directed therapy, and less overall cost than current standard‑of‑care point‑of‑care approaches.

Targeted evaluations and referrals in persons with HIV — All adult patients with CD4 count < 50 cells/μL, as well as infants and young children with profound immunodeficiency, should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a dilated funduscopic examination, and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy in untreated persons does not correlate with prognosis or disease progression; however, focal or rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy may require further evaluation, including biopsy, and if lymphadenopathy does not quickly resolve with initiation of ART, diagnostic studies should be pursued. Neurology and/or neuropsychology referral for assessment of neurocognitive disorders, dementia, and focal neuropathies may be indicated. Cervical motion and uterine or adnexal tenderness on bimanual pelvic examination suggest pelvic inflammatory disease and should prompt STI testing, and an anorectal examination is important to evaluate for anal warts, other STIs, and anal cancer, with age-appropriate screening for prostate abnormalities if assigned male at birth.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112xeyZm]. ClinicalInfo (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vulvovaginal candidiasis, more specifically with respect to patients with HIV (secondary prevention), HIV.gov 2025 guidelines recommend to initiate the following options for chronic suppressive therapy for VVC:

- fluconazole 150 mg PO once weekly

- oteseconazole 600 mg at day 1,450 mg at day 2 for treatment of the acute episode, followed by 150 mg once weekly starting at day 14 for 11 weeks

- fluconazole 150 mg at days 1, 4, and 7 for treatment of the acute episode, followed by oteseconazole 150 mg daily at days 14–20, followed by oteseconazole 150 mg once weekly starting at day 28 for 11 weeks

- ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID 1 day per month for 6 months.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) clinical manifestations include oropharyngeal candidiasis characterized by painless, creamy white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal surface, hard or soft palate, oropharyngeal mucosa, or tongue surface that can be easily scraped off; less commonly, erythematous patches without white plaques occur and angular cheilosis can be caused by Candida. Because a proportion of patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis also manifest esophageal involvement, clinicians should ascertain whether there are symptoms suggestive of esophageal disease in patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Esophageal candidiasis generally presents with retrosternal burning pain or discomfort along with odynophagia; occasionally esophageal candidiasis can be asymptomatic, and endoscopic examination reveals whitish plaques that on occasion may progress to superficial ulcerations with central or peripheral whitish exudates. In women with HIV infection, Candida vulvovaginitis usually presents with white adherent vaginal discharge associated with mucosal burning and itching of mild-to-moderate severity and sporadic recurrences; in women with advanced immunosuppression, episodes may be more severe and recur more frequently; and vulvovaginal candidiasis is less common than oropharyngeal candidiasis and when it occurs, it is uncommonly refractory to azole therapy unless caused by non-C. albicans species.

### Vulvovaginal-STI treatment guidelines… [^11342oLa]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH is common with BV or trichomoniasis. Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.

9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution. Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells, which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT or culture. Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis.

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered. Error processing SSI file.

### Diagnostic performance of an automated microscopy and pH test for diagnosis of vaginitis [^111ZASZa]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of the specific cause of vaginitis based on clinical presentation is limited, due to the similarity of symptoms and signs, such as itching, erythema, malodor, and vaginal discharge. Therefore, to obtain an accurate diagnosis additional procedures or diagnostic tests are required. Clinical guidelines suggest that pH and wet mount microscopy of fresh vaginal samples constitute the in-clinic standard practice for the diagnosis of vaginitis. However, the actual level of use of these two measures is low. Hillier et al. reported that among women with vulvovaginitis symptoms, microscopy was conducted in only 17.4% of 281 visits. An earlier study showed that microscopic assessment of vaginal discharge was not performed in 37% of 150 clinic visits, and 42% of 50 different physicians did not perform microscopy as part of the evaluation of vaginitis. Additionally, in > 90% of office visits, pH measurement of vaginal discharge was not performed. A review of 149,934 American patients' files found that over 60% did not include procedure codes for any form of vaginitis diagnostic testing. High rates of antifungal and antibacterial use were found, suggesting common empiric treatment, and likely over-prescription of antifungal and antibacterial medications. A study from the Netherlands found that only 16% (61/380) of GPs reported "always" or "often" using microscopy to diagnose vulvovaginal candidiasis, while only 7.9% (30/380) reported "always" or "often" using culture for the same purpose. Other reports found high levels of misdiagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), regardless of utilization of microscopy, suggesting inadequate use of microscopy as a possible explanation. Underutilization of these simple in-clinic tests often leads to inadequate treatment, with up to 47% of patients receiving one or more inappropriate prescriptions, as well as treatment without adequate evaluation in 54% of visits, implying appropriate treatment in fewer than half of the cases.

### Unusual case of intra-abdominal candidiasis following laparoscopic hysterectomy [^114y1txd]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Symptoms such as fever, chills, abdominal discomfort and investigations including raised inflammatory markers and white cell count are often milder in IAC than bacterial peritonitis. In this woman, her white cell count (5.15–8.7×10 9 /L; normal range 4.50–11.00) was not elevated throughout the ordeal. The C reactive protein was elevated but remained stable (244.9–365.5 mg/L; normal range 0.0–5.0 mg/L), which could be attributed to her recovery from recent surgery.

A diagnosis is made by observing yeast microscopically or having a positive culture for Candida from the peritoneal fluid aspirated under image guidance or intraoperatively. In this woman, blastoconidia with pseudohyphae seen on the Gram stain smear of the green fluid drained from the collection, and the presence of C. albicans from the fluid culture confirmed the diagnosis.

All patients should undergo source control interventions and receive antifungal treatment promptly. An early diagnosis with initiation of antifungal therapy and a carefully coordinated multidisciplinary team management have shown to improve survival in these patients. Treatment of IAC entails both drainage (surgically or percutaneously) and antifungal therapy (with echinocandin or fluconazole for minimum 2 weeks) until the abscess and all signs and symptoms of peritonitis are resolved. This will avoid complications such as bloodstream invasion with sepsis and abscess formation. There is evidence that percutaneous catheter drainage is more effective in eradicating an abscess, with a clinical improvement seen within 24–72 hours. Vergidis et al estimated the overall mortality ranged from 13% to 88%, and a recent French study also concluded that the overall mortality is ~40%.

Despite unexpected IAC, a prompt diagnosis with early involvement of a multidisciplinary team management involving the infectious disease team, microbiologist and the interventional radiologist was crucial in the effective management of this healthy woman who had undergone an uncomplicated routine hysterectomy. This led to an uneventful recovery in her.

Learning points

Avoid movement of specimen from the vagina to the abdominal cavity to minimise ascending infection during transvaginal retrieval of specimen.
Presence of green intra-abdominal fluid postoperatively in an otherwise well patient must raise a high clinical suspicion for intra-abdominal candidiasis (IAC) after ruling out gastrointestinal tract injuries.
IAC can occur in a patient who is not immunocompromised.
Preoperatively, if there is a history of recurrent vaginal infections or evidence of vaginal discharge, a screening test should be done to exclude lower genital tract infection prior to surgery.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^116ihMK7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Between 6 and 10 million health care visits in the United States by women are related to symptoms of vaginitis. The most common causes are bacterial vaginosis (40–50% of cases), vulvovaginal candidiasis (20–25% of cases), and trichomoniasis (15–20% of cases). The laboratory reference gold standards for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (Gram staining in combination with Nugent criteria scoring)and vulvovaginal candidiasis (culture)are time-consuming, involve a delayed time-to-result, and are not widely available in most clinical settings. Recent Centers for Disease Control guidelines state that nucleic acid amplification tests have a high sensitivity for detection of Trichomonas vaginalis, compared with wet mount microscopy. Diagnosis of vaginitis typically involves clinical findings, medical history, and in-clinic testing — with the latter representing the most essential component. In-clinic testing for bacterial vaginosis relies on Amsel's criteria (vaginal discharge, clue cells, positive whiff test, and a vaginal pH greater than 4.5). Wet mount microscopy is used for detection of clue cells; budding yeast or pseudohyphae, indicative of vulvovaginal candidiasis; and visualization of motile trichomonads, indicative of T vaginalis.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: a review of the evidence for the 2021 centers for disease control and prevention of sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^114CjmaX]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vulvovaginal itching and discharge. This article discusses the latest CDC STI Treatment Guidelines for VVC.

Methods

A literature search of relevant topics was performed, and a team of experts was convened to discuss (1) diagnosis/testing modalities; treatment of (2) uncomplicated VVC, (3) complicated VVC, and (4) VVC caused by non-albicans yeast; (5) alternative treatment regimens; (6) susceptibility testing of yeast; Special Populations: (7) pregnancy and (8) HIV and VVC.

Results

Yeast culture remains the gold standard for diagnoses. Newer molecular assays have been developed for the diagnosis of VVC and perform well. Azole antifungals remain the treatment of choice for uncomplicated VVC. Two new drugs, TOL-463 and recently FDA-approved ibrexafungerp, appeared promising in clinical trials. For recurrent VVC, oteseconazole, not yet commercially available, may represent a new option. For non-albicans yeast infections in symptomatic patients, boric acid appears useful. No evidence supports the use of alternative treatments, including probiotics. Fluconazole during pregnancy may be associated with spontaneous abortion and craniofacial and heart defects. In women with HIV infection, lower CD4+ T-cell counts are associated with increased rates of VVC, and VVC is associated with increased viral shedding. Treatment measures in women with HIV infection are identical to those women without HIV infection.

Conclusions

There has been significant new knowledge generated about VVC since the 2015 CDC Guidelines which have led to changing recommendations.

### Vulvodynia is not created equally: empirical classification of women with vulvodynia [^1115AYE3]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Subjects

The primary criterion for entry into the NVR included vaginal or vulvar pain of at least 3 months in duration, severe enough to impair sexual activity and/or quality of life. Participants were screened with a previously validated Harlow's Questionnaireand clinical examination. Harlow's Questionnaire is a 4-item screening measure that assesses the presence of vulvar pain, its duration, the quality of the pain experienced, and if the symptoms are provoked with contact to the vulvar region. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant, if they were younger than 20 years, or if they were found to have obvious pathology such as acute vaginitis (yeast, bacterial vaginosis, or sexually transmitted infections), dermatoses, neoplasia, or pelvic masses. Women were excluded if they were younger than 20 years because the resources needed to address the following issues were unavailable: 1) asking minors to provide consent; 2) answering sensitive questions related to sexual function, and 3) having a parent present during a pelvic examination if the patient is a minor. Women with a history of reproductive tract malignancy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy were also excluded.

### "What's really going on down there? " A practical approach to the adolescent who has gynecologic complaints [^113EGHVs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to review the common complaints related to the vaginal area in pubertal girls and offer an approach to those presenting with nonurologic perineal problems or issues related to emerging sexuality. Included is a discussion of the symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of physiologic discharge, vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Other vulvovaginal complaints are considered, and screening tests that can help differentiate the origin of the problem as urologic or gynecologic are briefly addressed.

### Incidence of abnormal findings during pelvic examinations in women aged 21–35 years [^111rTj3u]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

To describe the incidence of abnormal gynecologic examination findings in asymptomatic compared with symptomatic patients during preventive visits, we conducted a retrospective study of 1,121 visits for patients between the ages of 21 and 35 years from January 2017 to March 2017. Only 1.2% (95% CI, 0.5%,1.9%) of asymptomatic patients had abnormal findings on pelvic examination, compared with 32.4% (95% CI, 27.0%, 37.8%) of those with symptoms (P ≤ .001). In symptomatic patients, the most common symptoms were vaginal discharge (25.1%), pelvic pain (16.4%), and vaginal bleeding (15.7%). In asymptomatic patients, the most common findings were bacterial vaginosis and Candida infection. Asymptomatic patients presenting for a routine preventive visit have low rates of abnormalities detected on examination, and routine pelvic examinations should be re-considered.

### Vaginitis [^1139Lyf3]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis are the most common infectious causes of vaginitis. Bacterial vaginosis occurs when the normal lactobacilli of the vagina are replaced by mostly anaerobic bacteria. Diagnosis is commonly made using the Amsel criteria, which include vaginal pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, milky discharge, and the presence of clue cells on microscopic examination of vaginal fluid. Oral and topical clindamycin and metronidazole are equally effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis. Symptoms and signs of trichomoniasis are not specific; diagnosis by microscopy is more reliable. Features of trichomoniasis are trichomonads seen microscopically in saline, more leukocytes than epithelial cells, positive whiff test, and vaginal pH greater than 5.4. Any nitroimidazole drug (e.g., metronidazole) given orally as a single dose or over a longer period resolves 90 percent of trichomoniasis cases. Sex partners should be treated simultaneously. Most patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis are diagnosed by the presence of vulvar inflammation plus vaginal discharge or with microscopic examination of vaginal secretions in 10 percent potassium hydroxide solution. Vaginal pH is usually normal (4.0 to 4.5). Vulvovaginal candidiasis should be treated with one of many topical or oral antifungals, which appear to be equally effective. Rapid point-of-care tests are available to aid in accurate diagnosis of infectious vaginitis. Atrophic vaginitis, a form of vaginitis caused by estrogen deficiency, produces symptoms of vaginal dryness, itching, irritation, discharge, and dyspareunia. Both systemic and topical estrogen treatments are effective. Allergic and irritant contact forms of vaginitis can also occur.

### Incident and persistent vulvovaginal candidiasis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women: risk factors and severity [^115UiV8k]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine risk factors for vulvovaginal candidiasis among women with or at risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Methods

Data were from 856 HIV-infected women and 421 at-risk uninfected women observed semiannually at four study sites from April 1993 through February 1999. At enrollment women were 15–55 years old and had no acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions. Three definitions for vulvovaginal candidiasis of differing severity were constructed using data from vaginal Candida culture and Gram stains scored for yeast and three signs on pelvic examination (vulvovaginal edema, erythema, or discharge): 1) culture or Gram stain positivity plus at least one clinical sign, 2) culture or Gram stain positivity plus at least two clinical signs, and 3) visible yeast on Gram stain plus at least one clinical sign.

Results

The prevalence and cumulative incidence of each definition of vulvovaginal candidiasis were greater among HIV-infected women than among women not infected with HIV (P < .01 for all comparisons). Stratified by status at the preceding visit, vulvovaginal candidiasis was most likely among women with prior vulvovaginal candidiasis, least likely among women without earlier Candida colonization, and intermediately likely among women with preceding subclinical Candida colonization. Among HIV-infected women, lower CD4 count and higher HIV viral load were associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Several other factors were independently associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis, with strong associations for diabetes mellitus and pregnancy in particular. Vulvovaginal candidiasis was not more severe among HIV-infected women.

Conclusion

Vulvovaginal candidiasis occurred with higher incidence and greater persistence, but not greater severity, among HIV-infected women.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis as a chronic disease: diagnostic criteria and definition [^112tCDko]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Although recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is defined as 4 or more discrete attacks of vulvovaginal candidiasis per year, there is no diagnostic nomenclature or definition for the many women who are chronically symptomatic. This study aims to establish and propose a definition and a set of diagnostic criteria, which would enable clinicians to promptly identify and treat women with chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis (CVVC).

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

Public and private vulvar dermatology outpatient clinics in Sydney, Australia.

Participants

Data were obtained prospectively from 50 women with presumptive CVVC and 42 controls. Historical and clinical features of CVVC identified by expert consensus were compared between the 2 groups. Diagnostic criteria were then prospectively applied to a further 163 patients to verify their accuracy.

Outcome Measures

Signs and symptoms diagnostic of CVVC.

Results

The following characteristics were found to be significantly more common in women with CVVC compared to controls (p ≤ .001): a history of positive vaginal Candida swab, discharge, dyspareunia, soreness, swelling, cyclicity, and exacerbation of symptoms with antibiotics.

Conclusions

We propose that CVVC can be confidently diagnosed using the major criteria of a chronic nonspecific and nonerosive vulvovaginitis that includes at least 5 or more properties from the following criteria: soreness, dyspareunia, positive vaginal swab either at presentation or in the past, previous response to antifungal medication, exacerbation with antibiotics, cyclicity, swelling, and discharge. This condition responds reliably to oral antifungal medication.

### The vaginal microbiome: III. the vaginal microbiome in various urogenital disorders [^116FTsU5]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Urogenital symptoms, such as dysuria, discharge, odor, and itching, are major health problems worldwide, often related to microbial pathogenicity or imbalance. Better understanding of the factors that affect the composition and dynamics of the vaginal microbial communities in health and disease may allow development of useful diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies. Over the past decades, research provided insights into the role of microbial communities inhabiting the vagina. The focus of most of these studies remains the bacterial portion of the vaginal microbiota. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, causes of vaginitis and vulvovaginal complaints are often fungal (i.e. candidiasis), viral (i.e. human papillomavirus [HPV] and herpes), or protozoal (i.e. trichomoniasis).

Most of our knowledge regarding fungi in women's genital tract comes from culture-based studies and characterization of single organisms. The vaginal mycobiome (defined as the fungal communities within the microbiome) is an evolving field of study, as genomics tools are increasingly used. An improved understanding of the role fungal communities have in human health and disease, as well as the interactions between Candida species, bacteria, and other microorganisms in the vagina, is fundamental to our characterization of the vaginal microbiome (VMB).

Microbiome characterization using molecular techniques also expanded our knowledge regarding the urinary bladder, which was considered a sterile organ until recently. In this review, we discuss the urine microbiome and the mechanisms by which VMB can impact the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI).

The idea that a dysbiotic VMB participates in transmission of HIV, other sexually transmitted infections (STIs; trichomonal, gonococcal, and chlamydial infections) and its potential role in HPV infection, is also described. Finally, we discuss the putative role of the VMB in vulvodynia.

### Evaluation of vaginal complaints [^113LrPTr]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Vaginal symptoms are one of the most common reasons for gynecological consultation. Clinicians have traditionally diagnosed vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis using some combination of physical examination, pH, the wet mount, and the whiff test.

Objectives

To evaluate the role of the clinical examination and determine the positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs) for the diagnosis of vaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal trichomoniasis.

Data Sources

Using a structured literature review, we abstracted information on sensitivity and specificity for symptoms, signs, and office laboratory procedures. We chose published (1966 to April 2003) articles that appeared in the MEDLINE database and were indexed under the combined search terms of diagnosis with vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, and trichomoniasis.

Study Selection

Included studies of symptomatic premenopausal women seen in primary care settings. Tests were evaluated only if they would provide diagnostic information during the office visit and were compared with an acceptable criterion standard.

Data Extraction

All 3 authors extracted the data and computed sensitivity and specificity from each article independently. The absence of standard definitions for symptoms and signs made it impossible to combine results across studies.

Data Synthesis

Symptoms alone do not allow clinicians to distinguish confidently between the causes of vaginitis. However, a patient's lack of itching makes candidiasis less likely (range of LRs, 0.18 [95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05–0.70] to 0.79 [95% CI, 0.72–0.87]) and lack of perceived odor makes bacterial vaginosis unlikely (LR, 0.07 [95% CI, 0.01–0.51]). Similarly, physical examination signs are limited in their diagnostic power. The presence of inflammatory signs is associated with candidiasis (range of LRs, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.5–2.8] to 8.4 [95% CI, 2.3–31]). Presence of a "high cheese" odor on examination is predictive of bacterial vaginosis (LR, 3.2 [95% CI, 2.1–4.7]) while lack of odor is associated with candidiasis (LR, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.4–5.0]). Office laboratory tests, particularly microscopy of vaginal discharge, are the most useful way of diagnosing these 3 conditions.

Conclusions

The cause of vaginal complaints may be easily diagnosed when typical findings appear in microscopy. However, the poor performance of individual symptoms, signs, and office laboratory tests often makes it problematic to identify the cause of vaginal symptoms.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^116upMax]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The results of the present study suggest that the current approach to management of vaginal discharge provides suboptimal care. Significant time burdens placed on primary care providers and the time and effort necessary to perform inexpensive point-of-care tests are likely balanced against other competing priorities. Different models of care may be warranted for women having vaginal discharge syndromes. This requires a combination of sensitive and specific laboratory testing as well as careful patient evaluation and clinical acumen to accurately diagnose women presenting with symptoms of vaginitis. One approach could be to ask women who contact a clinician's office with vaginal symptoms to provide self-collected vaginal swab samples, which have been proven to be equivalent to clinician-collected samples, for testing. Prescriptions could be written to cover the specific pathogens identified and women having no infectious etiology identified could be counseled that no antifungal or antibiotic therapy is warranted. The excess healthcare costs associated with empiric treatment deserves further study.

Vaginitis and vaginosis diagnostics — bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) together account for about 90% of vaginitis; Nugent Gram stain yields indeterminate results 25%–30% with initial smear interpretation and is a high complexity test; G. vaginalis cultures are not recommended as 55% of women without BV harbor this organism; the Affirm VP III, which detects only G. vaginalis as the determinant for BV, has very poor specificity, and although sensitivity for VVC of the Affirm VP III is adequate compared to culture, lack of tests for TV ranges from 63% to 100% compared to the SOC NAAT; components used to meet Amsel's criteria have been documented to be rarely performed at the point of care (only 1 in 5 providers), multiple publications document unacceptable poor performance of these POCTs by providers lacking both sensitivity and specificity, and the overall result is nearly 50% of women being incorrectly treated; for VVC and TV, diagnosis can be made when pseudohyphae in a saline wet mount with KOH or motile trichomonads are visualized, though consistent microscopic exam of vaginal specimens and interpretation are difficult for many laboratories relative to culture and NAAT.

Study Assessments

Vulvovaginal samples were assessed locally using 10% KOH at screening, and fungal cultures were assessed by a central laboratory at baseline, TOC visit (day 11 ± 3), and if symptoms were present at FU visit (day 25 ± 4). Susceptibility testing was performed per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute M27-A3 guidelines. Samples were also tested at screening to determine vaginal pH and to identify other possible pathogens. Vulvovaginal signs (edema, erythema, and excoriation/fissures) and symptoms (burning, itching, and irritation) were rated using the VSS scale at screening, day 1, and TOC and FU visits. The VSS scale is a standardized, predefined scale for which each sign and symptom was given a numerical rating based on severity (absent = 0; mild = 1; moderate = 2; severe = 3) to calculate a total composite score (range, 0–18). Patients recorded vulvovaginal symptoms in a diary on days 1 to TOC visit. If the patient experienced persistence, worsening, or recurrence of symptoms (eg, symptoms ≥ 3) then rescue antifungal therapy was allowed following vaginal examination with samples for KOH and culture. VSS ratings leading to rescue therapy were recorded, and vulvovaginal samples were obtained for testing. If rescue medication was administered before or at the TOC visit, the patient was considered an early termination due to lack of efficacy. If rescue medication was administered after the TOC visit but before the FU visit, then the patient was considered an early termination due to lack of efficacy after the TOC visit. Safety assessments included physical exams, vital signs, laboratory tests, and vitals at screening and TOC visit, and continuous AEs monitoring throughout the study.

For uncomplicated Candida vulvovaginitis, a single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For severe acute Candida vulvovaginitis, fluconazole, 150 mg, given every 72 hours for a total of 2 or 3 doses, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). For C. glabrata vulvovaginitis unresponsive to oral azoles, topical intravaginal boric acid, 600 mg daily, for 14 days is an alternative (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), nystatin intravaginal suppositories, 100 000 units daily for 14 days (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence), or topical 17% flucytosine cream alone or with 3% AmB cream administered daily for 14 days (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

### Visual improvements in vaginal mucosa correlate with symptoms of VVA: data from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114f75g4]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Clinically, a variety of objective and subjective tools are available to practitioners to determine the extent of VVA in postmenopausal women, based mostly on patient history and/or physical examination. - The most common objective measures used to assess VVA include measuring vaginal pHand vaginal maturation index (VMI). A vaginal pH ≤ 4.5 is considered normal, whereas a pH ≥ 4.6 is supportive of VVA, as long as the patient does not have bacterial vaginosis. Superficial cells above 15% on a vaginal smear is considered normal, whereas ≤ 5% is typical for postmenopausal women with VVA. Whereas VMI is the standard for VVA confirmation, it is generally not used in clinical practice, because vaginal cytological smears need to be collected and sent for analysis.

Symptoms of VVA can be subjectively assessed using patient questionnaires evaluating the severity of symptoms, such as dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, soreness, irritation, or discharge. These are reflected in quality-of-life measures. VVA can also be objectively measured with a visual examination of the vagina using assessment tools such as the Vaginal Atrophy Index (VAI), the Genital Health Clinical Evaluation (GHCE), the Vaginal Physical Examination Scale, the Vaginal Health Index (VHI), or the Global Atrophy Score. However, no clear consensus has been reached as to which tool is best when visually evaluating VVA. An accepted method of visually assessing the vagina of postmenopausal women could aid clinicians in opening dialog about VVA with their patients, accurately diagnosing VVA, and ultimately determining their patients' optimal treatment and response to treatment.

Study Population

Healthy, nonpregnant female participants aged ≥ 18 years and < 65 years with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic acute VVC were enrolled in the study. Participants had a positive baseline potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount from a vaginal smear revealing filamentous hyphae/pseudohyphae or budding yeast cells, presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal sign, presence of ≥ 1 vulvovaginal symptom, and a composite severity score of ≥ 6. Vaginal swabs were obtained at the screening visit and at subsequent study visits. Candida species were characterized and stored frozen for susceptibility testing at study completion. Inclusion criteria required participants to present with a clinical diagnosis of acute VVC and did not differentiate between acute and recurrent VVC participants.

Participants did not have any clinically significant major organ system disease or infection (with the exception of VVC) and were not taking concomitant medications that would have interfered with study assessments.

Participants completed a review of pertinent medical history, vital signs, and body measurements; a symptom/sign evaluation; a physical examination including speculum examination of the vagina; and a KOH wet mount test from a vaginal smear.

INTRODUCTION

Vaginitis is responsible for as many as 50% of all gynecologic visits in the United States and represents a major contributor to health care expenses. Infectious vaginitis due to bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), and trichomoniasis accounts for up to 90% of these cases. Unlike trichomoniasis, both BV and VVC are attributable to several pathogens. For VVC, overgrowth ofis predominant, although other Candida species, including, may contribute as well. BV is harder to diagnose because the pathogenesis involves decreased levels of Lactobacillus bacteria concomitant with increased concentrations of BV-associated bacteria, such as, Mobiluncus spp. and.

Various diagnostic methods are available to identify the underlying cause of vaginitis. In the clinician's office, a combination of pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of fresh samples of vaginal discharge are routinely used, despite their relatively poor performance. For BV, diagnosis often relies on the use of either clinical Amsel criteria or Gram stain and Nugent score (considered the gold standard laboratory method for diagnosis of BV). Examination of wet mounts with KOH preparation and/or vaginal cultures for Candida are the most common diagnostic tools for VVC. Highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are recommended for detecting, but examination of wet-mount preparations is still commonly used in clinical practice. However, several barriers are associated with the use of nonmolecular methods, including lack of equipment in the clinic, subjectivity of the clinical endpoints used and inconsistent employment between practitioners, lack of proper training in microscopy, and overall poor sensitivity of the tests. Diagnosis of the underlying cause of vaginitis is further complicated by the common symptomatology reported for BV, VVC, and trichomoniasis; the incidence of mixed infections or coinfections; and the recurrence of vaginal symptoms.

Taken together, these barriers result in many women being misdiagnosed based on nonspecific observations, leading to incorrect, misguided, or prolonged treatment. This article reports the results from the clinical validation of two newly developed U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared NAATs for the detection of infectious vaginitis. The study also compares the investigational-assay results, in-clinic testing results, and clinicians' diagnoses to reference methods for BV, the Candida species group, and.

Despite therapeutic advances, vulvovaginal candidosis remains a common problem worldwide, affecting all strata of society. Understanding of anti-candida host defence mechanisms in the vagina has developed slowly and, despite a growing list of recognised risk factors, a fundamental grasp of pathogenic mechanisms continues to elude us. The absence of rapid, simple, and inexpensive diagnostic tests continues to result in both overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of vulvovaginal candidosis. I review the epidemiology and pathogenesis of this infection, and also discuss management strategies.

METHODS

Study Design and Patients

Enrolled patients were ≥ 18 years of age with a diagnosis of symptomatic moderate-to-severe acute VVC determined by a vulvovaginal signs and symptoms (VSS) score of ≥ 7. Other eligibility criteria included a positive microscopic examination with 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) in a vaginal sample revealing yeast forms (hyphae/pseudohyphae) or budding yeasts and a vaginal pH of ≤ 4.5. Exclusion criteria included patients with any vaginal condition that would interfere with the diagnosis and evaluation of VVC (suspected or concurrent causes of vulvovaginitis and/or cervicitis including bacterial vaginosis, Trichomonas, active herpes virus or human papillomavirus infection, positive tests for Neisseria gonorrheae or Chlamydia trachomatis, or other mixed infections), the use of antifungal treatments (topical or systemic) within 28 days of baseline visit, vaginal contraceptives, use of CYP3A4/3A5 inducers and strong time-dependent CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors 14 days before enrollment and during treatment, strong or moderate reversible CYP3A4/3A5 inhibitors including azoles or grapefruit juice 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, select CYP2C8 substrates (ie, amiodarone, amodiaquine, paclitaxel, repaglinide, montelukast, pioglitazone, and rosiglitazone) within 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, or select P-gp substrates (ie, digoxin, colchicine) 48 hours before enrollment and during treatment, patients menstruating at the baseline visit, patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, active cervical or vaginal cancer, and patients who were pregnant. This study was conducted in accordance with the general principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Each study site obtained institution review board approval for the protocol, informed consent form, recruitment flyers, and other written information before study initiation.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis-STI treatment guidelines… [^113sdd9D]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. Uncomplicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Diagnostic Considerations A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors.

The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. Complicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Diagnostic Considerations Vaginal culture or PCR should be obtained from women with complicated VVC to confirm clinical diagnosis and identify non– albicans Candida. Candida glabrata does not form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized on microscopy.

C. albicans azole resistance is becoming more common in vaginal isolates, and non– albicans Candida is intrinsically resistant to azoles; therefore, culture and susceptibility testing should be considered for patients who remain symptomatic. Non– albicans Vulvovaginal Candidiasis Because approximately 50% of women with a positive culture for non–.

### The diagnosis and treatment of infectious vaginitis [^115KpjM6]. Dermatologic Therapy (2004). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the vagina as a result of infectious agents is very common, both as an overgrowth of normal or common colonizers, or as a frank infection. The most common causes of infectious vaginitis are yeast, bacteria, protozoa, viruses, and parasites. Infections of the vagina produce an increase in vaginal secretion, vulvar symptoms of itching or irritation from contact with irritating vaginal fluid, and sometimes odor. A careful microscopic examination of vaginal secretions generally yields the correct diagnosis, but atypical or recalcitrant disease deserves a confirmatory culture, as noninfectious inflammatory processes can produce similar symptoms.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112LEkkc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, the diagnosis of vaginitis has been inaccurate. – Wet mount microscopy has very low sensitivity for all three causes of vaginitis. Availability of a microscope, appropriate training, and certification (eg, Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments)are required to perform microscopy in the clinic setting and to accurately identify the correct causes of vaginitis. Non–microscopy-based diagnostic criteria, with either low sensitivity (eg, vaginal discharge, whiff test) or low specificity (eg, vaginal pH), thus, do not consistently facilitate the appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Women who receive empiric treatment for vaginitis, without a known etiology, are more likely to return for a physician visit within 90 days.

New technologies, using molecular (DNA) targets that identify the etiologic factors for vaginitis, have recently been developed to address some limitations associated with onsite testing during clinical visits. Nucleic acid amplification tests can achieve both high sensitivity and specificity for detection of the three main infectious causes of vaginitis. In a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study, the BD MAX Vaginal Panel demonstrated higher sensitivity for detection compared with Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis, and compared with wet mount microscopy for vulvovaginal candidiasis and T vaginalis, while maintaining a comparable specificity. This work suggests that nucleic acid amplification tests are a diagnostic improvement over the traditional clinical algorithms largely used in settings such as primary care physician offices. The objective of this study was to determine the agreement of clinical diagnosis (standard of care) with a vaginal panel assay for diagnosis of vaginitis in a real-world setting.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^1168cCT1]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Multiple diagnostic methods are available for identifying the etiology of vaginal symptoms. Clinical laboratory testing can identify the vaginitis cause in the majority of women and is discussed in detail in the sections of this report dedicated to each condition. In the clinician's office, the cause of vaginal symptoms can often be determined by pH, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) test, and microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh samples of vaginal discharge. The pH of the vaginal secretions can be measured by pH paper; an elevated pH (i.e. > 4.5) is common with BV or trichomoniasis (although trichomoniasis can also be present with a normal vaginal pH). Because pH testing is not highly specific, vaginal discharge should be further examined microscopically by first diluting one sample in 1 or 2 drops of 0.9% normal saline solution on one slide and a second sample in 10% KOH solution (samples that emit an amine odor immediately upon application of KOH suggest BV or trichomoniasis). Coverslips are then placed on the slides, and they are examined under a microscope at low and high power. The saline-solution specimen might display motile trichomonads or clue cells (i.e. epithelial cells with borders obscured by small anaerobic bacteria), which are characteristic of BV. The KOH specimen typically is used to identify hyphae or blastospores observed with candidiasis. However, absence of trichomonads in saline or fungal elements in KOH samples does not rule out these infections because the sensitivity of microscopy is approximately 50% compared with NAAT (trichomoniasis) or culture (yeast). Presence of WBCs without evidence of trichomonads or yeast might also indicate cervicitis (see Cervicitis).

In settings where pH paper, KOH, and microscopy are unavailable, a broad range of clinical laboratory tests, described in the diagnosis section for each disease, can be used. Presence of objective signs of vulvovaginal inflammation in the absence of vaginal pathogens after laboratory testing indicates the possibility of mechanical, chemical, allergic, or other noninfectious causes of vulvovaginal signs or symptoms. For women with persistent symptoms and no clear etiology, referral to a specialist should be considered.

### Management of vaginitis [^111x3dZw]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Common infectious forms of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Vaginitis also can occur because of atrophic changes. Bacterial vaginosis is caused by proliferation of Gardnerella vaginalis, Mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. The diagnosis is based primarily on the Amsel criteria (milky discharge, pH greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells in a wet-mount preparation). The standard treatment is oral metronidazole in a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for seven days. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be difficult to diagnose because characteristic signs and symptoms (thick, white discharge, dysuria, vulvovaginal pruritus and swelling) are not specific for the infection. Diagnosis should rely on microscopic examination of a sample from the lateral vaginal wall (10 to 20 percent potassium hydroxide preparation). Cultures are helpful in women with recurrent or complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, because species other than Candida albicans (e.g. Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis) may be present. Topical azole and oral fluconazole are equally efficacious in the management of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, but a more extensive regimen may be required for complicated infections. Trichomoniasis may cause a foul-smelling, frothy discharge and, in most affected women, vaginal inflammatory changes. Culture and DNA probe testing are useful in diagnosing the infection; examinations of wet-mount preparations have a high false-negative rate. The standard treatment for trichomoniasis is a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. Atrophic vaginitis results from estrogen deficiency. Treatment with topical estrogen is effective.

### The vaginal microbiome: III. the vaginal microbiome in various urogenital disorders [^114dhefZ]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This series of articles, titled The Vaginal Microbiome (VMB), written on behalf of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease, aims to summarize the recent findings and understanding of the vaginal bacterial microbiota, mainly regarding areas relevant to clinicians specializing in vulvovaginal disorders.

Materials and Methods

A search of PubMed database was performed, using the search terms "vaginal microbiome" with " Candida", "vaginitis", "urinary microbiome", "recurrent urinary tract infections", "sexually transmitted infections", "human immunodeficiency virus", "human papillomavirus", "nonspecific vaginitis", "vulvodynia", and "vulvovaginal symptoms". Full article texts were reviewed. Reference lists were screened for additional articles. The third article in this series describes VMB in various urogenital disorders.

Results

Variable patterns of the VMB are found in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, challenging the idea of a protective role of lactobacilli. Highly similar strains of health-associated commensal bacteria are shared in both the bladder and vagina of the same individual and may provide protection against urinary tract infections. Dysbiotic VMB increases the risk of urinary tract infection. Loss of vaginal lactic acid–producing bacteria combined with elevated pH, increase the risk for sexually transmitted infections, although the exact protective mechanisms of the VMB against sexually transmitted infections are still unknown.

Conclusions

The VMB may constitute a biological barrier to pathogenic microorganisms. When the predominance of lactobacilli community is disrupted, there is an increased risk for the acquisition of various vaginal pathogents. Longitudinal studies are needed to describe the association between the host, bacterial, and fungal components of the VMB.

### Diagnosis and treatment of vaginal discharge syndromes in community practice settings [^1176CAmG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

(.)

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) infection, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) are common in women of reproductive age. The prevalence of BV and TV in the United States (US) is 29% and 3%, respectively, but can vary depending on the study population. Adverse sequelae associated with BV and TV include increased acquisition of sexually transmitted infections including human immunodeficiency virus, and pregnancy complications including preterm birth. While the prevalence of VVC cases is unknown, 20% of women are colonized by Candida species in the absence of signs and/or symptoms, and 70% are colonized over a year. Approximately 75% of women will experience at least 1 episode of VVC infection requiring treatment during their lifetimes.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines describe the point-of-care tests that can be performed as an adjunct to a clinical history and physical examination to support diagnosis of vaginal discharge syndromes (those not characterized by vulvodynia and noninfectious causes of vaginal symptoms). These tests include measurement of vaginal pH, "whiff" test (addition of potassium hydroxide [KOH] to vaginal fluid for assessment of amine odor), and microscopic examination of fresh samples of the discharge to identify presence of clue cells, motile trichomonads, and/or budding yeast/pseudohyphae. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopic detection of clue cells, yeast, and trichomonads by clinicians can vary considerably. Despite these limitations, the low cost and convenience of point-of-care testing have contributed to their continued use. In a variety of studies, laboratory testing (Nugent score, yeast culture, US Food and Drug Administration [FDA]–approved and independent molecular assays) performed better than clinician-diagnosed vaginitis. CDC guidelines recommend use of alternative commercially available point-of-care tests or clinical laboratory testing in settings where pH paper, KOH, and wet prep evaluation by microscopy are not available.

The primary objective of this study was to assess how women with vaginal discharge syndromes were being evaluated in community practice settings and to assess the appropriateness of the treatments prescribed for BV, TV, and VVC. A second objective was to assess how often women returned for symptoms of vaginitis in the 90 days following treatment and to assess whether the provision of appropriate treatment was related to return office visits for vaginitis symptoms.

### Use of intravaginal cooling to provide symptom relief in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis and reduce immunopathology in an accompanying mouse model [^112gBJEn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Despite the long-standing use of antifungal drugs for VVC and RVVC, current therapies often fail to provide complete cure or long-term relief. This shortcoming has led to considerable challenges for affected women, including increased healthcare burdens and reduced quality of life. This study had 2 main objectives: (1) to conduct a pilot clinical trial using the Vlisse device to treat VVC and (2) to establish proof of principle for the cooling therapeutic strategy in an established animal model of VVC.

Morphologic transition of C. albicans from yeast to hyphae is central to the pathogenicity in VVC. Studies have shown that hyphal formation triggers an aberrant inflammatory response by PMNs infiltrating the vaginal lumen but with little effect on clearance of Candida, as heparan sulfate in the vaginal environment inhibits interactions between PMNs and C. albicans. This dysfunction results in persistent hyphal overgrowth and inflammation, which are key indicators of symptomatic VVC in both women and mouse models.

To this end, we proposed the concept of intravaginal cooling as a therapeutic strategy by reversing the morphology of C. albicans from pathogenic hyphae to commensal yeast. Below physiologic temperatures, C. albicans remains in the yeast form due to suppressed morphogenic gene expression even in the presence of potent hyphal inducers. By targeting the morphologic state, cooling therapy aims to offer multifold benefits, including reducing the pathogenic fungal state, alleviating vaginal inflammation, and providing a nonpharmacologic, convenient alternative for managing VVC symptoms.

In this pilot clinical trial, 5 women with moderate to severe VVC underwent a regimen of 30-minute twice-daily intravaginal cooling using the Vlisse device. This approach demonstrated excellent compliance, with no adverse reactions reported. Notably, the treatment provided immediate relief, likely due first to the direct cooling effect on inflamed tissue rather than an instant reduction in hyphae, as symptoms rebounded within 12 hours of the first use. Conversely, sustained symptom relief observed after the second use suggests progressive reversion of hyphae to yeast over successive treatments. Overall, statistical tests applied between symptom scores at any posttreatment assessment compared with the following pretreatment assessment indicated that ≥ 2 treatments are needed for lasting effects. Although the small sample size and reliance on self-reported symptom measures are limitations, follow-up pelvic examinations and negative KOH test results 30 days after treatment confirmed clinical cure, extending symptom-free periods beyond the typical test-of-cure time frames (10–28 days) reported in previous antifungal drug studies for VVC treatment.

New Diagnostic Options for Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

With the commercial availability of nucleic acid amplification tests, the standard diagnostic tests (culture with Sabouraud agar) for Candida species are challenged. Molecular tests are far more sensitive, result in a short turnaround time, and enable the possibilities for self-testing and the diagnosis of coinfections. Disadvantages of molecular tests include false-positive results for patients with a low probability for infection, identification of asymptomatic Candida that does not require treatment, and higher costs compared with microscopy. Cost effectiveness studies are ongoing.

Summary

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is a multifactorial condition, with a predominant abnormal immune response of the host. Undoubtedly, fungal and bacterial communities have the potential to impact each other through physical interactions, metabolites production, chemical interactions, etc. Despite the uncertain effect of lactobacilli in vivo, a majority of in vitro and animal studies have shown that Lactobacilli species exerts an inhibitory effect on the growth, morphological transition, virulence, and biofilm formation of C. albicans. The metabolites of Lactobacilli species were shown to have antifungal properties. However, only specific lactobacilli strains can produce these metabolites in quantities required for antifungal activity, which possibly explains the failure of vaginal lactobacilli to suppress Candida colonization. For example, it has been reported that physiological levels of lactic acid may be too low to inhibit Candida species overgrowth, and therefore, the role of lactic acid for the control of its overgrowth is not clear. Lactic acid at physiological concentrations may, however, increase the efficacy of azoles against C. albicans and at higher concentrations against C. glabrata. A relative overrepresentation of L. iners and a relative underrepresentation of hydrogen-peroxide producing lactobacilli have been reported in many studies in women with VVC. Discrepancies among studies evaluating correlation between VMB and VVC may be due to different patients' geography, age and symptoms, as well as approaches used for sample collection, processing, and identification. More longitudinal studies are needed to describe the association between the host, bacterial, and fungal components of the VMB to enable insight into the potential interactions and antifungal mechanisms of vaginal lactobacilli, to understand their role in VVC.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^111T7j1U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A physical examination should include an inspection of the vulvovaginal area to identify any visible signs such as lesions, excoriations, skin or tissue changes, or abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, or consistency. Identified lesions should be well examined, and the patient should be asked whether they are the perceived source of itch, are painful, or are tender to touch. If vaginal itching is present, a wet mount preparation with microscopy of vaginal discharge, STI testing, and pH testing are often the first line, with DNA probe testing having higher accuracy. A speculum exam may not be needed, as specimens may be collected using a swab that can be inserted into the vagina without a speculum. However, a speculum exam is helpful with visualizing vaginal lesions, such as herpetic lesions or condylomas in the vaginal canal or with cervical visualization. If a provider is unable to perform a speculum exam or if there are upper vaginal or cervical symptoms or lesions that cannot be assessed, a referral to gynecology may be necessary. Additionally, concerning symptoms such as ulcerated, eroded, or discolored vulvar lesions, pelvic pain, sexual dysfunction, or abnormal vaginal bleeding may also warrant a referral. Vulvoscopy is used for magnified visualization of external vulvar lesions. For uncertain or persistent lesions that do not respond to treatment, punch biopsy may be necessary, and microbiological tests may help confirm diagnoses in cases of refractory infections. The goal is to create diagnostic algorithms based on symptoms, signs, and morphological features.

Differential Diagnosis

When evaluating vulvovaginal pruritus, it is essential to consider a broad differential diagnosis, encompassing infectious, inflammatory, hormonal, neoplastic, neuropathic, systemic, and psychogenic causes. Given the overlapping presentations of these conditions, a systematic approach is necessary to narrow down the most likely etiology. Of note, if hormonal causes are suspected, referral to a gynecologist is warranted for further workup. If a psychogenic cause is suspected or a psychiatric condition is suspected to be an aggravating factor, psychiatric evaluation is warranted. A detailed discussion on these topics is beyond the scope of this review.

Formation of a differential is led by the timing, absence or presence of lesions, location, absence or presence of abnormal discharge, age, and other risk factors. Medical history, contacts, and other elements of history may increase clinical suspicion for causes of vaginal itch originating from certain domains.

### Are a speculum examination and wet mount always necessary for patients with vaginal symptoms? A pilot randomized controlled trial [^113R4ubq]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The suggested evaluation of vaginal symptoms is based on the wet mount diagnosis of candidiasis, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis. We wondered if patients with vaginal symptoms could be managed initially based solely on symptoms.

Methods

This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2 urban family practice clinics and enrolled 46 premenopausal, nonpregnant women with acute vaginal symptoms. In the control arm, women were managed based on a speculum examination and wet mount. In the intervention arm, women were managed based on symptoms. Women were tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis and called 2 weeks later to assess symptom resolution, adverse medication effects, need for revisit, and satisfaction with care.

Results

Forty-one of 44 women (93%) felt better 2 weeks after the visit; 28 (64%) had complete resolution of symptoms. The intervention arm had slightly better resolution of symptoms (P = .046); there were other no differences between the 2 arms. Three women were diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases (trichomoniasis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea).

Conclusions

Our pilot study suggests that in selected women it may be reasonable to initially manage vaginal complaints based on symptoms. These results should be confirmed in other larger trials. Testing for sexually transmitted diseases is important in our population.

Evaluation of STD-Related Conditions

Genital ulcer disease can be caused by syphilis, HSV, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV). The more common sexually transmitted causes of male urethritis syndrome can include gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, trichomoniasis, and HSV. Diseases characterized by vaginal discharge as a result of vaginitis can include bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, and candidiasis. The causes of epididymitis, pharyngitis, cervicitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can include gonorrhea and chlamydia. Most genital warts are caused by nononcogenic HPV types. However, on occasion, oncogenic types can be found in genital warts. Proctitis can be caused by gonorrhea, LGV serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis, syphilis, and HSV. Ectoparasitic infections typically include pediculosis pubis and scabies. Systemic or dermatologic conditions compatible with or suggestive of an STD can include disseminated gonorrhea, neurosyphilis, ocular syphilis, condylomata lata, or palmar plantar syphilitic rash. STD-related conditions warrant prompt evaluation of signs and symptoms to make an accurate diagnosis and provide timely empiric treatment to prevent complications and onward transmission. Patients with a clinical presentation suggestive of an STD etiology (genital ulcer disease, urethritis, vaginal discharge, PID, epididymitis, pharyngitis, genital warts, proctitis, ectoparasitic infections, or certain systemic or dermatologic conditions) should be evaluated.

Recommendations for the STD-related conditions that should be evaluated are summarized (Box 5). Additional information on these recommendations is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112bg4hH]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate what proportion of symptomatic women purchasing over-the-counter antifungal products for immediate treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis have vulvovaginal candidiasis or other genitourinary conditions.

Methods

A time-location sample of 95 symptomatic women who purchased and presented with an over-the-counter antifungal product for immediate and personal treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis were evaluated by clinical examination and pertinent laboratory tests. The percentage of women diagnosed having vulvovaginal candidiasis or other conditions, proportions of women with vulvovaginal candidiasis compared between groups with and without a prior diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis, and groups that read or did not read the over-the-counter package label were assessed.

Results

The actual diagnoses for women who self-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis were: vulvovaginal candidiasis 33.7%, bacterial vaginosis 18.9%, mixed vaginitis 21.1%, normal 13.7%, other diagnoses 10.5%, and trichomonas vaginitis 2.1%. Women with a previous clinically based diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis were not more accurate in diagnosing vulvovaginal candidiasis than women without a prior clinical diagnosis (chi(2) = 0.27, P = .6). Women who read the package label were no more likely to have vulvovaginal candidiasis than were women who did not read the label (Fisher exact test, P = .39).

Conclusion

Many women who self-diagnose and use an over-the-counter product for treatment of presumed vulvovaginal candidiasis do not have vulvovaginal candidiasis. A history of a previous clinically based diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis and reading the package label do not help women self-diagnose vulvovaginal candidiasis properly. Ready access to these products is associated with wasted financial expenditures, unfulfilled expectations, and a delay in correct diagnosis for a substantial number of women.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^112SQVmb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our findings demonstrate the limited accuracy of clinical diagnosis as an approach for management of vaginitis caused by bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, or T vaginalis compared with the vaginal assay panel among women with symptoms of vaginitis seen in clinical settings. Consistent with the results here, Schwebke et alpreviously demonstrated that the vaginal panel assay had better sensitivity (using a laboratory reference standard) than clinical diagnosis for all three causes of vaginitis. We observed that 65%, 44%, and 56% of individuals with vaginal assay-positive, clinical diagnosis-negative results for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T vaginalis, respectively, went untreated. Conversely, those women who were negative for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T vaginalis, respectively, by assay testing were still (over)treated according to clinical diagnosis 15%, 17%, and less than 1% of the time (Appendix 7, available online at).

Previously, Hillier et aldemonstrated that almost half the women with a laboratory-diagnosed cause of vaginitis received at least one treatment that was inappropriate. Not surprisingly, return visits based on persistent vaginitis symptoms were common in that study; occurring in 35%, 17%, and 42% of cases associated with bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T vaginalis, respectively.

We found a significant difference in the paired proportions between clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the vaginal panel assay. Although Amsel's criteria represents the primary in-clinic test used to identify bacterial vaginosis, this modality is subjective, and the accuracy of the different diagnostic components comprising Amsel's criteria differ (Beqaj S, Lebed J, Smith B, Farrell M, Schwebke JR, Rivers CA, et al. Comparison of conventional and modified Amsel's criteria with Nugent score and impact on PCR-based bacterial vaginosis infection status evaluation [abstract]. Int J STD AIDS 2015;26:142.). This suggests that a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis might vary depending on the type of in-clinic testing involved with the standard of care for any given setting.

Lesions are atypical (eg, new pigmentation, indurated, affixed to underlying tissue, bleeding, or ulcerated)
Concern for malignancy exists
Lesions are in a patient who is immunocompromised (including those living with HIV)
The diagnosis is uncertain
Lesions do not respond to standard therapy
The disease worsens during therapy

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^114PMNCc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaginal symptoms account for more than 10 million physician visits in the USA annually, making them a leading cause of medical consultations among women. Since vaginal symptoms such as vaginal discharge, odour, itching and burning can be indicative of a variety of bacterial or fungal infections for which pharmacological treatment is pathogen-specific, accurately identifying the cause of presenting symptoms is crucial in the clinical assessment process. The clinical and laboratory methods commonly used to detect pathogens responsible for vaginal symptoms in women include a visual assessment of vaginal discharge by the treating physician, wet prep microscopy, urine culture or the collection of vaginal swabs for subsequent molecular testing; each method has its own benefits and drawbacks in terms of results turnaround time, accuracy, costs, and availability.

Determining symptom aetiology based on a clinical workup is notoriously inaccurate given the difficulty with microscopy (which is no longer available in many settings), the lack of specificity of the appearance of discharge and the high frequency of co-infections. Clinical diagnosis has also been hampered by SARS-CoV-2 during the pandemic as many patients, even those with symptoms, were not undergoing full pelvic examinations with visualisation of the cervix. This rendered the already difficult task of separating vaginitis from cervicitis as a cause of discharge nearly impossible. Given these challenges, laboratory diagnostics are needed to fully understand the pathogens that may be present in these patients.

### Identification of symptoms that indicate a pelvic examination is necessary to exclude PID in adolescent women [^1129nVbp]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and vaginitis is now possible in adolescents using urine testing and vaginal swabs obtained by care provider or patient. However, a complete pelvic examination is necessary to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). It is thus important to identify patients who might have pelvic inflammatory disease to assure complete gynecologic assessment of genitourinary symptoms.

Purpose

To determine whether adolescent patients with pelvic inflammatory disease report predictable symptoms during the medical interview and to determine what proportion of patients diagnosed with PID report at least one predictor symptom.

Design

Observational study.

Settings

Hospital-based adolescent clinic and Job Corps health service.

Patients

A convenience sample (n = 193) of adolescent and young adult women who had a pelvic examination performed to evaluate a wide range of genitourinary symptoms.

Main Outcome Measure

Clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Analysis

Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of predictor symptoms for identifying patients given a diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease.

Results

Twenty (10.4%) patients received a clinical diagnosis of PID. Lower abdominal pain was the most common symptom (90.0%) reported by these patients. All of the patients with PID reported either lower abdominal pain or dyspareunia in the medical history compared with 97 (56.1%) of those without PID. The presence of lower abdominal pain and/or dyspareunia in the clinical history yielded a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 44%, and positive and negative predictive value of 17% and 100%, respectively, for identifying patients given a diagnosis of PID.

Conclusion

This study identified two symptoms reported in the medical history (lower abdominal pain and dyspareunia) that were associated with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. If lack of these two symptoms was used as a criterion for omitting a pelvic examination, more than one third of the patients in this study could have been evaluated for cervical and vaginal infections with urine and directly obtained vaginal swabs. Although some of these patients might have required a pelvic examination to exclude other causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding, at least 30% of the total sample could have been evaluated without a speculum and bimanual examination. If further studies support these findings, patients with symptoms suggestive of uncomplicated genitourinary infection (e.g., vaginal discharge, vaginal pruritus, or dysuria) who deny lower abdominal pain and dyspareunia can be evaluated with urine and vaginal samples in place of a speculum and bimanual examination.

### The international society for the study of vulvovaginal disease vaginal wet mount microscopy guidelines: how to perform, applications, and interpretation [^113rGfxv]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aims of the study were to assess the available literature concerning the indications, performance, technique, and classification of wet mount microscopy (WMM) and to establish evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

Literature review from the main scientific databases was performed by the ad hoc "Vaginitis and Microbiome Committee" of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease. The document was approved by the executive council and membership of the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease.

Results

Available data are limited and usually of low level of evidence. Nevertheless, it shows that WMM is capable of reducing misdiagnosis, overtreatment, and undertreatment of vaginal conditions. It has an excellent performance for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and variable performance for trichomoniasis and candidiasis. It is the gold standard for aerobic vaginitis/desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. Currently, there is no recommendation to use WMM in the screening of asymptomatic women. The use of phase contrast is recommended to improve performance and reproducibility. Sampling location, devices, and technique have an impact on the results. Available scoring and classification scores have significant limitations.

Conclusions

Wet mount microscopy is a point-of-care, inexpensive, and fast technique that, with practice, can be mastered by office clinicians. It should be considered a basic skill in the curricula of gynecology and obstetrics residencies. Recommendations are provided on sampling, reading, and scoring.

### Chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis [^113kzSD8]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Frequently ignored by the medical community, chronic vulvovaginal symptoms are relatively common and can frustrating for patients and physicians. Establishing a proper diagnosis will lay the foundation for an effective therapeutic therapeutic plan. Fungal cultures are an important component of the work-up. The most common causes of chronic vaginal symptoms are recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC), vulvar vestibulitis syndrome and irritant dermatitis. In patients with RVVC caused by Candida albicans, host factors may play an important role. Long-term oral antifungal therapy will break the pattern of recurrence in many patients. Infections caused by other species of yeast may be more resistant to standard treatment approaches.

### Accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard [^111ynbGt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of the three most common causes of acute vulvovaginal symptoms (bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis vaginitis, and trichomoniasis vaginalis) using a traditional, standardized clinical diagnostic protocol compared with a DNA probe laboratory standard.

Methods

This prospective clinical comparative study had a sample of 535 active-duty United States military women presenting with vulvovaginal symptoms. Clinical diagnoses were made by research staff using a standardized protocol of history, physical examination including pelvic examination, determination of vaginal pH, vaginal fluid amines test, and wet-prep microscopy. Vaginal fluid samples were obtained for DNA analysis. The research clinicians were blinded to the DNA results.

Results

The participants described a presenting symptom of abnormal discharge (50%), itching/irritation (33%), malodor (10%), burning (4%), or others such as vulvar pain and vaginal discomfort. According to laboratory standard, there were 225 cases (42%) of bacterial vaginosis, 76 cases (14%) of candidiasis vaginitis, 8 cases (1.5%) of trichomoniasis vaginalis, 87 cases of mixed infections (16%), and 139 negative cases (26%). For each single infection, the clinical diagnosis had a sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 70.0% for bacterial vaginosis, 83.8% and 84.8% for candidiasis vaginitis, and 84.6% and 99.6% for trichomoniasis vaginalis when compared with the DNA probe standard.

Conclusion

Compared with a DNA probe standard, clinical diagnosis is 81–85% sensitive and 70–99% specific for bacterial vaginosis, Candida vaginitis, and trichomoniasis. Even under research conditions that provided clinicians with sufficient time and materials to conduct a thorough and standardized clinical evaluation, the diagnosis and, therefore, subsequent treatment of these common vaginal problems remains difficult.

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^112vv1GK]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

The decision to use a particular test to diagnose patients presenting with symptoms of vaginitis and/or STI is based primarily on the prevailing standards of care in the clinic at which the patient evaluation takes place. As a result, laboratory testing of vaginal samples for these patients often involves either an STI or a vaginitis test, but rarely both options simultaneously, which complicates the diagnosis and management of concurrent infections.

Methods

Using de-identified remnant vaginal specimens from symptomatic patients previously tested for STI (Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV)) with the Becton Dickinson (BD) CTGCTV2 assay for BD MAX System, positivity for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida spp (associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)) were evaluated using the molecular-based BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

Findings

The rate of STI/BV co-infection was 79.4% (227/286) in this symptomatic population, while that of STI/VVC was 27.0% (77/285). Women diagnosed with any one of the three STIs tested had an OR 2.86 (95% CI, 1.99, 4.11; p < 0.0001) for a concurrent BV infection and OR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.67, 1.37; p = 0.8085) for infection with Candida species.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that women being tested for STI have a high prevalence of co-infection with BV and a lower, although appreciable, prevalence of co-infection with VVC. The detection of co-occurring vaginal infections can be facilitated by molecular testing using a single sample.

### Noncandidal vaginitis: a comprehensive approach to diagnosis and management [^114ubumW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is one of the most common causes of patient visits to gynecologists, primary care providers, and urgent care centers. However, many women leave without a clear diagnosis or experience recurrent symptoms despite treatment. The 3 most common etiologies of vaginitis are trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis, which account for an estimated 70% of cases. The remaining 30% may be related to other causes of vaginitis, including atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and vaginal erosive disease. The purpose of this review is to describe the noncandidal causes of acute and recurrent vaginitis, with the goal of improving the likelihood of accurate diagnosis as well as efficient and effective therapy. We excluded candidal vaginitis from our review because there was a recently published review on this topic in the Journal. The clinical presentation and evaluation of patients with symptoms of vaginitis can be triaged into 1 of 2 diagnostic pathways: noninflammatory and inflammatory vaginitis. The most common noninflammatory cause is bacterial vaginosis. Features such as irritation, purulent discharge, and the presence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils are more suggestive of an inflammatory process. Trichomoniasis is the most common cause of inflammatory vaginitis. Other well-described forms of inflammatory vaginitis include atrophic vaginitis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, and erosive disease. We present a review of the pathogenesis, symptoms, examination findings, diagnostic testing, and treatment for each of these causes of noncandidal vaginitis.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment [^112C9UWw]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Vaginitis is defined as any condition with symptoms of abnormal vaginal discharge, odor, irritation, itching, or burning. The most common causes of vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. Bacterial vaginosis is implicated in 40% to 50% of cases when a cause is identified, with vulvovaginal candidiasis accounting for 20% to 25% and trichomoniasis for 15% to 20% of cases. Noninfectious causes, including atrophic, irritant, allergic, and inflammatory vaginitis, are less common and account for 5% to 10% of vaginitis cases. Diagnosis is made using a combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and office-based or laboratory testing. Bacterial vaginosis is traditionally diagnosed with Amsel criteria, although Gram stain is the diagnostic standard. Newer laboratory tests that detect Gardnerella vaginalis DNA or vaginal fluid sialidase activity have similar sensitivity and specificity to Gram stain. Bacterial vaginosis is treated with oral metronidazole, intravaginal metronidazole, or intravaginal clindamycin. The diagnosis of vulvovaginal candidiasis is made using a combination of clinical signs and symptoms with potassium hydroxide microscopy; DNA probe testing is also available. Culture can be helpful for the diagnosis of complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis by identifying nonalbicans strains of Candida. Treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis involves oral fluconazole or topical azoles, although only topical azoles are recommended during pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends nucleic acid amplification testing for the diagnosis of trichomoniasis in symptomatic or high-risk women. Trichomoniasis is treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole, and patients' sex partners should be treated as well. Treatment of noninfectious vaginitis should be directed at the underlying cause. Atrophic vaginitis is treated with hormonal and nonhormonal therapies. Inflammatory vaginitis may improve with topical clindamycin as well as steroid application.

### Immunity in vaginal candidiasis [^117XCVj2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Vulvovaginal candidiasis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis remain a significant problem in women of child-bearing age. While host defense mechanisms against infection are poorly understood, the most recent studies continue to challenge dogma relative to anti-Candida immunity at other mucosal sites that is normally associated with T helper 1-type CD4 T cells.

Recent Findings

Four studies comprise the latest findings in host defense against vulvovaginal candidiasis. The first from an animal model provided the most definitive data to date for the lack of involvement by systemic or local T-cell-mediated immunity. The second study confirmed a limited role for antibodies in vaginal candidiasis; similar to past studies, systemic and local Candida-specific antibodies in women with vulvovaginal candidiasis were either similar or elevated compared with controls. The third study from a cohort of adolescents provided evidence for some form of local protective immunity based on high asymptomatic vaginal fungal burden with low incidence rate of vulvovaginal candidiasis. This was addressed more specifically through a natural history protocol involving an intravaginal challenge with live Candida. Results showed a strong correlation between infiltration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils and symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis, with no evidence of an inflammatory response in those protected against infection.

Summary

Instead of vulvovaginal candidiasis being caused by defective or dysfunctional CD4 T helper 1-type cell-mediated immune reactivity, data suggest that symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis is associated with an aggressive response by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, whereas protection appears to be innate and noninflammatory. The role for innate immunity in both protection against, and promotion of, symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis is paradigm changing.

### Management of persistent vaginitis [^116nKm9g]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

With vaginitis remaining a common condition that leads women to seek care, it is not surprising that some women develop chronic vulvovaginal problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat. With a differential diagnosis that encompasses vulvar disorders and infectious and noninfectious causes of vaginitis, accurate diagnosis is the cornerstone of choosing effective therapy. Evaluation should include a symptom-specific history, careful vulvar and vaginal examination, and office-based tests (vaginal pH, amine test, saline and 10% potassium hydroxide microscopy). Ancillary tests, especially yeast culture with speciation, are frequently crucial to obtaining a correct diagnosis. A heavy but normal physiologic discharge can be determined by excluding other causes. With vulvovaginal candidiasis, differentiating between Candida albicans and non-albicans Candida infection has important treatment ramifications. Most patients with C albicans infections can be successfully treated with maintenance antifungal therapy, usually with fluconazole. Although many non-albicans Candida, particularly Candida glabrata, may at times be innocent bystanders, vaginal boric acid therapy is an effective first choice for many true non-albicans Candida infections. Recurrent bacterial vaginosis, a difficult therapeutic challenge, can often be controlled with maintenance therapy. Multiple options, especially high-dose tinidazole, have been used for metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis. With the aging of the U.S. population, atrophic vaginitis and desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, both associated with hypoestrogenism, are encountered frequently in women with persistent vaginitis.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

VVC usually is caused by Candida albicans but can occasionally be caused by other Candida species or yeasts. Typical symptoms of VVC include pruritus, vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, external dysuria, and abnormal vaginal discharge. None of these symptoms is specific for VVC. An estimated 75% of women will have at least one episode of VVC, and 40%–45% will have two or more episodes. On the basis of clinical presentation, microbiology, host factors, and response to therapy, VVC can be classified as either uncomplicated or complicated (Box 4). Approximately 10%–20% of women will have complicated VVC, requiring special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations.

Outcomes

Efficacy measurements included collection of clinical signs (erythema, edema, excoriation) and symptoms (itching, burning, irritation) of vulvovaginitis using a scoring scale of 0–3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe) for each sign or symptom to give a total severity score of 0–18. In addition, a KOH wet mount test and vaginal fungal culture were performed at each visit.

The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of participants with therapeutic cure, defined as both clinical and mycological cure, at the TOC day 28 visit. Mycological cure was defined as a negative fungal culture for Candida species. Clinical cure was defined as follows: complete resolution of signs and symptoms pertaining to VVC and any new sign or symptom observed at the TOC visit determined by the investigator not to be related to VVC.

The secondary efficacy outcome measures were the proportion of participants with the following: clinical cure at day 28; mycological cure at days 7, 14, and 28; clinical improvement (every individual VVC signs and symptoms score that was 0, 1, or 2 at baseline was a score of 0 at day 28, and scores of 3 at baseline were scores of 0 or 1 at day 28); clinical relapse (clinical cure at day 28 and signs and symptoms total severity score > 0 at day 84 or day 168); mycological reinfection or recurrence (negative fungal culture at day 28 and positive fungal culture for Candida species at day 84 or day 168); modified clinical cure (total VVC severity score of ≤ 1 at day 28); modified therapeutic cure (modified clinical cure and mycological cure at day 28); and therapeutic improvement (clinical improvement and mycological cure at day 28). Additional evaluations included the following: number of participants with a change in clinical signs and symptoms from baseline to day 28; number of participants with positive culture and KOH test at days 28, 84, and 168; and PK analyses.

PK samples were obtained from all participants prior to dosing of the study drug on day 1 and at each subsequent visit. Serial sampling was obtained from consenting participants at participating sites on day 1 (pre-dose and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 hours after dosing).

AEs were collected throughout the study. Physical examination findings, vital signs, ECGs, and safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) were recorded at baseline and throughout the study.

New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

Diagnostic Considerations

A diagnosis of Candida vaginitis is clinically indicated by the presence of external dysuria and vulvar pruritus, pain, swelling, and redness. Signs include vulvar edema, fissures, excoriations, and thick curdy vaginal discharge. Most healthy women with uncomplicated VVC have no identifiable precipitating factors. The diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation (saline, 10% KOH) of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding yeasts, hyphae, or pseudohyphae, or a culture or other test yields a positive result for a yeast species. Candida vaginitis is associated with normal vaginal pH (< 4.5). Use of 10% KOH in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure the yeast or pseudohyphae. Examination of a wet mount with KOH preparation should be performed for all women with symptoms or signs of VVC, and women with a positive result should be treated. For those with negative wet mounts but existing signs or symptoms, vaginal cultures for Candida should be considered. If Candida cultures cannot be performed for these women, empiric treatment can be considered. Identifying Candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not an indication for treatment because approximately 10%–20% of women harbor Candida species and other yeasts in the vagina. The majority of PCR tests for yeast are not FDA cleared, and providers who use these tests should be familiar with the performance characteristics of the specific test used. Yeast culture, which can identify a broad group of pathogenic yeasts, remains the reference standard for diagnosis.

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^115BUAsj]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The decision to use a particular test to diagnose patients presenting with symptoms of vaginitis and/or STI is based primarily on the prevailing standards of care in the clinic at which the patient evaluation takes place. As a result, laboratory testing of vaginal samples for these patients often involves either an STI or a vaginitis test, but rarely both options simultaneously, which complicates the diagnosis and management of concurrent infections.

Methods

Using de-identified remnant vaginal specimens from symptomatic patients previously tested for STI (Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV)) with the Becton Dickinson (BD) CTGCTV2 assay for BD MAX System, positivity for bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Candida spp (associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)) were evaluated using the molecular-based BD MAX Vaginal Panel.

Findings

The rate of STI/BV co-infection was 79.4% (227/286) in this symptomatic population, while that of STI/VVC was 27.0% (77/285). Women diagnosed with any one of the three STIs tested had an OR 2.86 (95% CI, 1.99, 4.11; p < 0.0001) for a concurrent BV infection and OR 0.96 (95% CI, 0.67, 1.37; p = 0.8085) for infection with Candida species.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that women being tested for STI have a high prevalence of co-infection with BV and a lower, although appreciable, prevalence of co-infection with VVC. The detection of co-occurring vaginal infections can be facilitated by molecular testing using a single sample.

### The vaginal microbiome: I. research development, lexicon, defining "Normal" and the dynamics throughout women's lives [^116h6Fyg]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

The vagina is a highly versatile organ that profoundly affects women's health as well as the health of their newborns. As microorganisms play a critical role in determining the vaginal environment in terms of biochemical and inflammatory properties, the characteristics of the vaginal environment may not only relate to genital symptoms but also impact conception, the ability to carry a fetus to term, the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and the risk for gynecological malignancies.

In the last 2 decades, many studies using molecular techniques were performed, aiming to characterize the vaginal microbiota. These studies identified vaginal bacteria that had been previously overlooked by culture-based methods, showing that bacterial communities in the vagina are more complex than previously thought. Although many different vaginal microbiome (VMB) reviews have been published recently, we aim to integrate the most recent knowledge regarding topics relevant to clinicians specializing in vulvovaginal disorders. This series of articles seeks to describe the current concepts regarding normal VMB and dysbiosis, VMB findings in different genital conditions, and discuss future therapeutic options. In this series of articles, we focused on the vaginal bacterial microbiota and did not describe the fungal, viral, archaeal, and protozoan diversity due to the paucity of published molecular surveys.

The first article in this series focuses on the evolution of VMB research, technical explanations, the definition of "normal" VMB, and the dynamics of VMB throughout women's lives. Subsequent articles in this series discuss VMB variations and dysbiotic conditions (II), the VMB in various urogenital disorders, including vulvovaginal candidiasis, urinary tract infections, STIs, and vulvodynia (III). The fourth part (IV) focuses on 2 distinct areas: the role of VMB in various aspects of human reproduction, including infertility, pregnancy, preterm birth, and miscarriages, and in sharp contrast, the association between the VMB and gynecologic cancers. The last article (V) discusses therapeutic modalities and the challenges facing the research of VMB.

### Targeted point-of-care testing compared with syndromic management of urogenital infections in women (WISH): a cross-sectional screening and diagnostic accuracy study [^112YL1M8]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Background

Sexually transmitted and urogenital infections are typically managed by WHO-recommended syndromic algorithms in resource-poor countries, and presumptively in Europe. However, algorithms for vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain perform poorly in women. The women's improvement of sexual and reproductive health (WISH) study in Kigali, Rwanda, sought to improve case-finding and infection management in women by introducing point-of-care tests. The main aim was to compare the performance of the WISH algorithms and the WHO vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain algorithms with gold standard testing.

Methods

This cross-sectional screening and diagnostic accuracy study recruited women aged 18 years or older with or without urogenital symptoms at risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections in Kigali, Rwanda. Recruitment activities were implemented by study staff with the help of community mobilisers at health centres, pharmacies, markets, women's organisations, and at "umuganda" community meetings. At the study visit, participants had a face-to-face interview that included questions about current urogenital symptoms. Participants were first asked without prompting (spontaneous reporting), followed by questions about 14 specific symptoms (structural reporting). Next, the WISH algorithms were implemented. All participants had point-of-care tests for bacterial vaginosis (vaginal pH of 5·0 or above) and Trichomonas vaginalis (immunoassay) regardless of symptom reporting. Women with a positive risk score had point-of-care tests for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoea (nucleic acid amplification tests). Vulvovaginal candidiasis was treated presumptively. Nucleic acid amplification tests for C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, T vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis were the gold standard, and all patients provided swabs for these.

Findings

Participants were recruited between July 5, 2016, and March 14, 2017. 705 participants were enrolled in the study and completed a study visit, and 51 attended 53 additional visits. Prevalence by gold standard testing was 8·5% for C trachomatis, 7·1% for N gonorrhoeae, 16·1% for T vaginalis, 18·1% for bacterial vaginosis, and 8·6% for vulvovaginal candidiasis. The WISH algorithms identified similar numbers of C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vaginalis infections, but much higher numbers of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis infections. Compared with gold standard testing, the WISH algorithms had a good sensitivity and high specificity for C trachomatis (sensitivity 71·7%, specificity 100%), N gonorrhoeae (sensitivity 76·0%, specificity 100%), and T vaginalis (sensitivity 68·5%, specificity 97·4%), high sensitivity but low specificity for bacterial vaginosis (sensitivity 95·2%, specificity 41·2%), and moderate sensitivity and specificity for vulvovaginal candidiasis (sensitivity 64·4%, specificity 69·4%). The performance of vaginal pH testing for bacterial vaginosis improved by increasing the cutoff to 5·5, followed by confirmatory testing (sensitivity 73·6%, specificity 100%). The WHO algorithms had moderate sensitivity and poor specificity for all infections compared with gold standard testing: C trachomatis sensitivity 58·3%, specificity 44·7%; N gonorrhoeae sensitivity 66·0%, specificity 45·2%; T vaginalis sensitivity 60·4%, specificity 45·6%; bacterial vaginosis sensitivity 61·6%, specificity 46·0%; and vulvovaginal candidiasis sensitivity 74·6%, specificity 50·6%. Two participants attended additional visits because they had a mild allergic reaction to metronidazole. Staff and participants considered point-of-care testing feasible and acceptable.

Interpretation

Point-of-care testing for urogenital infections might improve case-finding and infection management and is feasible in resource-poor settings. Point-of-care tests should be further developed, including those targeting multiple conditions. Additional studies in other populations, including populations with low prevalence of sexually transmitted and urogenital infections, are warranted.

### Women's appraisal of the management of vulvodynia by their general practitioner: a qualitative study [^115rb6HV]. Family Practice (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Provoked vulvodynia (PVD) is the most common cause of vulvar pain and is defined as 'vulvar pain of at least three months duration, without clear, identifiable cause, which may have potential associated factors'. These associated factors are, for example, fibromyalgia, mood and sleep disorders, fatigue, dyspareunia, micturition symptoms and irritable bowel syndrome. Despite the vulvar pain, up to 80% of women with PVD continue to have painful, unaroused intercourse, leading to a vicious circle with an exacerbation of vulvovaginal symptoms. This vicious circle, together with the help-avoiding behaviour of women with PVD, is an important patient factor in maintaining the problem. In primary care PVD is likely to be misdiagnosed, partially due to an overlap of symptoms between PVD and vulvovaginal candidiasis, as well as the absence of physical findings on exam.

### Comprehensive assessment of vaginal infections using a single swab [^112UGzbD]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory test orders for symptomatic women are often based on the standard of care at the clinic, the patient's medical history and the availability of diagnostic methods. Moreover, the decision to order a specific laboratory test, or the breadth of pathogens to be tested, may also be swayed by external factors such as funding/reimbursement and stigma related to STI testing. Therefore, laboratory workups may vary significantly among women seeking care for similar vaginal symptoms, depending on clinics' routine practices.

The frequent occurrence of vaginal and/or cervical co-infections adds to the complexity of selecting the most appropriate diagnostic test and suggests that a siloed approach to testing (ie, testing for STI or vaginitis) may not be sufficient to detect co-occurring infections. The prevalence of concurrent vaginal infections and patients' susceptibility to such infections are often mentioned in the literature, especially for bacterial vaginosis (BV) or Candida spp (associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC)) concurrently with gonorrhoea or chlamydia. As such, assessing the presence of multiple pathogens through laboratory testing may increase the ability of providers to comprehensively address patients' needs in terms of both accurate diagnosis and treatment.

When comprehensive testing is warranted, minimising sample collection reduces the burden on the patient and clinic flow and may increase clinical efficiency, making molecular-based testing using a single vaginal swab a preferred option. This study sought to assess the occurrence of BV and VVC with CT, GC and TV in vaginal swabs previously tested for STI to determine the utility of single vaginal swab collection in supporting multiple pathogen testing.

2 Patients and Methods

2.1 Patients

We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of consecutive patients who visited Seoul National University Hospital for pelvic pain suggestive of IC between October 2005 and December 2019. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (IRB No: 2401‐148‐1506).

Patients were diagnosed with IC through a diagnostic pathway according to published guidelines. The inclusion criteria were pain or discomfort in the suprapubic, pelvic, urethral, vaginal, or perineal areas perceived to be related to the urinary bladder and concomitant lower urinary tract symptoms with frequency, nocturia, and urgency. The exclusion criteria included age < 18 years, pregnancy, urinary tract infection, symptomatic urethral diverticulum, urinary stone, benign or malignant bladder tumors, gynecological malignancies, radiation cystitis, any significant gynecological disease including ovarian cyst, urogenital prolapse, vaginal candidiasis, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, adenomyosis, and gynecologic malignancies.

2.2 Diagnostic Procedure

If patients initially visited the hospital with pelvic pain, detailed information on the patient's chief complaint, period from symptom onset, presence or absence of underlying disease, pain location, and medical history were collected. The diagnostic procedure was the same as in our previous paper. Briefly, physical examination was performed on all patients, and urinalysis, urine culture (UC), uroflowmetry with post‐void residual (PVR) volume measurement, and frequency‐volume chart (FVC) for 3 days were performed. Urine cytology was performed to determine whether urothelial cancer was present, and for men aged > 50 years, a serum prostate specific antigen test was performed to eliminate prostate cancer. If bacteria were detected in UC at ≥ 10 5 /colony forming unit, antibiotics were administered and reexamined. Tuberculosis (TB) test was performed on urine specimens to determine whether genitourinary TB was present.

Ultrasonography, intravenous pyelography, and computed tomography were performed as imaging studies to eliminate other confusable diseases. If necessary, urodynamic studies were performed. We screened patients for the need for cystoscopy based on the patient medical history and additional information obtained from FVC, etc. In patients suspected of presumptive ulcerative IC or if other diagnoses including bladder CIS lesion had to be eliminated, observation cystoscopy was performed on an outpatient basis.

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis — definition and suppressive therapy: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, defined as ≥ 4 episodes of symptomatic infection within one year, should begin with induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole for 10–14 days, followed by maintenance azole; for recurring vulvovaginal candidiasis, 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical agent or oral fluconazole, followed by fluconazole, 150 mg weekly for 6 months, is recommended (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). The most convenient and well-tolerated regimen is 150 mg fluconazole weekly, achieving control of symptoms in > 90% of patients, but after cessation a 40%–50% recurrence rate can be anticipated; if fluconazole therapy is not feasible, topical clotrimazole cream, 200 mg twice weekly, clotrimazole vaginal suppository 500 mg once weekly, or other intermittent oral or topical antifungal treatment is recommended.

### The role of physical examination in diagnosing common causes of vaginitis: a prospective study [^111iLyJV]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

We evaluated agreement in diagnoses for bacterial vaginosis (BV), Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) between clinicians examining the patient and performing diagnostic tests versus a clinician with access only to the patient's history and diagnostic findings from self-obtained vaginal swabs (SOVS).

Design

Women presenting with vaginal discharge to a sexually transmitted infections clinic provided SOVS for evaluation and completed the study and qualitative questionnaires. A clinician then obtained a history and performed speculum and bimanual examinations. Participants' history and diagnostic test results from SOVS were provided to a masked non-examining clinician who rendered independent diagnoses. Overall agreement in diagnoses and κ statistics was calculated.

Results

The prevalence of infections among the 197 participants was 63.4% (BV), 19% (TV) and 14% (VVC). The per cent agreement between the examining and non-examining clinician for the diagnoses of BV was 68.5%, 90.9% for TV and 91.9% for VVC. Of the 105 women diagnosed with BV by the examining clinician, 34 (32%) were missed by the non-examining clinician. The non-examining clinician missed 13 (48%) of 27 women and 12 (34%) of 35 women treated for VVC and TV, respectively. Four women who all presented with abdominal pain were diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease.

Conclusions

Tests from SOVS and history alone cannot be used to adequately diagnose BV, TV and VVC in women presenting with symptomatic vaginal discharge. Cost benefits from eliminating the speculum examination and using only tests from SOVS may be negated by long-term costs of mistreatment.

Vaginal complaints are one of the most common reasons women seek the advice of a health care provider. Uncomplicated infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis are easy to diagnose and treat.

### Vulvovaginal candidiasis: histologic lesions are primarily polymicrobial and invasive and do not contain biofilms [^114GGj4W]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The recent demonstration of a vaginal biofilm in bacterial vaginosis and its postulated importance in the pathogenesis of recurrent bacterial vaginosis, including relative resistance to therapy, has led to the hypothesis that biofilms are crucial for the development of vulvovaginal candidiasis. The histopathology and microbial architecture of vulvovaginal candidiasis have not been previously defined; neither has Candida, containing biofilm been reported in situ. The present study aimed at clarifying the histopathology of vulvovaginal candidiasis including the presence or absence of vaginal biofilm.

In a cross-sectional study, vaginal tissue biopsies were obtained from 35 women with clinically, microscopically, and culture-proven vulvovaginal candidiasis and compared with specimens obtained from 25 healthy women and 30 women with active bacterial vaginosis. Vaginal Candida infection was visualized using fluorescent in situ hybridization with ribosomal gene-based probes.

Results

Candida microorganisms were confirmed in 26 of 35 biopsies obtained from women with vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, Candida containing biofilm were not detected in any of the cases. Histopathological lesions were exclusively invasive and accompanied by co-invasion with Gardnerella or Lactobacillus species organisms.

Conclusion

Histopathological lesions of vulvovaginal candidiasis are primarily invasive in nature and polymicrobial and do not resemble biofilms. The clinical significance of Candida tissue invasion is unknown.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114mW2Ad]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Mucosal candidiasis diagnosis — adults and adolescents with HIV: Esophageal candidiasis should be suspected in people with low CD4 count who have substernal chest pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, especially if oral thrush is present, and the diagnosis is often made empirically based on symptoms plus response to therapy; definitive diagnosis requires direct endoscopic visualization of lesions with histopathologic demonstration of characteristic Candida yeast forms in tissue and confirmation by fungal culture and speciation. Vulvovaginal candidiasis is usually diagnosed by clinical presentation with demonstration of characteristic blastosphere and hyphal yeast forms in vaginal secretions on potassium hydroxide preparation; culture confirmation is rarely required but may provide supportive information, and self-diagnosis of vulvovaginitis is unreliable, with microscopic and culture confirmation required to avoid unnecessary exposure to treatment and to assess for other potential pathogens including sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

### Attitudes and experience of women to common vaginal infections [^111Qr4xz]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine women's experience and knowledge of the 2 most common non-sexually transmitted vaginal infections, vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) and bacterial vaginosis (BV).

Materials and Methods

An online omnibus was conducted on 6,010 women aged 16 to 55 years to determine the incidence and awareness of VVC and BV in Europe (France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) and the United States, followed by an in-depth questionnaire on 1,945 women about experience and attitudes to VVC and BV.

Results

Almost all (97%) of the women who took part stated that they were aware of VVC and 44% reported having had VVC, whereas only 30% of women had heard of BV and only 9% thought they had experienced it. There was confusion between symptoms specifically related to each condition, and women thought they were caused by poor hygiene, ill health, or a sexually transmitted infection, with antibiotic use cited as a cause for VVC only. Diagnosis was generally by a health care professional, but there was also considerable self-diagnosis in countries where an over-the-counter treatment was available for VVC. Rates of reported examination and testing by the health care provider varied by country, with high rates in Germany and low rates in the United Kingdom.

Conclusions

Women seem very aware and knowledgeable about VVC, but awareness of BV is low with self-reported incidence considerably less than prevalence rates, suggesting misdiagnosis. Increased education and better diagnosis of these 2 conditions is needed to remove the stigma and taboo, especially for BV, and to ensure correct diagnosis with appropriate treatment.

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^115QbQcF]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Diseases Characterized by Vulvovaginal Itching, Burning, Irritation, Odor, or Discharge

The majority of women will have a vaginal infection, characterized by discharge, itching, burning, or odor, during their lifetime. With the availability of complementary and alternative therapies and over-the-counter medications for candidiasis, symptomatic women often seek these products before or in addition to an evaluation by a medical provider.

Obtaining a medical history alone has been reported to be insufficient for accurate diagnosis of vaginitis and can lead to inappropriate administration of medication. Therefore, a careful history, examination, and laboratory testing to determine the etiology of any vaginal symptoms are warranted. Information regarding sexual behaviors and practices, sex of sex partners, menses, vaginal hygiene practices (e.g. douching), and self-treatment with oral and intravaginal medications or other products should be elicited. The infections most frequently associated with vaginal symptoms are BV (i.e. replacement of the vaginal flora by an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria including G. vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, A. vaginae, Megasphaera type 1, and numerous other fastidious or uncultivated anaerobes), trichomoniasis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC). Cervicitis can also cause an abnormal vaginal discharge. Although VVC is usually not sexually transmitted, it is included in this section because it is frequently diagnosed among women who have vaginal symptoms or are being evaluated for an STI.

### Evaluation of vulvovaginitis in the adolescent patient [^114Vnx7S]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginitis, referring to inflammation of the vulva and vagina, is a commonly reported concern among adolescents and young women presenting for gynecologic care. Symptoms of vulvovaginitis may include vaginal discharge, odor, itching, pain, dysuria, skin irritation, burning, and dyspareunia. Vulvovaginitis may result from infectious or non-infectious causes. Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis represent the three most common infectious causes of vulvovaginitis in adolescents and young adults. Additionally, non-infectious causes such as the presence of a foreign body in the vagina, chemical irritants, douching, and poor hygiene may also lead to symptoms of vulvovaginitis. A thorough history in combination with the appropriate physical examination and laboratory evaluation is necessary to identify the cause of a patient's symptoms. Importantly, adolescent patients should be given the opportunity to speak privately with the provider without a parent or guardian present in the room, particularly when gathering the sexual history. Appropriate anticipatory guidance and counseling should be provided once a diagnosis has been made, and prevention of future episodes of vulvovaginitis should be discussed.

### Causes of chronic vaginitis: analysis of a prospective database of affected women [^116bYGmJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare women with different chronic vaginal symptoms with a wide variety of sociodemographic, health, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics.

Methods

Serially recruited subjects answered a questionnaire that asks about demographic information and symptoms and measures depression and stress scores. Patients underwent a standardized history, physical examination, and laboratory examination. Patients with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, physiologic leukorrhea, and other diagnoses were compared with one another. Chi-square tests and one-way analysis of variance with Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) post hoc analyses were used for categorical and continuous data analysis.

Results

Two hundred patients were enrolled in this study. The most common diagnoses were contact dermatitis (21%), recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (20.5%), atrophic vaginitis (14.5%), and vulvar vestibulitis syndrome (12.5%); 18% of women had 2 or more diagnoses. In the overall study sample, the mean age was 38.4 years, 78% were white, and 55% were college educated. Sixty-two percent had symptoms for over a year. Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis patients were older and less likely to be menstruating. Those with vulvar vestibulitis syndrome had more frequent complaints of dyspareunia. Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis patients felt that their symptoms had the greatest negative impact on work and social life. There were high rates of psychiatric disorder (43.5%), atopic disease (42.5%), and pain syndrome (56%) in all groups.

Conclusion

Women with chronic vaginal symptoms have a variety of diagnoses, most of them noninfectious.

### Performance of a vaginal panel assay compared with the clinical diagnosis of vaginitis [^113FPMWu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

The reference standards remain as Gram stain with Nugent scoring for bacterial vaginosis and culture for vulvovaginal candidiasis. Nucleic acid amplification testing is generally accepted as a more sensitive diagnostic approach for T vaginalis detection than wet mount microscopy. Challenges with the application of these reference methods exist; Gram stain is a specialized method that not all laboratories offer, and a lengthy turn-around time may occur with culture. In addition to the accepted reference methods for bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also gives a "Level A" rating for the use of Amsel's criteria for bacterial vaginosis diagnosis and for wet mount microscopy or commercial diagnostic tests for vulvovaginal candidiasis diagnosis. Nyirjesy et al found that clinicians often do not follow guidelines set out for the diagnosis of vaginitis owing to lack of access to tools for in-clinic testing and a lack of awareness of guideline recommendations. Findings of this study support the use of U.S. Food and Drug Administration–cleared nucleic acid amplification testing for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and T vaginalis, the three main causes of vaginitis. This assay, which can be processed on an instrument placed in either physician office laboratories or reference laboratories, takes approximately 3 hours to run between 2 and 24 samples simultaneously. Therefore, a same-day result is possible if the physician office has the instrument readily available on site. The recommendation for symptomatic patients would be to wait for a result to return before prescribing treatment to reduce incorrect diagnosis and treatment.

### Dequalinium chloride for the treatment of vulvovaginal infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ms1t3]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is a frequent condition in women of childbearing age and is responsible for approximately 50% of outpatient consultations in gynecological offices. Typical symptoms include vulvovaginal itching, discharge, irritation, dyspareunia, and unpleasant odor. These symptoms can be traced back to one of the following 4 entities: vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), bacterial vaginosis (BV), desquamative inflammatory vaginitis/aerobic vaginitis (DIV/AV), and trichomoniasis. Nevertheless, there are other and less common causes for these symptoms, such as cytolytic vaginosis, although the existence of this condition is rather controversial.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis, or less often referred to as candidosis, is a common vaginal infection, with 75% of all patients reporting at least 1 episode of VVC in their life. In 80%–95% of all symptomatic cases, VVC is caused by Candida albicans. Vulvovaginal candidiasis can often be suspected clinically, although clinical diagnoses are associated with high error rates. Hence, it is recommended to verify the diagnosis of VVC by the identification of pseudohyphae on phase-contrast microscopy; further diagnostic measures include cultural diagnosis and the use of multiplex polymerase chain reaction, which are both of highest importance in complex and recurrent cases. Fungal culture, however, is still considered the criterion standard for VVC diagnosis. –

Bacterial vaginosis is widely considered a form of vaginal dysbiosis and the most common bacterial syndrome of the vagina. Pathogens most frequently associated with BV are Gram-negative Gardnerella species, Fannyhessea vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. In most cases, BV can be suspected using the Amsel criteria: homogeneous, grayish-white discharge, vaginal pH of 4.5 or higher, positive amine whiff test, and the presence of clue cells on microscopy. Microscopic evaluation of Gram-stained smears and determination of the Nugent score is widely considered the criterion standard method for BV diagnosis. The Hay-Ison criteria represent another simplified and effective method for BV diagnosis. Bacterial vaginosis treatment is recommended for symptomatic patients, apart from an ongoing discussion on the screening and treatment of asymptomatic BV in pregnant women due to their increased risk of preterm birth; currently, recommendations on this topic are inconsistent. –

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116gSuNP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal candidiasis — uncomplicated vs complicated management: Vulvovaginal candidiasis can be classified as uncomplicated, which is present in about 90% of cases, or complicated, about 10% of cases. Uncomplicated infection can be effectively treated with either single-dose fluconazole or short-course fluconazole for 3 days, both of which achieve > 90% response. Complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis requires therapy administered intravaginally with topical agents for 5–7 days or orally with fluconazole 150 mg every 72 hours for 3 doses. Most Candida species, with the exception of C. krusei and C. glabrata, respond to oral fluconazole, and Candida krusei responds to all topical antifungal agents; treatment of C. glabrata vulvovaginal candidiasis is problematic and azole therapy, including voriconazole, is frequently unsuccessful.

### Clinical performance and safety of vaginal ovules in the local treatment of nonspecific vaginitis: a national, multicentric clinical investigation [^113j52AG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Nonspecific vaginitis is a distinct clinical entity with particular microscopic and immunologic features. There is currently no standard of care for women with nonspecific vaginitis. The aim of our study was to assess the change in vaginal symptoms score after 3 months of treatment with an intravaginal medical device in participants with abnormal vaginal discharge and specific signs and symptoms. As secondary objectives, the study analyzed other clinical and microscopic features, such as vaginal discharge aspect, change in vaginal pH, change in vaginal microbiome, and vaginal inflammation.

Methods

The study population included 47 participants with symptomatic vulvovaginitis, distinct from candidiasis, trichomoniasis, or bacterial vaginosis. The study design included 2 research sites from Romania. The treatment protocol consisted of 1 ovule per day inserted intravaginally during 15 consecutive days. The total study duration was 3 months.

Findings

The intravaginal medical device had a positive impact on the vaginal symptoms score for 72.34% of the study participants. Topical administration of the ovules balanced vaginal pH values and significantly reduced signs of inflammation between study visits.

Implications

This intravaginal medical device had curative effects that support its use as a stand-alone treatment in women with nonspecific vaginitis. A second clinical investigation is ongoing to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the device in postoperative care of cervical and vaginal wounds traumatic or secondary to surgical interventions.

### Clinical evaluation of a new molecular test for the detection of organisms causing vaginitis and vaginosis [^117XW1WW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Vaginal complaints are the most common reason for women to seek medical care, with global prevalence ranging from 23% to 29% in women of reproductive age. Most women will experience at least one episode of vaginitis in their lifetime. Vaginal complaints are most often a result of either bacterial vaginosis (BV), vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), or trichomoniasis. BV is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in reproductive aged women, accounting for 40 to 50% of cases. Among women aged 14 to 49 participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, the prevalence of BV was found to be 29.2%, and the estimated annual incidence of trichomoniasis among women in the US is 3.5 million cases.

While vaginitis and vaginosis are common, achieving an accurate diagnosis is elusive in most practice settings. Practice guidelines recommend the use the Amsel's clinical criteria, the Nugent score, or culture-based methods for diagnosis of symptomatic vaginitis/vaginosis. According to Amsel criteria, diagnosis of BV is based upon the presence of 3 out of 4 of the following clinical criteria: (i) vaginal pH > 4.5; (ii) homogenous white/gray adherent vaginal discharge; (iii) the presence of clue cells (vaginal epithelial cells covered in bacteria); and (iv) a positive whiff test (fishy odor after addition of potassium hydroxide). Although frequently used as an office-based assessment, the Amsel criteria is reported to be subjective, and prone to high rate of misdiagnosis. Further, given the reduction in frequency of speculum-assisted examinations, exacerbated in response to the SARS-COV-2 pandemic reduction in clinical services for sexually transmitted infections (STI), Amsel criteria cannot be fully evaluated, and rely on only 3 rather than 4 criteria, which further reduces accuracy. While Nugent score (a Gram stain scoring system based on the quantitative assessment of Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and Mobiluncus spp.) is deemed less subjective, it is dependent on user's expertise with microscopy, has higher turnaround time, and is prone to misdiagnosis, especially for fungal-based vaginosis and mixed infections. This method is not widely used in the clinical setting. In order to perform these tests successfully, the clinician must have access to microscopy, proficiency in microscopy, pH paper, and the other supplies needed to perform a wet mount and KOH screen.

### A clinician's guide to the diagnosis and treatment of candidiasis in patients with psoriasis [^111Qun81]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Vulvovaginal Candidiasis

It is estimated that 75% of all women experience at least one VVC infection during their childbearing years. Symptoms of VVC can include vulvar pruritus and burning, and soreness and irritation can lead to dyspareunia and dysuria. Concurrent fungal infections can worsen psoriasis; therefore, it is important for VVC to be identified and treated quickly in this population.

VVC is often diagnosed based on clinical history and physical examination showing signs of vulvar and vaginal erythema, edema, excoriation, fissures, and/or thick, curd-like vaginal discharge (Fig. 1 c). IDSA guidelines recommend confirming diagnosis with a wet-mount preparation in saline and 10% KOH, and a check of vaginal pH, which should be normal (< 4.5), before beginning antifungal treatment. Cultures should be obtained for patients with negative wet-mount findings.

Most (approximately 90%) cases of VVC are uncomplicated, and IDSA guidelines recommend treatment with topical antifungal agents (Table 2) or a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole (strength of recommendation: A). A number of topical antifungal agents are effective treatments for uncomplicated VVC, with no agent showing clear superiority. Response rates are generally high (> 90%) and comparable with topical versus oral therapies, whether given as a short course or as single-dose therapy. Because there are many available therapies that are safe and effective for uncomplicated VVC, patient preference (e.g. for oral vs. topical therapy) should be considered when making treatment decisions.

Intravaginal treatments for vulvovaginal candidiasis

a Available with and without miconazole 2% external cream for use twice daily for 7 days

Complicated VVC is defined as severe or recurrent disease, infection due to a Candida species other than C. albicans, and/or VVC in an abnormal host. Such infections require treatment with topical therapy administered intravaginally daily for approximately 7 days, or multiple oral doses of fluconazole (150 mg every 72 h for three doses). For recurrent VVC, defined as four or more symptomatic episodes within a 1-year period, IDSA guidelines recommend 10–14 days of induction therapy with a topical or oral triazole, followed by fluconazole 150 mg once weekly for 6 months (strength of recommendation: A).
