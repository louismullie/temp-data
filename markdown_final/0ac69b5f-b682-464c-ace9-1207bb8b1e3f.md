## Question

Would management change at all for a patient exposed to xylazine in fentanyl?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether management would change for a patient exposed to xylazine in fentanyl. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key pharmacologic differences and resultant mixed toxidrome. Then, I should adjust acute overdose management with naloxone, airway, and hemodynamic support while acknowledging naloxone's limitations with xylazine. Next, I'll consider withdrawal management adaptations, wound care protocols, diagnostics, and harm reduction at discharge. After that, I should integrate perioperative and inpatient considerations, plus pediatric and special populations. Finally, I'll summarize the paradigm shifts and ensure the plan aligns with the best available evidence and public health guidance [^1139aRhq] [^1134Pe1U].

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology because that drives everything else. Xylazine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist veterinary sedative that is not approved for human use, causing sedation, bradycardia, hypotension, and potentially respiratory depression, whereas fentanyl is a potent mu-opioid agonist causing dose-dependent respiratory depression, sedation, and miosis; together, they produce a dual alpha–opioid toxidrome in which naloxone reverses the opioid component but not xylazine's effects [^1139aRhq] [^116M1Uvp] [^115HHaeE].

> Now for acute overdose, I need to ensure naloxone is given promptly while preparing for an incomplete response if xylazine is present, because naloxone will not reverse xylazine-mediated sedation or bradycardia; therefore, airway management and ventilation readiness are essential, and hemodynamic support with IV fluids, atropine for bradycardia, and vasopressors as needed should be anticipated along with extended observation due to persistent cardiovascular effects and recurrent sedation as naloxone wears off [^1134Pe1U] [^116M1Uvp] [^115HHaeE]. Wait, let me verify antidote options for xylazine; at first glance atipamezole comes to mind from veterinary practice, but hold on, I should confirm human status — there is no approved human reversal agent, and calls for research into alpha-adrenergic antagonists underscore the current gap, so supportive care remains the standard in humans [^115cc8UX] [^1139aRhq].

> I should confirm how to recognize xylazine co-exposure at the bedside and in the lab. A "naloxone-resistant" phenotype with persistent sedation, bradycardia, or hypotension despite adequate naloxone should raise suspicion for xylazine, and I need to remember xylazine is not on routine clinical tox panels; if the result will change management, targeted LC-MS/MS can be sent when available, while real-time care remains supportive regardless of confirmatory testing turnaround [^11611wFC] [^113WRTBv] [^1134Pe1U]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — absence on a standard immunoassay does not exclude xylazine, so clinical pattern recognition and public health context remain crucial in decision-making [^113WRTBv] [^112Rpr3N].

> For withdrawal, I need to adapt beyond opioid-only paradigms because patients exposed to high-potency fentanyl often have more severe and prolonged opioid withdrawal and, with xylazine co-use, may exhibit additional adrenergic features; I should prioritize low-dose or micro-induction buprenorphine strategies or carefully titrated methadone for opioid withdrawal while adding alpha-2 agonists such as clonidine on the floor or dexmedetomidine in the ICU for suspected xylazine-related autonomic symptoms, using adjuncts as needed and closely monitoring hemodynamics [^112AEEHY] [^113YiHdu] [^116UcTos]. I should confirm the micro-induction approach and yes, emerging inpatient practices support low-dose buprenorphine initiation during ongoing full agonist use to mitigate precipitated withdrawal in fentanyl-tolerant patients, with careful monitoring and symptom control [^112AEEHY].

> Let me review what is known about the composite withdrawal phenotype with and without xylazine, because I need to avoid overcalling a distinct syndrome. In small inpatient cohorts, COWS scores and heart rates were not significantly different between fentanyl-only and fentanyl–xylazine groups, though modest early increases in systolic blood pressure and higher rates of self-directed discharge were observed among xylazine-copositive patients; importantly, these findings are exploratory and many comparisons were not statistically significant, so I should not over-interpret them while still planning for engagement challenges and a longer stabilization window [^115EVEbt] [^1144EGpe]. I should double-check the implication — this supports a hybrid approach driven by clinical trajectory rather than assuming a unique xylazine withdrawal scale at this time [^114mbxE1].

> Next, I will examine the wound dimension because xylazine-associated necrotic ulcers require modified care. Xylazine is associated with distinctive, often rapidly progressive necrotic ulcers likely related to peripheral vasoconstriction and ischemia, sometimes complicated by polymicrobial infection; treatment emphasizes gentle cleansing with sterile water or saline, moist wound healing principles, timely but conservative debridement calibrated to tissue viability, and early referral to experienced wound care teams, with antibiotics guided by clinical infection and coverage for anaerobes when indicated [^114VF6n7] [^1154GoFc]. Wait, I initially leaned toward aggressive serial debridement, but I should reconsider — some clinical experiences caution that overly aggressive debridement can worsen tissue loss in vasculopathic wounds, so a measured, case-by-case approach with specialist input is safer while evidence accrues, and experimental measures like anticoagulation remain speculative with limited data [^115FPQLm] [^114VF6n7].

> I need to check the diagnostic workup for wounds and systemic exposure. Routine panels miss xylazine, so if confirmation will influence longitudinal planning or public health reporting, I should request targeted mass spectrometry, assess for superinfection, and consider a limited vasculitis screen when features are atypical; if biopsy is pursued, small-vessel vasculopathy has been described in some cases, but histopathology remains variably reported and should not delay wound-directed care [^114VF6n7] [^113WRTBv]. Hold on, I should verify the practical takeaway — clinical suspicion plus early wound specialist involvement often matters more than definitive toxicology timing for immediate management [^1154GoFc].

> For harm reduction and discharge planning, I need to ensure patients and caregivers understand that naloxone remains lifesaving for the opioid component but will not reverse xylazine, so recurrent sedation and bradycardia can persist after reversal; I should provide naloxone kits, counsel on not using alone, and discuss that fentanyl test strips do not detect xylazine while encouraging xylazine test strips or drug checking services where available and acceptable, alongside supplies for safer wound care and prompt follow-up within 48 hours when ulcers are present [^1134Pe1U] [^115pUoRV] [^1154GoFc]. I should confirm linkage to care strategies — low-barrier wound services, outreach models, and consideration of long-acting buprenorphine can reduce disengagement and self-directed discharges in this high-risk group [^112AEEHY] [^1154GoFc].

> Turning to perioperative and hospitalization considerations, I will now examine anesthetic and monitoring implications. Xylazine exposure potentiates CNS and respiratory depression with opioids and can produce bradycardia and refractory hypotension, so preoperative planning should anticipate higher sedation risk, ensure continuous cardiopulmonary monitoring, and maintain readiness with atropine, fluids, and vasopressors; postoperative vigilance for prolonged respiratory depression is prudent, and inpatient OUD care should incorporate low-dose buprenorphine initiation or rapid methadone titration with adjunctive alpha-2 agonists when indicated [^113s2QXL] [^115HHaeE] [^112AEEHY]. Wait a minute, I should verify if routine cases need telemetry — given the bradycardia and hypotension profile, even minor procedures may warrant continuous monitoring when xylazine exposure is suspected, especially with concurrent opioid use [^113s2QXL].

> But wait, what about children and neonates. Pediatric co-exposures to fentanyl and xylazine have led to severe presentations including respiratory failure, need for repeated or continuous naloxone for the opioid component, and mechanical ventilation, with xylazine detected only on specialized testing; neonatal cases with in utero exposure have manifested bradycardia, vasoconstriction, hypertonicity, and prolonged symptoms, suggesting NICU-level monitoring and potential use of alpha-2 agonists as part of a tailored withdrawal regimen alongside standard neonatal opioid withdrawal protocols [^112Ess9Y] [^111PTZyF] [^113WRTBv]. I should confirm mandatory reporting and safeguarding considerations when pediatric exposure is identified, given the medicolegal and safety implications [^112Ess9Y].

> Next, I should review the epidemiology and surveillance context because it informs pretest probability and counseling. Xylazine detection has spread widely across U.S. jurisdictions, frequently co-occurring with illicitly manufactured fentanyl; IMF-involved deaths with detected xylazine have increased substantially in recent years, with jurisdictional variability in listing xylazine as a cause of death, underscoring the need for expanded postmortem and clinical testing to clarify prevalence and risk attribution [^113WRTBv] [^112Rpr3N] [^113Yz3W6]. Hold on, I should verify the clinical takeaway — this rising background prevalence strengthens the case for default preparedness for xylazine co-exposure in fentanyl overdoses and for consistent harm reduction messaging [^1134Pe1U].

> In summary, I need to emphasize three practice shifts while staying evidence-aligned. First, from single-antidote thinking to dual-support management: give naloxone promptly for the opioid component but anticipate persistent xylazine effects requiring airway and cardiovascular support with extended monitoring. Second, from opioid-only withdrawal to a hybrid strategy: pair buprenorphine or methadone approaches adapted for fentanyl tolerance with alpha-2 agonists for suspected xylazine-related autonomic symptoms. Third, from routine wound care to proactive, specialist-informed protocols for xylazine-associated ulcers, using gentle care, infection control, and calibrated debridement while avoiding overly aggressive tissue removal in ischemic beds. Across settings, maintain high suspicion, leverage targeted testing when useful, and prioritize engagement, harm reduction, and coordinated follow-up to mitigate morbidity in this evolving mixed alpha–opioid syndrome [^1139aRhq] [^1134Pe1U] [^1154GoFc].

Yes, xylazine exposure in fentanyl overdose changes management because **naloxone does not reverse xylazine** [^1139aRhq] and patients often need **prolonged monitoring** for recurrent sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension [^1134Pe1U] [^116M1Uvp]. Clinicians should provide immediate **airway and ventilatory support** [^115HHaeE], use **fluids and vasopressors** for hemodynamic instability [^116M1Uvp], and expect longer observation or ICU care [^112AEEHY]. Xylazine-specific complications — especially **severe skin ulcers** — require early wound care and infection control [^114VF6n7] [^1154GoFc]. Withdrawal may be atypical and need alpha-2 agonists (e.g. clonidine) in addition to standard opioid withdrawal management [^116UcTos] [^1144EGpe].

---

## Pharmacological considerations

- **Fentanyl**: A potent synthetic opioid causing respiratory depression, sedation, and analgesia; effects are rapidly reversed by naloxone [^115HHaeE].

- **Xylazine**: An alpha-2 adrenergic agonist causing sedation, bradycardia, hypotension, and respiratory depression [^1139aRhq]; naloxone does not reverse its effects [^116M1Uvp].

- **Combined exposure**: Xylazine potentiates fentanyl's respiratory depression and sedation [^116M1Uvp], increasing overdose severity and complicating reversal [^1134Pe1U].

---

## Clinical implications of xylazine exposure

### Acute overdose management

- **Naloxone resistance**: Naloxone reverses fentanyl but not xylazine [^1134Pe1U]; persistent sedation and respiratory depression may occur after naloxone [^112Ess9Y].

- **Prolonged monitoring**: Xylazine's longer duration requires extended observation for recurrent sedation, bradycardia, and hypotension [^1139aRhq] [^113Yz3W6].

- **Supportive care**: Immediate airway management, ventilatory support [^115HHaeE], and hemodynamic stabilization (fluids, vasopressors) are essential [^116M1Uvp].

---

### Withdrawal management

In withdrawal management, **atypical withdrawal** may occur with xylazine, presenting as agitation, anxiety, and autonomic instability that standard opioid protocols may not address [^116UcTos] [^1144EGpe]. **Adjunctive medications** such as alpha-2 agonists (e.g. clonidine) may be needed to manage xylazine withdrawal symptoms.

---

### Complications and long-term management

- **Severe skin ulcers**: Xylazine is linked to necrotic ulcers requiring aggressive wound care, infection control, and possible surgical intervention [^114VF6n7] [^1154GoFc].

- **Infection risk**: Increased risk of secondary infections (including sepsis) necessitates early antibiotic therapy and close monitoring [^1154GoFc].

- **Prolonged sedation**: Extended sedation and respiratory depression may require longer hospital stays or ICU care [^112Ess9Y] [^113s2QXL].

---

## Recommended clinical management strategies

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|
| Acute overdose | - Administer naloxone for fentanyl [^1134Pe1U] <br/> - Provide immediate airway and ventilatory support [^115HHaeE] <br/> - Monitor for prolonged sedation, bradycardia, hypotension [^1139aRhq] [^113Yz3W6] <br/> - Use fluids and vasopressors as needed [^116M1Uvp] |
| Withdrawal management | - Use standard opioid withdrawal protocols [^112AEEHY] <br/> - Add alpha-2 agonists (e.g. clonidine) for xylazine withdrawal symptoms [^116UcTos] |
| Complications | - Aggressive wound care [^1154GoFc] <br/> - Early antibiotic therapy [^1154GoFc] <br/> - Surgical intervention if necessary <br/> - Prolonged monitoring for sedation and respiratory depression [^113s2QXL] |

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Naloxone should **always be administered** [^1134Pe1U] in suspected fentanyl-xylazine overdose, but clinicians should anticipate persistent xylazine-related sedation [^1139aRhq]. Patients require **prolonged observation** compared with typical opioid overdoses because of xylazine's prolonged effects [^116M1Uvp]. Supportive care should prioritize **airway management, ventilatory support, and hemodynamic stabilization** [^115HHaeE]. Early recognition and aggressive management of xylazine-associated ulcers are critical [^114VF6n7] [^1154GoFc].

---

## Conclusion

Xylazine co-exposure in fentanyl overdose requires **prolonged monitoring** and supportive care because naloxone does not reverse xylazine [^1139aRhq]. Management should include **airway and ventilatory support**, hemodynamic stabilization, and early wound care, with alpha-2 agonists for atypical withdrawal.

Xylazine is an animal sedative, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, that is commonly used in veterinary medicine and is not approved for human use. Since 2016, xylazine has consistently appeared in the illicitly manufactured fentanyl supply and has significantly increased in prevalence, likely due to its low cost, easy availability, and presumed synergistic psychoactive effect. Clinical experience, along with the available pertinent research, was used to review xylazine adulteration of the drug supply and provide guidance on the care of patients exposed to xylazine.

### Notes from the field: Xylazine-related deaths - Cook County, Illinois, 2017–2021 [^113Yz3W6]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). Low credibility.

Xylazine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is used in veterinary medicine as a sedative and muscle relaxant; it is not approved for use in humans. However, reports of adulteration of illicit opioids with xylazine have been increasing in the United States. In humans, xylazine can cause respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension. Typical doses of naloxone are not expected to reverse the effects of xylazine; therefore, persons who use xylazine-adulterated opioids are at high risk for fatal overdose. Although some regions of the United States have reported increases in xylazine-involved deaths, xylazine was involved in less than 2% of overdose deaths nationally in 2019.

Most xylazine-involved deaths are associated with fentanyls, including fentanyl analogs. Cook County, Illinois, is the second largest county in the United States and has a high incidence of opioid-related deaths involving fentanyl. To determine temporal trends in xylazine-involved deaths in Cook County, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office and Cook County Health analyzed suspected substance-related deaths from January 2017 to October 2021 for the presence of xylazine and co-occurring substances.

A xylazine-associated death was defined as a positive postmortem xylazine serum toxicology test result in an unintentional, undetermined, or pending intent substance-related death during January 2017–October 2021. Routine postmortem tests were conducted for other substances including fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, cocaine, and naloxone. Xylazine testing is standard in Cook County for suspected drug overdose deaths.

### Illicitly manufactured fentanyl-involved overdose deaths with detected xylazine - United States, January 2019-June 2022 [^1134Pe1U]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Among overdose deaths involving illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) where xylazine was detected, the percentage for which xylazine was listed as a cause of death ranged from none to ≥ 90% among various jurisdictions. Medical examiners and coroners may differ in whether they consider xylazine to increase fatal overdose risk or may be unfamiliar with the substance, thus not listing it on death certificates. This variation underscores the importance of collecting postmortem toxicology data on all detected drugs in overdose deaths, not solely the ones listed on death certificates, especially for emerging substances.

Although the health consequences of xylazine in humans are unclear, it can act as a central nervous system depressant and is hypothesized to potentiate the sedative effects of opioids. Within this report, xylazine detection was not associated with a higher occurrence of naloxone administration — indicating instances where naloxone was administered but failed to reverse the overdose and prevent death — or decedents presenting without a pulse, which decreases their likelihood of responding to rescue measures upon first responders' arrival. Further information is required to comprehend xylazine's impact on overdoses.

While there is no known antidote for xylazine and naloxone cannot reverse xylazine-related sedation, administering naloxone is still advised to counteract opioid effects even if xylazine is suspected, because xylazine is primarily found in IMF products that do respond to naloxone. Immediate medical care should be sought if an overdose involving opioids, xylazine, or both is suspected.

### Fentanyl citrate [^115HHaeE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Life-threatening respiratory depression is a significant risk associated with the use of opioids, including fentanyl citrate, even when used as recommended. If respiratory depression is not promptly recognized and addressed, it may progress to respiratory arrest and result in death. Therefore, adequate facilities must be available for the postoperative monitoring and ventilation of patients administered anesthetic doses of fentanyl citrate injection. These facilities should be fully equipped to manage all levels of respiratory depression. Management may involve close observation, supportive measures, and the use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status [see Overdosage (10)].

Carbon dioxide (CO2) retention, which occurs with opioid-induced respiratory depression, can enhance the sedative effects of opioids. To mitigate this risk, proper dosing and titration of fentanyl citrate injection are vital. The respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl citrate injection may last longer than its analgesic effect, underscoring the importance of considering the total dose of all opioid agonists before prescribing opioid analgesics post-anesthesia.

Furthermore, certain forms of conduction anesthesia, such as spinal and some peridural anesthetics, can impair respiration by blocking intercostal nerves. Through additional mechanisms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], fentanyl citrate injection can also affect respiration.

### Opioid rotation: The science and the limitations of the equianalgesic dose table [^111igV9p]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

Opioid rotation refers to a switch from one opioid to another in an effort to improve the response to analgesic therapy or reduce adverse effects. It is a common method to address the problem of poor opioid responsiveness despite optimal dose titration. Guidelines for opioid rotation are empirical and begin with the selection of a safe and reasonably effective starting dose for the new opioid, followed by dose adjustment to optimize the balance between analgesia and side effects.

The selection of a starting dose must be based on an estimate of the relative potency between the existing opioid and the new one. Potency, which is defined as the dose required to produce a given effect, differs widely among opioids and among individuals under varying conditions. To effectively rotate from one opioid to another, the new opioid must be started at a dose that will cause neither toxicity nor abstinence and will be sufficiently efficacious so that pain is no worse than before the change.

The estimate of relative potency used in calculating this starting dose has been codified on "equianalgesic dose tables", which historically have been based on the best science available and have been used with little modification for more than 40 years. These tables, and the clinical protocols used to apply them to opioid rotation, may need revision as the science underlying relative potency evolves. Review of these issues informs the use of opioid rotation in the clinical setting and defines key areas for future research.

### Examining the severity and progression of illicitly manufactured fentanyl withdrawal: A quasi-experimental comparison [^113YiHdu]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has largely replaced heroin throughout the United States. Characteristics of fentanyl-specific withdrawal are not well understood compared to traditional opioid withdrawal. This study examines opioid withdrawal severity among two cohorts of participants who underwent identical morphine stabilization procedures before and after fentanyl was introduced to the local drug market.

- **Methods**: The Non-Fentanyl study (n = 103) included participants testing positive for non-fentanyl opioids, and the Fentanyl study (n = 30) included participants testing positive for fentanyl. Both studies completed a 7-day morphine stabilization protocol (30 mg subcutaneous, four times daily) and multiple daily self-report and observer-rated assessments of opioid withdrawal and vital signs. Two-way repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) examined the effects of the study, time, and study × time on daily peak ratings for each outcome.

- **Results**: There were significant elevations in self-report and observer-rated withdrawal scores among the Fentanyl versus Non-Fentanyl study (study × time, P < 0.05) during stabilization days 2–5 and days 2–6, respectively. There was a higher rate of tachycardia among the Fentanyl group compared to the Non-Fentanyl study, and peak diastolic blood pressure was greater among the Fentanyl study compared to the Non-Fentanyl study.

- **Conclusions**: Individuals with fentanyl exposure were less stabilized by morphine and experienced more severe opioid withdrawal via several metrics compared to those with non-fentanyl opioid exposure.

### Xylazine-induced acute skin necrosis in two patients who inject fentanyl [^114VF6n7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

As xylazine use rises, adverse effects are being seen in clinical settings. Xylazine-associated skin ulcers have been newly reported in the literature. Though it is unclear how xylazine induces necrosis, one proposed mechanism is local vasoconstriction secondary to alpha-2-agonist properties, resulting in poor perfusion and increased susceptibility to inflammation and secondary infection.

Physicians should maintain a high level of suspicion of xylazine exposure in patients with fentanyl use, particularly when acute skin necrosis is localized to injection sites. Diagnosis can be challenging since xylazine is not included in routine toxicology testing, but specialized testing for xylazine levels is available, as in our second case. Ruling out underlying vasculitis and infection with broad serologic workup is imperative. If there is recent cocaine ingestion, levamisole-induced vasculopathy/vasculitis should be considered.

There are limited data characterizing histopathologic features of xylazine-induced cutaneous necrosis. We hypothesize that small vessel vasculopathy may be a contributing feature given the drug's mechanism and resultant skin necrosis. However, this was only seen in one case, so it remains unclear. Since the mechanism is uncertain, treatment options are limited. With vasculopathy, a trial of anticoagulation may mitigate cutaneous damage, but further data are needed to substantiate this proposed treatment modality. Prompt local wound care is recommended for the recovery of affected skin.

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^115EVEbt]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Xylazine is not approved for human use, yet it has emerged as a common adulterant of illicit fentanyl. It is currently unclear whether there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with xylazine and the potential impact of fentanyl coexposure.

- **Methods**: A retrospective cohort study of patients with opioid use disorder admitted to an inpatient medically monitored withdrawal facility was performed. Patients positive for fentanyl were compared to patients copositive for fentanyl and xylazine. Outcomes were self-directed discharge and completion of treatment. Independent variables included Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores, heart rate, and blood pressure. Associations between individuals with or without xylazine were measured.

- **Results**: Among 71 patients admitted for opioid withdrawal management positive for fentanyl, 51.4% were copositive with xylazine. There was no difference detected in average COWS scores (P = 0.12–0.78) or average heart rate (P = 0.33–0.80) between groups. Xylazine copositive patients had higher average systolic blood pressure on days 1 (129.0 vs 123.0, P = 0.01) and 2 (127.9 vs 116.3, P = 0.04) although unclear if clinically meaningful. Individuals copositive for xylazine were less likely to complete treatment (43.2% vs 55.9%, P = 0.23) and more likely to have self-directed discharge (67.6% vs 44.1%; OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.0–6.9) although not statistically significant.

- **Conclusions**: Among 71 patients admitted for medically monitored withdrawal, individuals who were copositive for xylazine at the time of admission had higher average blood.

Note: The conclusions section appears incomplete and may need further clarification from the original source.

### Xylazine-associated wounds: Clinical experience from a low-barrier wound care clinic in Philadelphia [^1154GoFc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The veterinary sedative xylazine is spreading in unregulated opioid supplies across North America. Among people who use drugs with repeated exposure to xylazine, a distinct wound type has emerged. Here, we describe these wounds and share our experience treating them in a nurse-led, low-barrier wound care clinic in Philadelphia, PA. We propose a reimagining of wound treatment across settings to better serve people who use drugs, and we advocate for stronger protections against the harms of an increasingly adulterated drug supply. Our perspective from the epicenter of the xylazine crisis can inform the response of communities across the country who are starting to face harms associated with xylazine.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^115CTqf5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The fentanyl transdermal system is contraindicated in various situations:

- **Patients who are not opioid-tolerant**: This medication should not be used in patients who have not developed a tolerance to opioids.

- **Management of acute or intermittent pain**: It is not suitable for the management of acute or intermittent pain, or for patients who require opioid analgesia for a short period.

- **Post-operative pain**: The fentanyl transdermal system should not be used in the management of post-operative pain, including after outpatient or day surgeries, such as tonsillectomies.

- **Mild pain**: The medication is contraindicated for the management of mild pain.

- **Significant respiratory depression**: Patients with significant respiratory depression should avoid this system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

- **Acute or severe bronchial asthma**: It is contraindicated in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in unmonitored settings or without resuscitative equipment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

- **Gastrointestinal obstruction**: Patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, including paralytic ileus, should not use this system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.19)].

- **Hypersensitivity to fentanyl**: The system is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to fentanyl (e.g. anaphylaxis) or any components of the transdermal system [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

### SPL drug information for fentanyl citrate [^111LAPJS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fentanyl citrate intranasally (also known as Actiq, Fentora) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, use only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, and monitor neonates for respiratory and CNS depression. A specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, should be available for reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Additionally, monitor the neonate for withdrawal symptoms, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep patterns, high-pitched crying, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight. The onset, duration, and severity of opioid withdrawal may vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination by the newborn.

### Emergence of xylazine as a public health threat: What does the anesthesiologist need to know for perioperative care [^113s2QXL]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

This paper explores the rapid emergence of xylazine exposure in the United States and its implications for anesthesiologists. Xylazine, a non-opioid sedative and analgesic often used in veterinary medicine, has increasingly been found as an adulterant in the illicit substance supply, leading to serious health implications. The pharmacological properties of xylazine, its clinical effects, and the challenges it poses for clinicians are discussed. Perioperative strategies for anesthesiologists to manage these potential cases are provided. Furthermore, this paper emphasizes the need for an epidemiological understanding for detection and multidisciplinary collaboration in addressing this emerging public health threat. The manuscript concludes by highlighting the role anesthesiologists will have to play in managing the clinical implications of xylazine and contributing to public health strategies aimed at curbing its misuse.

### Caring for hospitalized adults with opioid use disorder in the era of fentanyl: A review [^112AEEHY]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The rise of fentanyl and other high-potency synthetic opioids across the US and Canada has been associated with increasing hospitalizations and unprecedented overdose deaths. Hospitalization is a critical touchpoint to engage patients and offer life-saving opioid use disorder (OUD) care when admitted for OUD or other medical conditions.

Clinical best practices include managing acute withdrawal and pain, initiating medication for OUD, integrating harm reduction principles and practices, addressing in-hospital substance use, and supporting hospital-to-community care transitions. Fentanyl complicates hospital OUD care, as its high potency intensifies pain, withdrawal, and cravings, increasing the risk for overdose and other harms. Fentanyl's unique pharmacology has rendered traditional techniques for managing opioid withdrawal and initiating buprenorphine and methadone inadequate for some patients, necessitating novel strategies. Furthermore, the co-use of opioids with stimulant drugs is common, and the opioid supply is unpredictable and can be contaminated with benzodiazepines, xylazine, and other substances.

To address these challenges, clinicians are increasingly relying on emerging practices, such as low-dose buprenorphine initiation with opioid continuation, rapid methadone titration, and the use of alternative opioid agonists. Hospitals must also reconsider conventional approaches to in-hospital substance use and expand clinicians' understanding and embrace harm reduction, which is a philosophy and set of practical strategies that support people.

### Notes from the field: Xylazine-related deaths - Cook County, Illinois, 2017–2021 [^11611wFC]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2022). High credibility.

These findings highlight a concerning trend in xylazine-involved deaths in Cook County, Illinois. Increased monitoring and public education within Cook County are warranted, along with expanded surveillance in other jurisdictions, particularly those where fentanyl use is highly prevalent. These findings can guide overdose prevention and response efforts because naloxone has not been shown to reverse the effects of xylazine. Although a specific antidote is not available for xylazine, naloxone should still be administered in suspected cases of potentially fatal overdose since most cases co-occur with opioids.

Cardiovascular and respiratory support are critical to managing serious xylazine toxicity. Health care providers should be made aware that suspected fentanyl overdose cases refractory to naloxone administration might involve xylazine toxicity. The designation of xylazine as a controlled substance has occurred in some states and would be an important policy to consider more broadly. Furthermore, expanded postmortem testing for xylazine and co-occurring substances across jurisdictions could better define the role of xylazine in opioid-related deaths.

### The effects of i.v. fentanyl administration on the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane in horses [^113ZrMAH]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Fentanyl decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of inhaled anesthetics and has been used clinically to reduce the requirements of other anesthetic drugs in humans and small animals. We hypothesized that i.v. fentanyl would decrease the MAC of isoflurane in horses in a dose-dependent manner.

- **Methods**: Following determination of baseline MAC of isoflurane, fentanyl was administered i.v. to target plasma concentrations of 1, 8, and 16 ng ml(-1). Each horse was randomly assigned two of three target concentrations administered in ascending order. Loading and infusion doses for each horse were determined from previously derived individual pharmacokinetic values. Isoflurane MAC determination began 45 minutes after fentanyl administration at each target fentanyl concentration. Venous blood was collected at fixed intervals during the infusion for measurement of plasma fentanyl concentrations.

- **Results**: Mean actual fentanyl plasma concentrations were 0 (baseline), and 0.72 (SD 0.26), 8.43 (3.22), and 13.31 (6.66) ng ml(-1) for the target concentrations of 1, 8, and 16 ng ml(-1), respectively. The corresponding isoflurane MAC values were a baseline of 1.57 (0.23), and 1.51 (0.24), 1.41 (0.23), and 1.37 (0.09)%, respectively. The fentanyl concentrations of 0.72 and 8.43 ng ml(-1) did not significantly alter the MAC of isoflurane, but an 18 (7)% ISO-MAC reduction was observed at the 13.31 ng ml(-1) concentration.

- **Conclusions**: These results cautiously encourage further study of fentanyl as an opioid anesthetic adjunct to inhalant anesthesia in horses.

### Management of xylazine withdrawal in a hospitalized patient: A case report [^116UcTos]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Xylazine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist commonly used as a large animal anesthetic. It is used as an adulterant in illicit opioids, and it is now well established that its synergistic effect with opioids increases lethality. The amount of xylazine adulterating illicit opioids is growing at an alarming rate, present in almost one-third of opioid overdose deaths reported in Philadelphia in 2019. Despite this, there are no reports considering the management of patients using xylazine chronically. In particular, there are no reported cases detailing the management of xylazine withdrawal or exploring the potential for ongoing treatment for those in recovery from xylazine use.

- **Case summary**: We present the case of a 29-year-old female with opioid use disorder and chronic xylazine use, admitted to the intensive care unit for the treatment of chronic lower extremity wounds thought to be due to xylazine injection. Her xylazine withdrawal was managed with a combination of dexmedetomidine infusion, phenobarbital, and tizanidine, later transitioned to clonidine. By hospital day 4, she was no longer experiencing withdrawal symptoms. She was transitioned from full-agonist opioids for pain to buprenorphine via a buprenorphine "micro-induction" and was ultimately discharged on buprenorphine, clonidine, and gabapentin on day 19 of admission.

- **Clinical significance**: This case illustrates a potential treatment pathway that allows for safe and comfortable xylazine withdrawal in hospitalized patients. It also provides an introduction to several medical concerns affecting this patient.

### Notes from the field: Xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer, identified as an emerging novel substance in drug overdose deaths - Connecticut, 2019–2020 [^116M1Uvp]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2021). High credibility.

These findings demonstrate a rising prevalence of xylazine-involved unintentional overdose deaths in Connecticut. The combination of xylazine with opioids or other recreational drugs might increase their toxic effects by potentiating sedation and causing respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. Awareness among health care professionals of issues related to xylazine is important because xylazine intoxication is unaffected by standard doses of naloxone, which is the usual treatment for suspected opioid intoxication. Xylazine intoxication might require additional interventions and appropriate supportive measures, which include blood pressure support with intravenous fluids, atropine, and extended hospital observation because of cardiac effects. The effects of xylazine when combined with fentanyl, heroin, or cocaine need further research to clarify adverse interactions.

### Tranq dope: Characterization of an ED cohort treated with a novel opioid withdrawal protocol in the era of fentanyl/xylazine [^1157bUN2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Treating opioid use disorder has reached a new level of challenge. Synthetic opioids and xylazine have joined the non-medical opioid supply, multiplying the complexities of caring for individuals in emergency departments (ED). This combination, known as "tranq dope", is poorly described in literature. Inadequate withdrawal treatment results in a disproportionately high rate of patient-directed discharges, also known as against medical advice dispositions (AMA). This study aimed to describe a cohort of individuals who received a novel order set for suspected fentanyl and xylazine withdrawal in the ED.

- **Methods**: This is a descriptive study evaluating a cohort of ED patients who received withdrawal medications from a novel protocol and electronic health record order set. Individuals being assessed in the ED while suffering from withdrawal were eligible. Individuals under age 18, on stable outpatient MOUD, or who were pregnant were excluded. Treatment strategies included micro-induction buprenorphine, short-acting opioids, non-opioid analgesics, and other adjunctive medications. Data collected included demographics such as zip code, urine toxicology screening, order set utilization, and disposition data. Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores were recorded, where available, before and following exposure to the medications.

- **Results**: There were 270 patient encounters that occurred between September 14, 2022, and March 9, 2023, included in the total study cohort. Of those, 66% were male, with a mean age of 37. Additionally, 71% resided within Philadelphia zip codes.

### Xylazine complicating opioid ingestions in young children [^112Ess9Y]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

The authors of this report present three cases of synthetic opioid intoxication complicated by the concomitant presence of the additive xylazine, a non-opioid sedative analgesic and muscle relaxant used in veterinary medicine that potentiates respiratory depression associated with the opioid toxidrome. Three exposed children presented with severe signs and symptoms, two of whom experienced cardiac arrest, required continuous naloxone infusion or multiple naloxone doses, or needed mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory failure after their exposures. Additives were detected in urine studies only through the performance of specialized toxicology testing.

Detection of xylazine among adult overdose deaths has recently increased sharply, particularly across the northeastern United States. Adulteration by xylazine is an emerging public health threat nationally. Our report reveals that pediatricians should be aware of sentinel drug trends among adults, including the emerging types of illicit, synthetic, or counterfeit formulations of recreational substances, because children may be harmed due to accidental or intentional exposure.

Children exposed to dangerous substances also need child protection services that may entail safe relocation outside of the home and the referral of affected caregivers to necessary substance use treatment services. Given epidemic drug use among adults, pediatricians should be competent to recognize common toxidromes and be aware that signs and symptoms may be potentiated by synergistic novel additives or polysubstance exposures.

### Pilot testing fentanyl test strip distribution in an emergency department setting: Experiences, lessons learned, and suggestions from staff [^113y2fJN]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Fentanyl test strips (FTSs) are increasingly used to address fentanyl contamination of the illicit drug supply. They allow people who use drugs (PWUD) to engage in overdose prevention by testing a drug for the presence of fentanyl. While emergency departments (EDs) have implemented various harm reduction strategies for PWUD, at the time of writing, distribution of FTSs in EDs is limited and not evaluated. Thus, we sought to explore ED staff experiences distributing FTSs.

Twenty-one staff members serving different roles (e.g. physician, nurse, technician, social worker, certified recovery specialist) within two urban EDs in a major metropolitan area were enrolled in a pilot study to distribute FTSs to patients who use drugs. Participants were interviewed about their experience at three weeks and again at three months. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using a conventional content analysis approach.

All participants endorsed the utility of FTS distribution in the ED. Across 42 interviews, participants discussed evolving strategies to approach patients about FTS, primarily favorable patient reactions to FTSs, improved dynamics between participants and patients, mixed intervention support from other staff, and identified challenges of FTS distribution and recommendations to make FTS distribution in the ED widespread. Recommendations included medical records prompts to offer FTS, offering via different types of staff, and offering FTS during triage.

Implementing FTS distribution may improve patient rapport while providing patients with tools to avoid overdose.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^113GEyCL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Addiction, abuse, and misuse**: Fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance. As an opioid, the fentanyl transdermal system exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Because modified-release products such as the fentanyl transdermal system deliver the opioid over an extended period of time, there is a greater risk for overdose and death due to the larger amount of fentanyl present [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9)].

Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed the fentanyl transdermal system. Addiction can occur at recommended doses and if the drug is misused or abused.

Assess each patient's risk for opioid addiction, abuse, or misuse prior to prescribing the fentanyl transdermal system, and reassess all patients receiving it for the development of these behaviors and conditions. Risks are increased in patients with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including drug or alcohol abuse or addiction) or mental illness (e.g. major depression). The potential for these risks should not, however, prevent the proper management of pain in any given patient. Patients at increased risk may be prescribed opioids such as the fentanyl transdermal system, but use in such patients necessitates intensive counseling about the risks and proper use of the system along with frequent reevaluation for signs of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.

### Widespread distribution of xylazine detected throughout the United States in healthcare patient samples [^113WRTBv]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Xylazine is a tranquilizer commonly added to the illicit drug supply and a likely contributor to overdoses because it does not respond to naloxone reversal. This study performed a retrospective data analysis on xylazine-positive samples collected from patients in various outpatient healthcare settings to illustrate geographic distribution and common copositive substances, which may also contribute to the risk of adverse events.

- **Methods**: Samples, for which providers ordered testing for xylazine, were subjected to enzymatic hydrolysis, extracted, and analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Retrospective analysis was performed on xylazine-positive samples collected from April 2021 to March 2022, to include geographic location and copositive substances.

- **Results**: Xylazine was identified in 413 of 59,498 samples from adults aged 20–73 years and originated from 25 of the 39 states where xylazine testing was ordered. The most common routine substances detected with xylazine were fentanyl, buprenorphine, naloxone, cocaine, d-methamphetamine, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. The most common designer drugs detected included fentanyl analogs, isotonitazene, and designer benzodiazepines.

- **Conclusions**: Xylazine is geographically spread throughout the United States, indicating a wide incorporation into the illicit drug supply. These findings differ from previous studies in that these samples originated from healthcare providers in routine care settings, where other reports typically involve overdose deaths.

### Opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in delirious cancer patients: an open-label trial [^111tq1HN]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2005). Low credibility.

Although recent studies suggest that opioid rotation could be an effective treatment strategy for morphine-induced delirium, there have been no prospective studies to investigate the treatment effects of opioid rotation using fentanyl. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of opioid rotation from morphine to fentanyl in symptom palliation of morphine-induced delirium. Twenty-one consecutive cancer patients with morphine-induced delirium underwent opioid rotation to fentanyl.

Physicians recorded the symptom severity of delirium using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), pain, and other symptoms on a categorical verbal scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), and the Schedule for Team Assessment Scale (STAS), from 0 (none) to 4 (extreme), as well as performance status at the time of study enrollment and three and seven days after. Of the 21 patients recruited, one patient did not complete the study. In the remaining 20 patients, morphine was substituted with transdermal fentanyl in 9 patients and parenteral fentanyl in 11 patients. Total opioid dose increased from 64 mg oral morphine equivalent/day (Day 0) to 98 mg/day (Day 7), with a median increase of 42%.

Treatment success, defined as an MDAS score below 10 and a pain score of 2 or less, was achieved in 13 patients on Day 3 and 18 patients on Day 7. The mean MDAS score significantly decreased from 14 (Day 0) to 6.4 and 3.6 on Days 3 and 7, respectively (P < 0.001). Pain scores significantly decreased from 2.2 (Day 0) to 1.3 and 1.1 on the categorical verbal scale on Days 3 and 7, respectively (P < 0.001).

### Fentanyl activates ovarian cancer and alleviates chemotherapy-induced toxicity via opioid receptor-dependent activation of EGFR [^112wPNjq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Low credibility.

Fentanyl is an opioid analgesic widely used in ovarian cancer patients for pain management. Although increasing evidence has suggested the direct role of fentanyl on cancer, little is known about the effect of fentanyl on ovarian cancer cells.

- **Methods**: Proliferation, migration, and apoptosis assays were performed in ovarian cancer cells after fentanyl treatment. A xenograft mouse model was generated to investigate the in vivo efficacy of fentanyl. The combination index was analyzed for the combination of fentanyl and chemotherapeutic drugs. An immunoblotting approach was used to analyze signaling involved in fentanyl's action, focusing on EGFR.

- **Results**: Fentanyl at nanomolar concentrations dose-dependently increased migration and proliferation of a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. At the same concentrations, fentanyl either did not stimulate or stimulated proliferation to a lesser extent in normal cells compared to ovarian cancer cells. Consistently, fentanyl significantly promoted ovarian cancer growth in vivo. The combination of fentanyl with cisplatin or paclitaxel was antagonistic in inhibiting cell proliferation. Although fentanyl did not affect cell apoptosis, it significantly alleviated ovarian cancer cell death induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, fentanyl specifically activated EGFR and its mediated downstream pathways. Knockdown of EGFR abolished the stimulatory effects of fentanyl on ovarian cancer cells. It was finally demonstrated that the activation of EGFR by fentanyl is associated with the opioid µ receptor system.

- **Conclusions**: Fentanyl activates ovarian cancer cells and alleviates chemotherapy-induced toxicity through opioid receptor-dependent activation of EGFR.

### Neonate with intrauterine xylazine exposure: A case report [^111PTZyF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Fentanyl is a rising cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, affecting neonates exposed in utero. Xylazine, an alpha-2 receptor agonist, is a non-narcotic sedative that is becoming an increasingly common adulterant. There are case reports describing the clinical manifestations of xylazine exposure and toxicity in adult populations; however, cases involving neonatal populations are not described in the literature. Limitations of toxicology analyses for neonates cause delays in the identification and treatment of affected patients.

- **Case summary**: We present the case of a term neonate who presented to the neonatal intensive care unit with a strong foul-smelling odor, diffuse rash, hypertonicity, irritability, and inconsolability. This case describes additional symptoms that presented over the subsequent 120 hours of life, including sustained bradycardia, significant peripheral vasoconstriction, and focalization of odor to breath, urine, feces, and umbilical stump. Mass spectroscopy toxicology of the neonate's serum confirmed the presence of methamphetamine, fentanyl, multiple fentanyl metabolites, and xylazine. Management strategies are discussed, including the role of alpha-2 receptor agonists in treating withdrawal.

- **Clinical significance**: This case report presents clinical manifestations of xylazine toxicity and withdrawal in neonatal populations and highlights the need for additional attention on the effects of adulterants to improve management strategies. There is a need for improved toxicology testing to identify affected populations in a timely manner.

### Research priorities to improve treatment of patients exposed to xylazine-fentanyl: Rapid communication from a National Institute on Drug Abuse Center for the Clinical Trials Network meeting [^114mbxE1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In response to the rapid escalation in the detection of xylazine in the unregulated drug supply, in April 2023, the White House designated fentanyl contaminated with xylazine an "emerging threat". The National Institute on Drug Abuse Center for Clinical Trials Network convened a multidisciplinary meeting of stakeholders, federal staff members, researchers, and clinicians caring for patients with fentanyl and xylazine exposures. This convening focused on the most critical areas of concern with the goal of describing practices and a xylazine-fentanyl research agenda.

- **Epidemiology and laboratory detection**: Discussions focused on the challenges in identifying and detecting xylazine in clinical and laboratory settings.

- **Xylazine withdrawal and overdose**: There was a significant focus on understanding the withdrawal and overdose risk associated with xylazine when used in combination with fentanyl.

- **Dermal manifestations**: The physical and dermatological effects resulting from xylazine exposure were examined, highlighting the need for further research in this area.

The authors were involved in planning and moderating the program and providing a summary of the proceedings.

### Optimizing the dosing regimen during rotation from subcutaneous to transdermal administration of fentanyl [^114Z7Giu]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2024). Low credibility.

Subcutaneous (SC) administration of fentanyl allows for rapid dose titration to treat urgent cancer-related pain. After establishing the optimal fentanyl dose, patients typically rotate towards transdermal (TD) fentanyl patches. Continuing the SC fentanyl up to 12 hours after application of the patch led to elevated fentanyl concentrations and fentanyl-related toxicities. Based on these findings and simulations using a pharmacokinetic (PK) model, SC fentanyl administration was discontinued immediately following the application of the patch.

- **Objectives**: To validate the fentanyl rotation schedule by assessing the PK equivalence in fentanyl exposure before and after rotation.

- **Methods**: PK samples and clinical data were prospectively collected from 12 hours prior to rotation until 12 hours after rotation in patients with cancer-related pain undergoing fentanyl rotation.

- **Results**: Between December 2021 and September 2023, 29 evaluable patients were enrolled in the study. The 90% confidence interval (CI) of the geometric mean ratio between the post- over pre-rotation area under the curve (AUC) fell within the pre-specified 0.8–1.25 equivalence interval (90% CI 1.05–1.16). Patient-reported intensity of both nausea (P = 0.047) and transpiration (P = 0.034) decreased post-rotation. Pain intensity and other adverse events did not differ significantly pre- and post-rotation. One patient needed adjustment of opioid therapy 40 hours after rotation due to fentanyl-related toxicities.

- **Conclusion**: The updated rotation scheme, implying a 1:1 dose conversion and discontinuation of SC fentanyl immediately following TD patch application, may help optimize fentanyl administration in cancer-related pain management.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^113cGn2v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The fentanyl transdermal system is indicated for the management of severe and persistent pain in opioid-tolerant patients that requires an extended treatment period with a daily opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Patients considered opioid-tolerant are those who, for one week or longer, are taking at least 60 mg of morphine per day, 25 mcg of transdermal fentanyl per hour, 30 mg of oral oxycodone per day, 8 mg of oral hydromorphone per day, 25 mg of oral oxymorphone per day, 60 mg of oral hydrocodone per day, or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid.

- **Limitations of use**: Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse associated with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, and due to the increased risks of overdose and death with extended-release/long-acting opioid formulations, reserve the fentanyl transdermal system for patients for whom alternative treatment options (e.g. non-opioid analgesics or immediate-release opioids) are ineffective, not tolerated, or inadequate for sufficient pain management. The fentanyl transdermal system is not indicated as an as-needed (prn) analgesic.

The fentanyl transdermal system contains fentanyl, an opioid agonist, and is designed for the management of severe and persistent pain in opioid-tolerant patients that requires extended treatment with a daily opioid analgesic, for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^114XsRiU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Proper administration of fentanyl transdermal systems is crucial to prevent serious adverse outcomes, including death, associated with accidental secondary exposure to the fentanyl transdermal system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

- **Application and handling instructions**: Patients should apply the fentanyl transdermal system to intact, non-irritated, and non-irradiated skin on flat surfaces such as the chest, back, flank, or upper arm. In young children and persons with cognitive impairment, adhesion should be monitored, and the upper back is the preferred location to minimize inappropriate patch removal.

	- Hair at the application site may be clipped (not shaved) prior to system application. If the application site must be cleaned prior to patch application, use clear water. Avoid soaps, oils, lotions, alcohol, or any other agents that might irritate the skin or alter its characteristics. Allow the skin to dry completely before applying the patch.

	- Patients should apply the fentanyl transdermal system immediately upon removal from the sealed package. The patch must not be altered (e.g. cut) in any way prior to application. Do not use if the pouch seal is broken or if the patch is cut or damaged. Press the transdermal system firmly in place with the palm of the hand for 30 seconds, ensuring complete contact, especially around the edges.

### Illicitly manufactured fentanyl-involved overdose deaths with detected xylazine - United States, January 2019-June 2022 [^112Rpr3N]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Low credibility.

In 2022, provisional data indicated that more than two-thirds (68%) of the reported 107,081 drug overdose deaths in the United States involved synthetic opioids other than methadone, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyls (IMFs). Xylazine, a nonopioid sedative not approved for human use and with no known antidote, has been increasingly detected in IMF products in the U.S. drug supply and in IMF-involved overdose deaths. Limited studies suggest xylazine can cause central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension in humans; chronic use might lead to severe withdrawal symptoms as well as skin ulcerations.

This report uses data from the CDC's State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) to describe IMF-involved overdose deaths, with and without xylazine detected, that occurred during January 2019 to June 2022. Among 21 jurisdictions, which included 20 states and the District of Columbia, the monthly percentage of IMF-involved deaths with xylazine detected increased by 276%, from 2.9% to 10.9%. Among IMF-involved deaths during January 2021 to June 2022 in 32 jurisdictions, xylazine was detected in a higher percentage of jurisdictions in the Northeast U.S. Census Bureau region; listing detected xylazine as a cause of death varied across jurisdictions. Expanded postmortem and illicit drug product testing for xylazine is needed to clarify its prevalence in drug supplies. Further investigation of xylazine's effects on humans is necessary to characterize morbidity and overdose risk. It is important for overdose prevention initiatives to consider these factors.

### Xylazine exposures reported to Texas poison centers [^112pC1qP]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Xylazine is a sedative, analgesic, anesthetic, and central muscle relaxant approved for animals but not humans. Although xylazine is an emerging drug of abuse, there are limited data on potentially adverse exposures to the drug.

- **Objectives**: The intent of this study was to describe potentially adverse xylazine exposures reported to a large poison center system.

- **Methods**: All xylazine exposures reported to Texas poison centers between 2000 and 2014 were included. The distribution of cases by selected variables was determined.

- **Results**: Of 76 total cases, 93% of the patients were aged 20 years or older, and 54% were male. Fifty-one percent of the exposures occurred by injection, 28% by ingestion, 16% were dermal, 14% were ocular, and 3% by inhalation. Sixty-four percent of the exposures were unintentional, 32% were intentional, and 1% each was related to malicious use and adverse reactions. Sixty-seven percent of the patients were already at or en route to a healthcare facility when the poison center was contacted, 21% were managed on-site, and 9% were referred to a healthcare facility. The most common clinical effects were drowsiness or lethargy (47%), bradycardia (20%), hypotension (11%), hypertension (9%), puncture or wound (8%), and slurred speech (8%).

- **Conclusion**: Xylazine exposures tended to involve adult males, were typically unintentional, and most often occurred by injection. Most of the patients were already at or en route to a healthcare facility when a poison center was contacted. The most frequently reported adverse effects were [text content incomplete].

### A new pharmacological approach for tracheal intubation [^113wUhpK]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Anaesthesia induced with remimazolam and a fentanyl-series opioid can be reversed with flumazenil and naloxone. Concomitant paralysis with rocuronium can facilitate tracheal intubation while being reversible with sugammadex. Together, this combination might offer full reversibility of a "routine" or a "rapid-sequence" induction anaesthesia. Whether this is useful or even safe requires careful evaluation.

### The two sides of opioids: The subtle boundary between medication and abuse [^1125LY8S]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Low credibility.

The main issue related to opioid use lies in their prolonged administration, which, in most cases, can lead to addiction in the patient. When opioids bind to their receptors, the release of endorphins causes a temporary pleasant feeling; once this feeling fades, it evokes an overwhelming desire to take more drugs. In addition, prolonged opioid administration can cause tolerance to the drug, resulting in a constant need to increase the dosage. The misuse of opioids is reported to cause 0.35 million deaths per year, attributed to drug use disorders, with overdose accounting for 30% of these deaths worldwide.

In the last 20 years, opioid overdose deaths in North America have risen due to the so-called opioid crisis, marking the start of the largest opioids epidemic that continues to grow worldwide. In the United States, opioids have not only been prescribed to patients affected by severe pain but have also been frequently prescribed to those suffering from headaches or back pain. Consequently, the total number of people exposed to opioids has soared, as have addiction and dependence. Furthermore, this overprescription trend coincides with a rise in overdose deaths, mainly caused by fentanyl and tramadol in the United States from 2010 to 2019. A similar trend has been observed in England, where opioid prescriptions increased by 34% between 1998 and the present. It is estimated that the global number of people using opioids increased from 30 million to 60 million from 2010 to 2019.

Opioids are produced by only three countries: Afghanistan (83% of global production), Myanmar (7%), and Mexico (6%). In the period of 1998–2020, the trade of opioids…

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^113vCyuK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

These exploratory findings suggest that xylazine may be associated with higher SBP during early abstinence; however, the absolute increase in SBP was not clinically significant. Xylazine presence was correlated with increased rates of SDD. It is important for future studies to more rigorously study the effects of xylazine cessation and to better characterize any "xylazine withdrawal syndrome" in order to improve treatment for patients exposed to xylazine.

### Illicitly manufactured fentanyl-involved overdose deaths with detected xylazine - United States, January 2019-June 2022 [^115kggwb]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). High credibility.

Routine toxicology testing for xylazine in suspected overdose cases is critical for accurate surveillance, and further investigation of xylazine's potency and effects on humans is needed to clarify morbidity and overdose risks and to guide prevention and response efforts. Insight into motivations for adding xylazine to IMF products, and whether persons actively seek xylazine, could help anticipate future drug supply changes and tailor prevention and response efforts. Examining overdose mortality data in conjunction with other data sources, such as drug seizure and nonfatal overdose data, could provide further information about short- and long-term effects of xylazine use.

Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)]. Because the risk of overdose increases as opioid doses increase, reserve titration to higher doses of Fentora for patients in whom lower doses are insufficiently effective and in whom the expected benefits of using a higher dose opioid clearly outweigh the substantial risks. It is important to minimize the number of strengths available to patients at any time to prevent confusion and possible overdose.

There is variability in the opioid analgesic dose and duration needed to adequately manage pain due both to the cause of pain and to individual patient factors. Initiate the dosing regimen for each patient individually, taking into account the patient's severity of pain, patient response, prior analgesic treatment experience, and risk factors for addiction, abuse, and misuse [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Respiratory depression can occur at any time during opioid therapy, especially when initiating and following dosage increases with Fentora. Consider this risk when selecting an initial dose and when making dose adjustments [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

Instruct patients and caregivers to take steps to store Fentora securely and to properly dispose of unused Fentora.

### Novel opioid analgesics for the development of transdermal opioid patches that possess morphine-like pharmacological profiles rather than fentanyl: Possible opioid switching alternatives among patch formula [^115Fj95R]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Transdermal fentanyl is widely used in the treatment of severe pain due to its convenience, safety, and ability to maintain stable blood concentrations. Nevertheless, patients often develop tolerance to fentanyl, necessitating the use of other opioids. The transdermal buprenorphine patch is widely used as an analgesic agent, though its available formulation does not provide an analgesic effect comparable to that of the transdermal fentanyl patch. Opioids bind to the opioid receptor (OR) to activate both G protein-mediated and β-arrestin-mediated pathways. We synthesized morphine-related compounds with high transdermal absorbability, referred to as N1 and N2, and evaluated their OR activities pharmacologically in comparison with fentanyl and morphine.

- **Methods**: In cells stably expressing μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and κ-opioid receptor (KOR), G protein-mediated pathways were assessed using the CellKey and an intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assay. β-arrestin-mediated pathways were analyzed with β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization assays. Furthermore, analgesic effects were evaluated using a tail-flick test in mice, including those tolerant to fentanyl.

- **Results**: In the CellKey and cAMP assays, both N1 and N2 showed the highest affinity for MOR and acted as full agonists, as well as partial agonists for DOR and KOR. In the β-arrestin and internalization assays, only fentanyl acted as a full agonist, while N1 and N2 acted as partial agonists of MOR. In the mouse tail-flick test, N1 and N2 showed analgesic effects equivalent to those of fentanyl.

### Groundbreaking research from NIDA addressing the challenges of the opioid epidemic [^115FPQLm]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2025). Low credibility.

Xylazine was predominantly reported in the Northeast in 2019 as a contaminant in fentanyl. Since then, its use has proliferated. Xylazine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist used as a sedative-hypnotic in veterinary medicine. While it increases the volume of the drug being injected, it is also pharmacologically active. Many individuals dislike its effects. However, some users prefer it because they claim that, when added to fentanyl, its effects last longer. The combination of xylazine and fentanyl extends the effects on respiration and hypoxemia, dramatically reducing blood oxygen concentration, which is relevant for mortality and neurotoxicity due to repeated hypoxemia episodes to the brain.

About three years ago, severe wounds were observed in fentanyl/xylazine users that developed rapidly. Physicians began debriding these wounds to preserve and clean tissue, often resulting in amputation. Consequently, they ceased debridement. Interestingly, the wounds sometimes appeared away from the injection site. Administering an alpha agonist can cause vasoconstriction in peripheral systems, raising concerns about its impact on mortality risk, which is generally believed to be adverse.

- **Wastewater testing**: One initiative from our translational program, started before COVID-19, aimed to expand the use of wastewater testing for drug monitoring in communities.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^1127MHoN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

There are no standard opioid tapering schedules that are suitable for all patients. Good clinical practice dictates a patient-specific plan to gradually taper the opioid dose. For patients on the fentanyl transdermal system who are physically opioid-dependent, initiate the taper by a small enough increment (e.g. no greater than 25% of the total daily dose) to avoid withdrawal symptoms, and proceed with dose-lowering at an interval of every 2 to 4 weeks. Patients who have been taking opioids for shorter periods may tolerate a more rapid taper.

It may be necessary to provide the patient with a lower dosage strength to accomplish a successful taper. Reassess the patient frequently to manage pain and withdrawal symptoms should they emerge. Common withdrawal symptoms include restlessness, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, yawning, perspiration, chills, myalgia, and mydriasis. Other signs and symptoms may also develop, including irritability, anxiety, backache, joint pain, weakness, abdominal cramps, insomnia, nausea, anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, or increased blood pressure, respiratory rate, or heart rate. If withdrawal symptoms arise, it may be necessary to pause the taper for a period or increase the dose of the opioid analgesic to the previous dose before proceeding with a slower taper. Additionally, evaluate patients for any changes in mood, emergence of suicidal thoughts, or use of other substances.

When managing patients taking opioid analgesics, particularly those who have been treated for an extended period or with high doses for chronic pain, ensure comprehensive monitoring and management.

### Fentanyl transdermal [^112kkzWn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Initial dosage**: Do not initiate treatment with fentanyl transdermal system in opioid nontolerant patients [see Contraindications (4)]. The recommended starting dose when converting from other opioids to fentanyl transdermal system is intended to minimize the potential for overdosing patients with the first dose.

- **Conversion from other opioids to fentanyl transdermal system**: When fentanyl transdermal system therapy is initiated, discontinue all other opioid analgesics other than those used on an as-needed basis for breakthrough pain when appropriate. While there are useful tables of opioid equivalents readily available, there is substantial inter-patient variability in the relative potency of different opioid drugs and products. As such, it is preferable to underestimate a patient's 24-hour fentanyl requirements and provide rescue medication (e.g. immediate-release opioid) than to overestimate the 24-hour fentanyl requirements, which could result in adverse reactions. In a fentanyl transdermal system clinical trial, patients were converted from their prior opioid to fentanyl transdermal system using Table 1 as a guide for the initial fentanyl transdermal system dose. Each fentanyl transdermal system is worn continuously for up to 72 hours [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. When converting patients from oral or parenteral opioids to fentanyl transdermal system, use Table 1 (alternatively use Table 2 for adult and pediatric patients taking opioids or doses not listed in Table 1) and consider the following:

### Management of cancer pain in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^115DsfdC]. Annals of Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, particularly in relation to opioids and dose adjustments, the ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend offering transmucosal fentanyl formulations. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, and intranasal forms, which are particularly effective for unpredictable and rapid-onset breakthrough cancer pain.

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^112QxQXZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This exploratory study aimed to evaluate whether, among patients using fentanyl, the clinical withdrawal syndrome was altered due to the presence of xylazine. Despite anecdotal reports of a xylazine withdrawal syndrome, a clearly defined xylazine withdrawal syndrome has not been described in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing withdrawal syndromes between patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine. In this small cohort, we found only minimal detectable differences in vital sign measures, which were abstracted to explore if there are signals in a patient's clinical presentation that may indicate xylazine presence when laboratory testing is not readily available.

Opioid use is evolving, and in this population studied, as well as others, individuals admitted for opioid withdrawal are more likely to be using multiple substances rather than just opioids. In addition, there is a striking prevalence of xylazine, which is not routinely tested for. In this study, xylazine was present in over half (51.4%) of the patients admitted for medical management of withdrawal (MMW). The prior year data (2022) from the local Knox County medical examiner reported a 10% xylazine prevalence in overdose deaths. The data showing over 50% prevalence in active opioid users in East Tennessee suggest that the prevalence in overdose deaths in this region will also be dramatically higher in the coming year's analysis. This is evidence of the rapid spread of xylazine in the illicit drug supply in Tennessee.

We show that, in addition to skin lesions and severe sedation, compound effects…

### Voltage changes in the lithium dilution cardiac output sensor after exposure to blood from horses given xylazine [^1174H57s]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

In a previous in vitro study using a saline medium, the authors showed that certain drugs changed the voltages of lithium dilution cardiac output (LiDCO) sensors and also influenced their accuracy in measuring lithium concentrations. These two parameters correlated, and so we examined whether such drug-sensor interaction exists when the LiDCO sensor was exposed to xylazine in blood.

- **Methods**: Five healthy adult warm-blood horses were injected with 0.5 mg kg(-1) xylazine intravenously. Physiological saline solution and venous blood were consecutively sampled through the same LiDCO sensor at 60, 45, 30, 15, and 0 minutes before, and then 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after xylazine injection. Sensor voltages were recorded, and the differences between saline- and blood-exposed sensor voltages were compared at each time point.

- **Results**: Saline-exposed sensor voltages continuously increased in a non-linear pattern during the experiment. Blood-exposed sensor voltages also increased in a similar pattern, but it was interrupted by an abrupt increase in voltage after xylazine injection. The differences between saline- and blood-exposed sensor voltages were 7 (6.1–8) mV [median (range)] before xylazine but decreased significantly at 5 and 15 minutes after xylazine treatment. The highest drug-induced voltage change was 3.4 (1.6–7) mV.

- **Conclusions**: This study showed that exposure of a LiDCO sensor to blood following a single clinically relevant dose of xylazine in horses changed the voltages of the sensors for 15 minutes. Comparison of saline- and blood-exposed sensor voltages could become a tool to detect drug-induced sensor changes.

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^116mu4Le]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Xylazine is not approved for human use, yet it has emerged as a common adulterant of illicit fentanyl. It is currently unclear whether there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with xylazine and the potential impact of fentanyl coexposure.

A retrospective cohort study of patients with opioid use disorder admitted to an inpatient medically monitored withdrawal facility was conducted. Patients positive for fentanyl were compared to patients copositive for fentanyl and xylazine. Outcomes included self-directed discharge and completion of treatment. Independent variables comprised Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS) scores, heart rate, and blood pressure. Associations were measured between individuals with or without xylazine.

Among 71 patients admitted for opioid withdrawal management positive for fentanyl, 51.4% were copositive with xylazine. There was no detected difference in average COWS scores (P = 0.12–0.78) or average heart rate (P = 0.33–0.80) between groups. Xylazine copositive patients had higher average systolic blood pressure on days 1 (129.0 vs. 123.0, P = 0.01) and 2 (127.9 vs. 116.3, P = 0.04), although it is unclear if this is clinically meaningful. Individuals copositive for xylazine were less likely to complete treatment (43.2% vs. 55.9%, P = 0.23) and more likely to have self-directed discharge (67.6% vs. 44.1%; OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.0–6.9), although this was not statistically significant.

Among the 71 patients admitted for medically monitored withdrawal, individuals who were copositive for xylazine at the time of admission had higher average blood…

### Fentanyl test strips for harm reduction: A scoping review [^115pUoRV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

High potency synthetic opioids like fentanyl have continued to replace or contaminate the supply of illicit drugs in North America, with fentanyl test strips (FTSs) often used as a harm reduction tool for overdose prevention. The available evidence to support FTS for harm reduction has yet to be summarized.

- **Methods**: A search of PubMed, Ovid Embase, and Web of Science was conducted in March 2023. A two-stage review was conducted to screen by title and abstract and then by full text by two reviewers. Data were extracted from each study using a standardized template.

- **Results**: A total of 91 articles were included, mostly from North America, predominantly reporting on FTS along with other harm reduction tools, and all conducted after 2016. No randomized controlled trials are reported. Robust evidence exists supporting the sensitivity and specificity of FTS, along with their acceptability and feasibility of use for people who use drugs and as a public health intervention. However, limited research is available on the efficacy of FTS as a harm reduction tool for behavior change, engagement in care, or overdose prevention.

- **Conclusions**: Though FTSs are highly sensitive and specific for point-of-care testing, further research is needed to assess the association of FTS use with overdose prevention. Differences in FTS efficacy likely exist between people who use opioids and non-opioid drugs, with additional investigation strongly needed. As drug testing with point-of-care immunoassays is embraced for non-fentanyl contaminants such as xylazine and benzodiazepines, increased investigation is necessary.

### Urgent need for reversal agents for xylazine and other imidazolines in illicit fentanyl [^115cc8UX]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

The epidemic of illicit fentanyl use continues in the United States. Xylazine, a veterinary tranquilizer closely related to clonidine, is now a widespread adulterant in illicit fentanyl. More recently, medetomidine (the racemic version of dexmedetomidine) has appeared with increasing frequency in the fentanyl supply. Specific reversal agents for xylazine and medetomidine, such as atipamezole and tolazoline, have decades of approved use in animals and favorable experimental use in humans. However, an expert panel in 2024 opined that research into human use of alpha-adrenergic agonists was neither "necessary nor worthwhile". We disagree. We outline the unmet need for reversal agents for xylazine and medetomidine, discuss their human evidence of effectiveness, and suggest the path forward as the fentanyl epidemic continues to evolve.

### SPL drug information for fentanyl [^115J3po7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of fentanyl SL (also known as Subsys) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use is recommended only if the benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. It is important to monitor for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and for respiratory and CNS depression in neonates. A specific opioid antagonist, such as naloxone, should be available for the reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the neonate. Monitor the neonate for withdrawal symptoms, including irritability, hyperactivity, abnormal sleep patterns, high-pitched crying, tremor, vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to gain weight.

The onset, duration, and severity of opioid withdrawal may vary based on the specific opioid used, duration of use, timing and amount of last maternal use, and rate of elimination by the newborn. The drug fentanyl SL (also known as Subsys) is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without leading to malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Novel opioid analgesics for the development of transdermal opioid patches that possess morphine-like pharmacological profiles rather than fentanyl: Possible opioid switching alternatives among patch formula [^113FBYd3]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

In several studies with β-arrestin-2 knockout mice, enhanced and prolonged analgesic effects of morphine were reported. In addition, resistance to morphine was also reduced in this model; respiratory depression was suppressed, and resistance to colon function was not observed.

- **β-arrestin recruitment assay**: In our β-arrestin recruitment assay with MOR, only fentanyl acted as a full agonist, whereas morphine, N1, and N2 were partial agonists. Both N1 and N2 showed significantly lower efficacy than fentanyl and morphine in β-arrestin–dependent activities. Our internalization assay with MOR showed that N1 and N2 have lower β-arrestin–mediated pathway-activating profiles than fentanyl, similar to morphine. Taken together, these data indicate that N1 and N2 are biased G protein–dependent pathway agonists, suggesting that they might have analgesic actions with fewer deleterious opioid effects, including tolerance, although further in vivo studies are needed.

- **DOR activation profile**: In the study with DOR, N2 showed the maximal activation profile among the opioids examined. DOR agonists show fewer potent analgesic effects than MOR agonists, but they cause less sedation, respiratory depression, and gastrointestinal motility suppression than MOR agonists; thus, they may be candidates for novel analgesics with fewer side effects. In fact, to achieve effective analgesia, multiple sites of action must be targeted. Some studies have shown that access to both the brainstem and spinal cord by DOR agonists provides synergistic analgesia and yields a dose-response curve shifted to the left relative to the curve for the lone targeting of either.

### Notes from the field: Suspected medetomidine withdrawal syndrome among fentanyl-exposed patients - Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, September 2024-January 2025 [^115wZm9z]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2025). Low credibility.

The syndrome described in this report is similar to that observed among ICU patients who have prolonged exposure to dexmedetomidine, an enantiomer of medetomidine. These patients experience an autonomic withdrawal syndrome characterized by vomiting and agitation when dexmedetomidine is discontinued. In the patients described in this report, these signs and symptoms did not resolve with increasing doses of medications that were previously effective in managing fentanyl and xylazine withdrawal; however, they were responsive to dexmedetomidine, as described in the management of dexmedetomidine withdrawal.

Health care providers and public health agencies should be aware of this life-threatening withdrawal syndrome, as it may require substantial escalations in care compared to the typical opioid and xylazine withdrawal syndromes. Public health agencies should consider testing for medetomidine in their regional drug supplies.

### Withdrawal signs and symptoms among patients positive for fentanyl with and without xylazine [^1144EGpe]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) continues to be a major public health concern in the United States. Of the 106,699 overdose deaths reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2021, 80,411 involved an opioid. Provisional data for 2022 from the CDC show that 68% of the 107,081 overdose deaths involve synthetic opioids other than methadone. One factor fueling the rise in overdoses is a diversification of opioids available in the illicit drug supply, from predominantly heroin to predominantly illicitly manufactured fentanyl, with other novel psychoactive substances introduced regularly, including xylazine.

Assessment of withdrawal may be complicated by the presence of substances other than opioids. The recent, widespread incorporation of xylazine into the illicit drug supply has introduced a new, nonopioid cause of central nervous system depression. Xylazine is a central α-2 adrenergic agonist, which causes sedation, respiratory depression, bradycardia, hypotension, and potentially, cardiac arrest. The presence of substances in other drug classes (nonopioids) in the illicit opioid drug supply may result in a secondary withdrawal syndrome when exposed repeatedly. Therefore, providers may benefit from knowing what substances are present in the local illicit drug supply and local toxicology findings from biological specimens.

In this study, we investigate whether the presence of xylazine in the fentanyl drug supply impacts the clinical withdrawal syndrome. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether there is a "xylazine withdrawal syndrome" that should be recognized by healthcare providers engaged in treating OUD.

### How the complex pharmacology of the fentanyls contributes to their lethality [^113oVJp1]. Addiction (2019). Low credibility.

A combination of factors — potency, rate of onset, bias, muscle rigidity, lower susceptibility to naloxone reversal, lack of cross-tolerance — may conspire together to make fentanyls such lethal drugs. We suggest that the dangers of fentanyls will only be fully understood and then mitigated by rigorously applying pharmacological principles to both experimental and clinical data.

### Accuracy in equianalgesic dosing: Conversion dilemmas [^112T3Wdi]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2001). Low credibility.

The clinical benefit and increased application of opioid rotation have focused attention on efficacy differences between opioids and their respective equianalgesic dose ratios. Understanding these differences is critical to understanding their equianalgesic dose ratios and for adjusting therapy following rotation to a new analgesic. The purpose of this article is to describe controversies regarding the relative potencies of these agents as presented in equianalgesic charts and to provide pharmacologic information to assist the clinician with opioid rotation.

### Novel opioid analgesics for the development of transdermal opioid patches that possess morphine-like pharmacological profiles rather than fentanyl: Possible opioid switching alternatives among patch formula [^116a19Mj]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Low credibility.

Transdermal fentanyl is widely used in the treatment of severe pain because of its convenience, safety, and ability to maintain stable blood concentrations. Nevertheless, patients often develop tolerance to fentanyl, necessitating the use of other opioids. The transdermal buprenorphine patch is widely used as an analgesic agent; however, the available formulation does not provide an analgesic effect comparable to that of the transdermal fentanyl patch. Opioids bind to the opioid receptor (OR) to activate both G protein–mediated and β-arrestin–mediated pathways. We synthesized morphine-related compounds with high transdermal absorbability (N1 and N2) and evaluated their OR activities pharmacologically in comparison with fentanyl and morphine.

- **Methods**: In cells stably expressing μ-opioid receptor (MOR), δ-opioid receptor (DOR), and κ-opioid receptor (KOR), G protein–mediated pathways were assessed using the CellKey and an intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assay. In contrast, β-arrestin–mediated pathways were analyzed with β-arrestin recruitment and receptor internalization assays. Furthermore, analgesic effects were evaluated using a tail-flick test in mice, and the analgesic effect on fentanyl-tolerant mice was evaluated.

- **Results**: In the CellKey and cAMP assays, both N1 and N2 showed the highest affinity for MOR and acted as full agonists as well as partial agonists for DOR and KOR. In the β-arrestin and internalization assays, only fentanyl acted as a full agonist; N1 and N2 acted as partial agonists of MOR. In the mouse tail-flick test, N1 and N2 showed analgesic effects equivalent to those of transdermal fentanyl.
