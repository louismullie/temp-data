## Question

Does Eliquis increase the risk of falls in an 86-year-old frail woman?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Eliquis (apixaban) increases the risk of falling in an 86-year-old frail woman. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether anticoagulants themselves increase fall propensity versus merely worsening consequences if a fall occurs. Then, I should verify the apixaban-specific safety data including intracranial hemorrhage rates and any fall-related subgroup analyses. Next, I will examine how frailty influences baseline fall risk and outcomes. After that, I should review guideline positions on anticoagulation in older adults with high fall risk. Finally, I need to consider dosing, drug interactions, reversal options, and practical fall-prevention steps before synthesizing a recommendation that answers the question directly.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame and avoid jumping to conclusions prematurely. Falling in older adults is typically driven by multifactorial intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as gait imbalance, sarcopenia, neuropathy, vision or vestibular impairment, orthostasis, and environmental hazards, whereas anticoagulants chiefly modify the severity of injury if a fall happens rather than the propensity to fall itself, so I should verify where apixaban fits in that schema [^112mJ744] [^112V6ZWx].

> Wait, let me verify whether direct oral anticoagulants change fall incidence per se. In a prospective cohort of older adults initiating DOACs for atrial fibrillation, the occurrence of falls during follow-up was common but being a "faller" versus "non-faller" was not associated with higher rates of major bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage after adjustment, which suggests that DOAC initiation is not a driver of fall occurrence and that falls, while important, do not automatically translate into excess bleeding on DOACs in real-world practice, although confounding and selection cannot be fully excluded [^1167hQUu].

> Hold on, I should examine apixaban head-to-head data in patients with a history of falls. In the ARISTOTLE trial, patients with a prior history of falling had higher risks of major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, and death than those without such history, but crucially there was no interaction indicating differential effects between apixaban and warfarin in that subgroup, so apixaban did not increase harm relative to warfarin in patients prone to falls; however, the rate of subsequent falls was not reported as an endpoint, so I cannot claim any effect on fall frequency from that dataset and should be cautious about overinterpreting it.

> I need to check whether frailty itself, rather than the anticoagulant, is the predominant driver of fall risk in this patient profile. Multiple longitudinal cohorts show that higher frailty burden predicts more falls, fracture-related hospitalizations, and mortality in community-dwelling older women across long follow-up horizons, highlighting that frailty phenotypes materially elevate baseline fall probability and adverse outcomes regardless of specific drug exposures [^116BcMbM] [^115cabXr] [^114scdm1].

> Next, I should review the consequences of a fall in anticoagulated elders, because even if apixaban does not increase fall propensity, it can influence the harm from a fall. In a very large retrospective cohort of elderly AF patients after ground-level falls, mortality was higher among those on oral anticoagulation with head injury a major contributor, which reinforces that the key issue is injury severity rather than fall initiation; similarly, in RE-LY, among patients who suffered falls or head injury, dabigatran had lower intracranial hemorrhage than warfarin, supporting a class signal that DOACs reduce ICH compared with warfarin when falls occur, though extrapolation from dabigatran to apixaban should be made with care [^112Zin9g] [^112V6ZWx].

> Let me now examine apixaban's bleeding profile, especially intracranial hemorrhage, because that is pivotal to net clinical benefit when falls are likely. In ARISTOTLE, apixaban reduced major bleeding and more than halved hemorrhagic stroke versus warfarin, establishing a favorable ICH profile, and this safety advantage underpins its selection as the preferred anticoagulant in many older or frail patients when anticoagulation is indicated for AF stroke prevention, although individual bleeding risks must still be individualized and reassessed regularly [^116LPtpz] [^113bGivz].

> I should confirm how contemporary guidelines frame anticoagulation in the very old with frailty or fall risk. European guidance and contemporary reviews emphasize that older age and frailty are not contraindications to oral anticoagulation and that the net clinical benefit is generally preserved even in patients at high risk of falls, while NICE explicitly advises not to withhold anticoagulation solely because a person is at risk of falls; in parallel, global falls guidelines recommend structured fall-risk stratification and comprehensive medication review to deprescribe true fall-risk–increasing drugs as part of multifactorial prevention, which typically targets sedatives and hypotensives rather than anticoagulants per se [^113bGivz] [^116GafxT] [^116yKd43].

> Let me think about dosing and interactions in an 86-year-old frail woman, because inappropriate dosing can amplify bleeding without improving efficacy. Standard apixaban dosing is 5 mg twice daily, reduced to 2.5 mg twice daily if at least two of age 80 years or older, body weight 60 kg or less, or serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL or higher are present; strong dual CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors require dose reduction or avoidance when already at 2.5 mg twice daily, and strong inducers should be avoided to prevent subtherapeutic exposure; also, apixaban should not be used in patients with mechanical heart valves, and coordination with other hemostasis-affecting drugs is necessary to limit bleeding risk [^117LnKUC] [^1138Kjw6] [^112SaBGm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought apixaban has no specific antidote and that reversal is limited to supportive care and charcoal, but I should double-check that against the current label. Apixaban does have a specific reversal agent; andexanet alfa is available to reverse anti–factor Xa activity, and activated charcoal can reduce exposure after recent ingestion, so my earlier statement that there is no specific antidote was incorrect and I need to correct it here to avoid misinformation in care planning, particularly for institutions that stock andexanet alfa.

> I should consider skeletal outcomes as a surrogate for injurious falls because fragility fractures often result from falls in this demographic. Observational comparative studies and meta-analyses suggest that DOACs, including apixaban, are associated with lower fracture risk than warfarin, which may matter for long-term harm reduction in frail older women, although fracture risk reduction should not be interpreted as a reduction in fall propensity but rather a potential mitigation of bone-related consequences after a fall [^116cy58i] [^114TuxQX] [^115yprsH].

> Next, I should review practical fall-prevention interventions that can be layered onto anticoagulation to address the true driver of risk here. Evidence-based recommendations favor multicomponent or exercise-based programs such as strength, balance, and gait training to reduce falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk, and high-risk individuals should undergo structured risk stratification with person-centered interventions as part of a comprehensive falls pathway, which is especially pertinent in a frail 86-year-old starting or continuing apixaban [^112LRHad] [^116yKd43].

> Synthesis and direct answer: Hold on, I should verify the logic before concluding. There is no evidence that apixaban increases the likelihood of falling; falls in an 86-year-old frail woman are primarily driven by frailty and other multifactorial risks, not by the anticoagulant itself, whereas being on an anticoagulant increases the severity of consequences if she falls, particularly risk of intracranial hemorrhage; among anticoagulants, apixaban confers lower major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage than warfarin, guideline bodies advise not to withhold anticoagulation solely for fall risk, and careful dosing, interaction management, availability of andexanet alfa, and targeted fall-prevention strategies together support the net benefit of apixaban for AF stroke prevention when indicated in this scenario [^116LPtpz] [^111pnfuA] [^113bGivz] [^116GafxT] [^112LRHad].

No, Eliquis (apixaban) does **not directly increase fall risk** in an 86-year-old frail woman, but it does increase the risk of **serious bleeding** [^1138Kjw6] if a fall occurs [^112V6ZWx]. Frailty [^114scdm1] and age-related factors (e.g. balance, cognition, polypharmacy) drive falls, not apixaban itself [^notfound]. Apixaban is preferred over warfarin [^116LPtpz] in frail older adults due to lower intracranial bleeding risk, and falls alone should not preclude its use [^113bGivz]. Use standard fall prevention [^112ah6ej] and monitor for bleeding [^1138Kjw6]; dose per renal function, weight, and age [^1139REAh].

## Pharmacological profile of apixaban (eliquis)

Apixaban is **a direct factor Xa inhibitor** [^1138Kjw6] that reduces thrombin generation and clot formation. It is approved for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, and postoperative thromboprophylaxis. It has predictable pharmacokinetics, does not require routine coagulation monitoring, and has fewer dietary and drug interactions [^117LnKUC] than warfarin.

---

## Evidence on apixaban and fall risk

There is **no evidence that apixaban directly increases fall risk**, as falls in older adults are driven by intrinsic factors — frailty, balance impairment, cognitive decline, and polypharmacy [^114Z5xZR] — rather than the pharmacological action of anticoagulants. Frailty [^114scdm1] markedly increases the risk of **falls and fractures**, particularly in women [^115cabXr] [^113nv1dv]. Anticoagulants, including apixaban [^1138Kjw6], do not inherently increase **fall risk** but do increase **bleeding severity** [^112V6ZWx] if a fall occurs [^114DeRbj].

---

## Bleeding risk associated with apixaban in elderly frail patients

Although apixaban does not increase fall risk, **it increases the risk of bleeding complications if a fall occurs** [^112V6ZWx]; elderly frail patients are particularly vulnerable due to age-related physiological changes, comorbidities, and polypharmacy [^115mL21h]. For **major bleeding**, apixaban is associated with a lower risk [^116LPtpz], including intracranial hemorrhage, than warfarin [^113bGivz]. For **intracranial hemorrhage**, the risk is significantly lower with apixaban than with warfarin [^116LPtpz], making it a safer option [^113bGivz] for elderly frail patients [^111pnfuA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized risk assessment and management** for elderly frail patients on anticoagulation therapy [^114Z5xZR]:

- **Risk assessment**: Regularly assess fall risk [^113Pgcaz], frailty, and bleeding risk using standardized tools [^114joxHc] and clinical judgment [^112ah6ej].

- **Medication review**: Conduct regular medication reviews to identify and deprescribe fall risk-increasing drugs (FRIDs) [^116yKd43].

- **Fall prevention**: Implement multifactorial fall prevention strategies [^112LRHad], including exercise programs, balance training [^11382YRc], and environmental modifications.

---

## Clinical management strategies

To **minimize fall and bleeding risks** in elderly frail patients taking apixaban, clinicians should:

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust apixaban dosage [^1138Kjw6] based on renal function [^114DeRbj], body weight, and age [^1139REAh].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor renal function, hemoglobin levels, and signs of bleeding [^1138Kjw6].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients and caregivers about fall prevention [^114Z5xZR], bleeding signs, and when to seek medical attention.

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve geriatricians, pharmacists [^114Z5xZR], and physical therapists in patient care.

---

## Conclusion

Eliquis (apixaban) does not directly increase fall risk in elderly frail patients, but it does increase the risk of bleeding complications if a fall occurs [^112V6ZWx]. Clinicians should carefully assess and manage fall and bleeding risks through individualized risk assessment, medication review, and implementation of fall prevention strategies [^112LRHad]. Apixaban remains a **safer anticoagulant option** [^116LPtpz] compared to warfarin for elderly frail patients due to its lower risk of major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage.

### Clinical outcomes and history of fall in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with oral anticoagulation: Insights from the ARISTOTLE trial [^111pnfuA]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We assessed outcomes among anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation and a history of falling, and examined whether the benefits of apixaban versus warfarin are consistent in this population.

Of the 18,201 patients in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) study, 16,491 had information about a history of falling — 753 with a history of falling and 15,738 without. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke or systemic embolism; the primary safety outcome was major bleeding.

When compared with patients without a history of falling, patients with a history of falling were characterized by:

- **Demographic factors**: older age, more likely to be female
- **Health conditions**: dementia, cerebrovascular disease, depression, diabetes, heart failure, osteoporosis, fractures
- **Risk scores**: higher CHA2DS2-VASc (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age ≥ 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, prior Stroke or TIA or thromboembolism, Vascular disease, Age 65–74 years, Sex category female) and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal renal and liver function, Stroke, Bleeding, Labile international normalized ratio, Elderly, Drugs or alcohol) scores

Patients with a history of falling had:

- **Higher rates**: major bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.84; p = 0.020), including intracranial bleeding (adjusted HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.02–3.43; p = 0.044), and death (adjusted HR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.36–2.14; P < .0001)
- **Similar rates**: stroke or systemic embolism and hemorrhagic stroke

There was no evidence of a differential effect of apixaban compared to warfarin in this context.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^114scdm1]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Frailty is associated with declines in physiological capacity across sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. An underlying assumption is that the frailer an individual, the more likely they are to experience falls and fractures. We examined whether grades of frailty can assess the long-term risk of hospitalized falls, fractures, and all-cause mortality in 1,261 community-dwelling older women (mean age [SD] of 75.1 [2.7] years) over 14.5 years.

Frailty was operationalized using a frailty index (FI) of cumulative deficits from 33 variables across multiple health domains (physical, mental, and comorbidities) at baseline. The total score across these variables was summed and divided by 33 to obtain the FI. Participants were graded as fit (FI ≤ 0.12), mildly frail (FI > 0.12–0.24), moderately frail (FI > 0.24–0.36), or severely frail (FI > 0.36).

Fall-related (n = 498), any fracture-related (n = 347), and hip fracture–related hospitalizations (n = 137) and deaths (n = 482) were obtained from linked health records. Associations between FI grades and clinical outcomes were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models, including age, treatment (calcium/placebo), BMI, smoking history, socioeconomic status, plasma vitamin D (25OHD) status plus season obtained, physical activity, self-reported prevalent falls in the last 3 months, and self-reported fractures since the age of 50 years.

At baseline, 713 (56.5%), 350 (27.8%), 163 (12.9%), and 35 (2.8%) of women were classified as fit, mildly frail, moderately frail, and severely frail, respectively. Women with higher frailty grades were more likely to be hospitalized for falls and fractures and had higher all-cause mortality risks compared to those classified as fit.

### Sex-specific transcriptome differences in a middle-aged frailty cohort [^113nv1dv]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Frailty is a syndrome described as reduced physiological reserve and increased vulnerability to stressors. Individuals with frailty have reduced strength and endurance and increased risk of falls, institutionalization, hospitalization, disability, and premature mortality. Frailty prevalence in adults aged ≥ 65 years in the United States is estimated at 15%. Health disparities have been observed in frailty; individuals from lower socioeconomic groups, racial and ethnic minority groups, and women have significantly higher frailty prevalence.

Research in frailty has predominantly studied older adult populations (≥ 65 years old). The few studies that have evaluated frailty prevalence in middle-aged cohorts (35–64 years old) found frailty prevalence ranges from 2–8.5%. One of these studies found mortality was associated with frailty for all age groups (37–73 years old) except for women aged 37–45 years old. We also recently evaluated frailty prevalence in the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) cohort for middle-aged participants aged 35–64 years and found 11% were frail. Additionally, these middle-aged frail individuals had significantly reduced survival probability compared to their non-frail counterparts, suggesting frailty in middle age is associated with mortality. Therefore, these studies indicate frailty can occur in middle age and highlight the importance of investigating mechanisms driving frailty in middle-aged individuals.

### Frailty and cardiovascular health [^113bGivz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Frailty is highly prevalent among older adults with atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with increased rates of mortality, stroke, and persistent or permanent AF. Despite this, the 2014 AHA/ACC/Heart Rhythm Society guidelines and their 2019 update do not explicitly address frailty. The 2020 ESC guidelines briefly address patients with older age and frailty, emphasizing that these patients benefit from oral anticoagulants and rate or rhythm control options offered to younger or more robust patients. In the years since these guidelines were published, a robust body of practice‐guiding research has grown about anticoagulation for patients with AF and frailty, while fewer studies have investigated rhythm and rate control in this population.

- **Anticoagulation**: The decision for anticoagulation is challenging in adults with frailty due to increased risk of both stroke and bleeding. Studies have demonstrated that the net benefit of oral anticoagulants remains similar among frailty and fall‐risk statuses, with stroke‐protective benefits improving mortality and outweighing the risk of hemorrhage. Compared with warfarin, rivaroxaban, and dabigatran, apixaban has the most favorable outcomes, specifically in terms of reduced bleeding risk. Moreover, in certain patients not deemed suitable for full‐dose oral anticoagulation, the ELDERCARE‐AF (Edoxaban Low‐Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients) RCT compared low‐dose edoxaban (15 mg daily) with placebo in Japanese patients with nonvalvular AF and age older than 80 years. Among these patients, 40.9% were frail.

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^1138Kjw6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis):

- **AIS**: Use extreme caution in patients with AF transitioning from apixaban to warfarin.

- **Bleeding**: Use caution in patients taking other drugs affecting hemostasis, including antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic agents, SSRIs, SNRIs, and NSAIDs.

- **Increased serum apixaban levels**: Use caution in patients taking P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, or ritonavir). Reduce the dose of apixaban from 5–10 mg BID by 50%. Do not use P-glycoprotein or potent CYP3A4 inhibitors in patients receiving 2.5 mg BID of apixaban.

---

### Eliquis [^114DeRbj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Overdose of Eliquis increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled clinical trials, orally administered apixaban in healthy subjects at doses up to 50 mg daily for 3 to 7 days (25 mg twice daily for 7 days or 50 mg once daily for 3 days) had no clinically relevant adverse effects.

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of Eliquis overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

### Mortality after ground-level fall in the elderly patient taking oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation/flutter: a long-term analysis of risk versus benefit [^112Zin9g]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who experience ground-level falls are at risk for lethal head injuries. Patients on oral anticoagulation (OAC) for thromboprophylaxis may be at higher risk for these head injuries. Trauma surgeons treating these patients face a difficult choice: (1) continue OAC to minimize stroke risk while increasing the risk of a lethal head injury, or (2) discontinue OAC to avoid intracranial hemorrhage while increasing the risk of stroke. To inform this choice, a retrospective cohort study was conducted to assess long-term outcomes and risk factors for mortality after presentation with a ground-level fall among patients with and without OAC.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of the longitudinal version of the California Office of Statewide Planning and Development database was performed for years 1995 to 2009. Elderly anticoagulated patients (age > 65 years) with known atrial fibrillation or flutter who fell were stratified by CHA2DS2-VASc score and compared with a nonanticoagulated control cohort. Multivariable logistic regression, including patient demographics, stroke risk, injury severity, and hospital type, was used to identify risk factors for mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 377,873 patient records met the inclusion criteria, with 42,913 on OAC and 334,960 controls. The mean age was 82.4 and 80.6 years, respectively. Most were female, with CHA2DS2-VASc scores between 3 and 5. Mortality among OAC patients following a first fall was 6% compared to 3.1% among non-OAC patients. Patients dying with a head injury constituted 31.6% of deaths.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^113ZPG3b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

In keeping with previous research on older women, the present study found that the frailty index (FI) was highly predictive of all-cause mortality. Compared to fit women, all-cause mortality during follow-up was twice as likely for those who were moderately frail and three times as likely for those who were severely frail. We also found that women with moderate and severe frailty (although not mild frailty) were at a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related death. These findings are concerning and are consistent with an emerging body of literature identifying frailty as a major risk factor for CVD, an area warranting urgent investigation.

The association between FI and risk of fracture in women can be explained, at least partially, by the higher likelihood of falls in those with frailty. Features of frailty include low muscle strength, balance problems, and gait disorders, including slowing of gait speed. These features are all falls risk factors, which can also be influenced by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels. Additionally, cognitive decline and sensory deficits (e.g. impaired vision or hearing), which are common in individuals with frailty, increase falls risk. As we have established a link between lower plasma 25OHD levels (< 50 nmol L−1), fall, and fracture hospitalization risk in this cohort, we accounted for 25OHD levels (and the season the sample was obtained) in our analyses.

Our results demonstrate the need for effective strategies to prevent frailty in older women. Strategies include early identification of frailty in older women by routine screening and case finding, addressing contributing factors such…

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: A global initiative [^112mJ744]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

The framework of the guidelines includes several key components:

- **Fall risk stratification**: A standard approach to assess an individual's estimated level of risk for falls to apply a proportionate detailed assessment and intervention according to the level of risk.

- **Assessment**: This involves identifying and measuring the falls risk factors across multiple domains using recommended tools, if available, to indicate potentially modifiable areas for intervention. Combined with other components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), this enables a person-centered approach.

- **Management and interventions**: A description of various approaches to fall prevention, including recommended treatments or actions that can reduce the risk of falls. These may be suitable as single interventions or in combinations.

- **Assessment and treatment algorithm**: This links the three stages of initial risk stratification, assessment, and management and encourages a 'person-centered' approach to design an individualized intervention.

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAX identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^112hiogm]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Fracture risk assessment is still far from perfect within the geriatric population. The overall aim of this study is to better identify older women at risk for fractures, using a quantitative measure of frailty in conjunction with the web-based Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®).

- **Methods**: This study was performed in the Osteoporosis Risk Assessment (OPRA) cohort of n = 1023, 75-year-old women followed for 10 years. A frailty index (FI) of 'deficits in health' was created, and FRAX 10-year probability for major osteoporotic and hip fractures was calculated and bone mineral density measured. Incident fractures were continuously registered for 10 years. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare FI, FRAX, and the combination FI + FRAX as instruments for risk prediction. Discriminative ability was estimated by comparing area under the curve (AUC). In addition, using guidelines from the Swedish Osteoporosis Foundation, a category of low-risk women who would not have been recommended for pharmacological treatment (non-treatment group) was identified, categorized by frailty status, and for relative risk analysis, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regressions.

- **Results**: For hip fracture, FRAX and frailty performed almost equally (hip AUC 10y: 0.566 vs. 0.567, p = 0.015 and p = 0.013). Next, FI was used in conjunction with FRAX; proving marginally better than either score alone (AUC 10y: 0.584, p = 0.002). Comparable results were observed for osteoporotic fracture.

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAX identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^114G86CW]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

- **10-year fracture risk**: Women in the non-treatment group were assessed based on their frailty status (low vs. high) at age 75.

	- The non-treatment group was identified using the Swedish Osteoporosis Foundation, including those with no previous major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) and a FRAX MOF of ≥ 20%. Low frailty includes quartiles 1–3, while high frailty is quartile 4. Hazard ratios are unadjusted, comparing quartile 4 to quartiles 1–3.

- **Fracture risk stratification**: Fracture risk among women in the non-treatment group was stratified by low and high frailty.

	- The non-treatment group was identified using the Swedish Osteoporosis Foundation and includes those with no previous MOFs and a FRAX MOF of ≥ 20%. Low frailty includes quartiles 1–3 (Frailty Index (FI) 0.0–0.27) and high frailty includes quartile 4 (FI > 0.28).

The utility of measuring frailty was also demonstrated when using the T-score to define fracture risk instead of FRAX. Among 678 non-osteoporotic women, frailty contributed to the 10-year risk of fracture (HR HIP 2.22 (1.35–3.71), p = 0.002; HR MOF 1.57 (1.15–2.14), p = 0.005).

### Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^116LPtpz]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). High credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists are highly effective in preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation but have several limitations. Apixaban is a novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitor that has been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in a similar population in comparison with aspirin.

- **Methods**: In this randomized, double-blind trial, we compared apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) with warfarin (target international normalized ratio, 2.0 to 3.0) in 18,201 patients with atrial fibrillation and at least one additional risk factor for stroke. The primary outcome was ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism. The trial was designed to test for noninferiority, with key secondary objectives of testing for superiority with respect to the primary outcome and to the rates of major bleeding and death from any cause.

- **Results**: The median duration of follow-up was 1.8 years. The rate of the primary outcome was 1.27% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 1.60% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 0.95; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.01 for superiority). The rate of major bleeding was 2.13% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 3.09% per year in the warfarin group (hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.80; P < 0.001). The rates of death from any cause were 3.52% and 3.94%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.99; P = 0.047). The rate of hemorrhagic stroke was 0.24% per year in the apixaban group, as compared with 0.47% per year in the warfarin group…

### Clinical outcomes of anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation after falls or head injury: Insights from RE-LY [^112V6ZWx]. Stroke (2023). High credibility.

Falls are always a concern regarding the balance of risk/benefit in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with anticoagulants. In this analysis, we aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients that had a fall/head injury reported in the RE-LY clinical trial (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) and to explore the safety of dabigatran (a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant).

- **Methods**: We performed a post hoc retrospective analysis of intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding outcomes in the RE-LY trial with 18,113 individuals with atrial fibrillation, according to the status occurrence of falls (or head injury) reported as adverse events. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to provide adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI.

- **Results**: In the study, 974 falls or head injury events were reported among 716 patients (4%). These patients were older and had more frequently comorbidities such as diabetes, previous stroke, or coronary artery disease. Patients with falls had a higher risk of major bleeding (HR, 2.41 [95% CI, 1.90–3.05]), intracranial hemorrhage (HR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.35–2.13]), and mortality (HR, 3.91 [95% CI, 2.51–6.10]) compared to those who did not have reported falls or head injury. Among patients who had falls, those allocated to dabigatran showed a lower intracranial hemorrhage risk (HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.18–0.98]) compared with warfarin.

- **Conclusions**: In this population, the risk of falls is important and confers a worse prognosis, increasing intracranial hemorrhage and major bleeding.

### DOACs for older adults with atrial fibrillation and falls: Results from the prospective single-centre DOAFF study [^1167hQUu]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Low credibility.

Falls are one of the most fearsome events in anticoagulated older adults. The evidence concerning the safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are prone to falls is still limited.

- **Methods**: We prospectively enrolled consecutive anticoagulant-naïve patients aged 65 years and older, starting anticoagulation with DOACs for AF. The study cohort was stratified into fallers vs. non-fallers, according to the occurrence of at least one fall during the 2-year follow-up. Bleeding outcomes were evaluated.

- **Results**: We enrolled 524 consecutive patients with a mean age of 80.8 years, most of whom were women (54.0%). Among the study cohort, 148 patients (28.2%) experienced at least one fall episode during the study period. After adjusting for potential confounders, no difference was found between fallers and non-fallers for all the study outcomes: major bleeding [HR: 1.04 (95% CI: 0.58–1.85)], intracranial haemorrhage [HR: 1.63 (95% CI: 0.69–3.80)], clinically relevant non-major bleeding [HR: 1.21 (95% CI: 0.83–1.76)], and all-cause death [HR: 1.51 (95% CI: 0.85–2.69)]. The presence of a prior cerebrovascular event [HR: 2.27 (95% CI: 1.12–4.62); p-value: 0.02] and polypharmacy [HR: 1.60 (95% CI: 1.08–2.39); p-value: 0.02] were the main drivers for major and clinically relevant non-major bleedings, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Falls in an anticoagulant-naïve population aged 65 years and over, starting DOAC treatment for AF, do not increase the bleeding risk. Thus, the presence of falls should not discourage clinicians from prescribing DOACs in this population.

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAX identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^114wkAzR]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). High credibility.

We sought to obtain a clinical perspective on the utility of assessing frailty for primary fracture management. Using guidelines from the Swedish Osteoporosis Society, a non-treatment group of 564 women (54%) was defined. These women had not sustained a previous osteoporotic fracture and would not be recommended for pharmacological treatment based on FRAX MOF or FRAX MOF BMD in combination with T-score.

To investigate the discriminative ability of FRAX and frailty in this "low risk" non-treatment group, ROC curves were made. For hip fracture, while frailty alone could discriminate fracture (HIP AUC 10y: 0.590, p = 0.031), FRAX could not (HIP AUC 10y: 0.557, p = 0.169). The combination of frailty and FRAX did not improve discriminative ability compared to frailty alone (HIP AUC 10y: 0.585, p = 0.042). Neither frailty nor FRAX alone, or the combination of the two measurements could discriminate osteoporotic fractures (data not shown).

The women in the non-treatment group were further categorized according to their frailty status where a FI ≥ 0.28 (corresponding to Q4) were considered frail and Q1-Q3 non-frail. Among the apparently "low fracture risk" women in the non-treatment group, being frail was associated with a higher risk of hip fracture over 10 years (HR 2.01 (1.13–3.57)) compared to those who were considered not frail (Table 3, Fig. 2). However, this association did not reach statistical significance for osteoporotic fracture (HR 1.40 (0.97–2.01), frail vs. non-frail).

### An evaluation of injurious falls and fall-risk-increasing-drug (FRID) prescribing in ambulatory care in older adults [^113qqJFH]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Falls are a major public health problem that affects millions of people in the United States each year. Older adults, specifically those 65 years of age and older, are disproportionately affected, with one out of four experiencing a fall each year according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Approximately 20% of these falls result in a serious injury, most often a fractured or broken bone or a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Injurious falls initiate a cascading effect that can negatively impact the patient's physical and mental health.

For example, patients experiencing hip fractures often require orthopedic surgery, which puts them at increased short-term risk for infection and bleeding, as well as increased long-term risk for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and muscle atrophy due to prolonged immobility. In addition, patients often have a fear of falling a second time, which can cause them to be less mobile, thereby compounding the probability of a subsequent fall. The economic costs associated with injurious falls place an enormous burden on the healthcare system. Each year, approximately $50 billion and $754 million are spent on non-fatal and fatal fall injuries, respectively.

Numerous risk factors for falls have been elucidated and are generally subclassified as extrinsic or intrinsic. Extrinsic factors are related to the physical environment (i.e. dim lighting, improper use of assistive devices, etc) and are often modifiable. Intrinsic factors are related to patient-specific factors, such as advanced age and history.

### Challenges in the prevention of venous thromboembolism in the elderly [^115CTFoi]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2004). Low credibility.

Aging itself is a risk factor for venous thromboembolism, and the prevalence in the elderly of additional risk factors, such as cancer, orthopedic surgery, and immobility, increases its intrinsic risk. Many in the medical community are reluctant to prescribe anticoagulation for primary and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism to their geriatric patients for fear that bleeding complications may outweigh the benefits. A thorough analysis of the data supports the concept that the under-use of heparin in primary prevention in the elderly is more related to medical beliefs than to facts. The risk of bleeding due to oral anticoagulants in secondary prevention is greatly reduced by keeping the International Normalized Ratio (INR) values within therapeutic ranges and carefully avoiding conditions and drugs that may interfere with such treatment.

The oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran has been studied for primary prophylaxis in hip and knee replacement surgery and for secondary prophylaxis and acute treatment of venous thromboembolism. The selective factor Xa inhibitor fondaparinux has been approved for primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in hip and knee replacement surgery and in hip fracture surgery. Studies on the latter drugs, where most of the patients were over 65 years of age, further show that the fear of bleeding complications due to anticoagulation in the elderly is largely unjustified.

### Atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation, fall risk, and outcomes in elderly patients [^1125rMs2]. American Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects 2.5 million patients in the United States. The incidence of this condition increases with age, such that approximately 5% of people over 65 years of age have AF. Due to the lack of organized atrial contraction and thrombus formation in the left atrium, patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke. The estimated risk of stroke among all AF patients is 5% per year. Among patients without mitral stenosis, there is a graded relationship of stroke risk with the number of CHADS₂ risk factors. Warfarin is the recommended treatment for embolic stroke prophylaxis in AF in intermediate- to high-risk patients. However, elderly patients who are deemed to be at risk of falls are often not started on warfarin therapy due to a perceived higher risk of bleeding complications. These risks have been evaluated, but conclusive data regarding the risk-benefit trade-off are elusive. This review summarizes available data on the use of warfarin in elderly patients with AF, focusing on the risk of bleeding, and will specifically address the utility of falls risk assessment in the decision to initiate warfarin therapy for AF.

### Injuries and outcomes associated with traumatic falls in the elderly population on oral anticoagulant therapy [^115Buf15]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Fall risk for older adults is a multifactorial public health problem, as 90% of geriatric injuries are caused by traumatic falls. The CDC estimated that 33% of adults over 65 years incurred a fall in 2011, with 30% resulting in moderate injury. While much has been written about the overall risk to trauma patients on oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy, less has been reported on outcomes in the elderly trauma population. We used data from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) to identify the types of injury and complications incurred, the length of stay, and mortality associated with OACs in elderly patients sustaining a fall.

- **Methods**: Using standard NTDB practices, data were collected on elderly patients (≥ 65 years) on OACs with a diagnosis of fall as the primary mechanism of injury from 2007 to 2010. Univariate analysis was used to determine patient variables influencing the risk of fall on OACs. Odds ratios were calculated for the types of injury sustained and post-trauma complications. Logistic regression was used to determine mortality associated with the type of injury incurred.

- **Results**: Of 118,467 elderly patients sampled, OAC use was observed in 444. Predisposing risk factors for falls on OACs included more than one comorbidity (p < 0.0001) and more than three complications (p < 0.0001); the most significant being ARDS and ARF (p < 0.0001). The mortality rate on OACs was 16%. Injuries to the gastrointestinal tract, liver, spleen, and kidney (p < 0.0002) were more likely to occur. However, if patients suffered mortality, the most significant injuries were skull fractures, an

### SPL drug information for apixaban [^114jedkt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in humans. Monitor pregnant women for bleeding and monitor neonates for bleeding. Recognize that apixaban may increase the risk of bleeding during pregnancy and delivery, as well as the risk of bleeding in the fetus or neonate. The drug apixaban PO (also known as Eliquis) is classified under category C in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug, owing to its pharmacological effects, has caused or may be suspected of causing harmful effects on the human fetus or neonate, without causing malformations. These effects may be reversible.

### Recurrent falls among elderly patients and the impact of anticoagulation therapy [^116oFmJt]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Falls are the leading source of injury and trauma-related hospital admissions for elderly adults in the United States. Elderly patients with a history of a fall have the highest risk of falling again, and the decision on whether to continue anticoagulation following a fall is difficult. To inform this decision, we evaluated the rate of recurrent falls and the impact of anticoagulation on outcomes.

- **Methods**: All patients aged ≥ 65 years hospitalized for a fall in the first 6 months of 2013 and 2014 were identified in the nationwide readmission database, a nationally representative all-payer database tracking patient readmissions. Readmissions for a recurrent fall within 6 months, and mortality and bleeding injuries (intracranial hemorrhage, solid organ bleed, and hemothorax) during readmission were identified. Logistic regression evaluated factors associated with mortality on repeat falls.

- **Results**: Of the 331,982 patients admitted for a fall, 15,565 (4.7%) were admitted for a recurrent fall within 6 months. The median time to the repeat fall was 57 days (IQR 19–111 days), and 9.0% (1,406) of repeat fallers were on anticoagulation. The rate of bleeding injury was similar regardless of anticoagulation status (12.8% vs. 12.7% not on anticoagulation, p = 0.97); however, among patients with a bleeding injury, those on anticoagulation had significantly higher mortality (21.5% vs. 6.9% not on anticoagulation, p < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: Among patients hospitalized for a fall, 4.7% will be hospitalized for a recurrent fall within 6 months. Patients on anticoagulation with repeat falls do not have a decreased bleeding injury rate but experience increased mortality.

### Apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation [^1158bzAp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, many patients are not suitable candidates for, or are unwilling to receive, vitamin K antagonist therapy, and these patients have a high risk of stroke. Apixaban, a novel factor Xa inhibitor, may be an alternative treatment for such patients.

- **Methods**: In a double-blind study, we randomly assigned 5,599 patients with atrial fibrillation who were at increased risk for stroke and for whom vitamin K antagonist therapy was unsuitable to receive apixaban (at a dose of 5 mg twice daily) or aspirin (81 to 324 mg per day) to determine whether apixaban was superior. The mean follow-up period was 1.1 years. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke or systemic embolism.

- **Results**: Before enrollment, 40% of the patients had used a vitamin K antagonist. The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the study because of a clear benefit in favor of apixaban. There were 51 primary outcome events (1.6% per year) among patients assigned to apixaban and 113 (3.7% per year) among those assigned to aspirin (hazard ratio with apixaban, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The rates of death were 3.5% per year in the apixaban group and 4.4% per year in the aspirin group (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.02; P = 0.07). There were 44 cases of major bleeding (1.4% per year) in the apixaban group and 39 (1.2% per year) in the aspirin group (hazard ratio with apixaban, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.75; P = 0.57); there were 11 cases of intrac.

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAx identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^112FzzYh]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Fracture risk assessment remains an imperfect science within the geriatric population. The overall aim of this study is to better identify older women at risk for fractures by using a quantitative measure of frailty in conjunction with the web-based Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®).

- **Methods**: This study was performed in the Osteoporosis Risk Assessment (OPRA) cohort, consisting of 1,023 women aged 75, who were followed for 10 years. A frailty index (FI) of 'deficits in health' was created. The FRAX 10-year probability for major osteoporotic and hip fractures was calculated, and bone mineral density was measured. Incident fractures were continuously registered over the 10 years. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare FI, FRAX, and the combination of FI+FRAX as instruments for risk prediction. Discriminative ability was estimated by comparing the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Additionally, using guidelines from the Swedish Osteoporosis Foundation, a category of low-risk women who would not have been recommended for pharmacological treatment (non-treatment group) was identified and categorized by frailty status. For relative risk analysis, hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Cox proportional hazard regressions.

- **Results**: For hip fractures, FRAX and frailty performed almost equally (HIP AUC 10y: 0.566 vs. 0.567, p = 0.015 and p = 0.013). When FI was used in conjunction with FRAX, it proved marginally better than either score alone (AUC 10y: 0.584, p = 0.002). Comparable results were observed for osteoporotic fractures. In the non-treatment group, the analysis continued similarly (5…).

### Eliquis [^117LnKUC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Apixaban is a substrate of both CYP3A4 and P-gp. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp increase exposure to apixaban and elevate the risk of bleeding. Conversely, inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp reduce exposure to apixaban, enhancing the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events.

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors**: For patients receiving Eliquis 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, the dose should be reduced by 50% when coadministered with drugs that are combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For patients receiving a 2.5 mg dose twice daily, avoid coadministration with these inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Clarithromycin**: Although clarithromycin is a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, pharmacokinetic data suggest that no dose adjustment is necessary when administered concomitantly with Eliquis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers**: Avoid the concomitant use of Eliquis with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort) as these drugs will decrease the exposure to apixaban [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Effect of 15-mg edoxaban on clinical outcomes in 3 age strata in older patients with atrial fibrillation: A prespecified subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^111Ni54V]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, and both AF and age are independent risk factors for stroke. To prevent cardioembolic stroke in patients with AF, clinical guidelines recommend using direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), even in older patients. However, evidence on the use of DOACs in extremely older patients is lacking. Many physicians remain reluctant to prescribe standard doses of DOACs to extremely older patients due to risk factors for bleeding in this group, such as severe kidney impairment, history of bleeding, previous falls, polypharmacy, and frailty.

The Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients (ELDERCARE–AF) trial was a randomized clinical trial investigating the effect of a once-daily 15-mg dose of edoxaban versus placebo on the primary efficacy endpoint of stroke or systemic embolism in older Japanese patients (≥ 80 years) with AF who were not considered candidates for a standard OAC regimen. Edoxaban was found to be superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of stroke or systemic embolism. In contrast, the incidence of major bleeding was higher with edoxaban compared to placebo; however, this difference was not statistically significant. Of the major bleeding events, the incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was higher with edoxaban compared to placebo. Although there was no influence of age (≤ 85 and > 85 years) on the effect of edoxaban on stroke or systemic embolism, it remains unclear whether the effects of edoxaban are consistent even in extremely older patients, such as those 90 years or older.

### Frailty phenotype as a predictor of bleeding and mortality in ambulatory patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants [^111mRApm]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2022). High credibility.

Limited prospective data exist about the clinical relevance of frailty in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or venous thromboembolism (VTE) receiving direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether frailty phenotype identifies DOAC-treated patients at higher risk of adverse clinical outcomes.

- **Methods**: Consecutive, adult outpatients treated with DOACs for AF or VTE were prospectively enrolled. Patients were classified as frail, pre-frail, or non-frail according to frailty phenotype. Study outcomes were clinically relevant bleeding, including major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding, arterial and venous thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: 236 patients (median age 78 years, 44% females) were included, of whom 156 (66%) had AF and 80 (34%) VTE. Ninety-eight (41%) patients were frail, 115 (49%) pre-frail, and 23 (10%) non-frail. Inappropriately high or low dose DOAC was used in 33% of frail and in 20% of non-frail or pre-frail patients. Over a median follow-up of 304 days, the incidence of clinically relevant bleeding, thromboembolism, and mortality were 20%, 4%, and 9% in frail patients, and 10%, 3%, and 2% in pre-frail patients, respectively, while no study outcome occurred among non-frail patients. Risk ratios (95% confidence intervals) for these outcomes in frail versus pre-frail and non-frail patients were respectively 2.5 (1.8, 3.7), 1.9 (0.9, 4.0), and 6.3 (2.9, 13.6).

- **Conclusion**: In a prospective cohort of ambulatory patients receiving DOAC treatment for AF or VTE, frailty phenotype identified patients at higher risk of adverse outcomes.

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAX identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^114biGJP]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

To capture more women at risk of fracture and reduce the fracture burden, this study involving 1023 community-dwelling women investigated whether frailty in conjunction with FRAX could improve fracture prediction over 10 years. The combination of these two measurements not only slightly improved fracture prediction, but applying a frailty score to women at apparent low risk successfully identified a group with a higher actual hip fracture risk in the non-treatment group. This finding is particularly important because these women would not be prioritized for pharmacological treatment according to current guidelines. Preventing a primary fracture in these individuals would not only decrease the fracture burden, but also potentially prevent further decline into higher frailty. Our results suggest there may be clinical utility in measuring frailty for preventive fracture management.

The need to improve fracture management is urgent, particularly due to the current and anticipated increase in the economic burden. Since a first fracture increases the risk of a subsequent fracture by 86%, primary fracture prevention should be a priority. This study indicates that frailty could be valuable in primary fracture prevention, identifying 'at risk' women without a previous osteoporotic fracture in the non-treatment group. Notably, while frailty could discriminate hip fracture risk in the non-treatment group, FRAX alone could not. Moreover, using FRAX in conjunction with the frailty index in this group did not enhance discriminative ability compared to using the frailty index alone.

### Management of atrial fibrillation for older people with frailty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117V1CNv]. Age and Ageing (2019). Low credibility.

The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increases with age, affecting up to 4.2% of those aged 60–70 years and 17% of those aged 80 years or older [1]. Around one in four hospitalized older people have AF, so management of AF in older people is a commonly encountered clinical challenge. Old age is a risk factor for thromboembolic outcomes of AF, but there is evidence for a risk-treatment paradox whereby older patients who are at the highest risk of complications of AF, including stroke, are not more likely to be prescribed oral anticoagulation (OAC) [6]. This appears to be related to fear of iatrogenic harm and a lack of confidence in the evidence of benefit in an older population [7, 8].

It is increasingly recognized that frailty is a more useful approach to guide care in older people than chronological age. It is a condition characterized by loss of biological reserves, failure of homeostatic mechanisms, and vulnerability to a range of adverse outcomes, and can help guide more individualized treatments with advancing multi-morbidity and polypharmacy. The prevalence of patients with frailty and AF is growing [11], making optimal management an important goal for older people, clinicians, health services, and social care.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends using the CHA2DS2-VASc score to identify individuals with a high ischemic stroke risk, and offering OAC to men with a score of 1, and to men or women with a score of 2 or above [15]. However, the studies on which the guidance was based did not explicitly assess

### Oral anticoagulant therapy in older adults [^115mL21h]. Thrombosis Research (2024). Low credibility.

Patients aged ≥ 65 years not only account for the majority of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism (VTE), but they are also at a higher risk of morbidity, mortality, and undertreatment than younger patients. Several age-related physiological changes affect drug pharmacokinetics and dynamics, and blood vessel fragility, as well as the higher prevalence of geriatric conditions such as frailty, multimorbidity, polypharmacy, fall risk, dementia, and malnutrition, make older persons more vulnerable to disease- and anticoagulation-related complications.

Moreover, because older patients with AF/VTE are underrepresented in oral anticoagulation (OAC) trials, evidence on OAC in older adults with AF/VTE is mainly based on subgroup analyses from clinical trials and observational studies. A growing body of such limited evidence suggests that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be superior in terms of efficacy and safety compared to vitamin K antagonists in older persons with AF/VTE, and that specific DOACs may have a differing risk-benefit profile.

In this narrative review, we summarize the evidence on the epidemiology of AF/VTE, the impact of age-related physiological changes, and the efficacy and safety of OAC, specifically considering individuals with common geriatric conditions. We review OAC guideline recommendations for older adults with AF/VTE and propose a research agenda to improve the evidence basis on OAC in older individuals with AF/VTE, including the conduct of advanced age-specific and pragmatic studies using less restrictive eligibility criteria.

### Benefits and harms of standard versus reduced-dose direct oral anticoagulant therapy for older adults with multiple morbidities and atrial fibrillation [^116AeKm1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Few data exist that directly compare the effects of standard versus reduced direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) dosing, particularly in older adults with multiple morbidities who would not otherwise meet the criteria for dose reduction. DOAC dose-adjustment criteria were derived based on pharmacokinetic studies that identified factors that may result in increased concentrations of the drug in the bloodstream. These criteria were used in the Phase III landmark trials to determine exposures in the DOAC arms. A post hoc analysis of the landmark trial of apixaban suggested that those who received standard dosing and had one dose-reduction criterion showed similar effects compared with warfarin as the apixaban arm as a whole. This post hoc analysis excluded subjects who had received dosages misaligned with labeling recommendations. With the greater use of DOACs, and these prior comparisons with warfarin, the present study is significant because it fills the gap on the real-world benefits and harms of standard- versus reduced-dose DOAC therapy outside of the bounds of pharmacokinetically derived dosing recommendations.

### Fracture risks in patients treated with different oral anticoagulants: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114gwooP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Because osteoporosis and bone fractures pose major threats to the elderly, and oral anticoagulants (OACs) are mainly prescribed to older adults who have multiple risk factors for fractures, it is critically essential to determine whether a difference in fracture risks exists between non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the risk of bone fractures between patients treated with NOACs and those treated with warfarin. We searched for both clinical trials and observational studies to comprehensively evaluate the evidence on this issue and compared the results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to real-world evidence.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^114VjrQk]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

A recent investigation in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging found that the frailty index (FI) was associated with self-reported incident fractures over 3 years (in both men and women aged 65 years) and self-reported falls in the 12 months prior to baseline (in those aged 45 years). Yet, like most previous research, their study only considered self-reported falls and fractures. Although self-reported outcomes are clinically meaningful, they can be influenced by poor recall bias and under-reporting in older adults. To overcome limitations associated with using self-reported data alone, our study used both hospital record data and self-reported information to enhance confidence in our findings.

Women are at high risk of losing substantial bone mineral density (BMD) after menopause, and as a result, can develop osteoporosis, which is a condition characterized by weak and brittle bones that greatly increases the risk of osteoporotic fractures. Yet, very few long-term studies of frailty with outcomes of falls and fractures have been conducted exclusively in women. Ensrud and colleagues studied the association of physical frailty with adverse long-term outcomes in the study of osteoporotic fractures and found that frailty was independently associated with increased risk of falls, hip fracture, any non-spine fracture, and mortality in women aged 70 years and over. However, their study also collected self-reported data on falls, while including participants with 1 or 2 missing physical frailty domains (out of a total of 5 domains), which may have resulted in the misclassification of frailty.

### Association of anticoagulant therapy with risk of fracture among patients with atrial fibrillation [^116ezwax]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Warfarin is prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) for the prevention of cardioembolic complications. Whether warfarin adversely affects bone health is controversial. The availability of alternate direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) options now makes it possible to evaluate the comparative safety of warfarin in association with fracture risk.

- **Objective**: To test the hypothesis that, among patients with nonvalvular AF, the use of DOACs versus warfarin is associated with a lower risk of incident fracture.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This comparative effectiveness cohort study used the MarketScan administrative claims databases to identify patients with nonvalvular AF who were prescribed oral anticoagulants from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2015. To reduce confounding, patients were matched on age, sex, CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age [> 65 years = 1 point; > 75 years = 2 points], diabetes, and previous stroke/transient ischemic attack [2 points], vascular disease) score, and high-dimensional propensity scores. The final analysis included 167,275 patients with AF. Data were analyzed from February 27, 2019, to September 18, 2019.

- **Exposures**: Warfarin and DOACs (dabigatran etexilate, rivaroxaban, and apixaban).

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Incident hip fracture, fracture requiring hospitalization, and all clinical fractures (identified using inpatient or outpatient claims) defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^115Rkq9Z]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

Emerging literature has linked frailty in older adults with an increased likelihood of osteoporotic fractures. The underlying assumption is that the more frail an individual is, the more likely they are to have an osteoporotic fracture in the future. Indeed, the high mortality rate observed in older hip fracture patients has been attributed to high frailty levels of patients prior to their falls. However, previous studies have either had relatively short follow-up periods or have relied on self-reported falls by study participants. To our knowledge, no research has examined the long-term consequences of frailty in relation to fall- and fracture-related hospitalizations. Importantly, hospitalized falls are the most serious in nature, often resulting in fractures that severely impact an older person's independence and quality of life.

In the study, we adopt the commonly used frailty index (FI) cumulative deficits model, which is commonly used across all health care settings to identify frailty. In England, all general practices are mandated to routinely identify older adults living with frailty through an electronic FI derived from patient electronic medical records, with individuals identified at risk referred for appropriate interventions. In our study, we distinguish grades of frailty from the FI (fit, mildly frail, frail, and severely frail). Limited research has investigated grades of frailty using the FI to predict falls and fractures in older adults. Moreover, comparatively very little research into long-term outcomes of frailty has been conducted in women. We investigated whether…

### Can frailty in conjunction with FRAX identify additional women at risk of fracture - a longitudinal cohort study of community dwelling older women [^117RUdZV]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

A substantial part of the association between frailty and fracture risk is probably explained by the higher fall propensity among the frail women. At present, there is ongoing work to optimize the FRAX algorithm, with the possibility of a future version including a history of falls, since the association between falls and fractures is widely recognized. The initial reasons for not including falls into FRAX were that data on falls from the cohorts used to construct FRAX was not uniform, there was limited data on whether intervention against falls reduced fracture risk, and that more information was needed before falls could be incorporated into FRAX. Moreover, it was considered that the risk of falling is implicitly captured without being measured directly. However, in our specific setting, this last assumption is not evident; when comparing quartiles of FRAX, we fail to see any significant difference between falls within the previous year. We have previously tested which factors predict falls and found that a clinical history and a subjective estimate of a person's health were more important than objective functional tests for fall prediction. While most other recent studies in this area compare single risk factors for falls, frailty captures a wider spectrum of deficits.

Today, frailty is considered a dynamic and hence potentially reversible syndrome, but the evidence supporting possible intervention to reverse or minimize the rate of decline into frailty is varied, as are the strategies employed. Based on this study, frailty could be an important tool to identify women at risk of fracture.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^115cabXr]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). High credibility.

Frailty is associated with declines in physiological capacity across sensory, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. An underlying assumption is that the frailer an individual, the more likely they are to experience falls and fractures. We examined whether grades of frailty can assess the long-term risk of hospitalized falls, fractures, and all-cause mortality in 1,261 community-dwelling older women (mean age [SD] of 75.1 [2.7] years) over 14.5 years. Frailty was operationalized using a frailty index (FI) of cumulative deficits from 33 variables across multiple health domains (physical, mental, comorbidities) at baseline. The total score across these variables was summed and divided by 33 to obtain the FI. Participants were graded as fit (FI ≤ 0.12), mildly frail (FI > 0.12–0.24), moderately frail (FI > 0.24–0.36), or severely frail (FI > 0.36).

- **Fall-related outcomes**: Fall-related (n = 498), any fracture-related (n = 347), and hip fracture-related hospitalizations (n = 137), and deaths (n = 482) were obtained from linked health records.

- **Analysis methods**: Associations between FI grades and clinical outcomes were analyzed using multivariable-adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models, including age, treatment (calcium/placebo), BMI, smoking history, socioeconomic status, plasma vitamin D (25OHD) status plus season obtained, physical activity, self-reported prevalent falls in the last 3 months, and self-reported fractures since the age of 50 years.

At baseline, 713 (56.5%), 350 (27.8%), 163 (12.9%), and 35 (2.8%) of women were classified as fit, mildly frail, moderately frail, and severely frail, respectively. Women with mild, moderate, and severe frailty demonstrated increased risks of hospitalization and mortality compared to their fit counterparts.

### Frailty increases the long-term risk for fall and fracture-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality in community-dwelling older women [^116mUtyw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2024). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: This study examines the association between frailty and the risk of fall-, fracture-related hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality in older women. The analysis is based on multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios from a Cox proportional hazards model with restricted cubic spline curves. The reference point is the median frailty index score for fit women (0.06).

- **Risk analysis**: The hazard ratios (HR) over 14.5 years for hospitalization and mortality risks were calculated based on frailty index (FI) classification: fit (FI ≤ 0.12), mild frailty (FI > 0.12–0.24), moderate frailty (FI > 0.24–0.36), and severe frailty (FI > 0.36). The estimated HRs compare the median FI scores for women classified as mildly frail (0.18), frail (0.30), and severely frail (0.39) to those of fit women (0.06).

- **Adjustment models**:
	- **Minimally adjusted model**: This model adjusts for age, treatment, and BMI.
	- **Multivariable adjusted model**: In addition to the minimally adjusted factors, this model considers whether individuals have smoked, socioeconomic status, plasma 25OHD levels, season of blood sampling, physical activity, self-reported prevalent falls, and prevalent fractures. Bolded values in the results indicate significant differences.

### Effect of 15-mg edoxaban on clinical outcomes in 3 age strata in older patients with atrial fibrillation: A prespecified subanalysis of the ELDERCARE-AF randomized clinical trial [^1134umXs]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Long-term use of oral anticoagulants (OACs) is necessary for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The effectiveness and safety of OACs in extremely older patients (i.e. aged 80 years or older) with AF and at high risk of bleeding need to be elucidated.

- **Objective**: To examine the effects of very low-dose edoxaban (15 mg) versus placebo across 3 age strata (80–84 years, 85–89 years, and ≥ 90 years) among patients with AF who were part of the Edoxaban Low-Dose for Elder Care Atrial Fibrillation Patients (ELDERCARE-AF) trial.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This prespecified subanalysis of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted from August 5, 2016, to December 27, 2019. Patients with AF aged 80 years or older who were not considered candidates for standard-dose OACs were included in the study. Reasons these patients could not take standard-dose OACs included low creatinine clearance (< 30 mL per minute), low body weight (≤ 45 kg), history of bleeding from critical organs, continuous use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or concomitant use of antiplatelet drugs. Eligible patients were recruited randomly from 164 hospitals in Japan and were randomly assigned 1:1 to edoxaban or placebo.

- **Interventions**: Edoxaban (15 mg once daily) or placebo.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of stroke or systemic embolism. The primary safety endpoint was International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis-defined major bleeding.

A total of 984 patients participated (mean [SD] age…).

### Rates of potentially inappropriate dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants and associations with geriatric conditions among older patients with atrial fibrillation: The SAGE-AF study [^1139REAh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

Direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) medications, including dabigatran, apixaban, rivaroxaban, and edoxaban, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). DOACs have a class I recommendation in the AF guidelines and are increasingly used in clinical practice. Data from large randomized clinical trials have shown each of these individual agents to be noninferior to warfarin for the prevention of systemic thromboembolism, with a similar or better safety profile. Unlike warfarin, they do not require intensive laboratory monitoring, making them easier to prescribe and use. However, their FDA approval was granted at specific doses with dose adjustments for age, renal function, body weight, or concomitant drug therapies.

Recent studies have shown that 10% to 15% of patients receiving DOAC prescriptions were treated with potentially inappropriate doses. Inappropriate dosing has potential clinical consequences, including thromboembolism, bleeding, and death. However, the reasons for choosing an off-label dosing regimen in such patients are not clear based on previous data. Older patients with AF are especially susceptible to the adverse effects associated with inappropriate drug dosing due to decreased drug metabolism, increased prevalence of hepatic and renal dysfunction, and a higher likelihood of drug-drug interactions as a result of frequent polypharmacy.

There is a limited number of adequate and well-controlled studies in patients 65 years and older. However, a higher incidence of bleeding has been reported in patients, particularly women, over 60 years of age [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Patients over 60 years of age may require lower doses of heparin. Lower doses of heparin may be indicated in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Prescribing of direct oral anticoagulants and warfarin to older people with atrial fibrillation in UK general practice: a cohort study [^116GafxT]. BMC Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Co-morbidities reduce OAC prescribing even when they are not a contraindication to therapy. Dementia/cognitive impairment, a history of falls, and bleeding have been shown in previous studies to reduce OAC prescribing. Prior stroke has been associated with increased OAC prescribing but had no effect in our study. This finding is unexpected and may be due to other factors such as age or other comorbidities which were not adjusted for in our univariate model. Other studies have found that OAC prescribing is not significantly affected by contraindications to therapy such as major bleeding or haemorrhagic stroke, but this may be due to the fact that these so-called 'contraindications' are time-dependent; a history of one of these contraindications does not necessarily preclude treatment for life. It is unsurprising that we found prior bleeds, and in particular major bleeds and intracranial haemorrhage, to be associated with reduced OAC prescribing. Where serious bleeds have occurred, the risk of further bleeding needs to be balanced carefully with the risk of stroke.

Despite NICE guidance specifically recommending that anticoagulation not be withheld solely because a person is at risk of falls, this was not seen in our study. The reduction in OAC prescribing to people with falls remained the same in all three periods, spanning the time pre- and post-the 2014 NICE publication. There is strong evidence that patients on warfarin would have to fall around 300 times a year for the risk of bleeding to outweigh the benefit of stroke prevention. Studies of DOACs also suggest that proper management and monitoring can mitigate these risks.

### Frailty and fracture, disability, and falls: A multiple country study from the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women [^116BcMbM]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2013). High credibility.

To test whether women aged 55 and older with increasing evidence of a frailty phenotype would have a greater risk of fractures, disability, and falls than women who were not frail, across geographic areas (Australia, Europe, and North America) and age groups, a multinational, longitudinal, observational cohort study was conducted within the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW).

Women (N = 48,636) aged 55 and older were enrolled at sites in Australia, Europe, and North America. Components of frailty such as slowness and weakness, poor endurance and exhaustion, physical activity, and unintentional weight loss were measured at baseline. Reports of fracture, disability, and falls were investigated at one year of follow-up. Women also reported health and demographic characteristics at baseline.

Women younger than 75 from the United States were more likely to be prefrail and frail than those from Australia, Canada, and Europe. The distribution of frailty was similar according to region for women aged 75 and older. Odds ratios from multivariable models for frailty versus non-frailty were 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.07–1.42) for fracture, 2.29 (95% CI = 2.09–2.51) for disability, and 1.68 (95% CI = 1.54–1.83) for falls. The associations for prefrailty versus nonfrailty were weaker, but still indicated a statistically significantly greater risk of each outcome. Overall, associations between frailty and each outcome were similar across age and geographic region.

### A new bleeding risk score specifically developed for direct oral anticoagulants in a geriatric population [^114LM5pr]. Age and Ageing (2025). Low credibility.

Although the use of direct oral anticoagulants increases with the rise in atrial fibrillation (AF) with age, existing bleeding risk scores (HAS-BLED, HEMORR2HAGES, ATRIA, and RE-LY) have not been developed for a geriatric population. Our study aimed to create a bleeding risk score tailored to this specific population and therapeutic class.

A multicentre, longitudinal, prospective, observational, pharmacoepidemiologic study was conducted in 60 French cardiologic and geriatric centres. It included consecutive patients aged ≥ 80 years with AF, treated with rivaroxaban, and followed for at least 1 year. All thromboembolic, bleeding, and clinical events, including falls, hospitalisations, or deaths, were recorded every 3 months for 1 year.

A predictive risk score based on the clinical variables most associated with bleeding events was developed. The total sample was randomly divided into a training sample and a validation sample. Among the 839 patients included (mean age = 86 years, 62% women), there were 78 (9.3%) major haemorrhagic events. Variables associated with bleeding included age, anaemia, low albuminemia, amiodarone use, and low creatinine clearance estimated with the Cockcroft formula, grouped together as the A4C score. The A4C score better identifies bleeding risk in subjects ≥ 80 years than scores validated in younger populations. Its area under the curve in the training sample and validation sample was 0.73 and 0.66, respectively. In contrast, it was 0.49/0.55 for the HAS-BLED score, 0.53/0.50 for the HEMORR2HAGES score, and 0.58/0.61 for the ATRIA score.

### Edoxaban versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation patients at risk of falling: ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 analysis [^111vJihB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation is often avoided in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at an increased risk of falling.

- **Objectives**: This study assessed the relative efficacy and safety of edoxaban versus warfarin in the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 48) trial in patients with atrial fibrillation judged to be at increased risk of falling.

- **Methods**: We performed a pre-specified analysis of the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, comparing patients with versus without increased risk of falling.

- **Results**: Nine hundred patients (4.3%) were judged to be at increased risk of falling. These patients were older (median, 77 vs. 72 years; p < 0.001) and had a higher prevalence of comorbidities including prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, diabetes, and coronary artery disease. After multivariable adjustment, patients at increased risk of falling experienced more bone fractures caused by falling (adjusted hazard ratio [HRadj]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.49 to 2.38; p < 0.001), major bleeding (HRadj: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.64; p = 0.023), life-threatening bleeding (HRadj: 1.67; 95% CI: 1.11 to 2.50; p = 0.013), and all-cause death (HRadj: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.70; p < 0.001), but not ischemic events including stroke/systemic embolic event (HRadj: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.51; p = 0.27). No treatment interaction was observed between either dosing regimens of edoxaban and warfarin for the efficacy and safety outcomes. Treatment with edoxaban resulted in a greater absolute risk reduction.

### Rates of potentially inappropriate dosing of direct-acting oral anticoagulants and associations with geriatric conditions among older patients with atrial fibrillation: The SAGE-AF study [^1146jxec]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Previous studies have investigated the association of frailty using a variety of frailty assessment scales with anticoagulation prescription. One meta-analysis showed an association between frailty and nonprescription of anticoagulants. There have been no studies to our knowledge that investigated potentially inappropriate DOAC dosing in relation to frailty. In our cohort, components of a comprehensive geriatric assessment, including frailty, were not related to inappropriate dosing. These findings suggest that although prescribers consider age in OAC prescribing, they may not consider geriatric conditions in the context of DOAC dosing. Whether these geriatric factors affect outcomes of OAC in participants with AF still needs to be evaluated.

It is likely that the reasons behind the prescription of potentially inappropriate doses are multifactorial. First, DOAC dosing recommendations can be complex and difficult to recall — for example, apixaban dose reductions are recommended based on serum creatinine, whereas dabigatran and rivaroxaban are based on creatinine clearance. Most commercial electronic health record systems report renal function as glomerular filtration rate based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation even though the pivotal trials with DOACs used creatinine clearance as a measure of renal function. There may be significant variations between the two. Previous studies have shown higher stroke risk with underdosing and elevated bleeding risk with inappropriate overdosing of DOACs; hence, adherence to guideline-directed dosing is important.

### Fracture risks in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with different oral anticoagulants: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^114TuxQX]. Age and Ageing (2022). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis, based on real-world evidence, suggests that the use of DOACs (direct oral anticoagulants) is associated with a lower risk of fractures compared to the use of warfarin in older patients with atrial fibrillation. Among the individual DOACs, only the use of apixaban and rivaroxaban is associated with a significantly lower risk of any fracture compared to warfarin. This study may provide optimal anticoagulation opportunities for atrial fibrillation patients with high fracture risk factors.

### Association between treatment with apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, or warfarin and risk for osteoporotic fractures among patients with atrial fibrillation: A population-based cohort study [^116cy58i]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether anticoagulant type is associated with the risk for osteoporotic fracture, a deleterious complication of anticoagulants among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Objective**: To compare the risk for osteoporotic fracture between anticoagulants.

- **Design**: Population-based cohort study.

- **Setting**: Territory-wide electronic health record database of the Hong Kong Hospital Authority.

- **Participants**: Patients newly diagnosed with AF between 2010 and 2017 who received a new prescription for warfarin or a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban). Follow-up ended on 31 December 2018.

- **Measurements**: Osteoporotic hip and vertebral fractures in anticoagulant users were compared using propensity score-weighted cumulative incidence differences (CIDs).

- **Results**: There were 23,515 patients identified (3241 apixaban users, 6867 dabigatran users, 3866 rivaroxaban users, and 9541 warfarin users). Overall mean age was 74.4 years (SD, 10.8), ranging from 73.1 years (warfarin) to 77.9 years (apixaban). Over a median follow-up of 423 days, 401 fractures were identified (crude event number [weighted rate per 100 patient-years]: apixaban, 53 [0.82]; dabigatran, 95 [0.76]; rivaroxaban, 57 [0.67]; and warfarin, 196 [1.11]). After 24-month follow-up, DOAC use was associated with a lower risk for fracture than warfarin use (apixaban CID, -0.88% [95% CI, -1.66% to -0.21%]; dabigatran CID, -0.81% [CI, -1.34% to -0.23%]; and rivaroxaban CID, -1.13% [CI, -1.67% to -0.53%]). No differences were seen in all head-to-head comparisons between DOAC.

### Atrial fibrillation and oral anticoagulation in older people with frailty: A nationwide primary care electronic health records cohort study [^112rZtxA]. Age and Ageing (2021). Low credibility.

Interestingly, in this study, we showed a positive association between frailty and prescription rates, although prescribing rates plateaued and dropped with more severe frailty. Previous small studies have shown conflicting findings, with one reporting a positive association [36] and another a negative association between OAC prescription and phenotype-defined frailty status [37]. The present study has the advantage of a large, representative community-based dataset and a validated measure to ascertain frailty status [16].

Despite a growing number of patients with AF and frailty, data are lacking regarding the relative safety and efficacy of OAC in this population. Observational evidence suggests the benefits of OAC may be similar for patients with and without frailty [37]. Although people with moderate–severe frailty are not well represented in randomized clinical trials of the efficacy and safety of DOACs, recent post-hoc analyses have shown increased rates of stroke or systemic embolism, death, and major bleeding with increasing levels of frailty. However, the efficacy and safety of apixaban compared with warfarin were not modified by multi-morbidity status, and a reduction in bleeding was shown with edoxaban compared with warfarin overall, but not significantly so in those with more advanced frailty, who made up a small proportion of the overall trial population.

It has been shown that frailty is common among patients with AF and is associated with a poor prognosis. The finding that the risk of stroke is higher for women with increasing frailty, but not for men, is of interest.

### Fracture risks in patients treated with different oral anticoagulants: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115yprsH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly prescribed to prevent or treat thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, is a traditional OAC and has been a primary long-term treatment option for these patients for decades. Recently, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been approved as alternatives to vitamin K antagonists and have demonstrated similar or superior efficacy and safety compared with warfarin. Because aging is one of the strongest risk factors for both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism, the prescription of OACs has gradually increased in the aging population worldwide.

Some previous studies have suggested that warfarin may increase fracture risks via its vitamin K antagonizing effect, which impairs bone mineralization. In contrast, NOACs are independent of mechanisms associated with vitamin K antagonists. However, previous studies have provided conflicting evidence on the association between warfarin and fracture risks. A previous cohort study published in 2017 was the first to compare the fracture risk associated with an NOAC (dabigatran) and warfarin, reporting a significantly lower fracture risk in dabigatran users. Another cohort study in 2017 observed no significant difference in fracture risks among patients taking NOACs (both dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors) and warfarin. In 2018, a meta-analysis based on 12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed that patients treated with NOACs did not experience an increased risk of fractures compared to those on warfarin.
