## Question

HPV vaccine for 28 year old male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 28-year-old man should receive the HPV vaccine and, if so, how to approach dosing, timing, and shared decision-making. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current ACIP/CDC recommendations and how they apply to a 28-year-old. Then, I should verify the FDA labeling and whether the 9-valent vaccine is licensed beyond age 26. Next, I will examine the evidence base for efficacy and safety in older adults, including any trials in the 27–45 range. After that, I need to consider individual risk factors that might shift the balance toward vaccination. Finally, I will outline practical dosing, cost, and counseling points, and reconcile any conflicting guidance from other societies like ACOG and ACS.

> Let me first confirm the core recommendation. ACIP/CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination through age 26 for all persons who are not adequately vaccinated, and for adults aged 27–45 years, shared clinical decision-making is advised rather than a routine recommendation, because population benefit is smaller and many have prior exposure, so the net benefit depends on individual risk and susceptibility to new infections [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075] [^d67b6386].

> Wait, let me verify the regulatory status before concluding anything. The 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) is FDA-licensed for women and men through age 45, so a 28-year-old is legally eligible to receive it, even though routine catch-up ends at 26 and decisions thereafter are individualized [^cd759357] [^ca7b9075].

> I will now examine the evidence for efficacy in older adults. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — most efficacy trials enrolled participants 16–26 years, and efficacy is highest in HPV-naïve individuals. In that context, quadrivalent vaccine reduced external genital lesions by about 60–90% depending on analysis, and long-term follow-up shows durable protection against anogenital warts and related lesions in men, supporting benefit when given before exposure [^e575a541] [^092adc46]. But wait, what if the patient is older than 26? ACIP's GRADE review found low certainty of benefit in 27–45-year-olds, with expected small absolute reductions in cancer and precancer, so benefit is real but modest and highly dependent on prior exposure and future risk of new infections [^cdb630ef] [^d67b6386].

> Next, I should review safety. The 9-valent vaccine has a reassuring safety profile in post-licensure surveillance, with mostly mild local reactions and no new safety signals identified; serious adverse events are rare, and syncope precautions remain standard practice during adolescent and young adult vaccination [^e600a35f] [^58c29034].

> Let me consider individual risk factors that could make vaccination more worthwhile at 28. New sexual partners, multiple partners, or recent partner change increase the likelihood of acquiring new HPV, and men who have sex with men are at higher risk for anal HPV and cancer; immunocompromised patients also have higher risk and may have attenuated vaccine responses, so vaccination through 26 is prioritized, and some experts extend consideration to 27–45 in shared decision-making contexts [^ca7b9075] [^1c783067] [^abf96861]. I should double-check: even if someone has had prior HPV exposure, the vaccine does not treat existing infection but can still prevent new infections with the types it covers, which is why individualized risk assessment matters here [^ca7b9075].

> Now, dosing and schedule. Since he is starting at age 28, he should receive a 3-dose series at 0, 1–2, and 6 months; if the series is interrupted, it does not need to be restarted, and there is no role for prevaccination HPV testing to guide administration decisions in this context [^f330936d] [^3885a40a] [^0da03180]. Hold on, I should verify: yes, the 2-dose schedule is only for those who initiate before age 15, so a 28-year-old follows the 3-dose schedule regardless of immune status, with the caveat that immunocompromised persons also require a 3-dose series and may have reduced immunogenicity [^68e71260] [^1c783067].

> I need to ensure I address cost and access. Routine catch-up through 26 is covered as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act, but for ages 27–45, coverage for shared decision-making vaccination varies by payer; uninsured or underinsured adults may face out-of-pocket costs, so I should discuss this upfront and explore manufacturer assistance programs if needed [^notfound].

> But wait, what about conflicting guidance? ACOG supports shared decision-making for some unvaccinated adults 27–45, aligning with ACIP/CDC, whereas the American Cancer Society does not endorse routine shared decision-making in this age group due to minimal population benefit and the burden of decision-making; I should present this nuance transparently and frame the decision around the patient's values and risk profile rather than a one-size-fits-all answer [^cd759357] [^34be841e] [^35a4ea33].

> Putting this together, my recommendation is that HPV vaccination is reasonable but not routinely recommended for a healthy 28-year-old man; it is a shared decision that favors vaccination if he has ongoing risk for new HPV exposure (new partners, multiple partners, MSM, or anticipated partner change), values prevention of genital warts and HPV-related cancers, and accepts a 3-dose series with modest individual benefit and excellent safety. If he is in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with low likelihood of new exposure, the benefit is lower and declining vaccination may be reasonable [^ca7b9075] [^d27f2e54] [^e575a541].

> Final check and counseling points: I should confirm there is no need for HPV testing before vaccination, explain that the vaccine prevents new infections but does not treat existing disease, review common adverse effects and syncope precautions, and reinforce that cervical screening recommendations do not apply to him while anal cancer screening is not routine but may be considered selectively in high-risk populations such as MSM with HIV or significant immunocompromise [^0da03180] [^58c29034] [^777581a0].

The HPV vaccine is **not routinely recommended** for a 28-year-old male, but it may be considered through shared clinical decision-making if he has not been previously vaccinated and is at risk for new HPV exposure [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075]. The vaccine is **most effective when given before sexual exposure**, and its benefit diminishes with age as most men have already been exposed to HPV [^d67b6386]. If chosen, the 9-valent HPV vaccine is used in a 3-dose series at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^f330936d]. The decision should weigh individual risk factors, potential benefit, and cost, as population-level benefit in this age group is limited [^34be841e].

## Current recommendations for HPV vaccination in males

ACIP/CDC recommend **routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years**, with catch-up vaccination through age 26 for those not previously vaccinated [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075]. For adults aged 27–45 years, including males, ACIP recommends **shared clinical decision-making** rather than routine vaccination, given the lower likelihood of benefit due to prior HPV exposure [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075].

---

## Efficacy and effectiveness of HPV vaccination in older males

Clinical trials show the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is **highly effective in preventing HPV-related diseases in males aged 16–26 years**, including external genital lesions and anogenital warts [^e575a541] [^092adc46]. However, **efficacy declines with age** as sexual exposure and prior HPV infection increase, reducing the potential benefit of vaccination [^d67b6386] [^ca7b9075]. A systematic review found moderate effectiveness against persistent anogenital HPV infection and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions in males, with higher effectiveness in HPV-naive individuals [^64e66ac2].

---

## Safety profile of HPV vaccination in older males

HPV vaccines have a **favorable safety profile**, with no significant increase in serious adverse events compared to placebo in clinical trials [^e600a35f] [^58c29034]. Common adverse effects include injection-site reactions, headache, and mild systemic symptoms [^e600a35f] [^a0b99337].

---

## Factors influencing the decision to vaccinate a 28-year-old male

Several factors should be considered when deciding whether to vaccinate a 28-year-old male:

- **Sexual history**: Number of sexual partners, history of sexually transmitted infections, and engagement in high-risk sexual behaviors increase the risk of new HPV infections [^ca7b9075].

- **Immune status**: Immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, may benefit from vaccination due to increased susceptibility to HPV infections [^1c783067].

- **Occupational exposure**: Healthcare workers or individuals with potential occupational exposure to HPV may be considered for vaccination.

- **Personal preferences**: Individual values, preferences, and willingness to pay for the vaccine should be considered [^ca7b9075].

---

## Cost-effectiveness considerations

Vaccinating males aged 27–45 years is generally **not considered cost-effective** at the population level due to the lower likelihood of benefit and the need for a three-dose series [^notfound]. However, individual cost-effectiveness may vary depending on personal risk factors and insurance coverage.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert opinions

ACIP/CDC emphasize that vaccination is most effective when administered before sexual exposure and recommend **shared clinical decision-making** for males aged 27–45 years [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075]. The American Cancer Society (ACS) **does not endorse routine vaccination** for adults aged 27–45 years due to limited effectiveness and potential burden of decision-making [^34be841e] [^35a4ea33].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The HPV vaccine is **not routinely recommended** for a 28-year-old male, but it may be considered through shared clinical decision-making if the individual has not been previously vaccinated and is at risk for new HPV exposure [^d27f2e54] [^ca7b9075]. The decision should be individualized, considering sexual history, immune status, occupational exposure, personal preferences, and cost-effectiveness. If vaccination is chosen, the 9-valent HPV vaccine should be administered in a three-dose series at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^f330936d].

### Vaccination against human papillomavirus [^788fa9b7]. JAMA Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — catch-up through age 26 years: ACIP states that catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. The ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. The document notes that before the June 2019 ACIP update, recommendations for men ages 22 to 26 years differed from those for women, and that catch-up vaccination recommendations are now harmonized for all persons through age 26 years.

On October 25, 2011, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil; Merck & Co, Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ) be used routinely in males. The American Academy of Pediatrics has reviewed updated data provided by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on vaccine efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness as well as programmatic considerations and supports this recommendation. This revised statement updates recommendations for human papillomavirus immunization of both males and females.

Studies with prophylactic HPV vaccination have demonstrated impressive efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety results; however, the implementation and uptake in both low and high-income countries continues to be challenging. Since 2006, administration guidelines have undergone multiple updates regarding age, dosing schedule, and gender. Despite these changes, the basic tenet remains the same: prioritize immunization before initiation of sexual activity and subsequent exposure to HPV. The importance of immunizing males and females equally and the role for catch-up vaccination in late adolescent and adulthood has also been supported by subsequent research. Very recently, the FDA approved to expand the range of eligible patients for the nonavalent (9vHPV) vaccine to women and men from age 27 to 45 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers and diseases. Furthermore, members of the ACIP voted to recommend that individuals between ages 27 and 45 who have not yet been vaccinated discuss the option with their physician. This review will highlight the history of the vaccine, barriers to vaccination, current recommendations, and future directions for success.

### Strategies for the introduction of human papillomavirus vaccination: modelling the optimum age-and sex-specific pattern of vaccination in Finland [^38f5c5ee]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted agent and persistent infection with high risk (hr) types of HPV, most notably types 16 and 18, is the most important risk factor for cervical cancer. Rates of invasive cervical cancer (ICC) in fertile aged women in Finland declined significantly from 1960 to 1990 (Figure 1), mostly as a result of the national screening programme. However, cervical cancer incidence in Finnish women aged 30–39 years is now four times higher than 15 years ago (2.9/100 000 in 1986–1990; 9.8/100 000 in 2000–2004:). This is probably due to an increase in incidence and prevalence of hr HPV types in young (23–28 year old) Finnish women.

In phase III trials, two HPV virus-like particle vaccines have been shown effective in preventing incident and persistent HPV16 and 18 infection and associated precancerous lesions, with reported efficacies in the region of 90–100%. The vaccines could prevent around 70% of all cervical cancer. One vaccine has recently been licensed for use in the US and in Europe. However, there remain important questions about how a HPV vaccine should be used at a population level. These include: the age chosen for vaccination, whether the vaccine is given to female subjects only or to female and male subjects and whether a catch-up vaccination campaign should accompany the introduction of routine vaccination. As mathematical models provide a framework for exploring these questions, we have examined these questions with a model of single-type HPV using the observed epidemiology of HPV in Finland.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine and men: what are the obstacles and challenges? [^3ce142ed]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The present review describes the indications for vaccinating men with the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, reports on the US rates of male vaccination, and reviews the recent research on acceptability of vaccinating men and research on the cost-effectiveness of adding men to existing female HPV immunization programs.

Recent Findings

Recent evidence shows that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents several HPV-related diseases in men. However, despite the licensure of the vaccine in the USA for men 9 through 26 years of age, rates of male vaccination are very low. Research on acceptability, in general, indicates strong interest in vaccination among men, parents, and healthcare providers, though female vaccination is typically seen as a higher priority. Cost-effectiveness studies indicate that in the context of modest female vaccination rates and with the specification of a broad range of disease outcomes (e.g. genital warts, anogenital cancers, and oropharyngeal cancers), male vaccination can be quite cost-effective.

Summary

Men are at high risk for HPV infection and can benefit from vaccination, but vaccination rates among men remain extremely low. More research needs to be done on the predictors of uptake of HPV vaccine among men and on the development of interventions to increase male vaccination.

### Prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes in unvaccinated 16-to 20-year-old men in Quebec, Canada [^3ae6db71]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We observed an overall HPV prevalence of 18.4% (95% CI, 14.6%–22.8%) and a prevalence of 4vHPV vaccine–targeted genotypes (HPV-6/11/16/18) of 0.5% (95% CI,.1%–1.9%) among sexually active unvaccinated 16- to 20-year-old men. The most probable explanation for the low 4vHPV vaccine prevalence observed in our study (0.5%) stems from the herd immunity effect conferred by HPV vaccination of same-age girls as the male subjects included in this study, via the school-based vaccination program implemented since 2008. As of 2019 (just before the start of the study), all female residents of Quebec aged ≤ 28 years had been eligible for free HPV vaccination and 90% had received at least 1 dose by age 15. Both participants harboring a 4vHPV vaccine–targeted genotype reported sexual contact with other men and consequently could have benefited less from the indirect protection conferred by the immunization of girls. The higher prevalence observed for 9vHPV vaccine–targeted genotypes (4.9% [95% CI, 2.9%–7.6%]) is not surprising, since girls were vaccinated with the 4vHPV vaccine up until 2016 (9vHPV vaccine thereafter). Vaccination of boys remains justified to offer direct protection to all men before the onset of sexual activity, particularly for men who will have sex with men.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d67b6386]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^1ff140dd]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — ACIP routine and catch‑up recommendations and special populations: "Currently, the ACIP recommends routine vaccination with the HPV vaccine for individuals 11 through 12 years of age". "The vaccine is licensed for use in children beginning at age 9 years", and "the ACIP recommends HPV vaccination beginning at age 9 years for children and youth with any history of sexual abuse or assault who have not initiated or completed the series". "Vaccination is also recommended for 13- through 26-year-old females and 13- through 21-year-old males" not previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series. Those starting at "15 years of age or older", and those "who are immunocompromised, should complete a 3-dose schedule, at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months". "Males 22 through 26 years of age may also receive the vaccine". "Men who are immune suppressed, have HIV infection, or have sex with men should be vaccinated through age 26 years". "For transgender persons, HPV vaccination is recommended through 26 years for those who were not adequately vaccinated previously".

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^3c1748ef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Adults (27–45 years) — the HPV vaccine is licensed in the United States for women and men through age 45 years. Although administration is safe in patients aged 27–45 and can prevent new infections in women not previously exposed, most women in this age range will already have been exposed to HPV, and the overall public health benefit in women aged 27–45 years is markedly diminished compared with use in the target age range. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### Comparison of different human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine types and dose schedules for prevention of HPV-related disease in females and males [^63e69aab]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three-dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search Methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV-negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV-positive males or females of any age.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main Results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow-up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years. Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 15-year-old females Antibody responses after two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low-certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three-dose group (1/898) and none in the two-dose group (0/899) (low-certainty evidence). Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9- to 14-year-old females and males Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow-up (4 RCTs, moderate- to high-certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low-certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). HPV vaccination of 10- to 26-year-old males In one RCT there was moderate-certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person-years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person-years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person-years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person-years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person-years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person-years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection-site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high-certainty evidence). There was very low-certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness. Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9- to 26-year-old females and males Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9- to 15-years (n = 600), one in females aged 16- to 26-years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16- to 26-years (n = 500). The RCT in 16- to 26-year-old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high-certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high-certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. HPV vaccination for people living with HIV Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low-certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low- to very low-certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' Conclusions

The immunogenicity of two-dose and three-dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post-marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long-term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced-dose schedules against HPV-related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

### The prophylactic role for the human papillomavirus quadrivalent vaccine in males [^f8781550]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) quadrivalent vaccine in males.

Data Source

PubMed (1966-March 2010) was searched using the terms human papillomavirus, human papillomavirus vaccine, quadrivalent, males, cancer, and genital warts. Reference citations were reviewed for relevant information.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies including humans and published in English with data describing HPV quadrivalent vaccine administration in males were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

The HPV quadrivalent vaccine is currently recommended in females, but its role in males is still being defined. Three clinical trials evaluated the immunogenicity and tolerability of the vaccine in more than 1100 males 9–26 years of age. Greater than 99.5% of males seroconverted for HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 at 1 month post-completion and titers were found to be numerically higher than those in females 16–26 years old. One study found that immune response persisted in > 92.5% of males at 1 year. The results show high efficacy against detection of new anogenital lesions in males 29 months after receiving the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. In addition, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine appears to be well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being syncope, fever, local site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and headache.

Conclusions

The HPV quadrivalent vaccine appears to be safe and induces an effective immune response in males. It may also decrease the incidence of anogenital and penile cancer, although current data are limited in number and duration of follow-up. Further analysis of the long-term immunogenicity and effects on HPV-associated complications is needed.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^7055adfc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

### Prevention strategies against human papillomavirus in males [^7799af9c]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Sexually transmitted human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is very common in men and women. Oncogenic HPV is strongly associated with cancers and high-grade dysplasias of the anogenital tract, including the anus, penis, and also a proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. In reducing male disease burden, some consider screening and treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer in high-risk populations. Such strategies have wide implications for the workforce, and require more evidence for the optimal management of AIN. Male sexual behavior, with consequent HPV infection and disease contribute to considerable disease burden in females. Hence, inclusion of males in prophylactic HPV vaccination programs should prevent HPV-related disease in males as well as substantially reducing disease burden in females. Clinical trial data in males 16–26 years for the quadrivalent vaccine show it is well tolerated, induces a strong type-specific immunological response comparable to that of females, and reduced vaccine HPV-type-related genital infection, as well as disease. Cost-benefit analyses and mathematical modeling show that the most cost-effective strategy involves routine administration of this vaccine to 12-year-old females, with catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-olds, with the most effective strategy in disease reduction including men and/or boys in the program. Such a vaccination strategy including 12-year-old boys is projected by 2050 to reduce HPV 16 infection by 88–94% in females and 68–82% in males, plus the aforementioned male HPV- related cancers by 22–27%. Therefore, inclusion of males in an HPV vaccination program is likely to have significant health and economic benefits over and above those observed from current female-only programs. However, comprehensive cost-benefit analyses are needed to determine the efficacy of these programs in the overall population. Such analyses will be crucial for the design, acceptance, and implementation of these vaccination programs into clinical practice globally.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^17949483]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) * routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

### HPV vaccine and males: issues and challenges [^65ec9f59]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

The quadrivalent vaccine has been shown to be safe and efficacious against HPV infection in men. It is expected, though, that male vaccination rates will remain low. Therefore this literature review examines the attitudes of parents, young men, and HCPs toward HPV vaccination and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). It appears that parents are interested in vaccinating their sons against HPV and other (STI). In addition, adolescent and adult males are interested in receipt of HPV vaccine and other vaccines for prevention of STI. Health care providers have a general preference for vaccinating females, but they indicate a willingness to recommend HPV vaccine for their male patients. This is important given the "permissive" recommendation for male HPV vaccination issued by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Cost effectiveness studies have shown that vaccinating males and females is less cost effective than vaccinating females alone. With low female vaccination rates, both cost effectiveness and health benefits increase. It is clear that males have poor knowledge of HPV infection, morbidity, transmission and prevention. Regardless of vaccination strategies adopted, efforts should be made to educate males about HPV and its health implications. In addition, there are more challenges to overcome before male vaccination can be successfully implemented.

### Advisory committee on immunization practices recommended immunization schedule for adults aged 19 years or older-United States, 2017 [^f330936d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination. Healthy adolescents who start their human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination series before age 15 years are recommended to receive 2 doses of HPV vaccine. Adults and adolescents who did not start their HPV vaccination series before age 15 years should receive 3 doses of HPV vaccine. Changes in recommendations in the adult immunization schedule include updates regarding HPV vaccination for adults who did not complete the HPV vaccination series as adolescents. These changes are described in the 2017 adult immunization schedule as follows:

Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years who have not received any HPV vaccine should receive a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated with a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine at 0, 1–2, and 6 months.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received 2 doses at least 5 months apart are considered adequately vaccinated and do not need an additional dose of HPV vaccine.
Adult females through age 26 years and adult males through age 21 years (and males aged 22 through 26 years who may receive HPV vaccine) who initiated the HPV vaccination series before age 15 years and received only 1 dose, or 2 doses less than 5 months apart, are not considered adequately vaccinated and should receive 1 additional dose of HPV vaccine.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d1fbcb81]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

From October 2013 to February 2015, the ACIP HPV Vaccine Work Group reviewed clinical trial data assessing the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of 9vHPV, modeling data on cost-effectiveness of 9vHPV, and data on burden of type-specific HPV-associated disease in the United States. Summaries of reviewed evidence and Work Group discussions were presented to ACIP before recommendations were proposed. Recommendations were approved by ACIP in February 2015. Evidence supporting 9vHPV use was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was categorized as a Category A recommendation (for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^35a4ea33]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Prevalence of human papillomavirus genotypes in unvaccinated 16-to 20-year-old men in Quebec, Canada [^ec7f292f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Indeed, when devising an evaluation strategy for new vaccination schedules, the presence of a herd effect must be taken into consideration. A study conducted in Quebec 5 years after the implementation of the initial vaccination program targeting girls showed a prevalence of 1% for 4vHPV vaccine–targeted genotypes in 17- to 19-year-old women. Data from other jurisdictions support the decline in prevalence of HPV vaccine genotypes in unvaccinated men following the implementation of female vaccination through herd protection. In Quebec, HPV vaccination coverage (VC) is high among young women, with 90% having received at least 1 dose when measured at 15 years old. A modeling study suggests that a sustained VC of 80% or more among girls and boys could eliminate vaccine-targeted HPV genotypes through herd immunity, implying that the 4vHPV vaccine–targeted genotypes may no longer be circulating in Quebec, including among unvaccinated same-age individuals as those targeted by the public vaccination program. Therefore, it was deemed relevant to measure the prevalence of HPV genotypes among unvaccinated individuals before designing a study measuring direct vaccine efficacy comparing vaccinees and nonvaccinees or vaccinees having received different schedules, including the mixed schedule. In our case, the female population could not be targeted for this study, since most females aged 9–28 years had already been vaccinated against HPV, achieving a high VC (> 80%). Likewise, girls and boys vaccinated using the mixed schedule in grade 4 were too young at the time of this study to be potentially infected with HPV infection. Thus, only boys in grade 9 aged 14–15 years also eligible for vaccination with the mixed schedule since September 2018 were of age to be at risk of infection and could be targeted for the evaluation of the schedule change. The precise VC among 16- to 20-year-old men in 2020–2022 is unknown but was estimated to be very low, since this cohort was not eligible for the public vaccination program. A 2014 study conducted among parents of 9- to 16-year-old boys living in Quebec (16–23 years old in 2021) revealed that 1% of boys were vaccinated and 5% of parents intended to vaccinate (with costs) their boy against HPV.

This cross-sectional study aimed to measure the prevalence of HPV infection among unvaccinated sexually active 16- to 20-year-old men and to explore factors associated with HPV detection.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^fa4baf06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — routine and catch-up guidance emphasizes early adolescent initiation and strong clinician recommendation. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for girls and boys at the target age of 11–12 years (but it may be given from the age of 9 years) as part of the adolescent immunization platform, and obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years) if not vaccinated at 11–12 years. Unvaccinated women age 26 years and younger should receive the HPV vaccine series regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should strongly recommend HPV vaccination, should educate parents in their decision making for daughters and sons, and are encouraged to stock and administer HPV vaccines when feasible. HPV vaccines are characterized as among the most effective available, with data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when given before exposure to that HPV type.

American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — age indications and adult decision-making — state that HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, with an ACS qualifying statement that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9–12 y is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, resulting in increased numbers of cancers prevented, and health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine at age 9 or 10 y. Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^292844bd]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — adults older than 26 years: ACIP indicates that catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years; instead, shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years. The ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27 through 45 years because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selecting individuals who might benefit. Supporting context notes that HPV vaccination is most effective in early adolescence, with effectiveness decreasing dramatically by age 18 years and minimal benefit noted by age 20 or 21 years, and that compared with vaccination through age 26 years, extending to adults through age 45 years was estimated to prevent only an additional 0.5% cases of cancer, 0.4% cases of cervical precancer, and 0.3% cases of genital warts over the next 100 years.

Methods

During April 2018–June 2019, the ACIP HPV Vaccines Work Group held at least monthly conference calls to review and discuss relevant scientific evidence regarding adult HPV vaccination using the Evidence to Recommendations framework. The Work Group evaluated the quality of evidence for efficacy, safety, and effectiveness for HPV vaccination for primary prevention of HPV infection and HPV-related disease using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

Scientific literature published during January 1, 2006–October 18, 2018, was searched to identify clinical trials of any licensed HPV vaccine in adults aged 27 through 45 years. Detailed search methods and results for the GRADE tables are available at. Benefits were based on per-protocol analyses of vaccine efficacy; immunogenicity data were also considered. Harms were any vaccine-related serious adverse events. Of 1,388 references identified, 100 were selected for detailed review, and 16 publications were included in GRADE tables presented at the October 2018 ACIP meeting; tables were updated in June 2019 to include new results from a 9vHPV trial. At the June 2019 ACIP meeting, two policy issues were considered: 1) harmonization of catch-up vaccination for all persons through age 26 years, and 2) vaccination of adults aged > 26 years. Two Evidence to Recommendations documents were developed and presented along with proposed recommendations; after a public comment period, ACIP members voted unanimously to harmonize catch-up vaccination recommendations across genders for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP members also voted 10–4 in favor of shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27 through 45 years, recognizing that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^cdff8250]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

### Breaking barriers: why including boys and men is key to HPV prevention [^777581a0]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are no approved screening tests for HPV in men. However, healthcare providers may recommend anal pap smears for men at a higher risk of developing anal cancer, such as those who are immunocompromised or engage in anal intercourse. Vaccination remains the most effective preventative measure against HPV infections and related health issues in men, yet global vaccination coverage for males remains low, standing at a mere 4%. The WHO recommends targeting girls aged 9–14 for HPV vaccinations, but only for males and older women when feasible and affordable. HPV vaccination has been recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first prophylactic HPV vaccine in 2007 for the prevention of HPV-related cancers, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) soon recommended it for both females and males (up to age 26). In 2018, the FDA extended the HPV vaccine approval for use in adults aged 27–45. Currently, six prophylactic HPV vaccines are licensed: three bivalent, two quadrivalent, and one nonavalent. The 9-valent HPV Gardasil-9® vaccine is particularly effective, serving as a preventive measure against anogenital lesions and oropharyngeal and other head and neck cancers resulting from specific HPV types such as 16/18/31/33/45/52/58.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — ACIP ages and dosing for adolescents and people with HIV — states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination with 9 valent HPV vaccine for all 11- or 12-year-old girls and boys, with the series able to start at age 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended for all 13- to 26-year-old females and all 13- to 21-year-old males who have not been vaccinated, and is also recommended for males aged 22 to 26 years who are men who have sex with men (MSM), or have HIV infection or are otherwise immunocompromised. The 9-valent vaccine should be delivered through a series of three intramuscular injections over a 6-month period, with the second and third doses given at 1 to 2 months and then 6 months after the first dose; although ACIP recommends a 2-dose schedule for adolescents initiating the vaccine series at ages 9 to 14 years, three doses of HPV vaccine (0, 1–2, and 6 months) are recommended for females and males with HIV infection or other immunosuppression because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^f5bbc0a9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Teens and adults (15–26 years) — if the first dose is given at age 15 years or older, three doses are needed at 0 (baseline), 1–2 months after the first dose, and 6 months after the first dose. Unvaccinated women age 26 years and younger should receive the HPV vaccine series regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation, and some benefit is expected because prior exposure to all nine vaccine types is highly unlikely. Vaccination is recommended for women through age 26 years even if HPV DNA testing is positive, and testing for HPV DNA is not recommended before vaccination.

### Committee opinion no. 704: human papillomavirus vaccination [^3c57ac38]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with anogenital cancer (including cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal), oropharyngeal cancer, and genital warts. The HPV vaccination significantly reduces the incidence of anogenital cancer and genital warts. Despite the benefits of HPV vaccines, only 41.9% of girls in the recommended age group, and only 28.1% of males in the recommended age group have received all recom-mended doses. Compared with many other countries, HPV vaccination rates in the United States are unacceptably low. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved three vaccines that are effective at preventing HPV infection. These vaccines cover 2, 4, or 9 HPV serotypes, respectively. Safety data for all three HPV vaccines are reassuring. The HPV vaccines are recommended for girls and boys aged 11–12 years and can be given to females and males up to age 26 years. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at the target age of 11–12 years (but it may be given from the age of 9 years) as part of the adolescent immunization platform in order to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancer and genital warts associated with HPV infection. Obstetrician-gynecologists and other health care providers should stress to parents and patients the benefits and safety of HPV vaccination and offer HPV vaccines in their offices.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^89182cb5]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — rationale for early adolescent vaccination and immunogenicity: "The rationale for administering the HPV vaccine routinely at the 11- through 12-year-old visit" includes high post‑initiation infection risk, with "nearly 40% within the first 2 years" among college women and "almost 60% among college men", supporting early completion of "all 3 HPV vaccine doses". Sexual debut is common, with "~24%" reporting intercourse by ninth grade and "58.1%" by 12th grade. Immunogenicity is higher at younger ages: "greater antibody responses in girls and boys 9 through 15 years of age" versus "16- through 26 years of age". Long‑term data show durability, with a study "conducted over a period of 8 years" demonstrating safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness in those "9 through 15 years of age".

### The indirect effect of the bivalent human papillomavirus vaccination program: an observational cohort study [^3dce6de5]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A persistent infection with a high-risk type of human papillomavirus (HPV) is the established cause of cervical cancer. Since 2006, prophylactic vaccination is available to prevent HPV-associated diseases. High vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness against persisting vaccine-type infections have been observed for licenced HPV vaccines. Prolonged high vaccination coverage has led to a reduction in the incidence of HPV vaccine-type infections, precancerous lesions, and cervical cancer. In countries with suboptimal HPV vaccination coverage, it is pivotal to assess the magnitude of herd effects in the unvaccinated population.

In the Netherlands, the bivalent HPV (2vHPV) vaccine was introduced in the national immunisation program in 2010, which was preceded by a catch-up campaign in 2009 for girls born between 1993 and 1996. Originally, girls were offered HPV vaccination via a 3-dose (3D) schedule in the year they turned 13. In 2014, the 3D schedule was replaced by a 2-dose (2D) schedule. The coverage of the 2vHPV vaccine within the immunisation program has been relatively low for many years, with a coverage ranging between 46 and 63%. In recent years, the program has been expanded to include boys and catch-up campaigns have been temporarily implemented for individuals up to 28 years of age. The low coverage over an extended period has left a significant portion of the population susceptible to vaccine-related HPV type infections. Besides direct vaccine effectiveness, vaccination can offer indirect protection through herd immunity, benefiting everyone in the population, regardless of their vaccination status.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^cd759357]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — regulatory scope and core recommendations — notes that three vaccines covering 2, 4, or 9 HPV serotypes have been approved, with bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines approved for women and men aged 9–26 years, the 9‑valent vaccine approved for women and men aged 9–45 years, and the 9‑valent vaccine currently the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at 11–12 years, but it may be given from the age of 9 years. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch‑up period (ages 13–26 years) regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation if they were not vaccinated at 11–12 years. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

### Safety of the 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine [^e600a35f]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine (9vHPV) was approved for females and males aged 9 to 26 years in 2014. We analyzed postlicensure surveillance reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).

Methods

We searched VAERS data for US reports of adverse events (AEs) after 9vHPV from December 2014 through December 2017. We calculated reporting rates and conducted empirical Bayesian data mining to identify disproportional reporting. Physicians reviewed reports for selected prespecified conditions.

Results

VAERS received 7244 reports after 9vHPV: 31.2% among females, 21.6% among males, and for 47.2%, sex was not reported. Overall, 97.4% of reports were nonserious. Dizziness, syncope, headache, and injection site reactions were most commonly reported; the most commonly reported AEs were similar between females and males. Two reports of death after 9vHPV were verified; no information in autopsy reports or death certificates suggested a causal relationship with vaccination. Approximately 28 million 9vHPV doses were distributed during the study period; crude AE reporting rates were 259 reports per million 9vHPV doses distributed for all reports and 7 per million doses distributed for serious reports. Syncope (a known AE associated with human papillomavirus vaccination) and several types of vaccine administration errors (eg, administered at wrong age) exceeded the statistical threshold for empirical Bayesian data mining findings.

Conclusions

No new or unexpected safety concerns or reporting patterns of 9vHPV with clinically important AEs were detected. The safety profile of 9vHPV is consistent with data from prelicensure trials and from postmarketing safety data of its predecessor, the quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine.

### FDA licensure of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4, gardasil) for use in males and guidance from the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^7b7b6eba]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2010). Low credibility.

On October 16, 2009, the Food and Drug Administration licensed quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV4; Gardasil, Merck & Co. Inc.) for use in males aged 9 through 26 years for prevention of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11. HPV4 had been licensed previously for use in females aged 9 through 26 years for prevention of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-related outcomes (i.e., vaginal, vulvar, and cervical precancers and cancers and genital warts). The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of females at age 11 or 12 years and catch-up vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years. On October 21, 2009, ACIP provided guidance that HPV4 may be given to males aged 9 through 26 years to reduce their likelihood of acquiring genital warts; ACIP does not recommend HPV4 for routine use among males. This report presents the ACIP policy statement and summarizes background data. Issues reviewed by ACIP included efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of the HPV4 vaccine in males, epidemiology of HPV and burden of HPV-associated diseases and cancers in males, cost-effectiveness of male vaccination, and programmatic considerations.

### Guidelines for prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected adults and adolescents: recommendations from CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^adafaeb6]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — HIV-specific age recommendation and approval status — states that HPV vaccination is recommended for males and females with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection aged 13 through 26 years (AIII). Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years, and women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV.

If a significant delay occurs between doses, there is no need to restart the series. Some people with HIV ages 27–45 years may benefit from vaccination, and shared clinical decision-making between the provider and patient is recommended in these situations. Vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII). Delay until after pregnancy. ACIP: No difference in recommendations.

### National trends in parental human papillomavirus vaccination intentions and reasons for hesitancy, 2010–2015 [^4d20db18]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was recommended for routine administration to adolescent females in 2006 and to adolescent males in 2011 in the United States, yet vaccine uptake lags behind other recommended adolescent vaccines. For example, in 2015, only 63% of females aged 13–17 years, and just 50% of males, had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine compared with overall coverage of 86% for the tetanus booster (Tdap) vaccine and 81% for the meningococcal ACWY vaccine. Although HPV vaccine uptake has increased over the past decade, series completion rates are still far below the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%, at 42% among females and 28% among males in 2015.

Despite evidence that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, and extensive efforts to effectively communicate the value of HPV vaccines, parental concerns about HPV vaccination contribute to their delay or refusal to vaccinate their children. Questions remain about whether and to what degree parental vaccination intentions and reasons for HPV vaccine hesitancy have changed over time. Little research has examined the differences between parents of adolescent females and males or between parents of adolescents who are unvaccinated and undervaccinated (ie, those who have initiated, but not yet completed the series). Understanding how vaccination intent and reasons for hesitancy have changed over time can inform healthcare providers' and public health practitioners' understanding of the impact of efforts to improve HPV vaccine uptake, why a large proportion of teens remain unvaccinated or undervaccinated against HPV, and how best to tailor messaging to address the changing landscape of concerns going forward. Thus, we aimed to (1) characterize parents' vaccination intentions and assess the degree to which parental intentions have changed over time; (2) identify the most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy among parents with low intent to vaccinate and assess changes in reported reasons over time; and (3) investigate differences in parental attitudes and concerns between parents of adolescent females and males for both unvaccinated and undervaccinated teens.

### Reducing cancer and cancer disparities: lessons from a youth-generated diabetes prevention campaign [^ed4a5b03]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Human Papillomavirus–related Cancers

HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. with an estimate of more than 7 million individuals aged 15–24 years being infected. HPV prevalence in U.S. women is highest among individuals aged 20–24 years, at 53.8%. White women experience cervical cancer at an incidence rate of 6.2 per 100,000 people compared with 7.8 for black, 8.2 for Hispanic, and 9.4 for American Indian/Alaska Native women. Black women experience the highest mortality rates from cervical cancer in the U.S. compared with all other racial and ethnic groups, which has been underestimated previously. Disparities in HPV vaccination rates mirror disparities in cervical cancer incidence and mortality. The HPV vaccine has been licensed for use in females since 2006 and in males since 2009, – with recommendations for starting at age 11 or 12 years; make-up vaccination for women through age 26 years and men through age 21 years; and for gay and bisexual men and immune-compromised persons through age 26 years. In 2015, only 42% of females and 28% of males aged 13–17 years received the three-dose vaccine series; only 23% of women aged 18–26 years and 7% of women aged 27–30years and only 5% of men aged 18–30 years reported receiving at least one dose of the vaccine. Some studies have shown that black and Latina girls and women have lower odds of initiating and completing the vaccine series, whereas others demonstrate mixed results. For boys, being a racial/ethnic minority does not carry excess risk, and data regarding vaccine initiation are mixed. Contributors to disparities in HPV include geographical differences, access barriers, variable clinician recommendation, mistrust of the healthcare system, and variable vaccine literacy.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^3885a40a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

HPV vaccine administration and series completion specify that 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV are each administered in a 3-dose schedule, with the second dose administered at least 1 to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose at least 6 months after the first dose; minimum intervals are 1 month between the first and second dose, 3 months between the second and third dose, and 6 months between the first and third dose; if the vaccine schedule is interrupted, the vaccination series does not need to be restarted; if vaccination providers do not know or do not have available the HPV vaccine product previously administered, or are in settings transitioning to 9vHPV, any available HPV vaccine product may be used to continue or complete the series for females for protection against HPV 16 and 18, and 9vHPV or 4vHPV may be used to continue or complete the series for males; there are no data on efficacy of fewer than 3 doses of 9vHPV.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^64e66ac2]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer in females. As HPV infections can also induce cancers of the anus, penis and oral cavity, male vaccination is also advocated, but systematic reviews on efficacy and safety in males are lacking.

Methods

We performed a systematic review on the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of HPV vaccination in males of any age. MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception to April 2017.

Results

We identified 5196 articles and seven studies (four randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three non-randomized studies) were included, comprising a total of 5294 participants. Vaccine efficacy against at least 6-month persisting anogenital HPV 16 infections was 46.9% (95% confidence interval (CI) 28.6–60.8%), whereas efficacy against persisting oral infections was 88% (2–98%). A vaccine efficacy of 61.9% (21.4–82.8%) and 46.8% (− 20 to –77.9%) was observed against anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 and grade 3 lesions, respectively. No meaningful estimates were available on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness against penile intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3, and no data were identified for anal, penile or head and neck squamous cell cancer. In participants who were HPV-seronegative and PCR-negative at enrolment, efficacy against all outcomes was higher as compared to seropositive and/or PCR-positive individuals. Risk of bias was low in three RCTs and high in one, while the three non-randomized studies were at serious to critical risk of bias. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation evidence quality was moderate to low for most outcomes.

Conclusions

HPV vaccination in males is moderately effective against persistent anogenital HPV infection and high-grade anal intraepithelial lesions in studies where the population consists mainly of HPV-infected males. Vaccine effectiveness was high in study groups comprising HPV-naïve males. This supports a recommendation for vaccination of boys before the onset of sexual activity with the goal of establishing optimal vaccine-induced protection. Mathematical modelling studies will still be needed to assess the effects of adding males to existing HPV vaccination programs in females.

### Comparison of two dose and three dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules: cost effectiveness analysis based on transmission model [^62e19b3b]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To investigate the incremental cost effectiveness of two dose human papillomavirus vaccination and of additionally giving a third dose.

Design

Cost effectiveness study based on a transmission dynamic model of human papillomavirus vaccination. Two dose schedules for bivalent or quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines were assumed to provide 10, 20, or 30 years' vaccine type protection and cross protection or lifelong vaccine type protection without cross protection. Three dose schedules were assumed to give lifelong vaccine type and cross protection.

Setting

United Kingdom.

Population

Males and females aged 12–74 years.

Interventions

No, two, or three doses of human papillomavirus vaccine given routinely to 12 year old girls, with an initial catch-up campaign to 18 years.

Main Outcome Measure

Costs (from the healthcare provider's perspective), health related utilities, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios.

Results

Giving at least two doses of vaccine seems to be highly cost effective across the entire range of scenarios considered at the quadrivalent vaccine list price of £86.50 (€109.23; $136.00) per dose. If two doses give only 10 years' protection but adding a third dose extends this to lifetime protection, then the third dose also seems to be cost effective at £86.50 per dose (median incremental cost effectiveness ratio £17,000, interquartile range £11,700-£25,800). If two doses protect for more than 20 years, then the third dose will have to be priced substantially lower (median threshold price £31, interquartile range £28-£35) to be cost effective. Results are similar for a bivalent vaccine priced at £80.50 per dose and when the same scenarios are explored by parameterising a Canadian model (HPV-ADVISE) with economic data from the United Kingdom.

Conclusions

Two dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules are likely to be the most cost effective option provided protection lasts for at least 20 years. As the precise duration of two dose schedules may not be known for decades, cohorts given two doses should be closely monitored.

Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination, and HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously, and vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years, and for these recommendations ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males, whereas bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females.

United States human papillomavirus (HPV)–attributable cancer burden and vaccine uptake — For the period from 2012 to 2016, an average of 34,800 cancers annually in the United States were attributable to HPV infection, and ninety-two percent of these cases (32,100) were attributable to the types targeted by the 9-valent HPV vaccine, the only vaccine formulation distributed in the United States since 2016. According to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, in 2018, 68.1% of adolescents (male and female) aged 13 to 17 years had received at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and 51.1% were up to date with the HPV vaccine series.

Abstract

Background

Uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains low in many countries, although the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines given as a three‐dose schedule are effective in the prevention of precancerous lesions of the cervix in women. Simpler immunisation schedules, such as those with fewer doses, might reduce barriers to vaccination, as may programmes that include males.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy, immunogenicity, and harms of different dose schedules and different types of HPV vaccines in females and males.

Search methods

We conducted electronic searches on 27 September 2018 in Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (in the Cochrane Library), and Ovid Embase. We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov (both 27 September 2018), vaccine manufacturer websites, and checked reference lists from an index of HPV studies and other relevant systematic reviews.

Selection criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with no language restriction. We considered studies if they enrolled HIV‐negative males or females aged 9 to 26 years, or HIV‐positive males or females of any age.

Data collection and analysis

We used methods recommended by Cochrane. We use the term 'control' to refer to comparator products containing an adjuvant or active vaccine and 'placebo' to refer to products that contain no adjuvant or active vaccine. Most primary outcomes in this review were clinical outcomes. However, for comparisons comparing dose schedules, the included RCTs were designed to measure antibody responses (i.e. immunogenicity) as the primary outcome, rather than clinical outcomes, since it is unethical to collect cervical samples from girls under 16 years of age. We analysed immunogenicity outcomes (i.e.g.eometric mean titres) with ratios of means, clinical outcomes (e.g. cancer and intraepithelial neoplasia) with risk ratios or rate ratios and, for serious adverse events and deaths, we calculated odds ratios. We rated the certainty of evidence with GRADE.

Main results

We included 20 RCTs with 31,940 participants. The length of follow‐up in the included studies ranged from seven months to five years.

Two doses versus three doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 15‐year‐old females

Antibody responses after two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules were similar after up to five years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected clinical outcome data. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing dose schedules was of very low‐certainty owing to imprecision and indirectness (three doses 35/1159; two doses 36/1158; 4 RCTs). One death was reported in the three‐dose group (1/898) and none in the two‐dose group (0/899) (low‐certainty evidence).

Interval between doses of HPV vaccine in 9‐ to 14‐year‐old females and males

Antibody responses were stronger with a longer interval (6 or 12 months) between the first two doses of HPV vaccine than a shorter interval (2 or 6 months) at up to three years of follow‐up (4 RCTs, moderate‐ to high‐certainty evidence). No RCTs collected data about clinical outcomes. Evidence about serious adverse events in studies comparing intervals was of very low‐certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness. No deaths were reported in any of the studies (0/1898, 3 RCTs, low‐certainty evidence).

HPV vaccination of 10‐ to 26‐year‐old males

In one RCT there was moderate‐certainty evidence that quadrivalent HPV vaccine, compared with control, reduced the incidence of external genital lesions (control 36 per 3081 person‐years; quadrivalent 6 per 3173 person‐years; rate ratio 0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.38; 6254 person‐years) and anogenital warts (control 28 per 2814 person‐years; quadrivalent 3 per 2831 person‐years; rate ratio 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.38; 5645 person‐years). The quadrivalent vaccine resulted in more injection‐site adverse events, such as pain or redness, than control (537 versus 601 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.18, 3895 participants, high‐certainty evidence). There was very low‐certainty evidence from two RCTs about serious adverse events with quadrivalent vaccine (control 12/2588; quadrivalent 8/2574), and about deaths (control 11/2591; quadrivalent 3/2582), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Nonavalent versus quadrivalent vaccine in 9‐ to 26‐year‐old females and males

Three RCTs were included; one in females aged 9‐ to 15‐years (n = 600), one in females aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 14,215), and one in males aged 16‐ to 26‐years (n = 500). The RCT in 16‐ to 26‐year‐old females reported clinical outcomes. There was little to no difference in the incidence of the combined outcome of high‐grade cervical epithelial neoplasia, adenocarcinoma in situ, or cervical cancer between the HPV vaccines (quadrivalent 325/6882, nonavalent 326/6871; OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.16; 13,753 participants; high‐certainty evidence). The other two RCTs did not collect data about clinical outcomes. There were slightly more local adverse events with the nonavalent vaccine (905 per 1000) than the quadrivalent vaccine (846 per 1000) (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.08; 3 RCTs, 15,863 participants; high‐certainty evidence). Comparative evidence about serious adverse events in the three RCTs (nonavalent 243/8234, quadrivalent 192/7629; OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.61) was of low certainty, owing to imprecision and indirectness.

HPV vaccination for people living with HIV

Seven RCTs reported on HPV vaccines in people with HIV, with two small trials that collected data about clinical outcomes. Antibody responses were higher following vaccination with either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine than with control, and these responses could be demonstrated to have been maintained for up to 24 months in children living with HIV (low‐certainty evidence). The evidence about clinical outcomes and harms for HPV vaccines in people with HIV is very uncertain (low‐ to very low‐certainty evidence), owing to imprecision and indirectness.

Authors' conclusions

The immunogenicity of two‐dose and three‐dose HPV vaccine schedules, measured using antibody responses in young females, is comparable. The quadrivalent vaccine probably reduces external genital lesions and anogenital warts in males compared with control. The nonavalent and quadrivalent vaccines offer similar protection against a combined outcome of cervical, vaginal, and vulval precancer lesions or cancer. In people living with HIV, both the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines result in high antibody responses. For all comparisons of alternative HPV vaccine schedules, the certainty of the body of evidence about serious adverse events reported during the study periods was low or very low, either because the number of events was low, or the evidence was indirect, or both. Post‐marketing surveillance is needed to continue monitoring harms that might be associated with HPV vaccines in the population, and this evidence will be incorporated in future updates of this review. Long‐term observational studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of reduced‐dose schedules against HPV‐related cancer endpoints, and whether adopting these schedules improves vaccine coverage rates.

### Efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety of a quadrivalent HPV vaccine in men: results of an open-label, long-term extension of a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^092adc46]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Background

The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was shown to prevent infections and lesions related to HPV6, 11, 16, and 18 in a randomised, placebo-controlled study in men aged 16–26 years. We assessed the incidences of external genital warts related to HPV6 or 11, and external genital lesions and anal dysplasia related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18, over 10 years of follow-up.

Methods

The 3-year base study was an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial done at 71 sites in 18 countries. Eligible participants were heterosexual men (aged 16–23 years) or men who have sex with men (MSM; aged 16–26 years). Men who had clinically detectable anogenital warts or genital lesions at screening that were suggestive of infection with non-HPV sexually transmitted diseases, or who had a history of such findings, were excluded. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive three doses of either quadrivalent HPV vaccine or placebo on day 1, month 2, and month 6, administered as a 0·5-mL injection into the deltoid muscle. The 7-year, open-label, long-term follow-up extension study was done at 46 centres in 16 countries. Participants who received one or more doses of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in the base study were eligible for enrolment into the long-term follow-up study (early vaccination group). Placebo recipients were offered the three-dose quadrivalent HPV vaccine at the end of the base study; those who received one or more quadrivalent HPV vaccine doses were eligible for enrolment into the long-term follow-up study (catch-up vaccination group). The primary efficacy endpoints were the incidence of external genital warts related to HPV6 or 11 and the incidence of external genital lesions related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 in all participants and the incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia (including anal warts and flat lesions) or anal cancer related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 in MSM only. The primary efficacy analysis was done in the per-protocol population for the early vaccination group, which included participants who received all three vaccine doses, were seronegative at day 1 and PCR-negative from day 1 through month 7 of the base study for the HPV type being analysed, had no protocol violations that could affect evaluation of vaccine efficacy, and had attended at least one visit during the long-term follow-up study. For the catch-up vaccination group, efficacy was assessed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included participants who had received at least one vaccine dose, were seronegative and PCR-negative for HPV types analysed from day 1 of the base study to the final follow-up visit before receiving the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, and had at least one long-term follow-up visit. Safety was assessed in all randomised participants who received at least one vaccine dose. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00090285.

Findings

Between Aug 10, 2010, and April 3, 2017, 1803 participants were enrolled in the long-term follow-up study, of whom 936 (827 heterosexual men and 109 MSM) were included in the early vaccination group and 867 (739 heterosexual men and 128 MSM) were included in the catch-up vaccination group. Participants in the early vaccination group were followed up for a median of 9·5 years (range 0·1–11·5) after receiving the third dose of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, and participants in the catch-up vaccination group were followed up for a median of 4·7 years (0·0–6·6) after receiving the third dose. In early vaccine group participants during long-term follow-up compared with the placebo group in the base study, the incidence per 10000 person-years of external genital warts related to HPV6 or 11 was 0·0 (95% CI 0·0–8·7) versus 137·3 (83·9–212·1), of external genital lesions related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 was 0·0 (0·0–7·7) versus 140·4 (89·0–210·7), and of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or anal cancer related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 in MSM only was 20·5 (0·5–114·4) versus 906·2 (553·5–1399·5). Compared with during the base study (ie, before quadrivalent HPV vaccine administration), during the long-term follow-up period, participants in the catch-up vaccination group had no new reported cases of external genital warts related to HPV6 or 11 (149·6 cases per 10000 person-years [95% CI 101·6–212·3] vs 0 cases per 10000 person-years [0·0–13·5]) or external genital lesions related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 (155·1 cases per 10000 person-years [108·0–215·7] vs 0 cases per 10000 person-years [0·0–10·2]), and a lower incidence of anal intraepithelial neoplasia or anal cancer related to HPV6, 11, 16, or 18 (886·0 cases per 10000 person-years [583·9–1289·1] vs 101·3 cases per 10000 person-years [32·9–236·3]). No vaccine-related serious adverse events were reported.

Interpretation

The quadrivalent HPV vaccine provides durable protection against anogenital disease related to HPV6, 11, 16, and 18. The results support quadrivalent HPV vaccination in men, including catch-up vaccination.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination guideline update: American cancer society guideline endorsement [^10fdc023]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

### Men's attitudes toward receiving the human papillomavirus vaccine [^a486f894]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine men's attitudes toward receiving the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine.

Materials and Methods

Five hundred seventy-one men read a 1-page informational sheet about HPV and the HPV vaccine before completing a 29-item questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were calculated on all variables.

Results

Of these men, 33% wanted to receive the HPV vaccine, 27% did not, and 40% were undecided. The main reasons for wanting the vaccine included a desire to stay healthy (67.4%); prevention of cancer in my sexual partner(s) (52.9%); prevention of anal, penile, and head and neck cancer (41.0%); fear of cancer (33.4%); and prevention of genital warts (32.8%). Being in a monogamous relationship and not at risk (18.9%), not interested (13.8%), and not enough evidence yet to prove that it will help men (8.2%) were the main reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated.

Conclusions

Although many men want to receive the HPV vaccine, more remain undecided. Pending favorable safety and efficacy results from a clinical trial for men, substantial factual education will likely convince many ambivalent men to receive the HPV vaccine.

### Comparison of two dose and three dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules: cost effectiveness analysis based on transmission model [^167ce3fa]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Objective To investigate the incremental cost effectiveness of two dose human papillomavirus vaccination and of additionally giving a third dose.

Design Cost effectiveness study based on a transmission dynamic model of human papillomavirus vaccination. Two dose schedules for bivalent or quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccines were assumed to provide 10, 20, or 30 years' vaccine type protection and cross protection or lifelong vaccine type protection without cross protection. Three dose schedules were assumed to give lifelong vaccine type and cross protection.

Setting United Kingdom.

Population Males and females aged 12–74 years.

Interventions No, two, or three doses of human papillomavirus vaccine given routinely to 12 year old girls, with an initial catch-up campaign to 18 years.

Main outcome measure Costs (from the healthcare provider's perspective), health related utilities, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios.

Results Giving at least two doses of vaccine seems to be highly cost effective across the entire range of scenarios considered at the quadrivalent vaccine list price of £86.50 (€109.23; $136.00) per dose. If two doses give only 10 years' protection but adding a third dose extends this to lifetime protection, then the third dose also seems to be cost effective at £86.50 per dose (median incremental cost effectiveness ratio £17 000, interquartile range £11 700-£25 800). If two doses protect for more than 20 years, then the third dose will have to be priced substantially lower (median threshold price £31, interquartile range £28-£35) to be cost effective. Results are similar for a bivalent vaccine priced at £80.50 per dose and when the same scenarios are explored by parameterising a Canadian model (HPV-ADVISE) with economic data from the United Kingdom.

Conclusions Two dose human papillomavirus vaccine schedules are likely to be the most cost effective option provided protection lasts for at least 20 years. As the precise duration of two dose schedules may not be known for decades, cohorts given two doses should be closely monitored.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^236fddeb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) has a minimum age of 9 years and, because it is not a live virus vaccine, it can be administered to individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those with HIV, although the immune response and vaccine efficacy in immunosuppressed individuals may be less than in immunocompetent individuals. HPV vaccines must be administered in a three-dose series to children and adolescents with HIV and are most effective for both males and females when given before exposure to HPV through sexual contact. Administer the first dose at age 11 years or 12 years, with approval to start as early as age 9 years. HPV vaccine should be administered early, beginning at 9 years of age, for persons with a history of sexual abuse and assault, and HPV vaccine can be administered to anyone beginning at 9 years of age. Administer the second dose 1 month to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose (≥ 24 weeks after the first dose), and administer the three-dose series at ages 13 years through 26 years if not previously vaccinated.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f4cb7a8a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine safety… [^58c29034]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

CDC is aware of public concern about the safety of HPV vaccine. Since the vaccine's introduction in 2006, vaccine safety monitoring and studies conducted by CDC, FDA, and other organizations have documented a reassuring safety record. Available vaccines & manufacturer package inserts Gardasil 9 and manufacturer insert
- Gardasil 9 was approved by FDA for use in 2014.
- The safety of Gardasil 9 was studied in clinical trials with more than 15, 000 participants before it was licensed and continues to be monitored.
- Gardasil 9 protects against 9 types of cancer-causing HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. For HPV vaccine to be most effective, the series should begin prior to exposure to HPV. Keep Reading: Vaccine Information Statement. The 9vHPV vaccine adds 5 additional antigens, providing protection against 9 types of cancer-causing human papillomaviruses.

Studies of 2vHPV have also shown a favorable safety profile. While the vaccines target different HPV types, all three HPV vaccines are similar and made from a single protein of the HPV virus. Who should & should not get the vaccine CDC recommends HPV vaccination for everyone through age 26 years, if not vaccinated already. Teens and young adults who start the series at ages 15 through 26 years still need three doses of HPV vaccine. Three doses are also recommended for people with certain immunocompromising conditions ages 9 through 26 years. Keep Reading: Who should & should not get the vaccine. When to call 911 Severe allergic reactions following vaccination are rare, but can be life threatening. If someone experiences symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, which can include hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, and weakness. HPV vaccine is safe and effective at preventing HPV-related infections and cancers.

Vaccines, like any medicine, can have side effects. Many people who get the HPV vaccine have no side effects at all. The most common side effects are usually mild, like a sore arm from the shot. HPV vaccines and fertility HPV vaccination prevents infection with the HPV types that most commonly cause cervical cancer. In some cases, women develop cervical cancer before starting or finish having children. Treatment for cervical cancer can keep a woman from being able to become pregnant. Preventing cervical cancer through HPV vaccination reduces this risk. A closer look at the safety data HPV vaccines are safe Findings from many vaccine safety monitoring systems and more than 160 studies have shown that HPV vaccines have a favorable safety profile — the body of scientific evidence overwhelmingly supports their safety. Of the reports to VAERS, 6% were classified as "serious.

" Of the other reports to VAERS relating to HPV, about 22% of the reports were not related to health problems, but were reported for reasons such as improper vaccine storage or the vaccine being given to someone for whom it was not recommended.
- **Analysis from VSD**: The Vaccine Safety Datalink conducted near-real time surveillance from October 2015 through October 2017, looking at 11 pre-specified adverse events. During this two-year time period, nearly 840, 000 doses were administered to people aged 9–26 years at six VSD sites. No new safety concerns were identified.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^59437857]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review followed a protocol published in the Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO; registration no. CRD42016038965) and was reported according to the guidelines in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. To be eligible, a study had to investigate the efficacy, effectiveness and/or safety of vaccination (with a licensed vaccine) against HPV in males of any age. The control group had to be males who were either unvaccinated or had received placebo or a vaccine not directed against HPV. An eligible study had to report on at least one of the following predefined outcomes: (1) incident oral infection with an HR HPV type; (2) incident anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type; (3) persisting oral infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (4) persisting anogenital (or anal) infection with an HR HPV type (≥ 6 months); (5) condyloma acuminatum (genital or anal) due to HPV 6 or 11; (6) anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade 2; (7) AIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (8) penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) grade 2; (9) PIN grade 3 or carcinoma; (10) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region, including the oropharynx, larynx and oral cavity; (11) epithelial dysplasia related to (10); and (12) any severe adverse event following immunization. As we were primarily interested in clinical relevance, we did not restrict ourselves to vaccine-type specific lesions only.

The electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (date of initial search 4 November 2016; last update 18 April 2017). For details on the complete search strategy, see Additional file 1. Additionally, ClinicalTrials.gov was searched systematically for unpublished or ongoing trials. Electronic searches were complemented by manually screening conference abstract books of major international HPV conferences (EUROGIN 2016, International HPV Conference 2017) as well as reference lists of all identified studies and those of identified reviews. Search results (titles, abstracts, full texts) were independently assessed by two investigators (TH, MWP). Differences were discussed until a consensus was reached.

We did not make any restrictions with regard to setting, language or publication status (published/unpublished). Potential indirect effects of male HPV vaccination on the incidence of clinical outcomes in females were not considered in this review.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination in males [^bc9b04fb]. Gynecologic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and is frequently presented clinically as anogenital warts in both males and females. There is a high rate of transmission of HPV in female partners of men with pre-existing penile warts, and HPV infection in men has been shown to contribute to HPV infection and subsequent cervical disease in women. HPV is associated with significant morbidity and represents a substantial healthcare burden. Data indicate that males experienced a longer duration of genital warts and incurred greater treatment costs than women. The quadrivalent vaccine, the first vaccine to be approved for use in adolescent and young women aged 9 to 26 years for the prevention of cervical cancer and genital warts, targets HPV types -6, and -11 (responsible for genital warts), and HPV types-16 and -18 (involved in cervical cancer). Pharmacoeconomic data determined that routine administration of a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine to 12-year-old males and females in addition to catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-old males and females, within the setting of organized cervical cancer screening within the US, was the most cost-effective strategy. It is also anticipated that widespread use of vaccines that offer protection against HPV-6 and -11 could potentially reduce the workload at STD clinics by approximately 10% without a substantial impact on the diagnosis and treatment of other STDs. To optimally control transmission of HPV, consideration should be given to vaccinating males as well as females.

### An update on human papillomavirus vaccination in the United States [^678d14b1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Cervical cancer remains a significant disease in the United States. Although the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been approved for those aged 9–26 years and for some individuals up to age 45 years, there are many circumstances in which health care professionals may not know whether the vaccine should be recommended, such as for patients with previous infection, health care workers, and those older than age 26 years. This article highlights the evidence that the HPV vaccine is a safe and highly effective way to prevent cervical cancer, with the strongest predictor of vaccine uptake being practitioner recommendation.

### Efficacy of quadrivalent HPV vaccine against HPV infection and disease in males [^e575a541]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and diseases caused by HPV are common in boys and men. We report on the safety of a quadrivalent vaccine (active against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18) and on its efficacy in preventing the development of external genital lesions and anogenital HPV infection in boys and men.

Methods

We enrolled 4065 healthy boys and men 16 to 26 years of age, from 18 countries in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. The primary efficacy objective was to show that the quadrivalent HPV vaccine reduced the incidence of external genital lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. Efficacy analyses were conducted in a per-protocol population, in which subjects received all three vaccinations and were negative for relevant HPV types at enrollment, and in an intention-to-treat population, in which subjects received vaccine or placebo, regardless of baseline HPV status.

Results

In the intention-to-treat population, 36 external genital lesions were seen in the vaccine group as compared with 89 in the placebo group, for an observed efficacy of 60.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 40.8 to 73.8); the efficacy was 65.5% (95% CI, 45.8 to 78.6) for lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18. In the per-protocol population, efficacy against lesions related to HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 was 90.4% (95% CI, 69.2 to 98.1). Efficacy with respect to persistent infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, or 18 and detection of related DNA at any time was 47.8% (95% CI, 36.0 to 57.6) and 27.1% (95% CI, 16.6 to 36.3), respectively, in the intention-to-treat population and 85.6% (97.5% CI, 73.4 to 92.9) and 44.7% (95% CI, 31.5 to 55.6) in the per-protocol population. Injection-site pain was significantly more frequent among subjects receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine than among those receiving placebo (57% vs. 51%, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Quadrivalent HPV vaccine prevents infection with HPV-6, 11, 16, and 18 and the development of related external genital lesions in males 16 to 26 years of age. (Funded by Merck and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00090285.).

### The effects of a brief educational intervention on human papillomavirus knowledge and intention to initiate HPV vaccination in 18–26 year old young adults [^3dcfe1c8]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

Despite the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for young adult females and males to receive the three-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, most recent findings show that only 30% of the U.S. females aged 19–26, 2.8% of males aged 19–21, and only 1.7% of males aged 22–26 are initiating vaccination. This study evaluates the effects of a brief (5–10 min) group HPV educational intervention on knowledge and intent to vaccinate among young adults.

Methods

A sample of 131 18–26 year old females and males was recruited from the 2012 INShape Black and Minority Health Fair in Indiana. We randomized participants into one of two groups: (1) survey completion prior to education (control group) or (2) survey completion following education (intervention group). Written surveys assessed HPV knowledge, vaccination history, and vaccination intent (for unvaccinated participants).

Results

Respondents were primarily female (70%), single (85%), and the majority self-identified as non-Hispanic Black (77%). Thirty-seven percent had initiated HPV vaccination (≥ 1 dose) and 19% had completed the series. The intervention group had higher HPV knowledge scores (M = 9.1; SD = 1.8) than the control group (M = 7.0; SD = 2.9; F = 22.53). Among unvaccinated individuals (n = 79), the intervention group had higher HPV vaccination intent (86%) compared to the control group (67%) (OR = 3.09; 95%CI = 1.02–9.36).

Conclusions

Despite ACIP recommendations, young adults continue to have low awareness of vaccine benefits and low vaccination rates. This study suggests that educational interventions to increase HPV awareness and vaccination may help to boost vaccination rates.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2036412c]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV) clinical efficacy — people with HIV: A randomized, double-blind trial in people with HIV who were older than 27 years did not show efficacy for prevention of new anal HPV infections or improvement in anal HSIL outcomes. Another RCT of 4vHPV involved 129 men who have sex with men on ART with a mean age of 38.8 years and history of AIDS; the vaccine and placebo arms did not differ by HSIL or genital wart incidence, but vaccine HPV types were less common in the vaccine arm, and secondary analyses found those with the longest time since immunization had significantly reduced risk of HSIL. A one-arm study of 260 MSM with HIV, aged 18 to 26 years, followed at 7, 12, and 24 months found that no participants naive at baseline for one or more 4vHPV types developed LSIL or HSIL related to those HPV. A Phase 3 4vHPV RCT in older males and females with HIV (aged ≥ 27 years) ended early due to an insufficient vaccine effect to meet stopping rules, but oral HPV infection decreased from 88% to 32% after 6 months. In a prospective observational cohort of female youth who received 4vHPV, abnormal cervical cytology occurred in 33 of 56 with perinatally acquired HIV and 1 of 7 exposed but uninfected, with incidence rates of 15 (10.9–29.6) and 2.9 (0.44–22.3), respectively.

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^4d90947c]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — coverage, disparities, and impact of provider recommendation: "Most female adolescents with commercial and Medicaid health plans are currently not receiving the recommended doses of HPV vaccine by 13 years of age", and although Medicaid coverage is higher, "the median of adolescent girls receiving 3 doses was only 19%". "According to the 2015 NIS–Teen, just over half (63%) of girls ages 13 through 17 years received ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and only 41.9% completed the series". Among boys of the same age, "49.8%" received " ≥ 1 dose", and "28.1%" completed the series. Disparities exist: compared with non‑Hispanic white adolescents or those at or above poverty, several groups "have a higher rate of initiation of the HPV vaccine series". Provider influence is substantial: "Health care provider recommendation and physician attitude play a major role", "A strong endorsement is more influential than a weak one", and "offering the HPV vaccine without strongly recommending it appears to confuse and frustrate parents", with the message that vaccination "is a critical strategy for cancer prevention".

### Sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines, 2021 [^783980ac]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^5c1109d8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 762 — immunizations in prepregnancy counseling advises that women of reproductive age should have their immunization status assessed annually for Tdap, measles–mumps–rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella, and that all patients should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Adult women who have never received a dose of Tdap or whose Tdap vaccination status is unknown should receive a single dose, and Tdap vaccine should be given to all women during each pregnancy between 27–36 weeks regardless of prepregnancy immunization history. Human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) and cervical cancer screening should be performed in accordance with current guidelines; HPV vaccination currently is not recommended during pregnancy but should not be avoided or delayed because a woman may want to become pregnant or may be actively trying to become pregnant, and if the HPV vaccine series is started and a patient then becomes pregnant, completion of the vaccine series should be delayed until that pregnancy is completed. Vaccinations for rubella and varicella should be given at least 28 days before pregnancy or in the postpartum period if not previously given; because two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended and the CDC recommends that women not become pregnant for 1 month after being vaccinated, a woman who desires pregnancy should begin vaccination 2 months before attempting pregnancy. Some advanced-reproductive-age patients may wish to reproduce, and those age 50 years and older should also be vaccinated against herpes zoster.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination and age at first sexual activity, national health and nutrition examination survey [^d92c4888]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects information on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination history as well as sexual activity. We evaluated data from NHANES to assess report of HPV vaccination with ≥ 1 dose and 3 doses among females and males aged 11 to 26 years during 2007–2014. We also examined age at first vaccine dose and age at first sexual activity among females aged 14 to 26 years. Vaccination significantly increased in females aged 13 to 26 years, but not among 11- to 12-year-old girls, and remained low for both females and males. In NHANES 2011–2014, among females with known age at first vaccine dose, 43.1% reported having had sex before or in the same year they received their first HPV vaccine, and this varied by race/ethnicity. Clinicians should provide strong recommendations consistent with guidelines, including routine vaccination of girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years.

### Efficacy, effectiveness and safety of vaccination against human papillomavirus in males: a systematic review [^07742f2d]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction

From the eligible studies, two independent reviewers (TH, MWP) used standardized forms to extract study characteristics and assess methodological quality. In case of disagreement, a final decision was made by consensus. The corresponding authors or principal investigators of three studies were contacted for additional data and information. The following data were extracted: study location, study design, study period, inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, age at enrolment, duration of follow-up, vaccine used, comparator, study sponsorship, conflict of interests, number (proportion) of vaccinated participants with outcome, number (proportion) of control participants with outcome, unadjusted estimates, adjusted estimates, confounders.

Assessment of risk of bias and quality of evidence

For randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, other bias. Studies were categorized as being at "high risk", "low risk" or "unclear risk" of bias. For non-randomized studies, the Risk Of Bias in Non-randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was used, comprising the following domains: bias due to confounding, bias in selection of participants into the study, bias in classification of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in measurement of outcomes, bias in selection of the reported results. Risk of bias was categorized as being "low risk", "moderate risk", "serious risk" or "critical risk".

The methodology of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) working group was used to assess the quality of the evidence.

Statistical analysis

Abstracted data were aggregated in tables. Risk ratios, odds ratios, risk differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were either calculated or extracted from the publications. Vaccine efficacy and vaccine effectiveness were either extracted from the publications or calculated as [1-(risk ratio or rate ratio comparing vaccine and control recipients)] × 100. Since only one study per outcome and study design was identified in this review, no meta-analyses were performed. According to the review protocol, analyses were performed in two subgroups: (1) all study participants, irrespective of HPV infection at enrolment, and (2) study participants who were seronegative and PCR-negative for the relevant HPV types at enrolment.

### Prevalence of human papillomavirus in young men who have sex with men after the implementation of gender-neutral HPV vaccination: a repeated cross-sectional study [^34989425]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Background

Anal infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes 16 and 18 and anal cancer are overrepresented in men who have sex with men (MSM). This study investigated HPV prevalence in young MSM before and after the implementation of a school-based quadrivalent HPV (genotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18) vaccination programme for boys in Australia in 2013.

Methods

In this repeated cross-sectional study, MSM aged 16–20 years were recruited from two successive birth cohorts via sexual health clinics and the community in Melbourne, Australia. The first cohort was before the implementation of gender-neutral vaccination (HYPER1 study, done in 2010–12, NCT01422356), and the second was the post-vaccination cohort (HYPER2 study, done in 2017–18, NCT03000933). Men who self-identified as being same-sex attracted were enrolled, and those recruited via the HYPER2 study had to be resident in Australia since 2013 to ensure eligibility. Study procedures were done in the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre. A clinician-collected anal swab and self-collected penile swab and oral rinse were tested for 28 HPV genotypes, and data on demographics and sexual health practices were collected via questionnaires. Only assessable samples were included in the analyses. We compared anatomical site-specific prevalence of HPV genotypes between cohorts by calculating the prevalence ratio, adjusting for age, circumcision, and sex with women. Herd protection was also assessed, by calculating the adjusted prevalence ratios by vaccination status.

Findings

400 MSM, 200 per cohort, were included in the study. In both cohorts, the median number of lifetime male partners was ten (IQR 5–25). The prevalence of any anal quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (54 [28%] of 193) than in the post-vaccination cohort (14 [7%] of 193; adjusted prevalence ratio [PR] 0·24, 95% CI 0·14–0·42), largely driven by decreases in HPV6, followed by HPV11, 16, and 18. Nevertheless, there was also a significant reduction in anal HPV16 and 18 in the post-vaccination cohort from the pre-vaccination cohort (0·31, 0·14–0·68). The prevalence of any penile quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was also higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (21 [12%] of 177) than in the post-vaccination cohort (11 [6%] of 179; 0·48, 0·24–0·97), driven by decreases in HPV 6 and 11, but not by 16 and 18. The prevalence of any oral quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype was higher in the pre-vaccination cohort (seven [4%] of 200) than in the post-vaccination cohort (one [1%] of 199; 0·10, 0·01–0·97); there were no cases of oral HPV6 or 11 detected in HYPER2. Comparing the pre-vaccinated cohort with the 149 confirmed vaccinated men from HYPER2 showed a reduction in any quadrivalent vaccine-preventable HPV genotype for anal (0·09, 0·03–0·25) and penile (0·18, 0·05–0·59) infection but not for oral infection (0·17, 0·03–1·08).

Interpretation

A reduction in anal, penile, and oral quadrivalent vaccine-targeted genotypes occurred in young MSM following the implementation of a school-based gender-neutral HPV vaccination programme. The fall in anal HPV16 and 18 may lead to a reduction in the incidence of anal cancer.
