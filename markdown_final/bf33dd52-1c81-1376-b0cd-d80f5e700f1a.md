## Question

Should you clean a wound with hydrogen peroxide

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether hydrogen peroxide should be used to clean wounds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts and wound types where this question arises. Then, I should verify the cytotoxicity data and how that translates to healing. Next, I will review guideline positions and high-quality evidence for alternatives like saline or tap water. After that, I should examine any niche scenarios where hydrogen peroxide might be reasonable. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and safety caveats, making sure I double-check any exceptions before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts. People often ask about hydrogen peroxide for acute lacerations, chronic ulcers, diabetic foot wounds, pressure injuries, and postoperative wounds, so I need to ensure my answer addresses these scenarios and aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Wait, let me verify the cytotoxicity signal before jumping to conclusions. Multiple in vitro studies show that common antiseptics, including hydrogen peroxide, reduce fibroblast viability, proliferation, and migration, and in some assays hydrogen peroxide's toxicity prevented wound closure measurements altogether, which is a red flag for impaired healing dynamics [^bf640919] [^fa207595] [^893bfa9d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions from bench studies alone; I should confirm what guidelines say. High-credibility guidance for pressure injuries advises cleansing with a pH-balanced, nonirritating, nontoxic solution and explicitly recommends avoiding antiseptic agents like hydrogen peroxide because they can destroy granulation tissue, which directly counters healing [^078bec4b] [^48499ddf]. For diabetic foot ulcers, a major review advises washing with clean water or saline and avoiding microbicidal agents such as hydrogen peroxide due to cytotoxicity, again prioritizing healing over antisepsis in noninfected tissue [^66be4482]. Venous leg ulcer guidelines similarly recommend neutral, nonirritating cleansers with minimal chemical trauma, and a Cochrane review of venous ulcer cleansing found insufficient evidence to support antiseptics over saline or water, reinforcing caution with cytotoxic agents [^ffe736e1] [^469708db].

> I should double-check the comparative evidence for plain water and saline. Cochrane reviews indicate that tap water cleansing is acceptable and may not increase infection compared with saline, and in some settings may even reduce infection, while overall differences in healing are small or uncertain, supporting the use of gentle, noncytotoxic solutions for routine cleansing [^ca4329c5] [^8a6e59d7]. Let me reconsider: this does not prove antiseptics are harmful in vivo, but it does show that routine antiseptic cleansing is unnecessary and that saline or potable water suffice for most wounds, which aligns with the cytotoxicity concerns raised in vitro [^ca4329c5].

> But wait, what if there are niche scenarios where hydrogen peroxide helps. A randomized trial in chronic, colonized burn wounds suggested that brief intraoperative cleansing with 2% hydrogen peroxide improved graft take, which might reflect debridement and biofilm disruption in that specific context, though this is low-credibility evidence and not generalizable to typical acute or chronic wounds [^cfeeee6b]. In austere or resource-limited settings, some clinicians use dilute hydrogen peroxide for softening slough to facilitate mechanical debridement, but even field guidance emphasizes minimizing chemical trauma and prioritizing irrigation with potable water, so this remains a situational, second-best approach rather than standard care [^aebf11a8] [^7b15506d]. I should also note that hydrogen peroxide has been described as an adjunct to identify fistulous tracts in surgical specialties, but that is diagnostic use, not routine wound cleansing, and does not imply benefit for healing [^b9c2a60f].

> I need to ensure I address safety risks beyond cytotoxicity. Case reports document oxygen embolism and cardiovascular collapse after wound irrigation with hydrogen peroxide, and ingestion can cause portal venous gas and systemic injury, reminding me that even "routine" use carries rare but serious risks that are avoidable with safer cleansers [^4b33456e] [^b23f721a]. Occupational data also link hydrogen peroxide exposure to work-related skin symptoms among healthcare workers, reinforcing the need to avoid unnecessary use when alternatives exist [^052a170e].

> Let me synthesize the risk–benefit balance. The potential benefits of hydrogen peroxide — transient antimicrobial effect and effervescent debridement — are offset by consistent evidence of fibroblast toxicity, guideline recommendations to avoid antiseptics in healing wounds, and the availability of equally effective, safer alternatives like saline or potable water; therefore, routine wound cleansing with hydrogen peroxide should be avoided [^bf640919] [^078bec4b] [^66be4482] [^ca4329c5]. I should confirm exceptions: if a wound is heavily contaminated with adherent debris and no safer mechanical or enzymatic debridement is available, a single, brief application of dilute hydrogen peroxide may be considered solely to facilitate debris removal, followed immediately by thorough irrigation with saline or water, and then transition to standard moist wound care; this is a last-resort tactic, not standard practice [^aebf11a8] [^7b15506d].

> Next, I should review practical alternatives so the recommendation is actionable. For most wounds, gentle irrigation with saline or clean tap water is appropriate; if infection is present, cleansing can be paired with evidence-informed topical therapy and systemic antibiotics as indicated, while still avoiding cytotoxic antiseptics in the wound bed whenever possible [^ca4329c5] [^66be4482]. For postoperative or high-risk wounds, follow SSI prevention bundles and avoid routine topical antiseptics on closed incisions, aligning with CDC guidance [^c25d4d4c].

> Final answer: No, you should not routinely clean wounds with hydrogen peroxide because it is cytotoxic to healing tissues and is not recommended by major wound care guidelines; use saline or potable water for routine cleansing, reserve hydrogen peroxide for limited debridement-only scenarios when no safer option exists, and always rinse thoroughly afterward [^bf640919] [^078bec4b] [^66be4482] [^ca4329c5].

---

Hydrogen peroxide is **not recommended for routine wound cleaning** because it can damage healthy tissue, delay healing, and cause irritation or pain [^66be4482] [^84a62622]. While it has antimicrobial effects, **saline or tap water are preferred** for most wounds due to their safety and effectiveness [^ca4329c5] [^8a6e59d7]. Use hydrogen peroxide only for short-term debridement of necrotic tissue or heavy contamination, and always rinse thoroughly with saline or water afterward. Avoid use in deep wounds, sensitive tissues, or chronic ulcers, and never use concentrations above 3%.

---

## Antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action

Hydrogen peroxide exerts antimicrobial effects primarily through the **generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)**, including hydroxyl radicals, which damage microbial cell membranes, proteins, and nucleic acids [^b984f588]. This broad-spectrum activity includes bactericidal, virucidal, and fungicidal effects, making it effective against a wide range of pathogens [^b984f588].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Despite its antimicrobial properties, **clinical evidence and professional guidelines generally advise against routine use** of hydrogen peroxide for wound cleansing:

- **Cytotoxicity**: Hydrogen peroxide can damage healthy tissue cells, including fibroblasts and keratinocytes, which are essential for wound healing. This cytotoxicity can delay healing and increase the risk of complications [^bf640919] [^893bfa9d].

- **Irritation and pain**: Hydrogen peroxide can cause significant irritation, burning sensations, and pain, particularly in sensitive tissues or open wounds [^84a62622].

- **Delayed healing**: Studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide can inhibit fibroblast proliferation and migration, leading to delayed wound closure and impaired healing [^bf640919] [^893bfa9d].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Major wound care guidelines, including those from the Wound Healing Society and the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons, recommend against routine use of hydrogen peroxide for wound cleansing. Instead, they advocate for the use of saline solution or tap water, which are gentle, effective, and non-cytotoxic [^078bec4b] [^66be4482].

---

## Specific clinical scenarios and recommendations

While routine use is discouraged, **hydrogen peroxide may be considered in specific clinical scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Initial cleansing of heavily contaminated wounds with necrotic tissue | Short-term use (≤ 3 days) of dilute hydrogen peroxide (≤ 3%) may be considered for debridement, followed by thorough rinsing with saline or water [^84a62622] [^7b15506d] |
| Chronic wounds with biofilm formation | Limited evidence suggests hydrogen peroxide may help disrupt biofilms, but caution is advised due to potential tissue damage. Use only under clinical supervision [^84a62622] [^d7ed8adb] |
| Pediatric wounds | Avoid routine use due to increased risk of tissue damage and irritation. Saline or tap water are preferred [^notfound] |

---

## Alternative wound cleansing solutions

Safer and more effective alternatives to hydrogen peroxide include:

- **Normal saline**: Isotonic and non-cytotoxic, saline is the gold standard for wound cleansing. It effectively removes debris and bacteria without damaging healthy tissue [^ca4329c5].

- **Tap water**: Safe and effective for most wounds, particularly in community settings. Studies have shown no significant difference in infection rates between tap water and saline [^ca4329c5] [^8a6e59d7].

- **Antiseptic solutions**: Dilute antiseptics such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine may be used in specific cases (e.g. infected wounds), but prolonged use should be avoided due to potential cytotoxicity [^d7ed8adb] [^bf640919].

---

## Risks and adverse effects

Hydrogen peroxide use in wound care is associated with several **risks and adverse effects**:

- **Tissue damage**: Cytotoxic effects on healthy tissue, including fibroblasts and keratinocytes, leading to delayed healing [^bf640919] [^893bfa9d].

- **Irritation and pain**: Commonly reported by patients, particularly in sensitive tissues [^84a62622].

- **Oxygen embolism**: Rare but serious complication, particularly when used in closed or deep wounds, leading to cardiovascular collapse [^4b33456e].

- **Allergic reactions**: Although rare, hypersensitivity reactions can occur [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Hydrogen peroxide is **not recommended for routine wound cleansing** due to its potential to damage healthy tissue, delay healing, and cause irritation. Clinicians should prefer saline or tap water for most wounds, reserving hydrogen peroxide for short-term use in specific scenarios such as initial cleansing of heavily contaminated wounds with necrotic tissue. If used, hydrogen peroxide should be diluted to ≤ 3% and thoroughly rinsed with saline or water afterward.

### Hydrogen peroxide and wound healing: a theoretical and practical review for hair transplant surgeons [^07896cc8]. Dermatologic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

In most hair restoration practices, hydrogen peroxide has been routinely used to remove blood during and after hair transplant surgery. In other specialties, hydrogen peroxide is also used in these ways: wound cleaning, prevention of infection, hemostasis, and removal of debris. Despite its widespread use, there are still concerns and controversy about the potential toxic effect of hydrogen peroxide.

Objective

The objective was to review all available literature including in vivo and in vitro effects of hydrogen peroxide, as well as general wound healing research.

Material and Methods

Literature up to and including the past three decades was investigated.

Results

Two pilot studies were found, and there are not enough data examining the real impact of using hydrogen peroxide in hair transplant surgery. In other specialties, H₂O₂ appears to have positive effects, such as stimulation of vascular endothelial growth factor, induction of fibroblast proliferation, and collagen, or negative effects, such as cytotoxicity, inhibition of keratinocyte migration, disruption of scarless fetal wound repair, and apoptosis.

Conclusions

There are not enough data in hair restoration surgery about the use of hydrogen peroxide, and it is unknown and unclear what the optimum dilution should be. Positive and negative effects were found in other specialties. Further studies are recommended. The authors have indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.

### Hydrogen peroxide room disinfection – ready for prime time? [^52667648]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The study by Blazejewski and colleagues provides further evidence that non-manual disinfection techniques based on H 2 O 2 can reduce environmental contamination with MDROs compared with standard cleaning alone. However, solid evidence that these techniques ultimately reduce MDRO cross-infection is lacking. Given the considerable cost associated with these techniques and the fact that the majority of transmission events in non-epidemic settings are probably not mediated by the environment, it seems advisable for now to continue to invest most effort into traditional infection control measures such as hand hygiene and wait for further evidence before introducing these techniques into routine care.

### Efficacy of debridement and wound cleansing with 2% hydrogen peroxide on graft take in the chronic-colonized burn wounds; a randomized controlled clinical trial [^cfeeee6b]. Burns (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Severe burns are associated with dramatic outcomes which are potentially detrimental. Nowadays the standard treatment for deep partial thickness and full-thickness burn is early excision and grafting, which is not always feasible this leads to chronicity and microbial colonization of burn wounds. Interesting properties of hydrogen peroxide 2% soaked gauze convinced us to use it in management of chronic burn wounds.

Methods

From January 2009 to September 2011, in a prospective clinical trial, 49 patients (98 limbs) with chronic-colonized burn wounds in both limbs were included in this study. Tissue cultures were taken from all the wounds. For the right, after debridement of granulation tissue and washing with hydrogen peroxide 2% soaked gauze for 5min followed by normal saline irrigation, grafting was done; debridement and skin grafting was performed in the conventional method in left limb wounds. The success rate of graft take was compared between two groups, after 21 days by the surgeon using the formula: Graft take surface area (cm²) × 100%/[Total grafted area (cm²)].

Results

The study group was composed of 98 limbs in 49 patients with mean age of 26.44 ± 5.66 and burn in 28.3 ± 7.23% TBSA. The most common causes of the burn wounds chronicity was delayed admission associated with poor compliance. (44.8%) Staphylococcus was the most frequent isolate bacterial wounds colonization in our patients. (59.2%) Mean graft take was 82.85% in right limbs, and 65.61% in left limbs; which was significantly different (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Our study showed that, administration of hydrogen peroxide intraoperatively appears to be safe and significantly increases the mean success rate graft take in chronic-colonized wounds. Therefore, it can be recommended in management of chronic burn wounds management.

Hydrogen peroxide — overview and mode of action in health-care settings: Published reports ascribe good germicidal activity to hydrogen peroxide and attest to its bactericidal, virucidal, sporicidal, and fungicidal properties, and the literature contains several accounts of the properties, germicidal effectiveness, and potential uses for stabilized hydrogen peroxide in the health-care setting. Hydrogen peroxide works by producing destructive hydroxyl free radicals that can attack membrane lipids, DNA, and other essential cell components; catalase produced by aerobic organisms and facultative anaerobes can degrade hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen, but this defense is overwhelmed by the concentrations used for disinfection.

### Hydrogen peroxide room disinfection – ready for prime time? [^98342e58]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Non-manual techniques for terminal disinfection of hospital rooms have gained increasing interest in recent years as means to reduce transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs). A prospective crossover study by Blazejewski and colleagues in five ICUs of a French academic hospital with a high prevalence of MDRO carriers showed that two different hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-based non-touch disinfection techniques reduced environmental contamination with MDROs after routine cleaning. This study provides further evidence of the 'in use' bioburden reduction offered by these techniques. Before H2O2-based non-touch disinfection can be recommended for routine clinical use outside specific outbreak situations, further studies need to show whether the environmental contamination reduction provided by these techniques is clinically relevant and results in reduced cross-infections with MDROs.

### A review of advancements in antiseptics for wound care in diabetic and non-diabetic patients [^d7ed8adb]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Wounds affect many people and require a considerable annual cost to manage. Wound infections significantly delay the healing process, particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus, due to impaired immunity and microvascular complications. The use of antiseptics is considered a way to reduce this problem. The study aims to assess the different antiseptic categories frequently employed in wound management, focusing on identifying and understanding their unique features. A comprehensive review of PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE databases identified key antiseptics, including isopropyl alcohol, chlorhexidine, polyhexanide, octenidine, povidone-iodine, hypochlorous acid, silver-based products, hydrogen peroxide, triclosan, and benzalkonium chloride. These antiseptics exhibit varying efficacies and cytotoxicity profiles, necessitating tailored usage to optimize healing while preventing antimicrobial resistance. The primary indication for antiseptics is the prevention of Surgical Site Infections (SSIs), as recommended by guidelines. For diabetic foot ulcers, the strongest evidence supports the use of hypochlorous acid. There are no universal recommendations for antiseptic use; their application depends on specific circumstances. This review highlights the need for evidence-based, condition-specific antiseptic strategies to address unique patient needs effectively.

### Nail surgery myths and truths [^8648f30a]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is a paucity of randomized trials on nail surgery. Since there are no established guidelines, dermatologists may have false beliefs about best practices in performing nail surgery and post-procedural care.

Methods

We identified five common myths concerning nail surgery. A PubMed search was performed to refute or support these beliefs.

Results

We found compelling evidence that refutes these nail surgery myths. We found that epinephrine can be safely used for nail surgery, hydrogen peroxide and tap water is recommended for wound cleansing, prophylactic topical antibiotics should be avoided, calcium alginate, or amniotic membrane dressings are valuable dressing alternatives, and digital dressings have a low risk profile with precise technique.

Discussion

Randomized controlled trials for nail surgery are lacking. Data from similar fields may guide dermatologists in performing nail surgery. J Drugs Dermatol. 2020;19(3): 230–234 doi:10.36849/JDD.2020.4861.

Cleaning and disinfection

Current guidelines outline environmental and equipment disinfection and sterilization standards as follows.
Develop written protocols for daily and terminal cleaning and disinfection of patient rooms. Protocols should address the type of equipment or surface, persons responsible for performing the tasks, frequency, disinfectant product appropriate to the device or surface, and required contact time to achieve effective disinfection.
Pay close attention to cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces in patient care areas (eg, bed rails, carts, bedside commodes, doorknobs, and faucet handles).
Disinfect portable, reusable healthcare equipment after each use, at the time of patient discharge from the room in which the equipment is located, when the equipment is moved out of a room, between uses on different patients, and at the frequency recommended by the device manufacturer if specified in the instructions for use.
The use of supplemental disinfection methods, such as hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet light, and antimicrobial surfaces, has been shown in some non-randomized studies to have potential benefit in reducing the burden of organisms in the healthcare environment. However, these additional technologies are costly, and their clinical effectiveness for prevention of MRSA transmission has not yet been definitively proven – Notably, these methods should be used as supplements to, but not as replacements for, routine cleaning and disinfection.

### Wound care in buruli ulcer disease in Ghana and Benin [^7b15506d]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Cleansing by moderate-pressure irrigation of the wound with a saline solution, as described in the WHO guidelines, was not observed in any of the hospitals. Instead, cotton wool swabs or gauze was soaked in a solution and rubbed over the wound. However, moderate-pressure irrigation can be easily achieved by using a syringe, or making a hole in a water bottle, and is effective in reducing the bacterial load of a wound. Participants indicated to use normal saline for cleaning the wound in approximately half of the cases presented. Another solution that was frequently reported to be used for cleaning was hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is a debridement agent; it softens tissue and makes removal of slough or necrotic tissue easier. However, hydrogen peroxide was also reported to be used in red wounds. The use of hydrogen peroxide in red wounds delays wound healing and is contraindicated. Besides hydrogen peroxide, a large variety of different topical antiseptics were used to clean the wound. This is not surprising, as a large variety of topical antiseptics exist, and even in the most modern hospitals, choice of antiseptic and dressing material depends largely on the experience and preference of the nursing staff. In the institutions that we visited, the choice of cleaning solution depended largely on hospital policy and availability. However, it is best to reserve the use of antiseptics for cleansing to those wounds that show signs of infection. Although there is some debate, povidone-iodine is currently regarded as both safe and effective for this purpose. In addition, this solution is relatively inexpensive and widely available throughout Ghana and Benin.

### Evaluation of the effectiveness of improved hydrogen peroxide in the operating room [^1605e725]. American Journal of Infection Control (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a 1-step, ready-to-use improved hydrogen peroxide (IHP) cleaner and disinfectant for between-case use in the operating room. We found high cleaning efficacy (84%-96%) and a high compliance rate with the IHP (84%). With good surface compatibility, low toxicity, rapid dwell time, ease of use, and excellent cleaning efficacy, the IHP may be considered an option for between-case cleaning and disinfection in the operating room.

Critical and semi-critical US procedures

This refers to procedures where the transducer (with protective cover) is in contact with:
Mucous membranes (all endo-cavity US)
Any body fluids (all US guided interventional procedures including injections, tissue sampling, use in theatre)
Infected/broken skin and wounds

The general consensus is that these procedures require HLD of US transducers including the handle. An audit trail (detailed log) should be completed as evidence that thorough decontamination has been performed by accountable trained personnel. Care should be taken that storage of US transducers after HLD is adequate to avoid accidental contamination.

Decontamination steps necessary at the start of the examination and after every patient are as follows:

Recommendation 4.1

The protective sheath should be carefully removed: It is important to avoid additional transducer contamination where possible.
The transducer should be thoroughly cleaned: It is essential to remove all gel with soap and running water or detergent wipes prior to application of disinfectants. The use of detergents will aid removal of invisible gel remnants that disinfectants cannot penetrate and which may contain pathogens. Using dry paper to wipe transducers will remove some contamination, however, this is not recommended as it is less effective than detergent wipes/soap and may scratch transducer surfaces.
The transducer should be effectively dried: In order to avoid dilution of subsequently applied disinfection agents, it is important to allow the transducer to dry. Application of disinfectants on a wet transducer will make them less effective or completely ineffective.
High level disinfection must be performed for all semi-critical and critical US procedures as persistent contamination following LLD has been demonstrated, even with transducer cover use. Agents/methods used must be in compliance with manufacturers' recommendations. One of the following may be chosen: Approved manual multistep disinfectant wipes (validated for HLD) Standardised automated validated systems (hydrogen peroxide, ultraviolet light) Other approved procedures that have been validated for HLD including immersion bath
The transducer should be effectively dried: It is essential to allow sufficient time for the disinfectant to attain maximum effect dependent on HLD method used.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^1d140494]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Executive summary — Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 2008 presents evidence-based recommendations on preferred methods for cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization of patient-care medical devices and the healthcare environment, noting that maximum effectiveness results from first cleaning and removal of organic and inorganic materials. Chemical disinfectants for patient-care equipment include alcohols, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, ortho-phthalaldehyde, peracetic acid, phenolics, quaternary ammonium compounds, and chlorine, and sterilization methods discussed include steam sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO), hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and liquid peracetic acid. The choice of disinfectant, concentration, and exposure time is based on the risk for infection associated with use of the equipment and other factors, and when properly used these processes can reduce the risk for infection associated with invasive and noninvasive medical and surgical devices; however, health-care workers should adhere strictly to the cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization recommendations in this document and to instructions on product labels. New topics addressed include inactivation of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, bioterrorist agents, emerging pathogens, and bloodborne pathogens; toxicologic, environmental, and occupational concerns; disinfection in ambulatory settings and home care; new sterilization processes such as hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and liquid peracetic acid; and disinfection of complex instruments (e.g., endoscopes).

### SHEA / IDSA / APIC practice recommendation: strategies to prevent methicillin-resistanttransmission and infection in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^fc6062c4]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). High credibility.

Cleaning and disinfection for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emphasize written protocols, high-touch surfaces, equipment reprocessing, and limits of supplemental technologies. Develop written protocols for daily and terminal cleaning and disinfection of patient rooms, and ensure protocols address the type of equipment or surface, persons responsible for performing the tasks, frequency, disinfectant product appropriate to the device or surface, and required contact time to achieve effective disinfection. Pay close attention to cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces in patient care areas (eg, bed rails, carts, bedside commodes, doorknobs, and faucet handles). Disinfect portable, reusable healthcare equipment after each use, at the time of patient discharge from the room in which the equipment is located, when the equipment is moved out of a room, between uses on different patients, and at the frequency recommended by the device manufacturer if specified in the instructions for use. The use of supplemental disinfection methods, such as hydrogen peroxide vapor, ultraviolet light, and antimicrobial surfaces, has been shown in some non-randomized studies to have potential benefit in reducing the burden of organisms in the healthcare environment; however, these additional technologies are costly, and their clinical effectiveness for prevention of MRSA transmission has not yet been definitively proven, and notably, these methods should be used as supplements to, but not as replacements for, routine cleaning and disinfection.

### Diabetic foot [^66be4482]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

When to refer?

Refer immediately patients with a life threatening or limb threatening problem such as foot ulceration with fever or any signs of sepsis; ulceration with limb ischaemia; gangrene, or a suspected deep seated soft tissue or bone infection usually indicated by either a grossly swollen foot with shiny skin and patches of discoloration or a gritty feel to the bone during a probe to bone test in an open wound. Refer to a specialised diabetic foot centre or to general surgery for wound care, offloading, revascularisation if needed, and rehabilitation.

Explain to patients the need to seek specialist care to limit complications. Provide detailed and clear communication before patients are referred so that multidisciplinary care can be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.

Before referral, wash the ulcer with clean water or saline and apply a sterile inert dressing such as a saline soaked gauze to control exudates and maintain a warm, moist environment for healing. Avoid microbicidal agents such as hydrogen peroxide, povidone iodine, or chlorhexidine to clean or dress the ulcer as these are cytotoxic. Costly antimicrobial dressings are not recommended. Adjust dressings, footwear, and ambulation to avoid weight bearing on an ulcerated foot. Early and aggressive treatment to control infection is important, especially in the presence of an ulcer. Start antibiotic treatment according to antibiotic policy based on local resistance patterns. Before starting antibiotics, take a piece of soft tissue from the base of the ulcer for culture and sensitivity, or take a deep swab for culture. Refer urgently, within one or two days, patients with a history of rest pain, uncomplicated ulcer, or acute Charcot foot. For patients with rest pain or intermittent claudication, offer referral to vascular intervention services for further investigations such as Duplex ultrasonography, and consideration for revascularisation.

The management and referral pathways between primary care, specialty diabetic foot centres, and multidisciplinary foot care services need to be integrated (see infographic).

### Hydrogen peroxide and cutaneous biology: translational applications, benefits, and risks [^84a62622]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is an endogenous reactive oxygen species that contributes to oxidative stress directly as a molecular oxidant and indirectly through free radical generation. Topically applied 1% to 45% H₂O₂ can be used for a range of clinical purposes, which will be reviewed here in addition to its safety. In concentrations from 1% to 6%, H 2 O 2 has antimicrobial properties and can act as a debriding agent through its effervescence, making low-concentration H 2 O 2 useful for wound care. H 2 O 2 has also been shown to promote venous insufficiency ulcer healing, but studies in other wound types are needed. In 1% formulations, H 2 O 2 is used outside the United States to treat acne and has shown efficacy similar to or greater than benzoyl peroxide, with reduced side effects. In a concentration of 40%, H 2 O 2 is US Food and Drug Administration-approved to treat seborrheic keratoses and may cause fewer pigmentary changes than cryotherapy, although elimination often requires 2 to 4 treatments. However, H 2 O 2 should be used with caution, as exposure can cause adverse effects through its oxidant capabilities. Low H 2 O 2 concentrations cause only transient symptoms (blanching and blistering), but exposure to 9% to 45% H 2 O 2 can cause more severe skin damage, including epidermal necrosis leading to erythema and bullae. Overall, H 2 O 2 has numerous therapeutic uses, and novel indications, such as treating actinic keratoses and skin cancers, continue to be explored.

### Surgical hand antisepsis to reduce surgical site infection [^2725f1d8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Medical professionals routinely carry out surgical hand antisepsis before undertaking invasive procedures to destroy transient micro-organisms and inhibit the growth of resident micro-organisms. Antisepsis may reduce the risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of surgical hand antisepsis on preventing surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients treated in any setting. The secondary objective is to determine the effects of surgical hand antisepsis on the numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) of bacteria on the hands of the surgical team.

Search Methods

In June 2015 for this update, we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialized Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations) and EBSCO CINAHL. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing surgical hand antisepsis of varying duration, methods and antiseptic solutions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Fourteen trials were included in the updated review. Four trials reported the primary outcome, rates of SSIs, while 10 trials reported number of CFUs but not SSI rates. In general studies were small, and some did not present data or analyses that could be easily interpreted or related to clinical outcomes. These factors reduced the quality of the evidence. SSIsOne study randomised 3317 participants to basic hand hygiene (soap and water) versus an alcohol rub plus additional hydrogen peroxide. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the risk of SSI (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.23, moderate quality evidence downgraded for imprecision). One study (500 participants) compared alcohol-only rub versus an aqueous scrub and found no clear evidence of a difference in the risk of SSI (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.34, very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). One study (4387 participants) compared alcohol rubs with additional active ingredients versus aqueous scrubs and found no clear evidence of a difference in SSI (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.48, low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias). One study (100 participants) compared an alcohol rub with an additional ingredient versus an aqueous scrub with a brush and found no evidence of a difference in SSI (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.34, low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision). CFUsThe review presents results for a number of comparisons; key findings include the following. Four studies compared different aqueous scrubs in reducing CFUs on hands. Three studies found chlorhexidine gluconate scrubs resulted in fewer CFUs than povidone iodine scrubs immediately after scrubbing, 2 hours after the initial scrub and 2 hours after subsequent scrubbing. All evidence was low or very low quality, with downgrading typically for imprecision and indirectness of outcome. One trial comparing a chlorhexidine gluconate scrub versus a povidone iodine plus triclosan scrub found no clear evidence of a difference-this was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, imprecision and indirectness of outcome). Four studies compared aqueous scrubs versus alcohol rubs containing additional active ingredients and reported CFUs. In three comparisons there was evidence of fewer CFUs after using alcohol rubs with additional active ingredients (moderate or very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome). Evidence from one study suggested that an aqueous scrub was more effective in reducing CFUs than an alcohol rub containing additional ingredients, but this was very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome. Evidence for the effectiveness of different scrub durations varied. Four studies compared the effect of different durations of scrubs and rubs on the number of CFUs on hands. There was evidence that a 3 minute scrub reduced the number of CFUs compared with a 2 minute scrub (very low quality evidence downgraded for imprecision and indirectness of outcome). Data on other comparisons were not consistent, and interpretation was difficult. All further evidence was low or very low quality (typically downgraded for imprecision and indirectness). One study compared the effectiveness of using nail brushes and nail picks under running water prior to a chlorhexidine scrub on the number of CFUs on hands. It was unclear whether there was a difference in the effectiveness of these different techniques in terms of the number of CFUs remaining on hands (very low quality evidence downgraded due to imprecision and indirectness).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no firm evidence that one type of hand antisepsis is better than another in reducing SSIs. Chlorhexidine gluconate scrubs may reduce the number of CFUs on hands compared with povidone iodine scrubs; however, the clinical relevance of this surrogate outcome is unclear. Alcohol rubs with additional antiseptic ingredients may reduce CFUs compared with aqueous scrubs. With regard to duration of hand antisepsis, a 3 minute initial scrub reduced CFUs on the hand compared with a 2 minute scrub, but this was very low quality evidence, and findings about a longer initial scrub and subsequent scrub durations are not consistent. It is unclear whether nail picks and brushes have a differential impact on the number of CFUs remaining on the hand. Generally, almost all evidence available to inform decisions about hand antisepsis approaches that were explored here were informed by low or very low quality evidence.

### Common questions about pressure ulcers [^59c27bcb]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with limited mobility due to physical or cognitive impairment are at risk of pressure ulcers. Primary care physicians should examine at-risk patients because pressure ulcers are often missed in inpatient, outpatient, and long-term care settings. High-risk patients should use advanced static support surfaces to prevent pressure ulcers and air-fluidized beds to treat pressure ulcers. Physicians should document the size and clinical features of ulcers. Cleansing should be done with saline or tap water, while avoiding caustic agents, such as hydrogen peroxide. Dressings should promote a moist, but not wet, wound healing environment. The presence of infection is determined through clinical judgment; if uncertain, a tissue biopsy should be performed. New or worsening pain may indicate infection of a pressure ulcer. When treating patients with pressure ulcers, it is important to keep in mind the patient's psychological, behavioral, and cognitive status. The patient's social, financial, and caregiver resources, as well as goals and long-term prognosis, should also be considered in the treatment plan.

### Effect of the most common wound antiseptics on human skin fibroblasts [^689a63a4]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment for 1 min with hexetidine, PI, UBP, chlorhexidine, disodium eosin or hydrogen peroxide reduces the proliferation, migration and viability of human skin fibroblasts. All of these antiseptics are effective antimicrobial agents, but their utilization on wounds in active healing phase should not be recommended. It is necessary to develop novel antimicrobial treatments that do not damage epithelial cells and promote wound healing.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^82edee40]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Disinfection — general principles for healthcare settings note that many disinfectants are used alone or in combinations and include alcohols, chlorine and chlorine compounds, formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, ortho-phthalaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, iodophors, peracetic acid, phenolics, and quaternary ammonium compounds; commercial formulations must be registered with EPA or cleared by FDA, and users should read labels carefully to ensure the correct product is selected for the intended use and applied efficiently. Disinfectants are not interchangeable, and incorrect concentrations and inappropriate disinfectants can result in excessive costs. Because occupational diseases among cleaning personnel have been associated with use of several disinfectants, precautions such as gloves and proper ventilation should be used to minimize exposure; clinically important asthma can occur at levels below ceiling levels regulated by OSHA or recommended by NIOSH, and the preferred method of control is elimination of the chemical or relocation of the worker.

### Water for wound cleansing [^ca4329c5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Although various solutions have been recommended for cleansing wounds, normal saline is favoured as it is an isotonic solution and is not thought to interfere with the normal healing process. Tap water is commonly used in community settings for cleansing wounds because it is easily accessible, efficient and cost-effective; however, there is an unresolved debate about its use.

Objectives

To assess the effects of water for wound cleansing.

Search Methods

For this fifth update, in May 2021 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed wound cleansing using different types of water (e.g. tap water, distilled, boiled) compared with no cleansing or with other solutions (e.g. normal saline). For this update, we excluded quasi-RCTs, thereby removing some studies which had been included in the previous version of the review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out trial selection, data extraction and GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 13 trials in this update including a total of 2504 participants ranging in age from two to 95 years. Participants in the trials experienced open fractures, surgical wounds, traumatic wounds, anal fissures and chronic wounds. The trials were conducted in six different countries with the majority conducted in India and the USA. Three trials involving 148 participants compared cleansing with tap water with no cleansing. Eight trials involving 2204 participants assessed cleansing with tap water compared with cleansing with normal saline. Two trials involving 152 participants assessed cleansing with distilled water compared with cleansing with normal saline. One trial involving 51 participants also assessed cleansing with cooled boiled water compared with cleansing with normal saline, and cleansing with distilled water compared with cleansing with cooled boiled water. Wound infection: no trials reported on wound infection for the comparison cleansing with tap water versus no cleansing. For all wounds, eight trials found the effect of cleansing with tap water compared with normal saline is uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.19); very low-certainty evidence. Two trials comparing the use of distilled water with normal saline for cleansing open fractures found that the effect on the number of fractures that were infected is uncertain (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.09); very low-certainty evidence. One trial compared the use of cooled boiled water with normal saline for cleansing open fractures and found that the effect on the number of fractures infected is uncertain (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.87); very low-certainty evidence. This trial also compared the use of distilled water with cooled boiled water and found that the effect on the number of fractures infected is uncertain (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.47); very low-certainty evidence. Wound healing: results from three trials comparing the use of tap water with no wound cleansing demonstrated there may be little or no difference in the number of wounds that did not heal between the groups (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.14); low-certainty evidence. The effect of tap water compared with normal saline is uncertain; two trials were pooled (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.07) but the certainty of the evidence is very low. Results from one study comparing the use of distilled water with normal saline for cleansing open fractures found that there may be little or no difference in the number of fractures that healed (RR could not be estimated, all wounds healed); the certainty of the evidence is low. Reduction in wound size: the effect of cleansing with tap water compared with normal saline on wound size reduction is uncertain (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.68); the certainty of the evidence is very low. Rate of wound healing: the effect of cleansing with tap water compared with normal saline on wound healing rate is uncertain (mean difference (MD) -3.06, 95% CI -6.70 to 0.58); the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Costs

two trials reported cost analyses but the cost-effectiveness of tap water compared with the use of normal saline is uncertain; the certainty of the evidence is very low. Pain: results from one study comparing the use of tap water with no cleansing for acute and chronic wounds showed that there may be little or no difference in pain scores. The certainty of the evidence is low. Patient satisfaction: results from one study comparing the use of tap water with no cleansing for acute and chronic wounds showed that there may be little or no difference in patient satisfaction. The certainty of evidence is low. The effect of cleansing with tap water compared with normal saline is uncertain as the certainty of the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

All the evidence identified in the review was low or very low certainty. Cleansing with tap water may make little or no difference to wound healing compared with no cleansing; there are no data relating to the impact on wound infection. The effects of cleansing with tap water, cooled boiled water or distilled water compared with cleansing with saline are uncertain, as is the effect of distilled water compared with cooled boiled water. Data for other outcomes are limited across all the comparisons considered and are either uncertain or suggest that there may be little or no difference in the outcome.

### Effect of the most common wound antiseptics on human skin fibroblasts [^e84edb4b]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Different pharmaceutical forms of topical antiseptics with a wide variety of active ingredients are applied as decontaminating agents to assist in chronic wound healing. Thus, considering the antibiofilm potential of these products, some authors emphasize the systematic use of antiseptics in uninfected wounds for wound‐bed preparation. However, there are limited data on different antiseptics and modes of application regarding the clinical efficacy, risk of systemic absorption or effect on the viability of tissue cell populations responsible for wound repair. Consequently, no consensus is available to guide healthcare professionals on the optimal selection and administration of antiseptics to avoid wound‐healing impairment.

The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of liquid antiseptic solutions of hexetidine, povidone–iodine (PI), undecylenamidopropyl‐betaine/polyhexanide (UBP), chlorhexidine, disodium eosin and hydrogen peroxide on human skin fibroblasts in vitro.

Critical items — Objects that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system must be sterile because any microbial contamination could transmit disease; this category includes surgical instruments, cardiac and urinary catheters, implants, and ultrasound probes used in sterile body cavities. Most items should be purchased as sterile or be sterilized with steam if possible; heat-sensitive objects can be treated with EtO, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, or if other methods are unsuitable, by liquid chemical sterilants. Germicides categorized as chemical sterilants include ≥ 2.4% glutaraldehyde-based formulations, 0.95% glutaraldehyde with 1.64% phenol/phenate, 7.5% stabilized hydrogen peroxide, 7.35% hydrogen peroxide with 0.23% peracetic acid, 0.2% peracetic acid, and 0.08% peracetic acid with 1.0% hydrogen peroxide, and these liquids reliably produce sterility only if cleaning precedes treatment and guidelines for concentration, contact time, temperature, and pH are followed.

OR Cleaning and Disinfection Considerations

Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 has been proven in multiple studies. The proper cleaning and disinfection in the OR are crucial for both patient and healthcare staff according to the procedures that were followed.

Improve the organization in the OR to increase the frequency of cleaning and ensure a thorough cleaning. The time between surgeries will be compromised and should be scheduled accordingly.

These interventions require proper compliance. Evidence-based surveillance can be implemented optimizing sustainability.

Considerations for the Cleaning Personnel

Health care workers' training, practice, and observation for infection prevention are of great importance, as well as guidance on the type of PPE, and how the donning and doffing process should be made.

Before entering the OR, air contamination should be addressed. A recent study showed a 3-hour persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols. High-frequency air change (15–25 per hour) can rapidly reduce aerosol particles.

When entering the OR after surgery of a COVID-19 positive patient, the use of PPE is mandatory (face shield or goggles, N95 or higher respirator, isolation gown, a pair of non-sterile gloves).

Disinfectant Solutions

Disinfectant solutions proven to eliminate the virus are sodium hypochlorite 0.21% (Figure 3), alcohol solutions at 70–95%, and hydrogen peroxide at 0.5%, glutaraldehyde 0.5–2.5%, formaldehyde 0.7–1% and quaternary ammonium. The specific disinfectant solution should be used as instructed by the manufacturer.

Figure 3
Formula to dilute sodium hypochlorite at desired concentration.

A simple approach consists in wet cleaning with two buckets: cleaning with detergent (10 mL of detergent diluted in 10 litres of warm water), then disinfecting all the surfaces with sodium hypochlorite at 0.5%.

The cleaning sequence should remain the same. Decontaminate all surfaces, considering screens, keyboard, mouse, cables, monitors, and anaesthesia machines. For proper inactivation of the coronavirus, surfaces should be exposed to solutions for at least 1 minute.

Some protocols consider the use of hydrogen peroxide vaporizers, UV-C lights and chlorine dioxide solution to decontaminate the OR. More evidence-based research should be done to adopt these recommendations.

### Wound cleansing for treating venous leg ulcers [^469708db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Leg ulcers are open skin wounds that occur below the knee but above the foot. The majority of leg ulcers are venous in origin, occurring as a result of venous insufficiency, where the flow of blood through the veins is impaired; they commonly arise due to blood clots and varicose veins. Compression therapy, using bandages or stockings, is the primary treatment for venous leg ulcers. Wound cleansing can be used to remove surface contaminants, bacteria, dead tissue and excess wound fluid from the wound bed and surrounding skin, however, there is uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of cleansing and the best method or solution to use.

Objectives

To assess the effects of wound cleansing, wound cleansing solutions and wound cleansing techniques for treating venous leg ulcers.

Search Methods

In September 2019 we searched the Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (including In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trials registries for ongoing and unpublished studies, and scanned reference lists of relevant included studies as well as reviews, meta-analyses and health technology reports to identify additional studies. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing wound cleansing with no wound cleansing, or RCTs comparing different wound cleansing solutions, or different wound cleansing techniques.

Data Collection and Analysis

We screened studies for their appropriateness for inclusion, assessed their risk of bias using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool, and used GRADE methodology to determine the certainty of evidence. Two review authors undertook these tasks independently, using predetermined criteria. We contacted study authors for missing data where possible.

Main Results

We included four studies with a total of 254 participants. All studies included comparisons between different types of cleansing solutions, and three of these reported our primary outcomes of complete wound healing or change in ulcer size over time, or both. Two studies reported the secondary outcome, pain. One study (27 participants), which compared polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) solution with saline solution for cleansing venous leg ulcers, did not report any of the review's primary or secondary outcomes. We did not identify any studies that compared cleansing with no cleansing, or that explored comparisons between different cleansing techniques. One study (61 participants) compared aqueous oxygen peroxide with sterile water. We are uncertain whether aqueous oxygen peroxide makes any difference to the number of wounds completely healed after 12 months of follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10 to 3.20). Similarly, we are uncertain whether aqueous oxygen peroxide makes any difference to change in ulcer size after eight weeks of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -1.38 cm², 95% CI -4.35 to 1.59 cm²). Finally, we are uncertain whether aqueous oxygen peroxide makes any difference to pain reduction, assessed after eight weeks of follow-up using a 0 to 100 pain rating, (MD 3.80, 95% CI -10.83 to 18.43). The evidence for these outcomes is of very low certainty (we downgraded for study limitations and imprecision; for the pain outcome we also downgraded for indirectness). Another study (40 participants) compared propyl betaine and polihexanide with a saline solution. The authors did not present the raw data in the study report so we were unable to conduct independent statistical analysis of the data. We are uncertain whether propyl betaine and polihexanide make any difference to the number of wounds completely healed, change in ulcer size over time, or wound pain reduction. The evidence is of very low certainty (we downgraded for study limitations and imprecision). The final study (126 participants) compared octenidine dihydrochloride/phenoxyethanol (OHP) with Ringer's solution. We are uncertain whether OHP makes any difference to the number of wounds healed (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.72) or to the change in ulcer size over time (we were unable to conduct independent statistical analysis of available data). The evidence is of very low certainty (we downgraded for study limitations and imprecision). None of the studies reported patient preference, ease of use of the method of cleansing, cost or health-related quality of life. In one study comparing propyl betaine and polihexanide with saline solution the authors do not report any adverse events occurring. We are uncertain whether OHP makes any difference to the number of adverse events compared with Ringer's solution (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.14). The evidence is of very low certainty (we downgraded for study limitations and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently a lack of RCT evidence to guide decision making about the effectiveness of wound cleansing compared with no cleansing and the optimal approaches to cleansing of venous leg ulcers. From the four studies identified, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether the use of PHMB solution compared with saline solution; aqueous oxygen peroxide compared with sterile water; propyl betaine and polihexanide compared with a saline solution; or OHP compared with Ringer's solution makes any difference in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. Evidence from three of the studies is of very low certainty, due to study limitations and imprecision. One study did not present data for the primary or secondary outcomes. Further well-designed studies that address important clinical, quality of life and economic outcomes may be important, based on the clinical and patient priority of this uncertainty.

### Water for wound cleansing [^8a6e59d7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although various solutions have been recommended for cleansing wounds, normal saline is favoured as it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process. Tap water is commonly used in the community for cleansing wounds because it is easily accessible, efficient and cost effective; however, there is an unresolved debate about its use.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of water compared with other solutions for wound cleansing.

Search Methods

For this fourth update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 9 November 2011); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to October Week 4 2011); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, November 8, 2011); Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2011 Week 44); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 4 November 2011).

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials that compared the use of water with other solutions for wound cleansing were eligible for inclusion. Additional criteria were outcomes that included objective or subjective measures of wound infection or healing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently carried out trial selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We settled differences in opinion by discussion. We pooled some data using a random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 11 trials in this review. We identified seven trials that compared rates of infection and healing in wounds cleansed with water and normal saline; three trials compared cleansing with no cleansing and one trial compared procaine spirit with water. There were no standard criteria for assessing wound infection across the trials, which limited the ability to pool the data. The major comparisons were water with normal saline, and tap water with no cleansing. For chronic wounds, the relative risk of developing an infection when cleansed with tap water compared with normal saline was 0.16, (95% CI 0.01 to 2.96). Tap water was more effective than saline in reducing the infection rate in adults with acute wounds (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.99). The use of tap water to cleanse acute wounds in children was not associated with a statistically significant difference in infection when compared to saline (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.64). We identified no statistically significant differences in infection rates when wounds were cleansed with tap water or not cleansed at all (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.07 to 16.50). Likewise, there was no difference in the infection rate in episiotomy wounds cleansed with water or procaine spirit. The use of isotonic saline, distilled water and boiled water for cleansing open fractures also did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the number of fractures that were infected.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence that using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults increases infection and some evidence that it reduces it. However there is not strong evidence that cleansing wounds per se increases healing or reduces infection. In the absence of potable tap water, boiled and cooled water as well as distilled water can be used as wound cleansing agents.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^22560ada]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Disinfection in ambulatory care, home care, and the home — because the ambulatory-care setting (i.e., outpatient facility) provides the same risk for infection as the hospital, the Spaulding classification scheme described in this guideline should be followed; in homes, APIC recommends that reusable objects that touch mucous membranes be disinfected by immersion in 70% isopropyl alcohol for 5 minutes or in 3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes, and a 1:50 dilution of 5.25%–6.15% sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) for 5 minutes should be effective; noncritical items can be cleaned with a detergent, blood spills should be handled according to OSHA regulations, sterilization of critical items is not practical in homes but could be accomplished by chemical sterilants or boiling, and single-use disposable items can be used or reusable items sterilized in a hospital.

Hydrogen peroxide — field use guidance — Although hydrogen peroxide can sterilize water, it is not widely used as a field water disinfectant because high concentrations known to be effective are very caustic and there is a lack of data for protozoal cysts and quantitative data for dilute solutions; it can also remove the taste of hypochlorite and be used with other processes. "We recommend that hydrogen peroxide in typical concentration of 3% should not be used as a primary drinking water disinfectant; whereas effective concentrations are not practical for field use. Strong recommendation, moderate quality evidence".

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^ee2cfa8b]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities (2008) — floor and fabric decontamination practices balance detergent-only approaches with targeted disinfection and routine cleaning. The document notes that "Reasons also exist for using a detergent alone on floors because noncritical surfaces contribute minimally to endemic health-care–associated infections, and no differences have been found in health-care–associated infection rates when floors are cleaned with detergent rather than disinfectant". At the same time, "some researchers have suggested that such surfaces should be disinfected on a regular schedule". For textiles, "Spot decontamination on fabrics that remain in hospitals or clinic rooms while patients move in and out (e.g., privacy curtains) also should be considered", and "One study demonstrated the effectiveness of spraying the fabric with 3% hydrogen peroxide". Regardless of product choice, "surfaces should be cleaned routinely and when dirty or soiled to provide an aesthetically pleasing environment and to prevent potentially contaminated objects from serving as a source for health-care–associated infections". The document also notes contamination risks with cleaning tools: "Several investigators have recognized heavy microbial contamination of wet mops and cleaning cloths" and that wiping with contaminated cloths "can contaminate hands, equipment, and other surfaces".

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^1309dd83]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization — mechanism and key operating parameters are summarized. This technology was "patented in 1987 and marketed in the United States in 1993", with gas plasmas "generated in an enclosed chamber under deep vacuum using radio frequency or microwave energy" to produce free radicals that disrupt microbial metabolism. In use, the chamber is evacuated and hydrogen peroxide is vaporized "to a concentration of 6 mg/l"; the vapor "diffuses through the chamber (50 minutes)", and an electrical field creates a plasma that generates microbicidal radicals. The process "operates in the range of 37–44°C and has a cycle time of 75 minutes", its by-products "are nontoxic and eliminate the need for aeration", allowing materials to be "handled safely, either for immediate use or storage", but "If any moisture is present on the objects the vacuum will not be achieved and the cycle aborts".

### Pin site care for preventing infections associated with external bone fixators and pins [^102c520a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Metal pins are used to apply skeletal traction or external fixation devices in the management of orthopaedic fractures. These percutaneous pins protrude through the skin, and the way in which they are treated after insertion may affect the incidence of pin site infection. This review set out to summarise the evidence of pin site care on infection rates.

Objectives

To assess the effect on infection rates of different methods of cleansing and dressing orthopaedic percutaneous pin sites.

Search Methods

In September 2013, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE; and EBSCO CINAHL.

Selection Criteria

We evaluated all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effect on infection and other complication rates of different methods of cleansing or dressing orthopaedic percutaneous pin sites.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the citations retrieved by the search strategies for reports of relevant RCTs, then independently selected trials that satisfied the inclusion criteria, extracted data and undertook quality assessment.

Main Results

A total of eleven trials (572 participants) were eligible for inclusion in the review but not all participants contributed data to each comparison. Three trials compared a cleansing regimen (saline, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide or antibacterial soap) with no cleansing (application of a dry dressing), three trials compared alternative sterile cleansing solutions (saline, alcohol, peroxide, povidone iodine), three trials compared methods of cleansing (one trial compared identical pin site care performed daily or weekly and the two others compared sterile with non sterile techniques), one trial compared daily pin site care with no care and six trials compared different dressings (using different solutions/ointments and dry and impregnated gauze or sponges). One small blinded study of 38 patients found that the risk of pin site infection was significantly reduced with polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) gauze when compared to plain gauze (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.44) (infection rate of 1% in the PHMB group and 4.5% in the control group) but this study was at high risk of bias as the unit of analysis was observations rather than patients. There were no other statistically significant differences between groups in any of the other trials.

Authors' Conclusions

The available trial evidence was not extensive, was very heterogeneous and generally of poor quality, so there was insufficient evidence to be able to identify a strategy of pin site care that minimises infection rates. Adequately-powered randomised trials are required to examine the effects of different pin care regimens, and co-interventions - such as antibiotic use - and other extraneous factors must be controlled in the study designs.

### Postoperative wound care protocol prevents surgical site infection after craniotomy [^7407520a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Development of a post-craniotomy wound care protocol

A multidisciplinary performance improvement team was convened at the end of 2018 to create a standardized post-craniotomy wound care protocol to address dressing integrity, incisional clots, postoperative hair cleanliness, and wound care. The team included wound care nurses, neurosurgical nurse specialists, neurosurgeons, and infection prevention leaders. At the time, monthly SSI rates were commonly 2%–4% with most pathogens representing skin flora.

Multiple products were trialed for removing incisional clots: hydrogen peroxide (0.3%, 1.5%, 3%), 2% CHG sponge and swab stick applicators, and 2% CHG cloths. We applied products two-at-a-time on opposite ends of a convenience sample of incisional clots to test their effect on clot removal. We began with lower hydrogen peroxide percentages to find the minimum effective concentration since higher concentrations may cause skin cell damage and adversely affect wound healing. Nevertheless, none of the tested dilutions were effective for clot removal. In trialing CHG, 2% CHG sponge and swab applicators were impractical because their surface material became trapped by metal staples. Warmed 2% CHG cloths were consistently able to soften, loosen, and remove dried blood clots. The developed protocol involved squeezing 2% CHG solution from a warmed impregnated cloth onto the incision and laying the cloth flat for 15 minutes to breakdown dried blood/clots before cleaning the incision with a new CHG cloth.

### Water for wound cleansing [^7c494c7a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Various solutions have been recommended for cleansing wounds, however normal saline is favoured as it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process. Tap water is commonly used in the community for cleansing wounds because it is easily accessible, efficient and cost effective, however, there is an unresolved debate about its use.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of water compared to other solutions for wound cleansing.

Search Strategy

Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified by electronic searches of Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Primary authors, company representatives and content experts were contacted to identify eligible studies. Reference lists from included trials were also searched.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials that compared the use of water with other solutions for wound cleansing were eligible for inclusion. Additional criteria were outcomes that included objective or subjective measures of wound infection or healing.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial selection, data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two reviewers and checked by a third reviewer. Differences in opinion were settled by discussion. Some data were pooled using a random effects model.

Main Results

Three trials were identified that compared rates of infection and healing in wounds cleansed with water and normal saline, two compared cleansing with no cleansing and one compared procaine spirit with water. There were no standard criteria for the assessment of wound infection across the trials which limited the ability to pool the data. The major comparisons were water vs normal saline, and tap water vs no cleansing. For chronic wounds, the odds of developing an infection when cleansed with tap water compared with normal saline was 0.16, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.01, 2.96. Use of tap water to cleanse acute wounds was associated with a lower rate of infection than saline (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28, 0.96). No statistically significant differences in infection rates were seen when wounds were cleansed with tap water or not cleansed at all (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.06, 17.47). Similarly there was no difference in the infection rate in wounds cleansed with water or procaine spirit and those cleansed with isotonic saline, distilled water and boiled water (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.18,1.62).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Although the evidence is limited one trial has suggested that the use of tap water to cleanse acute wounds reduces the infection rate and other trials conclude that there is no difference in the infection and healing rates between wounds that were not cleansed and those cleansed with tap water and other solutions. However the quality of the tap water should be considered prior to its use and in the absence of potable tap water, boiled and cooled water as well as distilled water can be used as wound cleansing agents.

### Guideline for disinfection and sterilization in healthcare facilities, 2008 [^cfca1566]. CDC (2008). Medium credibility.

Cleaning — definition and pre-disinfection rationale — states that cleaning is the removal of foreign material from objects using water with detergents or enzymatic products, and thorough cleaning is required before high-level disinfection and sterilization because residual materials interfere with these processes; if soils dry or bake onto instruments the processes become less effective or ineffective, and surgical instruments should be presoaked or rinsed to prevent drying of blood and to soften or remove blood from instruments.

### Personal protective equipment for reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection among health care workers involved in emergency trauma surgery during the pandemic: an umbrella review [^4873ce09]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Regarding decontamination, a systematic review assessed the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation for the decontamination of PPE and its impact on PPE performance. Its findings support that the use of a cumulative ultraviolet-C dose of at least 40,000 J/m² results in adequate decontamination without affecting performance or fit afterward. Another review on the subject reported that mask (N95) performance was best conserved using dry heat decontamination and that vaporous hydrogen peroxide and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation are effective decontaminants. However, its effect on surgical masks is unknown. The authors also state that bleach is not safe for decontamination since it alters mask performance and might be associated with health risk for users.

A qualitative evidence synthesis that searched for barriers and facilitators of HCWs adherence to PPE protocols included 20 studies of moderate- to high-quality overall (10 from Asia, 4 from Africa, 4 from Central and North America, and 2 from Australia). They report that HCWs were unsure to follow recommendations when they are long and ambiguous or do not reflect national or international guidelines. Some were overwhelmed because of constantly changing guidelines and by the increased workload and fatigue associated with PPE use because of preparation and cleaning. A serious concern was the lack of PPE or the low quality of the available items, pointing at a need to adjust supplies during the pandemic. Health care workers reported that it was challenging to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened, or stigmatized. Of course, discomfort associated with wearing PPE was also reported.

IV.E. Environmental cleaning and disinfection — overview: Evidence indicates "contaminated environmental surfaces play a role in the transmission of healthcare-associated pathogens… and that improved environmental cleaning and disinfection are effective in reducing the transmission of such pathogens". In CF care, "All people with CF may harbor transmissible pathogens or are at risk of acquiring such pathogens; environmental cleaning and disinfection practices should be implemented when caring for all people with CF". "Four strategies can reduce transmission from contaminated healthcare surfaces and equipment": "(1) improve cleaning and disinfection of the rooms of patients known to carry healthcare-associated pathogens", "(2) disinfect high-touch surfaces in isolation rooms daily", "(3) disinfect portable equipment between patients or use disposable or dedicated equipment in isolation rooms", and "(4) expand efforts to improve cleaning and disinfection of all rooms if there is concern that patients harboring MDROs are not identified or are identified after long delays". "Automatic disinfection devices (eg, hydrogen peroxide vapor and ultraviolet cleaning) are promising but require additional studies before recommendations for their routine use can be made". Monitoring and quality improvement are emphasized: "Three types of audits after cleaning and disinfecting have been described", and "Objective measures utilizing fluorescent dye or ATP detection are the most effective and practical to implement". Coordination is urged: "coordination between the CF care team and the IP&C team is advised", and tools exist as "Checklists and other tools for cleaning and additional background information are available on the CDC website".

### Effect of the most common wound antiseptics on human skin fibroblasts [^df4f47b1]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiseptics are increasingly being used on chronic wounds due to the rise in multidrug‐resistant micro‐organisms in biofilms. However, clinical guidelines for antiseptic use are limited to the treatment of wounds that are already infected or at risk of infection. The ideal antiseptic for wound cleaning should combine maximum antimicrobial activity with minimum cytotoxicity. This in vitro study found that antiseptics have toxic effects on fibroblasts, which are cells that play a key role in wound healing. In vitro treatment with hexetidine, PI, UBP, chlorhexidine, disodium eosin or hydrogen peroxide significantly reduced the proliferative capacity of the fibroblasts, significantly increased their necrosis and apoptosis rates, and significantly diminished the percentage wound closure compared with controls.

Hexetidine is effective as a local antimicrobial and antifungal agent. Compared with controls, treatment of cultured fibroblasts with hexetidine significantly reduced their proliferative capacity and significantly increased their apoptosis rate, although it did not increase their necrosis rate. We found only one previously published in vitro study on the effects of hexetidine on fibroblasts; Shakespeare et al.treated 3 T3 fibroblasts with hexetidine (dilutions of 1: 500 to 1: 1000) and found a reduction in the proliferation capacity and viability of these cells. The present finding of a significant reduction in the in vitro percentage wound healing (migration capacity) of fibroblasts at 12 and 24 h may be explained by the effect of hexetidine on the proliferative capacity of these cells.

PI and UBP are commonly used to treat and prevent wound infection. Compared with controls treatment with these agents significantly reduced the proliferative capacity of fibroblasts, significantly increased their apoptosis and necrosis rates, and significantly decreased the percentage wound closure at 12 and 24 h in the current study. These findings are in line with a study showing that treatment with PI at variable concentrations was found to exert a cytotoxic effect on human gingival fibroblast cultures through a dose‐dependent inhibition of proliferation. Likewise, Hirsch et al. reported a cytotoxic effect on human fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro after treatment with UBP or PI at similar concentrations to those we used in the present study. The action of UBP and PI against multidrug‐resistant micro‐organisms is well documented, and these antiseptics are routinely applied to treat long‐term infected wounds with good outcomes. However, their preventive application in open wounds may be counterproductive due to their negative effects on fibroblasts, which may slow the healing process.

### Wound care in buruli ulcer disease in Ghana and Benin [^89ddf279]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

A high standard of wound care is likely to reduce the time to healing, decreasing the risk for secondary infections and functional limitations, and promoting an early return to society. Several low-cost interventions can be made to enhance the standard of wound care: using a simple system for classifying and monitoring the wound based on size and color, washing the area around the wound before dressing, using a syringe or pierced water bottle for low pressure irrigation of the wound, avoiding routine use of hydro-peroxide or chlorhexidine, and avoiding pain and bleeding. Furthermore, efforts should be made to empower health care workers responsible for wound care, e.g. with appropriate tools and facilities and further training in WHO guidelines on wound care management in BU patients.

### Effect of the most common wound antiseptics on human skin fibroblasts [^893bfa9d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatments with chlorhexidine, disodium eosin and hydrogen peroxide all reduced the proliferative capacity of fibroblasts and increased their necrosis rate. In fact, the cytotoxic effect of these antiseptics on the human skin fibroblasts meant the scratch assays could not be performed because there was no cell movement.

Chlorhexidine exerts prolonged antimicrobial activity and is frequently used for skin antisepsis before surgery or directly applied to cleanse the wound bed. In previous in vitro studies, Coelho et al.and Sukumaran et al.reported that treatment with chlorhexidine at varying concentrations for different time periods (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 min) had cytotoxic effects on gingival fibroblasts, reducing their viability at 24 h post‐treatment.

The effectiveness of disodium eosin as an antibacterial agent is also well established, although there is little evidence about its activity against eukaryotic cell populations. An in vitro study found that disodium eosin at different concentrations (0.002%–0.2%) reduced the proliferation of keratinocytes from skin biopsies and inhibited the release of healing‐related inflammatory cytokines. Disodium eosin is commonly used to treat napkin (diaper) dermatitis and psoriasis, among other skin conditions, but its application on open wounds is contraindicated.

Hydrogen peroxide is widely used to prevent and treat local infectious processes and is known to have a toxic effect on tissues. Hydrogen peroxide was found to induce dose‐dependent apoptosis and necrosis in pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and to inhibit wound healing in an in vitro model. In another study, treatment of cultured human oral keratinocytes with hydrogen peroxide (at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 or 100 nM) reduced their proliferation at concentrations above 5 mM and induced DNA damage and cytotoxicity, with a concentration‐dependent increase in cell apoptosis.

Base on these in vitro findings, the antiseptics under study can all be toxic for fibroblasts, which play a key role in wound healing.

### Care and cleaning of maxillofacial prostheses [^ede679a2]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Both the cleaning and care of the prosthesis are fundamental for maintaining its quality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to show the methods of cleaning and care the patient needs to take as regards the prosthesis and adjacent tissue, starting with correct instruction and training by the professional. It has been verified that among the materials for fabricating maxillofacial prostheses, silicone was considered the major retainer of microorganisms on its surface. Therefore, for cleaning prostheses, the use of water and neutral soap, as well as chlorhexidine, is recommended. As regards care of the adjacent tissues, it is recommended to remove the prosthesis before going to sleep, in addition to washing the prosthesis receptor tissues with water and neutral soap or with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water. Whereas for the mucosal surfaces of the ophthalmic cavity, cleaning with filtered and boiled water or physiological solution at least 3 times a day is recommended.

2.3 Administration

Below is the list of supplies needed for VYJUVEK gel administration:

The administration syringes
Hydrophobic dressing
Scissors
Standard dressing
Protective gloves
Biohazard container
Virucidal agent for clean-up

VYJUVEK GEL ADMINISTRATION

Note: The administration syringe should be primed prior to the initial application by pulling the plunger down and pushing it upwards, so that a small droplet of VYJUVEK gel forms at the tip of the syringe.

Follow the steps below for VYJUVEK gel administration.

1. Apply VYJUVEK gel to the selected wound(s) in droplets spaced evenly within the wound, approximately 1cm-by-1cm apart (width of a fingertip). The resulting droplet pattern should loosely resemble a grid. Avoid touching the administration syringe to the skin and/or wound (Figure 14).

Figure 14 Application of VYJUVEK gel to the wound

Table 2below provides a reference on dose per approximate size of the wound.

Dose by Wound Size

2. Use the clean scissors to cut the hydrophobic dressing to a size slightly larger than the wound and place the dressing atop the VYJUVEK gel droplets (Figure 15).

Figure 15 Placing the hydrophobic dressing over the treated wound

3. Use the scissors to cut the standard dressing used by the patient to a size slightly larger than the hydrophobic dressing and place the standard dressing atop the hydrophobic dressing (Figure 16).

Figure 16 Placing the standard dressing over the hydrophobic dressing

4. Clean all surfaces that may have come in contact with VYJUVEK gel and treat all spills with a virucidal agent such as 70% isopropyl alcohol, 6% hydrogen peroxide or < 0.4% ammonium chloride. Blot using absorbent materials.

5. Dispose all materials (e.g., syringe, cleaning materials) that may have come in contact with VYJUVEK biological suspension or gel into a biohazard container.

6. Discard unused administration syringes containing the VYJUVEK gel after preparation into a biohazard container [see Storage and Handling (16.2)].

7. The dressing should be left in place until the next dressing change after VYJUVEK gel application. Once the VYJUVEK dressings are removed, the patient may continue with their standard of care.

### Effect of the most common wound antiseptics on human skin fibroblasts [^bf640919]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Antiseptics are used for the cleansing of acute or chronic wounds to eliminate micro‐organisms from the wound bed. However, they have effects on the skin cells.

Aim

To determine the effects of hexetidine, povidone–iodine (PI), undecylenamidopropyl‐betaine/polyhexanide (UBP), chlorhexidine, disodium eosin and hydrogen peroxide on human skin fibroblasts.

Methods

CCD‐1064Sk cells were treated with hexetidine, PI, UBP, chlorhexidine, disodium eosin or hydrogen peroxide. Spectrophotometry was used to measure cell viability and flow cytometry was used to study apoptosis and necrosis after the treatment. In vitro wound scratch assays were performed to determine the gap closure.

Results

All antiseptics significantly reduced the viability of human skin fibroblasts compared with controls. The percentage wound closure was lower with hexetidine, PI and UBP. The scratch assay could not be measured after treatments with chlorhexidine, disodium eosin or hydrogen peroxide, owing to their cytotoxicity. The apoptosis/necrosis experiments evidenced a significant reduction in viable cells compared with controls. An increased percentage of apoptotic cells was observed after treatment with all antiseptics. Compared with controls, the percentage of necrotic cells was significantly increased with all antiseptics except for hexetidine.

Conclusion

The proliferation, migration and viability of human skin fibroblasts are reduced by treatment with hexetidine, PI, UBP, chlorhexidine, disodium eosin and hydrogen peroxide.

### Hydrogen peroxide irrigation as an adjunct to digital rectal examination for detection of penetrating low rectal injuries [^b9c2a60f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The ideal modality to evaluate patients for rectal trauma would be low cost, performed rapidly with minimal equipment, accurate, and cause negligible discomfort. This case report demonstrates that hydrogen peroxide irrigation into a penetrating injury where there is suspicion for extraperitoneal rectal violation is feasible.

Hydrogen peroxide has been traditionally discussed as a wound cleansing agent due to its production of reactive oxygen species. Hydrogen peroxide reacts with catalase within body tissues, resulting in its characteristic foamy appearance through production of oxygen and water. In a penetrating injury, the volume of gas expands within the cavity and fluid is forced to make its egress toward the exit site of the wound. The ability to diagnose rectal injury has not been described, but it has been described as an adjunct to CT for diagnosis of penetrating abdominal injury. Hydrogen peroxide has also been demonstrated to assist identification of an anal fistulous tract and, more recently, combined with ultrasound to enhance detection of fistulas.

Future research is needed to determine the safety and statistical accuracy of using hydrogen peroxide to outline rectal injury. In this report, the DRE had been falsely negative for gross blood. Hydrogen peroxide irrigation outperformed the DRE and requires only simple tools that are available within most trauma bays and can be completed rapidly at the bedside.

### Wilderness Medical Society practice guidelines for basic wound management in the austere environment: 2014 update [^6bf1bc24]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Rabies exposure management in wilderness wound care — After rabies virus exposure in previously unvaccinated persons, prompt postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) is nearly universally effective in preventing human rabies, and PEP combines local wound care, infiltration with human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) into and around the wound, and multiple doses of rabies cell-culture vaccine. Rabies PEP is effective in preventing human rabies. Recommendation grade: 1B. In the wilderness setting, the one critical intervention that can be performed in the field is appropriate wound cleansing; this should be done with soap and water or, if available, irrigation with a virucidal agent (ie, povidone-iodine; or the more commonly available chlorine dioxide), and local wound care may significantly decrease rabies risk. Wounds that might require suturing should undergo delayed primary closure at 4 days, and wounds with a risk of rabies exposure should be irrigated, preferably with a virucidal agent, and closure should be delayed for 4 days. Recommendation grade: 1C. All bites, regardless of body site or evidence of gross trauma, represent a potential risk, and prophylaxis for suspected rabies exposure is a medical urgency, but not an emergency.

3.4 Occupational factors associated with skin outcomes

In the multivariate logistic regression models, an approximately four‐fold increased odds of WRSS and PCD was found in technicians compared to administrative clerks (Table 2).

TABLE 2
Association between occupational factors in relation to work‐related skin outcomes in adjusted logistic regression models.

Workers with PCU were more likely to use hydrogen peroxide for medical instrument cleaning and disinfection (OR adj = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.08–11.55) and formalin 10% for specimen preparation (OR adj = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.03–6.09) (Table 3). Job tasks associated with an increased likelihood of PCU included manual and automatic sterilization of medical instruments, and disinfection of patients' skin areas prior to procedures.

TABLE 3
Association between nature of occupational exposures in relation to work‐related skin outcomes in adjusted logistic regression models.

A protective association against PCD was observed among HWs using alcohol sanitiser to clean hands (OR adj = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.07–0.83). Job tasks associated with an increased likelihood of PCD included manual sterilization of medical instruments, disinfection of patients' skin areas prior to procedures and the use of wound adhesives.

Among the workplace activities, patients' skin/wound cleaning and disinfection significantly increased the odds of WRSS (Definition 2: OR adj = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.16–3.48). Except for cleaning and disinfecting wounds, all the job tasks that involved patients' skin/wound cleaning and disinfection were associated with an approximately two‐fold increased likelihood of WRSS. Automatic sterilization of medical instruments was also associated with an increased odds of WRSS in the past 12 months (Definition 1: OR adj = 3.80, 95% CI: 1.34–10.80).

In contrast to SAHWs, a protective association for WRSS (Definition 1: OR adj = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.18–0.92) was observed for TAHWs using liquid hand soap. Protective associations were also observed for WRSS in the last 12 months when using bleach or all‐purpose cleaner for medical instruments cleaning and disinfection.

### A rare case of portal vein gas: accidental hydrogen peroxide ingestion [^b23f721a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) is a colourless and odourless liquid with oxidant characteristics used for various purposes. Whereas in lower concentrations (3%), H(2)O(2) is used as a disinfectant in home cleaning products and wound care, in higher concentrations (35%) it is used in textile and paper industry as a bleaching agent and is diluted for use in lightening hair dyes. Like other caustic substances, direct injuries may develop if H(2)O(2) is swallowed and systemic air embolisms may occur due to the resultant gaseous oxygen. This study discusses a patient who was detected with the presence of gas in the portal venous system due to H(2)O(2) intoxication and was treated conservatively.

### Do we know how best to disinfect child care sites in the United States? A review of available disinfectant efficacy data and health risks of the major disinfectant classes [^442e2150]. American Journal of Infection Control (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Children in child care settings have a high infectious burden. They are frequently exposed to sanitizing and disinfecting agents, whose toxicities have not been studied in these settings. Current guidance on the preferred disinfection agents for child care is vague.

Methods

This article combines 2 different sources of information: the Environmental Protection Agency registration data on the efficacy of hospital-grade disinfectants and a review of the research on the toxicities of the most common of these disinfectants to summarize information that could be used for more evidence-based early care and education disinfection regulations and guidelines.

Results

Coverage of these organisms varied both between disinfectant classes (defined by active ingredient), as well as within classes. The 3 most common active ingredients in the database-quaternary ammonias, bleaches, and hydrogen peroxides-had 251, 63, and 31 products, respectively. Quaternary ammonias and bleaches are both known asthmagens, with the potential for toxic gas release when mixed. Quaternary ammonias may also cause reproductive toxicity. Disinfectant-grade peroxides have relatively low inhalational toxicity.

Conclusions

A clear rationale is needed to establish policies for determining preferable disinfection products for use in child care settings, based on efficacy against relevant pathogens, toxicity, ease of use, and cost. When other factors are equal, the use of peroxide-based disinfectant products is recommended to minimize inhalational toxicity.

### Centers for disease control and prevention guideline for the prevention of surgical site infection, 2017 [^28339bbb]. JAMA Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

The human and financial costs of treating surgical site infections (SSIs) are increasing. The number of surgical procedures performed in the United States continues to rise, and surgical patients are initially seen with increasingly complex comorbidities. It is estimated that approximately half of SSIs are deemed preventable using evidence-based strategies.

Objective

To provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI.

Evidence Review

A targeted systematic review of the literature was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library from 1998 through April 2014. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the quality of evidence and the strength of the resulting recommendation and to provide explicit links between them. Of 5759 titles and abstracts screened, 896 underwent full-text review by 2 independent reviewers. After exclusions, 170 studies were extracted into evidence tables, appraised, and synthesized.

Findings

Before surgery, patients should shower or bathe (full body) with soap (antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial) or an antiseptic agent on at least the night before the operative day. Antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered only when indicated based on published clinical practice guidelines and timed such that a bactericidal concentration of the agents is established in the serum and tissues when the incision is made. In cesarean section procedures, antimicrobial prophylaxis should be administered before skin incision. Skin preparation in the operating room should be performed using an alcohol-based agent unless contraindicated. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, additional prophylactic antimicrobial agent doses should not be administered after the surgical incision is closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Topical antimicrobial agents should not be applied to the surgical incision. During surgery, glycemic control should be implemented using blood glucose target levels less than 200 mg/dL, and normothermia should be maintained in all patients. Increased fraction of inspired oxygen should be administered during surgery and after extubation in the immediate postoperative period for patients with normal pulmonary function undergoing general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Transfusion of blood products should not be withheld from surgical patients as a means to prevent SSI.

Conclusions and Relevance

This guideline is intended to provide new and updated evidence-based recommendations for the prevention of SSI and should be incorporated into comprehensive surgical quality improvement programs to improve patient safety.
