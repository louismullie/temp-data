## Question

Urinary retention work up inpatient

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step inpatient urinary retention workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to screen and risk-stratify patients. Then, I should verify the focused history and physical examination elements that change management. Next, I will review objective testing, especially bladder scanning thresholds and when to use intermittent versus indwelling catheterization. After that, I need to check etiologic evaluation and when to involve consultants. Finally, I will consider special populations, implementation, and quality metrics to ensure the plan is safe and actionable in real-world inpatient care.

> Let me first confirm the screening approach and risk stratification, because missing high-risk patients changes outcomes. I should screen all postoperative patients and high-risk medical inpatients for urinary retention using symptom assessment and bladder scanning, starting with symptomatic patients and considering earlier scanning in those receiving high-volume IV fluids or diuretics, as recommended by the URECA expert panel and supported by qualitative feedback emphasizing the need for a standardized, nurse-friendly algorithm [^116wM89w] [^113bVUKe] [^1175h3VE]. Hold on, I should verify the risk factors that truly matter: male sex, older age, BPH, neurologic disease, anticholinergics or opioids, prolonged anesthesia, pelvic surgery, and immobility are repeatedly cited as predictors of postoperative and inpatient retention, so I will keep these front-of-mind during triage [^112d51ts] [^111cUR2W] [^1132aP7D].

> Next, I should review the focused history and physical, and I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions before excluding mimics. I will ask about inability to void, suprapubic discomfort, frequency with small volumes, and overflow incontinence, while also checking medications such as anticholinergics, opioids, alpha-agonists, and recent anesthesia or neuraxial blocks, and I will assess fluid balance and diuretic exposure that could mask or exacerbate retention, aligning with URECA's emphasis on clinical context and symptom-driven decisions [^113fEFms] [^111WnxDU]. On exam, I will inspect for a distended bladder, perform a focused neurologic assessment including perineal sensation and anal reflex, and do a digital rectal exam to assess prostate and fecal impaction, because these findings can pivot management toward neurologic or obstructive etiologies and guide decompression strategy [^113fEFms] [^11687oRT].

> I will now examine objective testing, and I should double-check the role of bladder scanning versus catheterization. The URECA panel concluded that bladder scanning is preferred over immediate catheterization for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients when available, and that catheterization to "diagnose" retention is inappropriate if a scanner is accessible, which reduces harm from unnecessary urethral instrumentation and CAUTI risk [^112JwzPx] [^116wM89w]. Wait, let me verify the thresholds: for symptomatic patients, volumes of 300 mL or more warrant intervention, whereas in asymptomatic patients, 500 mL or more is the trigger, with volumes below 400 mL generally not prompting catheterization absent other indications, and these cutoffs reflect expert consensus rather than randomized data, so I should document clinical judgment alongside the number [^112JwzPx] [^111WnxDU]. I should also remember that ascites and very low urine output can degrade scanner accuracy, so if the clinical picture and scan conflict, I need to reassess or use alternative measures [^111WnxDU].

> Let me think about catheterization modality, because choosing intermittent straight catheterization versus an indwelling urethral catheter changes infection risk and patient mobility. URECA recommends ISC as first-line for lower bladder volumes and for most initial decompressions, reserving IUC for higher volumes, patient preference after counseling, or when frequent ISC is impractical, and this approach is echoed by geriatric best practices emphasizing daily review and early removal of indwelling devices [^116wM89w] [^1128FGQ8]. Hold on, I should verify the practical triggers to switch from ISC to IUC: if ISC is required more often than every 4 hours or yields more than 500 mL every 4 hours, or if patient preference and nursing feasibility favor IUC, then transition is reasonable after discussing infection and mobility trade-offs [^113wS9Pf] [^111WnxDU].

> Next, I should review etiologic evaluation and when to escalate diagnostics. I will obtain urinalysis and culture if infection is suspected, because UTI can precipitate or mimic retention, and I will check basic metabolic panel if there is concern for renal impact from obstructive uropathy, while reserving upper tract imaging for unknown-risk neurogenic presentations or abnormal labs rather than ordering it reflexively in low-risk patients [^111MYYLq] [^113CEiiR]. But wait, what if the patient has red flags for neurogenic causes or cauda equina? New severe LUTS, enuresis without chronic retention, saddle anesthesia, leg weakness, or gait disturbance should prompt urgent neurologic evaluation and appropriate imaging, given the catastrophic consequences of delayed diagnosis [^116MMpCv] [^116TasJD]. I should also consider urethral stricture in patients with weak stream, straining, or rising PVR, using uroflow and PVR to screen and proceeding to urethrography or cystoscopy if indicated, per contemporary guidance [^113BCou2] [^116JYog4].

> I will now examine special populations, because one size does not fit all. In postoperative patients, I should anticipate POUR incidence of roughly 15–45% after pelvic reconstructive surgery and perform a voiding trial before discharge when feasible, recognizing that delayed POUR can occur and is often associated with UTI at catheter removal, so I should culture before decatheterization in delayed cases [^113X7uDj] [^111ds9ro] [^115Nd6hX]. For women with advanced prolapse or those on anticholinergics, I should maintain a high index of suspicion and individualize the timing of medication resumption, as consensus statements note increased POUR risk without definitive guidance on preoperative discontinuation intervals [^111cUR2W] [^113YtmZR] [^1147XFBV]. In older adults, I should screen broadly for PVR on admission in rehabilitation settings and use lower thresholds for intervention given frailty and comorbidity, while still avoiding unnecessary indwelling catheters when ISC is feasible [^1132aP7D] [^111tMbtJ]. For patients with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, I must risk-stratify and tailor imaging and urodynamics to risk tier, and I should counsel on retention risk before botulinum toxin, which frequently necessitates intermittent catheterization [^113CEiiR] [^114EFmVF].

> Let me reconsider implementation, because even the best algorithm fails without workflow support. Frontline clinicians prefer concise, visually intuitive algorithms embedded in the EMR with clear action points and minimal text, and URECA was iteratively refined to portrait orientation with color coding and explicit thresholds to meet this need, which I should replicate locally to drive adoption [^113bVUKe] [^111VR729]. I need to ensure daily catheter rounds, automatic removal reminders after 24–48 hours, and documentation of indication to sustain reductions in catheter days and CAUTIs, as demonstrated by quality improvement initiatives in general medicine wards and ICU protocols targeting AUR management [^115K6MHG] [^112iDaSi]. Hold on, I should verify that we track process and balancing measures: catheter utilization, CAUTI rates, and reinsertion after failed voiding trials are key metrics to monitor for unintended consequences as we scale the algorithm [^115K6MHG] [^113oiZzU].

> Finally, I should confirm the stepwise flow I will use at the bedside so I do not miss anything critical. Screen for symptoms and risk, examine for distension and neurologic signs, scan the bladder and apply 300 mL and 500 mL thresholds by symptom status, choose ISC first for most decompressions and escalate to IUC when volumes, frequency, or logistics demand it, evaluate for reversible causes including medications, constipation, infection, and obstruction, and involve urology or neurology early for complex or red-flag presentations, documenting each step and the rationale for deviations when clinical context warrants it [^116wM89w] [^112JwzPx] [^111WnxDU].

---

The inpatient workup for urinary retention should start with a **focused history** (onset, medications, comorbidities, prior retention) and a **targeted exam** (suprapubic distension, prostate, neurologic deficits) [^113fEFms]. Obtain a **bladder scan** to estimate volume [^112JwzPx]; if ≥ 300 mL in symptomatic or ≥ 500 mL in asymptomatic patients, decompress with intermittent catheterization first, reserving indwelling catheters for high volumes, failed trials, or patient preference [^116wM89w] [^113wS9Pf]. Order urinalysis and culture, electrolytes/BUN/creatinine, and glucose; consider PSA in men > 50 or with risk factors. Use ultrasound to assess prostate, kidneys, and ureters; reserve CT for suspected stones or complex obstruction. Identify and treat causes (BPH, medications, neurologic, urethral stricture, constipation) and arrange urology consult for refractory cases or suspected obstruction [^113fEFms] [^11687oRT].

Discussion

We applied a mixed-methods approach including the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and qualitative methods to develop a practical algorithm based on the available evidence to assess and manage UR in postoperative and medical inpatients. We found that a combination of clinical symptoms and scanned bladder volumes could guide management and prevent unnecessary catheterization or recatheterization. Decreasing catheterization minimizes patient discomfort and reduces the risk of urethral injury and urinary tract infection. Given the lack of guidelines for UR management in this population, our robust, expert panel approach provided a framework for consistent, quality care for patients with UR.

Our study adds to the literature by providing practical guidance on assessing and managing UR based on available evidence augmented by expert opinion. Our results concur with those obtained by another multidisciplinary panel that assessed appropriate indications for initial catheter placement in hospitalized medical patients in which UR was considered an appropriate indication for catheter placement. Generally, bladder scanner accuracy is adequate for clinical purposes; however, some conditions can interfere with obtaining objective data from bladder scanners used for decisions within the algorithm, such as ascites (leading to erroneous volume assessment by ultrasonography) or very low urine output due to kidney failure (extending the time needed to fill the bladder). Algorithm implementation must consider clinical context to accommodate patient variability.

When assessing transitions from ISC to IUC, the panel found it was appropriate to transition based solely on patient requests (a patient-centered approach). However, patients must understand the potential risks of IUC, including increased infection risk and restraints on normal activity, so that their decision is informed.

The recommendations of the panel indicated that bladder scanners allow for data-driven patient management. This requires the ubiquitous presence of bladder scanners in hospitals. For an investment of several thousand dollars each, having scanners readily available can provide rapid, noninvasive diagnosis and prevent unnecessary catheterization.

Panel findings provided the numerical framework for our draft algorithm, which we then iteratively refined through qualitative interviews with local stakeholders. Honoring frontline clinicians' request for specific cutoffs rather than numeric ranges required choosing somewhat arbitrary cutoffs (for volumes and timing) within the range of options deemed appropriate by the panel. This underlines the fact that the numerical choices in our algorithm are not the only reasonable options consistent with the panel data; thus, our results allow adaptation of the URECA to fit various patient populations and health system policies.

Transitioning From ISC to IUC

Panelists felt that transitioning patients from ISC to IUC based on patient request could be appropriate depending on the clinical scenario (Table 3 and eTable 7 in Supplement 1). Patients needing ISC more than every 4 hours or whose output was more than 500 mL every 4 hours could also be appropriately transitioned to IUC. The panelists considered it inappropriate to transition to IUC for initial ISC volumes less than 500 mL, for ISC frequencies less than 5 times in 24 hours, or when needed for more than 2 days. The panel disagreed on what volume of initial retention warranted IUC instead of ISC.

Table 3.
Appropriateness Ratings for Transitioning From ISC to IUC for Urinary Retention

Abbreviations: ISC, intermittent straight catheter; IUC, indwelling urinary catheter.

In general, panelists were either uncertain or felt that it was inappropriate to perform assessments or treatments to prevent development of UR in specific patients, such as males with a history of UR. Findings are shown in eTable 8 in Supplement 1.

Qualitative Interviews and Feedback to Refine Algorithm Development

After interviewing 33 frontline clinicians from 5 hospitals (9 men and 24 women; 10 surgical nurses, 8 surgeons, 8 nurse educators or infection preventionists, 4 urologists, and 3 surgery residents), we organized findings into 3 domains. These included (1) perceived need for a retention management algorithm; (2) feedback on the draft retention algorithm, including likes and dislikes and recommended changes; and (3) suggestions for implementation.

Introduction

Urinary catheters are commonly used in hospitalized medical and surgical patients. However, there are no guidelines or widely accepted algorithms for screening and management of urinary retention (UR) in these patients. Balancing the potential complications of untreated UR (eg, pain, bladder dysfunction) against those of urinary catheterization (eg, urethral injury, urinary tract infection) is necessary when deciding whether to insert a catheter.,

Although UR algorithms exist for outpatient populations, there is limited evidence to guide management in hospitalized patients. Outpatient surgical populations are generally healthier and undergo less-invasive procedures than those requiring inpatient care, limiting the generalizability of outpatient recommendations. Algorithms for outpatients use symptoms and risk stratification (eg, hydronephrosis, recurrent infections) to guide catheterization recommendations instead of postvoid residual volumes commonly used in hospitals. Inpatients may experience evolving disease processes and changing medications and fluid volumes that acutely impact bladder function and voiding. To improve the quality and consistency of care for hospitalized adult medical and surgical patients with UR, we aimed to use a systematic, multidisciplinary approach based on evidence, expert opinion, and feedback from frontline medical professionals to develop and refine a urinary retention evaluation and catheterization algorithm (URECA).

Clinician Panel Selection and Rating Process

We recruited 11 practicing clinicians experienced in evaluating and managing UR in medical and postoperative hospitalized patients. We sampled different practice types (academic, private, and government), US regions, and relevant clinical expertise. Panelists (eTable 2 in Supplement 1) included urologists, urologic nurses, and an infectious diseases physician with expertise in urinary infections.

In round 1, participants completed independent ratings of clinical scenarios. We asked panelists to rate appropriateness of each intervention ("appropriate" was defined as when expected health benefits exceeded expected negative consequences, exclusive of cost) on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 indicating harms outweigh benefits (ie, inappropriate) and 9 indicating benefits outweigh harms (ie, appropriate). A middle rating (5) indicated the benefits or harms were equivalent or the panelist could not make an informed decision. All scenarios involved adults in medical inpatient and postoperative surgical settings. We instructed panelists to use their clinical judgment and the evidence provided in the literature review, making no other assumptions.

After round 1, we held a conference call with panelists to clarify the clinical scenarios while attempting to reduce disagreement and uncertainty. Panelists met in person for round 2, during which they discussed each scenario, preliminary scores, and rating differences. Then they independently rerated each clinical scenario for a total of 107 clinical scenarios involving diagnosis and management of UR in postoperative or medical inpatients. Panelists also rated an additional 11 scenarios involving potential practices to prevent UR. Median round 2 scores determined the final classification of each scenario as appropriate (median score, 7–9), uncertain (4–6), or inappropriate (1–3). If 4 or more panelists rated a scenario as appropriate while 4 or more rated the same scenario as inappropriate, we rated the scenario as uncertain. The entire rating process took place from March to May 2015.

Importance

Acute urinary retention (UR) is common, yet variations in diagnosis and management can lead to inappropriate catheterization and harm.

Objective

To develop an algorithm for screening and management of UR among adult inpatients.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this mixed-methods study using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and qualitative interviews, an 11-member multidisciplinary expert panel of nurses and physicians from across the US used a formal multi-round process from March to May 2015 to rate 107 clinical scenarios involving diagnosis and management of adult UR in postoperative and medical inpatients. The panel ratings informed the first algorithm draft. Semistructured interviews were conducted from October 2020 to May 2021 with 33 frontline clinicians-nurses and surgeons from 5 Michigan hospitals-to gather feedback and inform algorithm refinements.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Panelists categorized scenarios assessing when to use bladder scanners, catheterization at various scanned bladder volumes, and choice of catheterization modalities as appropriate, inappropriate, or uncertain. Next, qualitative methods were used to understand the perceived need, usability, and potential algorithm uses.

Results

The 11-member expert panel (10 men and 1 woman) used the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method to develop a UR algorithm including the following: (1) bladder scanners were preferred over catheterization for UR diagnosis in symptomatic patients or starting as soon as 3 hours since last void if asymptomatic, (2) bladder scanner volumes appropriate to prompt catheterization were 300 mL or greater in symptomatic patients and 500 mL or greater in asymptomatic patients, and (3) intermittent was preferred to indwelling catheterization for managing lower bladder volumes. Interview findings were organized into 3 domains (perceived need, feedback on algorithm, and implementation suggestions). The 33 frontline clinicians (9 men and 24 women) who reviewed the algorithm reported that an evidence-based protocol (1) was needed and could be helpful to clinicians, (2) should be simple and graphically appealing to improve rapid clinician review, and (3) should be integrated within the electronic medical record and prominently displayed in hospital units to increase awareness. The draft algorithm was iteratively refined based on stakeholder feedback.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study using a systematic, multidisciplinary, evidence- and expert opinion-based approach, a UR evaluation and catheterization algorithm was developed to improve patient safety by increasing appropriate use of bladder scanners and catheterization. This algorithm addresses the need for practical guidance to manage UR among adult inpatients.

### Evaluation and treatment of acute urinary retention [^113y5wnM]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute urinary retention is a common presentation to the Emergency Department and is often simply treated with placement of a Foley catheter. However, various cases will arise when this will not remedy the retention and more aggressive measures will be needed, particularly if emergent urological consultation is not available. This article will review the causes of urinary obstruction and systematically review emergent techniques and procedures used to treat this condition.

### Urinary retention evaluation and catheterization algorithm for adult inpatients [^113oiZzU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Future efforts could examine whether algorithms such as the URECA can minimize the harms of untreated UR and unnecessary urinary catheterization or whether unintended consequences arise from algorithm implementation. The algorithm was recently implemented in the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative as a tool in the 2023 SUCCESS quality improvement initiative in multiple participating Michigan hospitals to assess diagnosis and management of UR, measure patient outcomes regarding harms related to urinary catheter use, and provide qualitative data regarding implementation and feedback regarding the tool's usability.

Limitations

There are several caveats and limitations to this study. First, the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method panel included only 11 members, though this aligns with the formal methodsand we sampled panelists from a range of institutions and practice types across the US to capture diverse perspectives. We also included urologists who regularly manage complex UR in addition to practitioners with general medical backgrounds. Second, although we systematically assessed the relevant literature, the evidence was not of optimal quality, lacking randomized clinical trials to guide appropriateness ratings. Since the literature indicates that most inpatient catheters are placed due to surgery, the qualitative critique of the algorithm focused on patients at risk for postoperative UR. Therefore, some of the practitioners interviewed had less expertise in the management of nonsurgical patients and the algorithm may not be optimized for the general medical population. Third, the panel and the URECA focused decision-making based on postvoid residual volumes and did not consider voided volumes or calculations of voiding efficiency, which can be relevant in patients with low bladder capacities. Future algorithm iterations could be adapted to include these parameters.

Feedback on Algorithm

Participants wanted a short, clear algorithm that was easy to follow. They found that the visual aspects (ie, use of arrows, boxes, and color coding) were appealing and aided quick navigation. Participants stressed the importance of limiting the amount of text:

I like how it's clear and it's color coded a little bit so it helps. There's not a lot on it so you can't get lost… it's self-explanatory. (Nurse No. 126)

Additionally, participants liked that the algorithm prioritized patient factors, such as symptom assessment. They agreed with including language to clearly direct clinicians to begin with using ISC prior to reinserting an IUC when patients needed additional catheterization.

The most frequent critique of the earliest draft algorithm was its use of numerical ranges of urinary output (eg, 100–500 mL). Participants preferred having specific cutoff volumes (eg, 300 mL) with specific steps to take at each cutoff. Recommended changes included switching the algorithm from landscape to portrait orientation; adding specific action points, including when to call the surgeon or urologist; and adding patient-specific criteria (eg, men aged > 55 years, patients with spinal cord injuries). Suggestions from frontline clinicians were iteratively incorporated into the final URECA (Figure and eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

Figure.
Final Evaluation and Catheterization Algorithm to Manage Urinary Retention Among Inpatients

The algorithm is intended for the inpatient setting. Cutoffs were determined based on a combination of literature review, expert opinion, and local practice patterns. Of note, use of external catheters to treat urinary retention is inappropriate as external catheters only collect spontaneously voided urine. ISC indicates intermittent straight catheter.

a Consider checking sooner if the patient is receiving high volumes of intravenous fluid or diuretics.

b Other common causes of these urinary symptoms include urinary tract infection, overactive bladder, small bladder capacity, or recent catheterization. Consider contacting attending physician for further evaluation.

c Evaluate the patient's fluid intake and consider increasing fluids. Call attending physician if urine output is less than 35 mL per hour, raising concern for oliguria from hypovolemia or acute kidney injury.

### Urinary retention evaluation and catheterization algorithm for adult inpatients [^111VR729]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

We assembled draft 1 of the URECA (eFigure 2 in Supplement 1) using results from the panel. The research team felt this draft had limited clinical utility since the flowsheet included large ranges of appropriateness and no guidance was offered for scenarios rated as uncertain appropriateness. Therefore, we revised the protocol by selecting cutoffs consistent with clinical practice at our institution that were within the ranges of acceptability according to the panel (draft 2 in eFigure 2 in Supplement 1). We next solicited informal expert feedback on draft 2 from 2 multidisciplinary groups, including the Surgical Urinary Catheter Care Enhancement Safety Study (SUCCESS)stakeholder committee and the Patient Safety Enhancement Program from the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Healthcare System. These groups included experts in urinary catheter use, complication prevention, clinical education, and communication. Feedback included that the algorithm needed to be easier to read quickly by clinicians, needed to be adapted for use by nurses caring for both postoperative and medical patients, and would benefit from broader qualitative evaluation.

### Urinary retention [^1175ER3a]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary retention is a common problem encountered in the emergency department. Acute urinary retention (AUR) presents as a sudden inability to voluntarily void, and is typically associated with lower abdominal pain. Its etiology can be varied and multifactorial. Treatment of AUR aims to relieve the obstruction and mitigate the underlying cause of retention. This can generally be accomplished in the emergency department without immediate urologic consultation; however, certain clinical features may require specialist involvement. This article provides an overview of the common causes of urinary retention, as well as emergency department evaluation, treatment, and disposition of patients with acute retention.

Methods

In this mixed-methods study, we applied a multimethod approach, illustrated in eFigure 1 in Supplement 1. The qualitative portion of this study was approved by the institutional review board at the University of Michigan Medical School, and oral informed consent was obtained. Panelists and interviewees were compensated for their time. This study followed the Accurate Consensus Reporting Document guidelines for reporting consensus methods in biomedicine.

RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method

We developed guidance for algorithm development using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Our group previously used this approach to define appropriateness of urinary catheterization in hospitalized medical and postoperative general, urologic, and orthopedic surgery patients. Our group's prior articles, include detailed methods and documentation of the rating process. These methods combine scientific evidence with clinical judgment from multidisciplinary and multispecialty content experts to produce guidance regarding a procedure's appropriateness while addressing both patient symptoms and clinical context. It has been used to define appropriate care and design quality indicators in various fields, and provides useful clinical guidance when insufficient high-level evidence is available.

Literature Review

The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method begins by identifying published literature and categorizing it by relevance and level of evidence. Between September 2014 and February 2015, we searched relevant databases (ie, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed/MEDLINE) for studies assessing bladder scanner technology, algorithms as part of UR interventions, and literature reviews involving bladder scanners. We identified and reviewed 50 unique articles meeting abstract, title, and keyword criteria, and based on content review, we narrowed the list to 26 articles (listed in eTable 1 in Supplement 1) to provide to panelists. We also developed clinical scenarios based on the literature review and piloted them with colleagues from the Patient Safety Enhancement Program at the University of Michigan and the Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Healthcare System, along with local urogynecologists.

### Urinary retention in adults: evaluation and initial management [^113fEFms]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is the acute or chronic inability to voluntarily pass an adequate amount of urine. The condition predominantly affects men. The most common causes are obstructive in nature, with benign prostatic hyperplasia accounting for 53% of cases. Infectious, inflammatory, iatrogenic, and neurologic causes can also affect urinary retention. Initial evaluation should involve a detailed history that includes information about current prescription medications and use of over-the-counter medications and herbal supplements. A focused physical examination with neurologic evaluation should be performed, and diagnostic testing should include measurement of postvoid residual (PVR) volume of urine. There is no consensus regarding a PVR-based definition for acute urinary retention; the American Urological Association recommends that chronic urinary retention be defined as PVR volume greater than 300 mL measured on two separate occasions and persisting for at least six months. Initial management of urinary retention involves assessment of urethral patency with prompt and complete bladder decompression by catheterization. Suprapubic catheters improve patient comfort and decrease bacteriuria and the need for recatheterization in the short term; silver alloy-coated and antibiotic-impregnated catheters offer clinically insignificant or no benefit. Further management is decided by determining the cause and chronicity of the urinary retention and can include initiation of alpha blockers with voiding trials. Patients with urinary retention related to an underlying neurologic cause should be monitored in conjunction with neurology and urology subspecialists.

Perceived Need

Participants reported the need for an evidence-based retention algorithm in their hospital:

We found out that this is a big gap in our nursing care and we can help fill this void by establishing this protocol… and [nursing] staff like algorithms like this, they're so easy for them to follow. (Nurse No. 113)

Furthermore, clinicians noted that postoperative UR management, including decisions regarding when to reinsert IUCs, varied considerably between units and among surgeons and that a written, evidence-based algorithm could provide consistency between units and a systematic approach to decision-making:

There are some surgeons who, a patient retains once, they will never get their Foley out. There are others who will just keep trying. It's all over the map. I agree. It should be streamlined. (Surgeon No. 130)

Interviewees reported that an algorithm would most help clinicians who are in training (eg, residents and interns) or new to their hospital. Participants felt that these algorithms would be used and appreciated most by nurses and that physicians may be more resistant to following algorithms.

Qualitative Methods to Refine the URECA

To better understand the need for and potential uses of the URECA and to solicit feedback to refine our draft algorithm, we conducted qualitative interviews with clinicians who diagnosed and managed adult postoperative UR. Interviews were part of a larger study, SUCCESS, aimed at improving safe and appropriate use of urinary catheters in surgical patients. Purposive sampling was used to include a subset of hospitals from the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborativethat varied in size, geographic location, and health system. Champions of the Michigan Surgical Quality Collaborative at each of these hospitals helped identify individuals with varied roles to interview. A total of 37 individuals agreed to be interviewed, but due to scheduling constraints, only 33 participated. Interviews took place between October 2020 and May 2021 and were conducted via videoconferencing software. We used a pilot-tested, semistructured, role-specific interview guide. The questions most relevant to this study are listed in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.

Interviews were conducted sequentially, with revisions made to the proposed algorithm after each interview based on feedback. The next interviewee would be given the updated algorithm to review. Interviews were led by a trained qualitative interviewer and clinician expert (M.Q. S.H. J.M.) and were audiorecorded, transcribed, and verified for accuracy. We used a rapid analysis approach, to quickly integrate stakeholder feedback into the algorithm. Two team members (M.Q. J. A.) constructed a template reflecting key domains of interest (ie, perceived need for an algorithm; feedback on the current algorithm, including likes, dislikes, and suggestions for improvement; and implementation suggestions). They both read the same transcript and summarized data for each domain, including supporting quotes. Next, they compared templates, discussed discrepancies, attained consensus, and revised the template accordingly. They repeated this process with 2 more transcripts to ensure that the template was comprehensive. They then reviewed the remaining transcripts, with 1 team member conducting a primary review and the other doing a secondary review to ensure that all data were consistently and accurately captured. Once all templates were complete, we reviewed each domain for main findings and summarized with supporting quotes.

RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method

Diagnosing UR

The expert 11-member panel (10 men and 1 woman) reviewed and discussed the 107 clinical scenarios. Table 1 and eTable 4 in Supplement 1 detail panel responses to the question of bladder scanning after urinary catheter removal in postoperative or medical patients (male or female) who have no urine output for varying lengths of time and with varying symptoms (eg, pain associated with the inability to void). The panel deemed it appropriate to evaluate any symptomatic patients using a bladder scanner. Conversely, using catheterization to evaluate symptomatic or asymptomatic patients was deemed to never be appropriate if a bladder scanner is available.

Appropriateness Ratings for Monitoring of Urinary Retention After Catheter Removal a

Abbreviations: ISC, intermittent straight catheter; IUC, indwelling urinary catheter.

When working without bladder scanners, panel members indicated the appropriateness of an intermittent straight catheter (ISC) or indwelling urinary catheter (IUC), which varied by symptom presence and time since last urine output (eTable 5 in Supplement 1). Panelists consistently recommended ISC sooner than IUC, and longer wait times were considered appropriate in asymptomatic patients compared with symptomatic patients. We noted more uncertainty among panel members for the scenarios without bladder scanners than those with bladder scanners.

Bladder Scanner Volumes to Catheterize

When bladder scanners are available, bladder volume can guide the need for treatment of UR (Table 2 and eTable 6 in Supplement 1). Panel members determined that treatment was appropriate at lower volumes for symptomatic retention than for asymptomatic retention and that in symptomatic patients, use of ISC was appropriate at lower volumes than was use of IUC. In asymptomatic patients with bladder volumes of 500 mL or greater, ISC or IUC was considered appropriate, while any catheterization was considered inappropriate for volumes less than 400 mL.

### The importance of a thorough clinical examination in adolescent girls presenting with acute urinary retention [^114XbX2T]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We present an adolescent girl with a 1-day history of acute urinary retention and lower abdominal pain. She was admitted to the paediatric ward for ongoing treatment and investigations. Due to a myriad of factors including pain and anxiety, challenges posed included an incomplete initial abdominal and external genital examination. This case report highlights the importance of a focused history and performing an appropriate sensitive examination at the time of presentation. Furthermore, we explore the common causes of new onset urinary retention and unravel the case as it unfolds. We also highlight differential diagnoses (however, uncommon), which must be considered and not overlooked to avoid unnecessary investigations and to ensure timely management.

### Urinary retention in adults: diagnosis and initial management [^1176KoYJ]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is the inability to voluntarily void urine. This condition can be acute or chronic. Causes of urinary retention are numerous and can be classified as obstructive, infectious and inflammatory, pharmacologic, neurologic, or other. The most common cause of urinary retention is benign prostatic hyperplasia. Other common causes include prostatitis, cystitis, urethritis, and vulvovaginitis; receiving medications in the anticholinergic and alphaadrenergic agonist classes; and cortical, spinal, or peripheral nerve lesions. Obstructive causes in women often involve the pelvic organs. A thorough history, physical examination, and selected diagnostic testing should determine the cause of urinary retention in most cases. Initial management includes bladder catheterization with prompt and complete decompression. Men with acute urinary retention from benign prostatic hyperplasia have an increased chance of returning to normal voiding if alpha blockers are started at the time of catheter insertion. Suprapubic catheterization may be superior to urethral catheterization for short-term management and silver alloy-impregnated urethral catheters have been shown to reduce urinary tract infection. Patients with chronic urinary retention from neurogenic bladder should be able to manage their condition with clean, intermittent self-catheterization; low-friction catheters have shown benefit in these patients. Definitive management of urinary retention will depend on the etiology and may include surgical and medical treatments.

### Acute urinary retention in elderly men [^11687oRT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Acute urinary retention is a urologic emergency that can affect elderly men. It requires prompt bladder decompression and identification of the underlying cause. Elderly patients with acute urinary retention often have associated fecal impaction, delirium, and constitutional symptoms. With increasing age, hospitalization for acute urinary retention may be necessary to treat precipitating events, whereas acute urinary retention itself might precipitate or exacerbate comorbid medical conditions, necessitating hospitalization. Multiple causative factors operate via 3 main mechanisms: obstructive, neurogenic, and detrusor underactivity. More than 1 mechanism might exist in a single patient. Definitive treatment must be individualized on the basis of the quality of life, life expectancy, caregiver support, and presence of other chronic medical conditions. Urology consultation may be needed for invasive diagnostic testing or management of refractory cases.

### Acute urinary retention and urinary incontinence [^116rNvej]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

AUR is a commonly seen genitourinary emergency. It has many etiologies, including obstructive, neurogenic, pharmacologic, and extraurinary causes. Treatment is immediate bladder decompression by transurethral catheterization and treatment of the provoking etiology. Urinary incontinence is less commonly seen as a presenting complaint in the ED. For the emergency physician, the key lies in recognizing its underlying cause. Neurologic and pharmacologic causes need to be considered in all patients. Urinary incontinence that is not caused by a neurologic emergency can be referred for further outpatient evaluation.

### Quality improvement initiative to reduce inappropriate urinary catheterisation on a clinical teaching unit [^115K6MHG]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

Indwelling urinary catheters are often inserted and retained without appropriate indications in the inpatient setting, leading to catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs). Previous multidisciplinary toolkits have created modest reductions in inappropriate catheterisation, but these effects were not sustained. This study aimed to achieve a 50% reduction in catheter-days and CAUTIs per 100 patient-days in a general medicine ward at a Canadian tertiary care hospital. A preintervention evaluation of urinary catheterisation was completed by retrospective chart review from 2020 to 2022. A quality improvement initiative was then conducted using an interrupted time series design. Patients admitted during the study period to general internal medicine on the pilot ward with an indwelling urinary catheter were included. A physician-targeted intervention in the electronic medical record system triggered reminders for patients with catheters inserted for more than 24 hours. The second intervention implemented standardised discussion of catheterised patients in daily multidisciplinary rounds. Finally, a chronic catheter order was created for patients with chronic indwelling catheters. Our outcome measures were the number of catheter-days and CAUTIs per 100 patient-days. Process measures were the utilisation of electronic reminder features and implementation of catheter review during multidisciplinary rounds. The balancing measure was the frequency of urinary catheter reinsertion following a failed trial of void. Catheter-days per 100 patient-days decreased from 14.2 to 5.8days postintervention. CAUTIs decreased from 0.47 to 0.31 CAUTI per 100 patient-days. On average, 80% of patients with catheters were reviewed monthly during multidisciplinary rounds. 24 patients required catheter reinsertion postintervention due to a failed trial of void. The implementation of a multifaceted approach on a general medicine ward consisting of physician reminders, standardised discussion of catheters in multidisciplinary rounds and chronic catheter orders was associated with a sustained reduction in catheter use and CAUTIs.

AUGS defines CCSs as statements based on expert opinion using an explicit Delphi methodology, and for this document the group used a modified Delphi process that included a Stage 1 literature search to determine existing guidelines, define scope, and formulate topic questions. The Stage 1 search was completed on December 21, 2020, was limited to systematic reviews, meta-analyses, practice guidelines, and white papers published in English, and included sources such as the Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute EBP Database, TripDatabase.com, PubMed, and Embase. The search yielded 24 potentially relevant references, and the group identified 6 generalized topic areas: incidence of POUR, medications, patient factors, surgical factors, urodynamic studies, and VT.

### Acute urinary retention and risk of cancer: population based Danish cohort study [^113WkvMi]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and weaknesses of this study

We used data from the Danish health registries, which are prospectively collected and have virtually complete follow-up. Owing to the completeness of the Danish Cancer Registry, we expect to have captured virtually all cancer diagnoses. The data quality of the registries used in our study is generally high; the positive predictive value of acute urinary retention in men in the Danish National Patient Registry is 98% (95% confidence interval 93% to 99%). Although the diagnosis of acute urinary retention has not been validated specifically in women, we also expected a high positive predictive value among women. A concern is that we might not have captured all patients admitted to hospital with acute urinary retention, as those with an obvious underlying cause might have received a diagnosis code only for that condition. Our cohort is, however, likely to be complete for patients with no obvious cause of acute urinary retention after initial investigations. Also, we included only patients with a hospital (inpatient, outpatient, or emergency department) diagnosis. Although current guidelines recommend referral to a specialist for all patients presenting with acute urinary retention and residual urine > 100 mL, general practitioners might have treated patients with an obvious benign underlying cause without hospital referral. Consequently, patients treated by general practitioners might have a lower risk of cancer than patients with a hospital referral. Patients with acute urinary retention are in closer contact with the hospital system than people in the general population, therefore increased diagnostic attention could potentially explain at least some of the excess risk of cancer diagnoses. The short term increased risk of colorectal cancer is thus probably explained by enhanced diagnostic investigations (for example, digital rectal examination and detection of anaemia). If the increase exclusively occurred as a result of more intense medical attention though, we would expect a compensatory decrease in cancer occurrence after this increase. The one to five year standardised incidence ratios did not support such a compensatory decrease. However, if some of the patients with acute urinary retention were not evaluated by a cancer specialist during follow-up, we might have missed some cancers. Still, missed cancers also occur in the general population and we therefore expect such potential bias to be negligible.

### Urinary retention in surgical patients [^112d51ts]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is an important and potentially avoidable postoperative complication. Identifying risk factors for retention is important given expedient bladder decompression is important for long-term outcomes. Age, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and lower urinary tract symptoms are patient factors that predispose to retention. Surgery-related factors include operative time, intravenous fluid administration, type of anesthesia, and procedure type. The mainstay for treatment in the acute setting is Foley catheter placement. Starting alpha-blockers in men is also indicated as they increase voiding trial success. Long-term solutions for chronic retention include a variety of surgeries, with transurethral prostatectomy as the gold standard.

Aims

The management of acute urinary retention (AUR) revolves around trial without catheter (TWOC) after prescription of an alpha-blocker. This study evaluates the implementation of a clinical pathway for AUR.

Methods

Specific clinical pathways for AUR was established between the Emergency Department and the Department of Urology in order to reduce the duration of bladder drainage that included standard prescriptions, an information sheet, and a note to be faxed to scheduling nurses to organize the trial without catheter (TWOC). The main endpoint was the reduction in the time between the AUR episode and TWOC, without decreasing urination.

Results

Between April 2015 and December 2016, 248 patients were treated in the Emergency Department, and externally, for AUR. One hundred and seventy patients were enrolled in the pathway group and 78 in the control group. The mean duration of urinary catheterization decreased by 5.5 days as did the number of patients lost to follow-up (32% vs 76%), without decreasing the successful voiding (46% vs 36%). The duration of the urinary catheterization was not related to the chance of successful voiding regardless of the urine volume and a drainage time of over 10 days significantly reduced the chance of success (68%, n = 26 versus 42%, n = 76; P = 0.0038).

Conclusion

The implementation of a clinical pathway for AUR reduced the number of patients lost to follow-up and the catheterization duration, thus optimizing the management of these patients.

### Urinary retention in children [^111b6hng]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the causes and outcome of urinary retention in children and assess its prevalence by gender and age.

Methods

The medical records of all children (aged < 18 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute urinary retention from 2000 to 2012 were reviewed. Patients with postoperative urinary retention, a known neurologic disorder, and neonates were excluded. Data were collected on patient demographics and cause, treatment, and outcome of the urinary retention. Findings were evaluated and compared by age and gender.

Results

The study group comprised 42 boys (75%) and 14 girls (25%). Median follow-up time was 25 months. Causes of urinary retention were mechanical obstruction in 14 patients (25%), infection or inflammation in 10 (18%), fecal impaction in 7 (13%), neurologic disorders in 6 (11%), gynecologic disorders in 4 (7%), and behavioral processes in 3 patients (5%); 12 patients (21%) were idiopathic. All patients with mechanical obstruction were boys, of whom 5 had a pelvic tumor. Age distribution was bimodal: 29% of the events occurred between ages 3 and 5 years, and 32%, between ages 10 and 13 years. Fifteen children underwent surgery. Three children required continuous catheterization during follow-up.

Conclusion

Urinary retention in children is characterized by a variable etiology and bimodal age distribution. The high rate of severe underlying disease is noteworthy and should alert physicians to the importance of a prompt, comprehensive, primary evaluation of this patient population in a hospital setting to initiate appropriate treatment and avoid complications.

In reconstructive surgery for pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence, the incidence ranges from 15% to 45%. The authors note that in the urologic literature there are no specific guidelines for POUR in women, and that without appropriate treatment POUR can lead to postoperative morbidity including urinary tract infection, detrusor dysfunction, overflow incontinence, and, in severe cases, renal dysfunction.

### Urinary retention in a general rehabilitation unit: prevalence, clinical outcome, and the role of screening [^1132aP7D]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To document the prevalence of, risk factors for, and outcomes of, urinary retention (UR).

Design

Prospective observational study.

Setting

A subacute general (predominantly geriatric) rehabilitation unit.

Participants

Three hundred nineteen consecutive patients (196 women, 123 men).

Interventions

Twenty-two patients were catheterized for acute UR in the acute facility prior to transfer to rehabilitation. Patients admitted without catheters (n = 297) had their postvoid residual (PVR) volumes assessed via a bladder scanner within 72 hours of admission.

Main Outcome Measure

PVR volumes of 150 mL or more were considered abnormal.

Results

PVR volumes in the 297 "asymptomatic" patients were 150 mL or more in 64 (21.5%) patients. The risk of UR was greatest among male patients who had lower admission FIM instrument scores, neurologic disorders (eg, stroke or multiple sclerosis), cognitive impairment, urinary incontinence, a history of previous prostate, bladder, or voiding problems, were taking anticholinergic medications, or were immobile. Patients with UR were significantly more likely to have a urinary tract infection at admission, have urinary incontinence on discharge, and to be discharged with referrals for community services for personal care or to residential care. Although patients with UR on admission had a lower discharge FIM score, they generally showed a greater degree of improvement in their FIM scores during their stay.

Conclusions

Clinically unsuspected UR is common in patients admitted to a general rehabilitation unit. We recommend that all patients be screened for PVR on admission as an aid in bladder management.

Clinicians may obtain a post-void residual in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to exclude incomplete emptying or urinary retention, especially in patients with concomitant voiding or emptying symptoms. Clinicians may obtain a symptom questionnaire and/or a voiding diary in patients with symptoms suggestive of OAB to assist in the diagnosis of OAB, exclude other disorders, ascertain the degree of bother, and/or evaluate treatment response. Clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB. Clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. Clinicians should assess for comorbid conditions in patients with OAB that may contribute to urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urgency urinary incontinence and should educate patients on the role that managing these conditions can have on bladder symptoms. Clinicians may use telemedicine for follow-up visits with patients with OAB.

### Assessment of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms where an undiagnosed neurological disease is suspected: a report from an international continence society consensus working group [^116MMpCv]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are a common urological referral, which sometimes can have a neurological basis in a patient with no formally diagnosed neurological disease ("occult neurology"). Early identification and specialist input is needed to avoid bad LUTS outcomes, and to initiate suitable neurological management.

Methods

The International Continence Society established a neurological working group to consider: Which neurological conditions may include LUTS as an early feature? What diagnostic evaluations should be undertaken in the LUTS clinic? A shortlist of conditions was drawn up by expert consensus and discussed at the annual congress of the International Neurourology Society. A multidisciplinary working group then generated recommendations for identifying clinical features and management.

Results

The relevant conditions are multiple sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, early dementia, Parkinsonian syndromes (including early Parkinson's Disease and Multiple System Atrophy) and spinal cord disorders (including spina bifida occulta with tethered cord, and spinal stenosis). In LUTS clinics, the need is to identify additional atypical features; new onset severe LUTS (excluding infection), unusual aspects (eg, enuresis without chronic retention) or "suspicious" symptoms (eg, numbness, weakness, speech disturbance, gait disturbance, memory loss/cognitive impairment, and autonomic symptoms). Where occult neurology is suspected, healthcare professionals need to undertake early appropriate referral; central nervous system imaging booked from LUTS clinic is not recommended.

Conclusions

Occult neurology is an uncommon underlying cause of LUTS, but it is essential to intervene promptly if suspected, and to establish suitable management pathways.

### Postoperative urinary retention: anesthetic and perioperative considerations [^116fLojW]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is common after anesthesia and surgery, reported incidence of between 5% and 70%. Comorbidities, type of surgery, and type of anesthesia influence the development of postoperative urinary retention (POUR). The authors review the overall incidence and mechanisms of POUR associated with surgery, anesthesia and analgesia. Ultrasound has been shown to provide an accurate assessment of urinary bladder volume and a guide to the management of POUR. Recommendations for urinary catheterization in the perioperative setting vary widely, influenced by many factors, including surgical factors, type of anesthesia, comorbidities, local policies, and personal preferences. Inappropriate management of POUR may be responsible for bladder overdistension, urinary tract infection, and catheter-related complications. An evidence-based approach to prevention and management of POUR during the perioperative period is proposed.

Our study has several strengths and limitations. Strengths include access to prospectively collected population‐based data in a country with universal health care. The positive predictive value of diagnoses and surgical procedure codes in the DNPR are generally high, and the positive predictive value is 98% for AUR, 95% for BPH and 98% for the diagnoses used for the CCI. A potential limitation is that we only included patients with a hospital diagnosis (i.e. inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room hospital contacts) of AUR, thus patients treated at general practitioners without referral to hospital, were not included. However, national guidelines recommend referral to hospital for evaluation by a urologist of all men presenting with AUR and residual urine > 100 ml. We therefore expect the proportion of men treated solely at general practitioners to be relatively low. These patients may be patients with advanced disease making hospital referral and further evaluation futile. However, we do not expect this to substantially influence our time trends in incidence, subsequent BPH‐related treatment and mortality. Another limitation is that cause of deaths were based on a subjective clinical judgment rather than autopsy, and may consequently not be entirely accurate. Still, we do not expect such misclassification to explain the excess mortality that we observed for specific causes of death.

### Geriatric emergency department guidelines [^114RVT38]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Geriatric emergency department guidelines — indwelling urinary catheter indications and discontinuation specify that "The patient must have an indication for use of an indwelling catheter and a physician order in the chart", and "After receiving a physician order with the appropriate indications documented, nursing will insert the indwelling catheter as per protocol, using sterile technique". Indications include "Urinary retention/obstruction", "Very close monitoring of urine output and patient unable to use urinal or bedpan", "Open wound in sacral or perineal area with urinary incontinence", "Patient too ill, fatigued or incapacitated to use alternative urine collection method", "Patient s/p recent surgery", "Management of urinary incontinence on patient's request", and "Other – needs specification and clarification documented"; other acceptable indications also include "Neurogenic bladder", "Emergent pelvic ultrasound", "Emergent surgery", "Altered mental status or unresponsive", "Urologic procedures", "Hip fracture", and "Hospice or palliative care". For discontinuation, "Indwelling catheters will be removed as soon as feasibly possible", and because "Evidence shows that catheter associated bacteriuria increases and is directly associated with catheter days", "daily catheter rounds should prompt for continued use or removal of indwelling catheters".

### Pediatric urinary retention in the emergency department: a Concerning symptom with etiology outside the bladder [^113T13GH]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary retention in an otherwise healthy adolescent is a concerning symptom, in which etiology can range from an extracystic mass to central nervous system involvement (CNS). One possibility is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a rare inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects the CNS via demyelination. The disease usually is preceded by an acute viral infection, and commonly presents with multifocal neurological deficits. The diagnosis for ADEM is made based on clinical presentation, correlating with findings characterized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the CNS.

Case Report

Our case involves a 16-year-old boy who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with urinary retention. The patient was an otherwise healthy adolescent who was experiencing intermittent fevers for 1 week, and was found to be monospot positive when seen by his pediatrician. When presenting to the ED, the patient's primary complaint was urinary retention, which he experienced acutely in the middle of the night. Due to the suspicious nature of the patient's symptoms and history of present illness, the patient received a thorough workup including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain and spinal cord, which demonstrated findings consistent with ADEM. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? There is very little literature describing a case of ADEM in the ED where the primary manifesting symptom was urinary retention. In addition, it is important that clinicians address acute urinary retention in an otherwise healthy adolescent as a red flag, with the need to rule out concerning etiology.

### Acute urinary retention in children [^114rDqqZ]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute urinary retention is relatively infrequent in children. There are a variety of causes that are poorly defined in the literature, and they differ greatly from those seen most frequently in adults. We review our experience with pediatric patients presenting with urinary retention to 2 major metropolitan children's hospitals.

Materials and Methods

Records from Egleston and Scottish Rite Hospitals for Children were reviewed for a 6-year period for the diagnosis of urinary retention. Urinary retention was defined as inability to empty the bladder volitionally for greater than 12 hours with a volume of urine greater than expected for age ([age in years + 2] x 30 cc) or a palpably distended bladder. All cases resulting postoperatively and believed secondary to surgical dissection, narcotic use or immobility, and children previously diagnosed with chronic neurological disorders and voiding dysfunction or with reduced mental status were excluded from study. The majority of these encounters were emergency department visits specifically for acute urinary retention.

Results

We identified 53 children meeting these criteria, including 37 boys 6 months to 17 years old and 16 girls 1 to 17 years old. Etiologies included neurological processes in 17%, severe voiding dysfunction in 15%, urinary tract infection in 13%, constipation in 13%, adverse drug effect in 13%, local inflammatory causes in 7%, locally invading neoplasms in 6%, benign obstructing lesions in 6%, idiopathic in 6%, combined urinary tract infection and constipation in 2%, and incarcerated inguinal hernia in 2% of cases. Adverse drug effects and dysfunctional voiding were implicated 3 times as often in males than females (16% versus 6% and 19% versus 6%, respectively). Urinary tract infections were 6 times more common in females (31% versus 5%). Constipation and local inflammatory processes were twice as common in females than males (19% versus 11% and 12% versus 5%, respectively). Local neoplasms, benign obstruction and idiopathic causes were found exclusively in males.

Conclusions

Urinary retention in children is a relatively rare entity but there is a significant incidence of neurological abnormalities in this population. If a clear reason for this condition cannot be delineated based on history, physical examination and laboratory assessment, these patients should undergo prompt neurological evaluation and appropriate imaging studies.

### Postpartum urinary retention: an expert review [^116tgRSW]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Postpartum urinary retention is a relatively common condition that can have a marked impact on women in the immediate days following childbirth. If left untreated, postpartum urinary retention can lead to repetitive overdistention injury that may damage the detrusor muscle and the parasympathetic nerve fibers within the bladder wall. In rare circumstances, postpartum urinary retention may even lead to bladder rupture, which is a potentially life-threatening yet entirely preventable complication. Early diagnosis and timely intervention are necessary to decrease long-term consequences. There are 3 types of postpartum urinary retention: overt, covert, and persistent. Overt retention is associated with an inability to void, whereas covert retention is associated with incomplete bladder emptying. Persistent urinary retention continues beyond the third postpartum day and can persist for several weeks in rare cases. Recognition of risk factors and prompt diagnosis are important for proper management and prevention of negative sequelae. However, lack of knowledge by providers and patients alike creates barriers to accessing and receiving evidence-based care, and may further delay diagnosis for patients, especially those who experience covert postpartum urinary retention. Nationally accepted definitions and management algorithms for postpartum urinary retention are lacking, and development of such guidelines is essential for both patient care and research design. We propose intrapartum recommendations and a standardized postpartum bladder management protocol that will improve patient outcomes and contribute to the growing body of evidence-based practice in this field.

### Reducing CAUTI in patients with acute urinary retention in the critical care setting: a pilot study with electronic medical record analytics [^112iDaSi]. American Journal of Infection Control (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This study implemented and evaluated an algorithm protocol for management of indwelling urinary catheters (IUCs) among patients treated for acute urinary retention (AUR) in an intensive care unit. The algorithm protocol (1) instituted in and out catheterization before placing an IUC for retention; (2) encouraged more consistent use of medications for AUR; and (3) provided for prompt removal of IUCs placed for AUR.

Methods

An uncontrolled pre- and post-test intervention approach was used to assess the impact of the algorithm on the treatment of AUR. Bivariate and multivariate analyses assessed data collected using 2 approaches: (1) electronic extracts from the electronic medical record (EMR) vs (2) manual chart reviews.

Results

Findings suggest that the intervention decreased indwelling IUC days by 1.93 average days and increased medication prescription rates. An EMR extract identified fewer catheters per patient pre-intervention than a manual chart review, but otherwise the differences observed in the EMR extract and manual chart review were insignificant.

Conclusions

Implications for practitioners and administrators are that the algorithm protocol may reduce CAUTI risk and - provided consistent EMR documentation - EMR extracts may represent an efficient and effective approach for monitoring data when spreading the intervention.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^116TasJD]. DoD/VA (2022). High credibility.

VA/DoD Low Back Pain — red flags evaluation and recommendation: The Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low for detection of serious spinal pathologies by history/symptoms or physical examination, but given the high likelihood of catastrophic harms from a failure to identify a serious underlying condition and that the life-preserving benefits of conducting a history and physical examination to identify red flags outweigh very small potential harms, it determined a Strong recommendation is warranted and decided upon a Strong for recommendation, noting that conducting a history and physical examination including assessment of neurological deficits and red flags is generally feasible and accepted. Supporting risk data indicate that the presence of multiple red flags increases the probability of fracture to between 42% and 90%, and that urinary retention signals higher risk of cauda equina syndrome (CES), which has an estimated prevalence of 0.04% among patients presenting with LBP, whereas in patients without urinary retention, the probability of CES was approximately 0.01%.

### A novel intervention to reduce noninfectious and infectious complications associated with indwelling urethral catheters in hospitalized older patients: a quasi-experimental study [^111tMbtJ]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, face-to-face interviews were conducted to understand the first-line nurses' considerations in implementing this intervention in clinical practice, and the content of the intervention was refined according to their thoughts and feelings at the beginning of the study. The final version of the flow diagram is shown in Fig. 1. Hospitalized older patients with urethral catheters will be followed up by nurses to evaluate the appropriateness of use every day. The indication for appropriate use of urethral catheters included medication instillation or bladder irrigation; dysuria due to bladder outlet obstruction without better solutions; urinary retention ≥ 400 cc without better solutions; close monitoring of urine output in critically ill patients; perioperative management; open sacral or perineal wounds with a need for urinary diversion in incontinent patients; and special needs, including the considerations of medical members and needs in the physiological, psychological, and social domains among hospitalized older patients. If a urethral catheter is no longer necessary, the clinician would need to address the high risks of reinsertion before attempting to remove it. The risk factors for urine retention include obstruction of the bladder, urinary tract infection, urinary tract trauma, drug induction, neuropathy, and external factors. If risk factors for urine retention are eliminated, the physician should be reminded to remove the catheter. After catheter removal, strategies to promote self-voiding include establishing a urination schedule, encouraging patients to regularly urinate every 2 to 4 h, monitoring water intake, selecting the Valsalva manoeuvre or Crede's method, and creating a voiding diary. If older patients have self-voiding within 8 h after removal, the volume of urine needs to be recorded, and the residual urine needs to be measured by bladder scanning or intermittent catheterization to assess the residual urine and the ratio of self-voiding.

Flow diagram of a novel intervention. Note: 1. Record the urine volume and reason for urethral catheter insertion. 2. Apply intermittent catheterization (IC) Q12H when the first-time postvoid residual volume (PVR) is 100–200 ml; IC Q8H, when the PVR is 200–300 ml; and IC Q6H, when the PVR is > 300 ml. Successful removal of the catheter is defined as PVR ≤ 100 mL or a ratio of the actual void volume to the postvoid residual volume of > 2:1

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^114EFmVF]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Neurogenic Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction — In NLUTD patients who spontaneously void, clinicians must discuss the specific risks of urinary retention and the potential need for intermittent catheterization prior to selecting botulinum toxin therapy. (Clinical Principle). One of the most common adverse effects after onabotulinumtoxinA is incomplete bladder emptying/urinary retention that may require catheterization; single-injection RCTs report urinary retention rates of 2.6–54% with onabotulinumtoxinA versus 1.9–5.0% with placebo, and a meta-analysis found OR = 6.80; 95% CI: 3.46 to 13.35; p < 0.05. In multiple sclerosis patients not catheterizing at baseline, urinary retention increased with dose, at 31.4% and 47.1% in the onabotulinumtoxinA 200 U and 300 U groups versus 4.5% with placebo; nearly half used clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) for ≤ 36 weeks and the other half for ≥ 36 weeks. With repeated treatments, de novo CIC rates dropped to 29.5%, 3.4%, and 6.0% across treatment cycles 1–3 and were higher with 300 U (43.0, 15.0, and 4.8% in cycles 1–3). In non-catheterized multiple sclerosis patients randomized to 100 U onabotulinumtoxinA or placebo, CIC due to urinary retention occurred in 15.2% versus 2.6% with median duration 64.0 and 2.0 days, respectively. Patients must be counseled regarding the risk of requiring CIC (or possibly an indwelling catheter, if not able to perform CIC) for up to several weeks to months after the procedure, and clinicians should be cognizant that CIC may be challenging for some NLUTD patients, in which case there should be an appropriately trained caregiver to perform catheterization.

### Postoperative urinary retention [^111ds9ro]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) management and delayed POUR — patient/provider preferences, conservative strategies, and observed risks are summarized as follows: Preference for bladder drainage method is varied, with evidence that patients prefer suprapubic catheterization, urogynecology surgeons prefer transurethral indwelling catheters or intermittent self-catheterization, and in-hospital nurses prefer transurethral indwelling catheters. The conservative management of POUR after MUS includes continuous bladder drainage or intermittent catheterization, and most studies include small numbers and are descriptive; studies of postoperative mobilization or loosening of the MUS report high rates of POUR resolution but persistence of irritative voiding symptoms and recurrence of SUI. Delayed POUR, where a patient initially passes a VT then later presents in retention, is described as uncommon; in a case-control study after POP and/or SUI surgery, voided volume on VT was the only factor associated with delayed POUR, the median time to resolution after diagnosis was 7 days, and there was a high prevalence (74.5%) of UTI at catheter removal; the authors concluded that standard testing for UTI should be considered in all patients that present with delayed POUR.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^113Qt2ge]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

OnabotulinumtoxinA for neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) with spinal cord injury (SCI) or multiple sclerosis (MS) — In NLUTD patients with spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis refractory to oral medications, clinicians should recommend onabotulinumtoxinA to improve bladder storage parameters, decrease episodes of incontinence, and improve quality of life measures. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A). Based upon high-quality systematic reviews and RCTs with placebo-control groups and adequate sample sizes, the body of evidence supports the use of onabotulinumtoxinA to manage NDO in SCI or MS with Grade A evidence for both initial and repeated injections; a single set of intradetrusor injections reduces UTI episodes, increases MCC, and decreases MDP versus placebo, there are no differences in efficacy between the 200 U and 300 U dose, the most frequently reported AEs are UTI and urinary retention including initiation of CIC in some, and repeated series restore the improvements experienced with the first set of injections.

### Incidence, outcomes, and prediction of postoperative urinary retention after a nonurologic procedure [^112JDATN]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

This is a large study to analyze the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of urinary retention after LLA. This has led to many important conclusions. Importantly, the statistical weight of what we established as risk factors was revealed. Most of these outcomes are inherently related to patient characteristics and not the intraoperative or postoperative course. Finally, the nature of this problem is transient in most patients and does not require immediate surgical intervention. Collectively, we think that the results of this study will provide a more objective tool to counsel patients and to plan prophylactic measures to prevent the occurrence of this adverse outcome.

### Urinary retention can be the sole initial manifestation of acute myelitis [^115dFaGH]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Urinary retention is a frequent feature in patients with acute myelitis (AM). We here describe the result of a survey of 32 consecutive AM patients as to what extent of AM patients initially present with micturition disturbance. Among those, 3 patients (9%) were shown to have urinary retention as the initial sole manifestation, which was followed by dysesthesia of foot in 3 and leg weakness in 1; and the average interval between micturition disturbance and these second-appearing symptoms/signs was 11 days (8–15 days). Although initial presentation of urinary retention was not common, occurring in only 9% of all the AM patients, clinically it has relevance because patients who suffer urinary retention but have no obvious neurological symptoms may first see general physicians or urologists. In those patients, when obstructive disease has been excluded, AM should be considered.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^113CEiiR]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) initial evaluation — At initial evaluation, all patients with NLUTD should undergo a detailed history, physical exam, and urinalysis (Clinical Principle), and patients with NLUTD who spontaneously void should undergo post-void residual measurement (Clinical Principle). Optional studies include a voiding/catheterization diary, pad test, and non-invasive uroflow (Expert Opinion). For low-risk NLUTD, the clinician should not routinely obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, or multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C), whereas for unknown-risk NLUTD, the clinician should obtain upper tract imaging, renal function assessment, and multichannel urodynamics (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). In the patient with an acute neurological event resulting in NLUTD, the clinician should perform risk stratification once the neurological condition has stabilized (Clinical Principle), and clinicians should not perform routine cystoscopy in the initial evaluation of the NLUTD patient (Clinical Principle).

### Measurement of post-void residual bladder volumes in hospitalized older adults [^1148whU9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

It is commonly recommended to catheterize or closely follow up patients with post-void residual volumes of 150 mL or more, but the frequency of such findings in geriatric hospitalized patients and the need for intervention are unclear.

Methods

Post-void residual volumes were measured by ultrasound examination within 14 hours of admission in 464 patients aged 70 years or more who were hospitalized in a regional hospital general internal medicine department. Outcome variables included the need for an indwelling catheter and complications of urinary retention during the hospitalization.

Results

Post-void residual volumes of ≥ 150 mL were common (23.9%; 111/464) and had the following distribution: 150 to 299 mL, 13.1% (61/464); 300 to 499 mL, 6.4% (30/464); and 500 mL or more, 6% (28/464). The rate of indwelling catheters was 3.2% (15/464). Results of post-void residual volumes did not predict the need for indwelling catheters in those without other criteria, although those with indications for indwelling catheters had a significantly higher frequency of post-void residual volumes ≥ 500 mL (P < .001) compared with those without such indications.

Conclusions

We conclude that urinary retention in hospitalized geriatric patients is common, but measurements of post-void residual volumes did not have definite clinical utility. However, the study had limited power to determine the benefits or potential harms of urinary catheterization for elevated post-void residual volumes.

Figure two — Neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) risk stratification outlines initial evaluation and category criteria. Initial evaluation of patient with NLUTD includes history and physical examination; PVR (if spontaneously void); diary, pad test, and uroflowmetry as indicated (optional); and cystoscopy NOT routinely indicated. Low-Risk includes suprapontine lesion (e.g. CVA, Parkinson's, brain tumor, traumatic brain injury, cerebral palsy) without identified potentially-related NLUTD complications or lesion distal to the spinal cord (disc disease, pelvic surgery, diabetes) without identified potentially-related NLUTD complications, with spontaneously void (no indwelling catheter or CIC), low PVR, renal function normal/stable, UDS (if assessed) showing synergistic voiding, upper tract imaging (if assessed) normal/stable, and stable LUTS. Unknown-Risk includes suprasacral spinal cord lesion (SCI, multiple sclerosis, transverse myelitis, spinal dysraphism), other neurologic lesions with identified GU complications potentially related to NLUTD such as HN, bladder stones, elevated PVR, recurrent UTI, or change in LUTS. Moderate-Risk includes urodynamics demonstrating urinary retention, BOO, or DO with incomplete emptying, PVR elevated, upper tract imaging normal, and renal function normal/stable. High-Risk (any of these = high risk) includes urodynamics: poor bladder compliance, elevated detrusor storage pressures with DO, DSD, VUR (if done with fluoroscopy); upper tract imaging: hydronephrosis, new renal scarring, parenchymal loss, staghorn, large or increased stone burden; and renal function abnormal/unstable.

AUA/SUFU adult urodynamics — lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) guidance includes: Clinicians may perform PVR in patients with LUTS as a safety measure to rule out significant urinary retention both initially and during follow up (Clinical Principle). Uroflow may be used by clinicians in the initial and ongoing evaluation of male patients with LUTS when an abnormality of voiding/emptying is suggested (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Clinicians may perform multi-channel filling cystometry when it is important to determine if DO or other abnormalities of bladder filling/urine storage are present in patients with LUTS, particularly when invasive, potentially morbid or irreversible treatments are considered (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should perform PFS in men when it is important to determine if urodynamic obstruction is present in men with LUTS, particularly when invasive, potentially morbid or irreversible treatments are considered (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Clinicians may perform PFS in women when it is important to determine if obstruction is present (Option; Evidence Quality: Grade C). Clinicians may perform videourodynamics in properly selected patients to localize the level of obstruction, particularly for the diagnosis of primary bladder neck obstruction (Expert Opinion).

ACS NSQIP/AGS Best Practices Guidelines — indwelling bladder catheter use in older adults: If an older adult patient has an indwelling catheter, daily review and documentation of its indication should be completed and attempts be made to remove catheter as soon as possible. Indications for indwelling bladder catheterization include anticipated prolonged duration of surgery (these catheters should be removed in the postanesthesia care unit), patients anticipated to receive large-volume infusions or diuretics during surgery, need for intraoperative monitoring of urinary output, need for short-term frequent monitoring of urine output in critically ill patients, management of acute urinary retention or obstruction, need to facilitate healing of advanced pressure ulcers in incontinent patients, and patient preference to improve comfort. Indwelling catheters should not be used as a substitute for nursing care of the older adult patient who is incontinent; they are also not indicated as a means of obtaining urine culture when a patient can void, nor should they routinely be used for patients receiving thoracic epidural anesthesia/analgesia.

### Revefenacin (Yupelri) [^113PjQrU]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

5.1	Deterioration of Disease and Acute Episodes

YUPELRI should not be initiated in patients during acutely deteriorating or potentially life-threatening episodes of COPD. YUPELRI has not been studied in subjects with acutely deteriorating COPD. The initiation of YUPELRI in this setting is not appropriate.

YUPELRI is intended as a once-daily maintenance treatment for COPD and should not be used for relief of acute symptoms, i.e. as rescue therapy for the treatment of acute episodes of bronchospasm, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist.

COPD may deteriorate acutely over a period of hours or chronically over several days or longer. If YUPELRI no longer controls symptoms of bronchoconstriction, the patient's inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist becomes less effective, or the patient needs more inhalations of a short-acting beta2-agonist than usual, these may be markers of deterioration of disease. In this setting, a re-evaluation of the patient and the COPD treatment regimen should be undertaken at once. Increasing the daily dose of YUPELRI beyond the recommended dose is not appropriate in this situation.

5.2	Paradoxical Bronchospasm

As with other inhaled medicines, YUPELRI can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with YUPELRI, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator; YUPELRI should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy should be instituted.

5.3	Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma

YUPELRI should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of acute narrow-angle glaucoma (e.g. eye pain or discomfort, blurred vision, visual halos or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival congestion and corneal edema). Instruct patients to consult a physician immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops.

5.4	Worsening of Urinary Retention

YUPELRI should be used with caution in patients with urinary retention. Prescribers and patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of urinary retention (e.g. difficulty passing urine, painful urination), especially in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction. Instruct patients to consult a healthcare provider immediately if any of these signs or symptoms develops.

Method

Patients

A prospective observational study was conducted at St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK, from May to October 2014 (24 weeks) with approval from the local research ethics committee (REC 14/SC/0219). Consecutive adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) undergoing elective day-case general surgical procedures (expected same-day discharge) were included. Patients undergoing bariatric, emergency or minor dermatological procedures and those with a urinary catheter in situ prior to, or inserted during, the procedure were excluded. Patients undergoing a procedure typically performed as a day case but with a planned overnight admission (e.g. because of attendant comorbidities) were not excluded.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on adult neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction: diagnosis and evaluation [^112ACzCp]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Xiao procedure — nerve rerouting for volitional bladder and bowel control in neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction (NLUTD) due to spinal cord injury (SCI) or spina bifida (SB) showed initial efficacy with 67% achieved satisfactory emptying and low post-void residual (PVR), but subsequent studies, including a randomized, prospective, double-blind controlled trial during untethering surgery, found no difference in urination control, continence, or urodynamic contraction; given limited reproducibility and reported morbidities, the Xiao procedure should only be considered in investigational settings with appropriate patient counseling.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^111Cqh7P]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU guideline — initial evaluation of idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) states that clinicians should not routinely perform urodynamics (UDS), cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB, and that clinicians may perform advanced testing, such as UDS, cystoscopy, or urinary tract imaging, in the initial evaluation of patients with OAB when diagnostic uncertainty exists. The initial evaluation of patients with symptoms of OAB should include a medical history, physical examination, and urinalysis, and additional components of an OAB evaluation may also include post-void residual (PVR) measurement, voiding diary, and a symptom questionnaire. There is no need to obtain UDS, cystoscopy, or upper tract imaging in the initial evaluation of a patient with OAB symptoms, but further evaluation with UDS, cystoscopy, and/or urinary tract imaging can be considered to clarify diagnosis when diagnostic uncertainty or abnormal findings exist and can also be considered if patients have a suboptimal or unexpected response to standard OAB therapy.

Catheter-dependent urinary retention evaluation — In patients with catheter-dependent urinary retention who may have underactive detrusor function, a pressure flow study is advised; clinicians should also recognize that some patients (e.g., with bladder diverticulum) may have studies that inaccurately indicate a lack of detrusor contractility, and treating detrusor overactivity (DO) or low bladder compliance for bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) may not lead to meaningful improvement, can subject patients to unnecessary surgery, and carries increased risks for incontinence and exacerbated voiding symptoms after finishing treatment.

### American Urogynecologic Society best practice statement: evaluation and counseling of patients with pelvic organ prolapse [^116UT5mx]. Female Pelvic Medicine & Reconstructive Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) evaluation — bleeding and bladder assessment and asymptomatic management include to assess for abnormal vaginal bleeding, document the patient's denial of vaginal bleeding, and evaluate symptoms of vaginal bleeding to rule out premalignant or malignant conditions. Bladder function assessment includes to assess bladder function with continence testing to consider cough stress test with the prolapse in the native, neutral, and reduced position at bladder volume of 300 mL or capacity, whichever is less, and if considering surgery to assess risk of occult stress urinary incontinence using available risk prediction models; for emptying, evaluate PVR urine volume in patients with anterior vaginal wall prolapse beyond the hymen or abnormal voiding symptoms. For management, asymptomatic women without evidence of urinary retention can be offered expectant management, and asymptomatic women should be offered an appropriate range of interventions based upon their medical histories and treatment goals, including vaginal pessary and surgery.

These conditions are predisposed to affect characteristic parts of the nervous system, as set out in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Neurological levels affected by disorders that may present initially to a LUTS or urodynamics clinic.

In LUTS clinics, the imperative is to identify additional atypical features. This could include new onset severe LUTS (excluding infection or malignancy). Alternatively, unusual aspects should be noted, such as emergence of enuresis without chronic retention, which might be a result of a cerebral problem. Furthermore, there may be "suspicious" symptoms reported during history taking, such as numbness, weakness, speech disturbance, gait disturbance, memory loss/cognitive impairment, and autonomic symptoms.

Any such concerns mean that consideration should be given to a more extensive assessment for bowel and sexual dysfunction, as these may develop alongside LUTD in the neurogenic context and a "full house" of pelvic organ involvement may be suggestive of a neurological disorder affecting their common pathways. Despite the risk that pelvic organ problems might indicate an occult neurology, they are often not suspected by healthcare professionals seeing these patients. This is highlighted by the omission of pelvic organ problems for recognition and diagnosis of a range of neurological conditions in recent NICE guidance, notably in conditions where pelvic organ symptoms are well established early indications of diseases such as MS and MSA. As pelvic organ problems are common in the general population, it is even more important to distinguish those whose symptoms are being caused by neurological disease, to enable an appropriate and timely referral to an appropriate service (e.g. neurology, neurosurgery or spinal surgery) to reduce the preventable progression of disease, which impacts both the nervous system and the end organs.

Key guidelines instruct the holistic management of bladder, bowel and sexual problems in people with neurological conditions, given that multiple pelvic organ problems are frequently experienced by a single individual. While both healthcare professionals and patients might feel reluctant to discuss sexual problems, their evaluation is important for appreciating any neurological contribution and the impact sexual dysfunction has on the patient and their partner.

Screening tools may be used to identify people who have increased likelihood of particular conditions. The currently available tools assessing pelvic organ function are either single‐system specific or population specific. Commonly they quantify symptom severity and impact, rather than serving to identify the potential cause of the symptoms i.e. neurological.

### Postoperative urinary retention [^1147XFBV]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) — patient factors: Women with neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease often have preexisting voiding dysfunction that increases their risk of POUR, whereas diabetes does not appear to be a predisposing factor. The collinear variables of older age and postmenopausal status appear to be risk factors for POUR, and advanced prolapse, often difficult to separate from preoperative voiding dysfunction, is also implicated as a predisposing factor. The International Prostate Symptoms score is validated and has been studied in an outpatient urogynecologic setting and following other types of surgery to assess for POUR in women, although currently the use of this measure in women is limited.
