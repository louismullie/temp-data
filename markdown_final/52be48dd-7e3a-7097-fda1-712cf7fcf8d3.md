## Question

Dosage of penicillin v for dental abscess

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate dosage of penicillin V for a dental abscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether antibiotics are even indicated. Then, I should verify the first-line agent and whether penicillin V is appropriate. Next, I will check the exact adult dose, frequency, and duration. After that, I need to consider alternatives if penicillin V is not feasible and what to do if there is a penicillin allergy. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, stopping rules, and special situations like renal impairment or pregnancy, and then synthesize a concise, practical recommendation with caveats about when not to prescribe antibiotics at all.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because I need to ensure we are not overprescribing antibiotics for odontogenic infections. Most dental abscesses are best managed with definitive conservative dental treatment (DCDT) such as pulpotomy, pulpectomy, root canal, or incision and drainage, and antibiotics are not routinely indicated unless there is systemic involvement or a high risk of progression, so I should not jump to antibiotics without assessing for fever, malaise, trismus, diffuse swelling, or immunocompromise [^2001ab83] [^466f2b17] [^944881ed].

> Wait, let me verify the first-line agent. The ADA guideline recommends amoxicillin as preferred over penicillin V because amoxicillin has better activity against gram-negative anaerobes and fewer GI adverse effects, but penicillin V remains an acceptable alternative when amoxicillin is not feasible, so penicillin V is reasonable if amoxicillin is unavailable or not tolerated, though it is not the top choice [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17].

> I will now examine the adult dosing for penicillin V when antibiotics are actually indicated. The ADA specifies 500 mg orally four times daily for 3 to 7 days, with the shorter end favored if symptoms resolve promptly, and I should double-check that this applies to immunocompetent adults with systemic involvement or when DCDT is delayed, which it does [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17] [^c5f838d5].

> Hold on, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for QID dosing. Beta-lactam efficacy depends on time above MIC, and more frequent dosing improves target attainment; while the pivotal dental data are limited, the streptococcal pharyngitis literature supports that 800 mg QID for 5 days achieves noninferior clinical outcomes to 1000 mg TID for 10 days, reinforcing the principle that frequent dosing can maintain efficacy with shorter courses, which is indirectly supportive of QID regimens in odontogenic infections when antibiotics are warranted [^5b5354e4] [^67001a50] [^4f477fb3].

> Next, I should review alternatives and what to do if penicillin V fails. If penicillin V is not feasible, amoxicillin 500 mg TID for 3–7 days is preferred; if there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, I need to broaden coverage by adding metronidazole 500 mg TID for 7 days or switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate 500/125 mg TID for 7 days, and I should confirm that this escalation is guideline-supported, which it is [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17] [^9e23adf2].

> But wait, what if the patient reports a penicillin allergy. I should confirm the allergy phenotype. If there is no history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or urticaria, cephalexin 500 mg QID for 3–7 days is reasonable; if there is a true immediate hypersensitivity, azithromycin or clindamycin are alternatives, though I need to counsel on higher resistance with azithromycin and the elevated C. difficile risk with clindamycin, and I should double-check that these cautions are explicitly stated in the guideline, which they are [^7fb45163] [^6c1e2c8f].

> I need to ensure I address duration and stopping rules. The ADA advises re-evaluating at 48–72 hours and discontinuing antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution of systemic symptoms, even if the planned 3–7 day course is not finished, to minimize resistance and adverse effects; I should also remind patients not to save or share antibiotics, and to dispose of unused medication properly [^9e23adf2] [^95332efc].

> Let me consider special populations. For renal impairment, I initially thought dose adjustment might be needed, but wait, I should verify the label; the FDA labeling indicates no dose adjustment is required for penicillin V in adults with eGFR 0–90 mL/min/1.73 m², so I should correct that assumption and avoid unnecessary dose changes in renal dysfunction [^bc2418c4]. For pregnancy, penicillin V is generally considered safe, and the same adult dosing applies when antibiotics are indicated, though I should still prioritize source control and reserve antibiotics for cases with systemic involvement or delayed care [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify what to do when definitive dental treatment is immediately available. If DCDT can be performed the same day, antibiotics are not recommended as adjuncts for localized disease without systemic involvement, so I should avoid antibiotics in that scenario and focus on timely drainage or endodontic therapy instead [^2001ab83] [^466f2b17].

> Let me synthesize a practical, conditional recommendation. For an immunocompetent adult with a dental abscess and systemic involvement, or when DCDT is delayed, penicillin V 500 mg orally four times daily for 3 to 7 days is acceptable, with a strong preference for amoxicillin 500 mg TID when available; reassess at 48–72 hours, stop 24 hours after symptom resolution, and escalate to amoxicillin-clavulanate or add metronidazole if there is no improvement, while avoiding antibiotics altogether if source control is promptly achieved and there is no systemic spread [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17] [^9e23adf2].

---

For adult dental abscesses, the recommended dose of penicillin V is **500 mg orally four times daily for 3–7 days** [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17]. This regimen is appropriate when definitive dental treatment is delayed or not immediately available, and should be stopped 24 hours after symptoms resolve [^95332efc]. If there is no improvement within 48–72 hours, add metronidazole 500 mg three times daily or switch to amoxicillin-clavulanate 500/125 mg three times daily [^9e23adf2] [^466f2b17]. For penicillin allergy, use cephalexin 500 mg four times daily if no anaphylaxis; if anaphylaxis is present, use azithromycin or clindamycin [^7fb45163].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard adult dose**: 500 mg orally four times daily (every 6 hours) [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17].
- **Duration**: 3–7 days, tailored to clinical response; discontinue 24 hours after complete symptom resolution [^95332efc].
- **Administration**: Take on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after meals) for optimal absorption.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dosage

The ADA guideline recommends penicillin V 500 mg four times daily for 3–7 days when antibiotics are indicated for dental abscesses, particularly when **definitive dental treatment is delayed** or unavailable [^61cf71de] [^466f2b17]. This regimen balances efficacy against oral anaerobes with minimizing resistance and adverse effects [^dacbd46d].

---

## Factors influencing dosage adjustments

Several factors may necessitate **dosage adjustments**:

- **Renal impairment**: No adjustment is required for mild to moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30–90 mL/min/1.73 m²) [^bc2418c4].
- **Severe renal impairment**: Use caution and monitor closely; consider dose reduction if clinically indicated.
- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered safe at standard doses, but monitor closely.

---

## Clinical response and duration of therapy

Clinical improvement is typically expected within **48–72 hours**. If there is no improvement, reassess and consider modifying therapy [^9e23adf2]. The total duration should be 3–7 days, with discontinuation 24 hours after symptom resolution [^95332efc].

---

## Potential side effects and precautions

Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), rash, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. Serious adverse effects such as **anaphylaxis** and severe cutaneous reactions are rare but require immediate medical attention [^c61d6342]. Monitor for signs of allergic reactions, especially in patients with a known penicillin allergy [^6d1c2079].

---

## Alternative antibiotic therapies

If penicillin V is contraindicated or ineffective, consider the following alternatives:

| **Antibiotic** | **Dosage and frequency** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Amoxicillin | 500 mg orally three times daily for 3–7 days | First-line alternative [^61cf71de] |
| Amoxicillin-clavulanate | 500/125 mg orally three times daily for 7 days | Broad-spectrum alternative [^466f2b17] |
| Cephalexin | 500 mg orally four times daily for 3–7 days | Penicillin allergy (non-anaphylaxis) [^7fb45163] |
| Azithromycin | 500 mg on day 1, then 250 mg daily for 4 days | Penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis) [^7fb45163] |
| Clindamycin | 300 mg orally four times daily for 3–7 days | Penicillin allergy (anaphylaxis) [^7fb45163] |

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Dosage should be adjusted based on weight and age, typically 25–50 mg/kg/day divided into four doses.
- **Elderly patients**: Monitor closely for adverse effects, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances and renal function.
- **Immunocompromised patients**: Consider broader-spectrum antibiotics or combination therapy due to increased risk of complications.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard adult dose**: 500 mg orally four times daily for 3–7 days [^61cf71de].
- **Discontinue**: 24 hours after complete symptom resolution [^95332efc].
- **Monitor**: Clinical response within 48–72 hours; modify therapy if no improvement [^9e23adf2].
- **Alternatives**: Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cephalexin, azithromycin, or clindamycin based on allergy status and clinical response [^7fb45163].

---

Penicillin V remains a **first-line option** for dental abscesses when antibiotics are indicated, with 500 mg four times daily for 3–7 days as the standard regimen. Adjust therapy based on clinical response, allergy status, and patient-specific factors.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^5b5354e4]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

According to a Cochrane report from 2012, clinical trials on shorter treatment duration with oral penicillin for streptococcal pharyngotonsillitis are encouraged.Moore and colleagues (DESCARTE study) called for randomised controlled trials to confirm if a shorter course of penicillin might be sufficient when symptomatic cure is the goal.Increasing overall antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new antimicrobial agents emphasise the importance of correctly using existing antibiotics to their full potential.A Cochrane review published in 2016 concluded that penicillin is the preferred first line treatment for pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococcus in adults and children.This review compared penicillin with broader spectrum antibiotics. A meta-analysis from 2008 stated that clinical success and bacteriological eradication are less likely in patients with group A streptococcus pharyngotonsillitis on a short course of treatment (five to seven days) compared with those on a long course of treatment (10 days). The total daily doses in these studies ranged from 750 to 1600 mg, either twice daily or three times daily.However, the inclusion criteria did not always follow current ESCMID guidelines, and the dosing regimens were suboptimal according to current knowledge of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

The efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration of the unbound drug concentration in serum. The most important determinants for time above minimum inhibitory concentration are dose and frequency, and the dosing regimen of 800 mg four times daily provides better target attainment compared with 1000 mg three times daily.The risk with a shorter regimen might be a lower rate of clinical resolution and microbiological eradication.However, reducing the treatment duration could cause fewer side effects, improve patient adherence,cause less impact on the human microbiota,lower the total antibiotic use, and reduce drug costs for patients and the community. The rationale for a non-inferiority trial design was based on the expectation that non-inferiority of the clinical efficacy of a shorter treatment duration compared with the currently recommended treatment would be sufficient from a clinical perspective. The efficacy of 10 day treatment compared with placebo is previously well documentedand in line with international guidelines. The non-inferiority margin for the primary endpoint was agreed upon by the trial steering committee based on European Medicines Agency guidelinesand on the judgment that a difference in the rate of clinical cure up to 10 percentage points is not clinically relevant for non-serious infections.

American Dental Association guideline—Immediate DCDT available (same visit): For immunocompetent adults with pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis or localized acute apical abscess, the expert panel recommends dentists do not prescribe oral systemic antibiotics as an adjunct to DCDT (strong recommendation, very low certainty). For immunocompetent adults with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, the expert panel suggests dentists do not prescribe oral systemic antibiotics as an adjunct to DCDT (conditional recommendation, very low certainty). The good practice statement suggests dentists perform DCDT in conjunction with prescribing oral amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times per d, 3-7 d) or oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3-7 d) for immunocompetent adults with pulp necrosis and acute apical abscess with systemic involvement, and adds, “If the clinical condition worsens or if there is concern for deeper space infection or immediate threat to life, refer for urgent evaluation.”

Antibiotic follow-up and modification—patients without a penicillin allergy who do not respond to first-line therapy: Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient’s symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients without a penicillin allergy fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral amoxicillin or oral penicillin V potassium, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d) or discontinue first-line treatment and prescribe oral amoxicillin and clavulanate (500/125 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

### What are the antibiotics of choice for odontogenic infections, and how long should the treatment course last? [^c879c501]. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

In the everyday practice of oral and maxillofacial surgeons, empiric antibiotics are prescribed in the face of uncertainty. Is there a highly resistant organism present? Are the old-line antibiotics no longer effective? Should a broad-spectrum antibiotic be used just to cover all the bases in this case? The surprising result of this systematic review is that when combined with appropriate surgery, the usual antibiotics are all effective. Safety and cost become the differentiating factors in this clinical decision.

### Penicillin V potasium [^32439b68]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

NOTE: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

The following infections will usually respond to adequate dosage of penicillin V.

Streptococcal Infections (without bacteremia)

Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

NOTE: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

Pneumococcal Infections

Mild to moderately severe infections of the respiratory tract.

Staphylococcal infections – penicillin G-sensitive

Mild infections of the skin and soft tissues.

NOTE: Reports indicate an increasing number of strains of staphylococci resistant to penicillin G, emphasizing the need for culture and sensitivity studies in treating suspected staphylococcal infections.

Fusospirochetosis (Vincent’s gingivitis and pharyngitis)

Pulp necrosis with acute apical abscess and systemic involvement (GPS)—For adults with PN-AAA considering antibiotics alone or as adjuncts to DCDT, the panel provides two GPS: the expert panel suggests dentists prescribe oral amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times per d, 3-7 d) or oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3-7 d) for immunocompetent adults with PN-LAAA with systemic involvement, with urgent referral because DCDT should not be delayed; if the clinical condition worsens or if there is concern for deeper space infection or immediate threat to life, refer patient for urgent evaluation. The expert panel also suggests dentists perform urgent DCDT in conjunction with prescribing oral amoxicillin (500 mg, 3 times per d, 3-7 d) or oral penicillin V potassium (500 mg, 4 times per d, 3-7 d) for immunocompetent adults with PN-LAAA with systemic involvement; if the clinical condition worsens or if there is concern for deeper space infection or immediate threat to life, refer for urgent evaluation.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^67001a50]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Primary outcome

Clinical cure at test of cure evaluation was 89.6% in the five day group (181/202) and 93.3% in the 10 day group (182/195). The study showed that penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days was non-inferior to penicillin V 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days in the main analysis population (the per protocol population). The point estimate showed a difference in the rate of clinical cure of −3.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval −9.7 to 2.2) with advantage to the 10 day intervention group. The results of non-inferiority for the five day treatment were supported by supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as clinical cure (table 2). We confirmed the results by using supplementary analyses of the modified intention to treat population with imputed values as not clinical cure; and analyses of the per protocol population when we excluded patients with only telephone follow-up (n=14) and patients outside the follow-up visit window (n=17). For two supplementary analyses, modified intention to treat without imputation (n=403) and when patients who received oral solution of penicillin V by mistake (n=7) were excluded, the 95% confidence interval crossed the non-inferiority line (−10.04 to 1.9 and −10.01 to 2.2, respectively). The patients who received oral solution were all clinically cured.

Table 2 
Primary and secondary endpoints for per protocol, modified intention to treat*, and subgroup populations. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

MITT=modified intention to treat; PP=per protocol.

The sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint, performed by assessing the patients’ judgment of being cured at five, seven, and nine days after randomisation, showed a faster resolution in the treatment arm with four daily doses compared with patients who received three daily doses (table 3).

Table 3 
Self reported clinical cure according to patient diaries for per protocol population.* Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

Results from the subgroup analysis of gender and different age groups did not reveal any differences and were in line with the main analysis population. In patients with Centor score 3, clinical cure differed between the treatment groups by 1.7% (table 2).

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^3ad43cab]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

The five day regimen was preferred by patients, and patients in this group showed better adherence than the 10 day group despite the more frequent dose regimen. This finding is supported by a previous study that showed a four dose regimen does not reduce adherence compared with a three dose regimen.Fewer patients in the five day treatment group achieved bacterial eradication at the clinical follow up (test of cure), which is in line with previous studies.It is not clear whether bacterial eradication has clinical relevance because colonisation of group A streptococcus occurs in healthy people and there is the possibility that patients have coinfections with other potential pathogens and so the causative agent is not known. Notably, the relapse rate within one month was similar in the two groups, and the recurrence rate of new pharyngotonsillitis within three months was lower in the five day treatment group. Overall, these results support the argument for penicillin treatment regimens with more frequent dosing.

It is important to consider whether shorter duration of treatment would be appropriate in general or if certain subgroups in particular would benefit. In our study, subgroup analyses indicated that the rate of clinical cure at five to seven days after the end of penicillin treatment was similar in both treatment groups for patients with three Centor criteria. However, the cure rate in patients with four Centor criteria appeared lower in those receiving the shorter treatment regimen (table 2). This is mirrored by the fact that patients with four Centor criteria had a lower rate of clinical cure. Further research is needed to identify patients who would benefit from a longer treatment regimen.

Despite a slightly higher daily dose of penicillin V in the five day treatment group (3.2 g v 3.0 g in the 10 day treatment), fewer adverse events and shorter duration of adverse events were reported. This finding could be because of shorter exposure to penicillin and might lead to improved adherence if a five day treatment regimen were to be introduced in clinical practice. The four patients who developed complications (three had peritonsillitis and one had psoriasis) were in the 10 day treatment group. We do not know whether complications were avoided in the five day treatment group because of more frequent dosing or whether the three peritonsillitis cases were caused by other infectious agents not treatable with penicillin V. In addition to group A streptococcus, Fusobacterium necrophorum is one of the main agents that causes peritonsillitis.

### Two dosages of clarithromycin for five days, amoxicillin / clavulanate for five days or penicillin V for ten days in acute group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^828d53f4]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Short course antimicrobial therapy is suggested for group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis.

Methods

The bacteriologic and clinical efficacies of clarithromycin [30 or 15 mg/kg/day twice daily (b.i.d.)] or amoxicillin/clavulanate (43.8/6.2 mg/kg/day b.i.d.) for 5 days or penicillin V (30 mg/kg/day 3 times a day) for 10 days were compared. In a randomized, open label, parallel group, multicenter study, 626 children (2-16 years old) with tonsillopharyngitis were enrolled; 537 were evaluable for efficacy. Follow-up evaluations were performed at 4-8 and 21-28 days after therapy.

Results

At enrollment, 26% of the Streptococcus pyogenes isolates were clarithromycin-nonsusceptible. All regimens had an apparently similar clinical efficacy. The long term S. pyogenes eradication rates were 102 of 123 (83%) with amoxicillin/clavulanate and 88 of 114 (77%) with penicillin V. In the 30- and 15-mg/kg/day clarithromycin groups, eradication occurred in 71 of 86 (83%) and 59 of 80 (74%) of the clarithromycin-susceptible isolates (P = 0.33), and in 4 of 28 (14%) and 5 of 26 (19%) of the clarithromycin-resistant isolates, respectively (clarithromycin-susceptible versus -resistant, P < 0.0001). Both clarithromycin dosages were well-tolerated.

Conclusions

In group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, 5 days of clarithromycin or amoxicillin/clavulanate treatment had clinical efficacy comparable with that of 10 days of penicillin V treatment; however, amoxicillin/clavulanate and penicillin V were bacteriologically more effective than clarithromycin because of its failure to eradicate the clarithromycin-resistant S. pyogenes isolates. The 5-day clarithromycin regimens are not recommended for treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis in areas where in vitro resistance of group A streptococci to clarithromycin is common.

### Penicillin V potasium [^e53c00c1]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Mild to moderately severe infections of the oropharynx usually respond to therapy with oral penicillin.

NOTE: Necessary dental care should be accomplished in infections involving the gum tissue.

Medical conditions in which oral penicillin therapy is indicated as prophylaxis: For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea: Prophylaxis with oral penicillin on a continuing basis has proven effective in preventing recurrence of these conditions.

Although no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted, penicillin V has been suggested by the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association for use as an oral regimen for prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients who have congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease when they undergo dental procedures and surgical procedures of the upper respiratory tract1. Oral penicillin should not be used in those patients at particularly high risk for endocarditis (e.g., those with prosthetic heart valves or surgically constructed systemic pulmonary shunts). Penicillin V should not be used as adjunctive prophylaxis for genitourinary instrumentation or surgery, lower-intestinal tract surgery, sigmoidoscopy, and childbirth. Since it may happen that alpha hemolytic streptococci relatively resistant to penicillin may be found when patients are receiving continuous oral penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever, prophylactic agents other than penicillin may be chosen for these patients and prescribed in addition to their continuous rheumatic fever prophylactic regimen.

NOTE: When selecting antibiotics for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis, the physician or dentist should read the full joint statement of the American Heart Association and the American Dental Association1.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin-VK and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin-VK should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^4f477fb3]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

We found that penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The bacterial eradication rate was lower in the five day treatment group, but the time to symptom resolution was shorter. We did not find any statistically significant difference in the number of relapses within one month between the groups. At the last follow-up there were fewer new pharyngotonsillitis cases and fewer complications reported in the five day treatment group. Additionally, there were fewer adverse events and shorter durations of adverse events reported in the five day group.

Comparison with other studies

Previous studies have compared long treatment regimens with short treatment regimens with the same daily dosage.In this study, we took into account that the efficacy of β lactam antibiotics is dependent on time above the minimum inhibitory concentration. A similar total daily dose but more frequent dosing regimen would give longer time above the minimum inhibitory concentration and would be more aggressive, therefore treatment would not need to be as long.Interestingly, the sensitivity analysis at fixed time points after randomisation supports the hypothesis that more frequent dosing favours faster resolution of symptoms. However, this difference between the treatment groups equals out towards the test of cure visit, when both groups have been without antibiotic protection for about a week. Therefore, patients with shorter treatment duration might be at slightly higher risk of having an early relapse and need additional antibiotic treatment. It is important to bear in mind that this sensitivity analysis is based on patients’ self assessment of cure rather than physicians’ clinical judgment at test of cure. Additionally, the five day group diaries had a larger portion of missing data than the 10 day group diaries.

Recommendation framework—recommendations versus good practice statements (GPS) and strength: Recommendations are informed by a comprehensive search for the best available evidence and a formal process for assessing the certainty of the evidence, whereas GPS are appropriate when there is an excess of indirect evidence suggesting that their implementation will result in large and unequivocal net positive or negative consequences; recommendations are associated with a certainty of the evidence in contrast to GPS. The expert panel graded the strength of recommendations (that is, strong or conditional) and these recommendations and GPS aim to help clinicians, policy makers, and patients make decisions about antibiotic use for immunocompetent adults (most typical patients) who have the target conditions; clinicians should use informed clinical judgement to identify the appropriate course of action in situations that deviate from these recommendations and GPS.

American Dental Association guideline—follow-up, discontinuation, preferences, and safety notes for adjunctive antibiotics with DCDT: “DCDT refers to pulpotomy, pulpectomy, nonsurgical root canal treatment, or incision for drainage abscesses.” The panel advises “Clinicians should reevaluate within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call)” and “Dentists should instruct patients to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after their symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d.” Among first-line options, “amoxicillin is preferred over penicillin because it is more effective against various gram-negative anaerobes and is associated with lower incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.” Cautions include “Bacterial resistance rates for azithromycin are higher than for other antibiotics, and clindamycin substantially increases the risk of developing Clostridioides difficile infection even after a single dose,” and “clindamycin has a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning for Clostridioides difficile infection, which can be fatal.” Patients receiving azithromycin “should be instructed to closely monitor their symptoms and call a dentist or primary care provider if their infection worsens while on therapy,” and patients should “call their primary care provider if they develop fever, abdominal cramping, or ≥ 3 loose bowel movements/d.” The text also notes “If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic within the same spectrum as the one indicated, additional antibiotics do not need to be prescribed. If the patient currently is taking an antibiotic outside of the spectrum as the one indicated, the intended antibiotic still can be prescribed, considering potential contraindications.”

Evidence-based clinical practice guideline on antibiotic use for the urgent management of pulpal- and periapical-related dental pain and intra-oral swelling Supporting Files 11 2019 By Lockhart, Peter B. ; Tampi, Malavika P. ; Abt, Elliot; . File Language: English.

Description: Background: An expert panel convened by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs and the Center for Evidence-Based Dentistry conducted a systematic review and formulated clinical recommendations for the urgent management of symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with or without symptomatic apical periodontitis, pulp necrosis and symptomatic apical periodontitis, or pulp necrosis and localized acute apical abscess using antibiotics, either alone or as adjuncts to definitive, conservative dental treatment in immunocompetent adults. Results: The panel formulated five clinical recommendations and two good practice statements, each specific to the target conditions, for settings where DCDT is and is not immediately available. With likely negligible benefits and potentially large harms, the panel recommended against using antibiotics in the majority of clinical scenarios, irrespective of DCDT availability.

They recommended antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement due to the dental conditions, or when the risk of progression to systemic involvement is high. Conclusion and Practical Implications: Evidence suggests that antibiotics for the target conditions may provide negligible benefits and probably contributes to large harms. The expert panel only suggests antibiotics for target conditions when systemic involvement is present, and immediate DCDT should be prioritized in all cases.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^b6c8f056]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Technical information

Patients or their guardians provided signed informed consent. Patients eligible for inclusion were assigned to treatment with penicillin V as an oral tablet, either 800 mg four times daily for five days or 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days. The dosages for children up to 40 kg were adjusted according to weight (10-20 kg: 250 mg per dose, 20-40 kg: 500 mg per dose, irrespective of treatment arm).Physicians prescribed penicillin V and the patients or their guardians obtained the drugs from the pharmacy after the inclusion visit. Patients or their guardians were asked to fill in a patient diary until the test of cure visit, which was scheduled five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. We chose a test of cure visit based on last dose and not a fixed day after randomisation so that the duration without antibiotic protection was similar for both treatment groups.

Physicians’ clinical judgment of throat status at inclusion and at the test of cure visit were recorded. Throat swabs for rapid antigen detection test and culture were performed at study inclusion and at the follow-up visit. To reduce the discomfort for children, we accepted a double swab if rotated against the tonsils. We regarded any growth of group A streptococcus as a positive outcome. A physician recorded adverse events in the case report form at the test of cure visit. Start and stop dates for each event were recorded, and the physician’s assessment of intensity and the relation to the study drug. In addition, patients (or their guardians) self reported adverse events and side effects in the patient diary. Regional study nurses made follow-up telephone calls to patients (or their guardians) one month and three months after completion of antibiotic treatment. Throat symptoms, potential relapses or new tonsillitis, and complications were monitored, in addition to adverse events. When patients had complications, we collected details retrospectively from their medical records. Uppsala Clinical Research Center and the Center for Primary Health Care Research performed monitoring according to International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^9ae73e8c]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine whether total exposure to penicillin V can be reduced while maintaining adequate clinical efficacy when treating pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci.

Design

Open label, randomised controlled non-inferiority study.

Setting

17 primary healthcare centres in Sweden between September 2015 and February 2018.

Participants

Patients aged 6 years and over with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci and three or four Centor criteria (fever ≥38.5°C, tender lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and absence of cough).

Interventions

Penicillin V 800 mg four times daily for five days (total 16 g) compared with the current recommended dose of 1000 mg three times daily for 10 days (total 30 g).

Main Outcome Measures

Primary outcome was clinical cure five to seven days after the end of antibiotic treatment. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified to 10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes were bacteriological eradication, time to relief of symptoms, frequency of relapses, complications and new tonsillitis, and patterns of adverse events.

Results

Patients (n=433) were randomly allocated to the five day (n=215) or 10 day (n=218) regimen. Clinical cure in the per protocol population was 89.6% (n=181/202) in the five day group and 93.3% (n=182/195) in the 10 day group (95% confidence interval -9.7 to 2.2). Bacteriological eradication was 80.4% (n=156/194) in the five day group and 90.7% (n=165/182) in the 10 day group. Eight and seven patients had relapses, no patients and four patients had complications, and six and 13 patients had new tonsillitis in the five day and 10 day groups, respectively. Time to relief of symptoms was shorter in the five day group. Adverse events were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vulvovaginal disorders; the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events.

Conclusions

Penicillin V four times daily for five days was non-inferior in clinical outcome to penicillin V three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci. The number of relapses and complications did not differ between the two intervention groups. Five day treatment with penicillin V four times daily might be an alternative to the currently recommended 10 day regimen.

### Penicillin V potassium [^cbefbe1b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin V potassium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

NOTE: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

The following infections will usually respond to adequate dosage of penicillin V.

Streptococcal Infections (without bacteremia)

Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

NOTE: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

### Antibiotic prescriptions associated with dental-related emergency department visits [^89dc526c]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

The frequency of antibiotic prescribing and types of antibiotics prescribed for dental conditions presenting to the emergency department (ED) is not well known. The objective of this study is to quantify how often and which dental diagnoses made in the ED resulted in an antibiotic prescription.

Methods

From 2011 to 2015, there were an estimated 2.2 million (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 2.5 million) ED visits per year for dental-related conditions, which accounted for 1.6% (95% CI 1.5% to 1.7%) of ED visits. This is based on an unweighted 2,125 observations from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey in which a dental-related diagnosis was made.

Results

An antibiotic, most often a narrow-spectrum penicillin or clindamycin, was prescribed in 65% (95% CI 61% to 68%) of ED visits with any dental diagnosis. The most common dental diagnoses for all ages were unspecified disorder of the teeth and supporting structures (44%; 95% CI 41% to 48%; International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification[ICD-9-CM] code 525.9), periapical abscess without sinus (21%; 95% CI 18% to 25%; ICD-9-CM code 522.5), and dental caries (18%; 95% CI 15% to 22%; ICD-9-CM code 521.0). Recommended treatments for these conditions are usually dental procedures rather than antibiotics.

Conclusion

The common use of antibiotics for dental conditions in the ED may indicate the need for greater access to both preventive and urgent care from dentists and other related specialists as well as the need for clearer clinical guidance and provider education related to oral infections.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^06be5f33]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Streptococcus Species

The expert group recommendations for streptococcal infections are based on the IDSA PJI guidelines.Beta-lactam antibiotics are the agent of choice, although it is known that antibiotics that target the cell wall may be ineffective once the initial phase has passed, due to the slower growth rate of adherent bacteria, during which cell wall synthesis is reduced.However, poor efficacy of these beta-lactams has not been demonstrated in streptococcal implant-associated infections.– Intravenous beta-lactam therapy should be given for up to a week followed by oral therapy with amoxicillin (Table 1).

After prompt debridement, it is recommended (if there is no history of penicillin allergy) to start with IV benzyl penicillin 4 million units (2.4 g) every 4 hours (24 MU/day) or 5 million units (3.0 g) every 6 hours (20 MU/day). When the MIC value is <0.1 mg/L, the dosage can be adjusted to 12–18 MU/day. If there is a history of nonimmediate, nonsevere penicillin allergy (eg, a delayed rash), an alternative is ceftriaxone or cefotaxime (Table 1). In case of penicillin allergy, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, and clindamycin are alternatives, depending on susceptibility testing.

Despite good activity of rifampicin against planktonic streptococci, it has been observed in clinical studies that it has no activity on streptococcal biofilms. Therefore, despite some studies showing a beneficial effect of rifampicin, the expert group does currently not recommend rifampicin for streptococcal FRI infections.

### Penicillins for the prophylaxis of bacterial endocarditis in dentistry [^423f6f33]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia and it is believed that this may lead to bacterial endocarditis (BE) in a few people. Guidelines in many countries recommend that prior to invasive dental procedures antibiotics are administered to people at high risk of endocarditis. However, it is unclear whether the potential risks of this prophylaxis outweigh the potential benefits.

Objectives

To determine whether prophylactic penicillin administration compared to no such administration or placebo before invasive dental procedures in people at increased risk of BE influences mortality, serious illness or endocarditis incidence.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was developed on MEDLINE and adapted for use on the Cochrane Oral Health, Heart and Infectious Diseases Groups' Trials Registers (to October 2003), as well as the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2002), OLDMEDLINE (1966 to June 2002); EMBASE (1980 to June 2002); SIGLE (to June 2002); and the Meta-register of current controlled trials.

Selection Criteria

Due to the low incidence of BE it was anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, cohort and case controlled studies were included where suitably matched control or comparison groups had been studied. The intervention was the administration of penicillin compared to no such administration before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of BE. Cohort studies would need to follow those at increased risk and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping by whether prophylaxis was received. Included case control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing an invasive dental procedure preceding the onset of endocarditis) with those at similar risk but who had not developed endocarditis. Outcomes of interest were: mortality or serious adverse event requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse events to the antibiotics; and cost implications of the antibiotic provision for the care of those patients who develop endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected studies for inclusion, then assessed quality and extracted data from the included study.

Main Results

No RCTs, CCTs or cohort studies were included. One case-control study met the inclusion criteria. It collected all the cases of endocarditis in the Netherlands over 2 years, finding a total of 24 people who developed endocarditis within 180 days of an invasive dental procedure, definitely requiring prophylaxis according to current guidelines and who were at increased risk of endocarditis due to a pre-existing cardiac problem. This study included participants who died because of the endocarditis (using proxys). Controls attended local cardiology outpatient clinics for similar cardiac problems, had undergone an invasive dental procedure within the past 180 days and were matched by age with the cases. No significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis could be seen. No data were found on other outcomes.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no evidence about whether penicillin prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in people at risk who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. There is a lack of evidence to support published guidelines in this area. It is not clear whether the potential harms and costs of penicillin administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically practitioners need to discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Unexplained reduced microbiological efficacy of intramuscular benzathine penicillin G and of oral penicillin V in eradication of group a streptococci from children with acute pharyngitis [^35dae1df]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of oral penicillin V and intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) in eradicating group A streptococci from the upper respiratory tract.

Methodology

Two randomized, single-blind, multicenter antibiotic efficacy trials in children using recommended doses of either oral penicillin V or intramuscular BPG for treatment of acute-onset pharyngitis associated with isolation of group A streptococci were conducted. Throat examinations and cultures were obtained at enrollment and on days 5 to 8, 10 to 14, and 29 to 31.

Results

Thirty-five percent of 284 evaluable patients treated with oral penicillin V and 37% of BPG-treated patients were microbiologic treatment failures at either 10 to 14 or 29 to 31 days.

Conclusions

Although these findings do not provide sufficient evidence to change current treatment recommendations or public health policy, important questions are raised about currently recommended penicillin doses, about the role of the carrier state, and possibly about adequate bioavailability of intramuscular BPG. These findings require confirmation.

### Comparison of two dosages of azithromycin for three days versus penicillin V for ten days in acute group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis [^5c798f3f]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Three-day, 10 mg/kg/day azithromycin (AZM) studies in pediatric acute group A streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis have shown contradictory bacteriologic results. This study investigates the efficacy and tolerability of two dosages of 3-day azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day and 10 mg/kg/day) compared with 10-day penicillin V.

Methods

This was a prospective, comparative, randomized, multicenter trial. Children were scheduled to return for visits at 14 days (main end point) and 1 month after the onset of treatment for clinical and bacteriologic assessment. Molecular tools were used to compare pre- and posttreatment group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (GABHS) isolates.

Results

Between November, 1997, and July, 1998, 501 patients (169 AZM 10 mg, 165 AZM 20 mg, 167 penicillin V) between 2 and 12 years old were enrolled; 500 were assessable for safety, 469 for intent to treat analysis and 420 for efficacy in the per protocol analysis. Before treatment 25 (7.9%) of 315 GABHS stains isolated from patients receiving AZM were resistant to this compound. On Day 14 pretreatment GABHS were eradicated from 78 (57.8%) of the 135 children receiving the AZM 10 mg regimen, 131 (94.2%) of the 139 receiving AZM 20 mg and 123 (84.2%) of the 146 taking penicillin. One month after the outset of treatment, bacteriologic relapses were observed in 40.5% (n = 30) of the children receiving AZM 10 mg, 14.8% (n = 18) of children taking AZM 20 mg and 13.2% (n = 15) of those treated with penicillin V. AZM 20 mg/kg/day was statistically superior to AZM 10 mg/kg/day microbiologically on Day 14 (P = 0.0001) and Day 30 (P = 0.0001) and clinically on Day 14 (P = 0.0035). AZM 20 mg/kg/day was statistically equivalent both microbiologically and clinically to standard therapy with penicillin V at all endpoints. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was similar in the two azithromycin groups [AZM 10 mg, 31 of 169 (18.3%); AZM 20 mg, 37 of 164 (23%)] but significantly higher than those observed in the penicillin V group [5 of 166 (3%); P < 0.0001]. Most treatment-related adverse events were gastrointestinal and of mild-to-moderate severity. Fourteen patients withdrew from the trial because of adverse events (1 in the penicillin V group, 7 in the AZM 10 mg group and 6 in the AZM 20 mg group).

Conclusion

This is the first study to demonstrate a daily dose-dependent difference in microbiologic efficacy of a regimen; 3-day AZM 20 mg/kg/day is a more effective regimen than 3-day AZM 10 mg/kg/day for pediatric GABHS tonsillopharyngitis.

Antibiotic follow-up and modification—patients with a history of a penicillin allergy (with or without anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives): Clinicians should reevaluate patient within 3 d (for example, in-person visit or phone call), and dentists should instruct patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 h after patient’s symptoms resolve, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 d. In cases in which patients with a history of a penicillin allergy and with or without a history of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or hives with penicillin, ampicillin, or amoxicillin fail to respond to first-line treatment with oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin, the panel suggests that dentists should broaden antibiotic therapy to complement first-line treatment with oral metronidazole (500 mg, 3 times per d, 7 d).

American Dental Association guideline—reported penicillin allergy and alternative antibiotics: Although approximately 10% of the population self-reports having a penicillin allergy and less than 1% of the entire population is truly allergic, clinicians should proceed with nonpenicillin drug class antibiotics until further confirmation of a true penicillin allergy, and the panel suggests prescribing oral cephalexin, oral azithromycin, or oral clindamycin; some antibiotics may be less effective or carry a greater risk of harming patients through allergic reactions (penicillin) or Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the prevention of CDI should be a community priority in addition to a hospital priority, and according to a United Kingdom–based study, the incidence of CDI can be reduced through the appropriate use of antibiotics.

### Are oral antibiotics an effective alternative to intravenous antibiotics in treatment of osteomyelitis of the jaw? [^af562732]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To review treatment of osteomyelitis of the jaw (OMJ) and determine whether antibiotic route and/or length of administration impacts resolution of infection postsurgically.

Methods

The investigators designed a retrospective cohort study enrolling a sample of patients treated at Harborview Medical Center from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. The primary predictor variable was antibiotic administration route: oral (PO) only, intravenous (IV) only, IV transitioned to PO (IV + PO), or none. The secondary predictor was duration of antibiotic therapy (≤6 weeks or >6 weeks). The primary outcome variable was resolution of infection at 2 months follow-up posttreatment completion. The secondary outcome variable was number of surgeries to resolution of infection. Descriptive, bivariate, and multiple linear regression statistics were computed, with statistical significance set at P < .05.

Results

Sixty-seven individuals met inclusion criteria (38 male), mean age 51 years (18 to 88). Forty-nine (73%) received PO antibiotics, 12 (18%) IV + PO, 3 (4%) IV, and 3 (4%) none. Both PO and IV antibiotics were associated with clinical resolution (P = .022, .005, respectively) compared with debridement alone. Antibiotic duration of ≤6 weeks compared with >6 weeks was not significant. Seventy-six percent (51 of 67) required only 1 surgery. In the multivariate logistic regression, PO was associated with clinical resolution (P = .025, OR = 5.05). Penicillin allergy (P = 0.049, OR = 0.223) and diabetes (P = .008, OR = 0.104) were adversely associated with outcome.

Conclusions

OMJ was successfully treated with oral antibiotics and surgery. Prescribing 6 weeks of IV antibiotics may be antiquated. Clinicians should consider oral penicillins as first line whenever possible. Further studies are recommended.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing bacterial endocarditis following dental procedures [^438180dc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Infective endocarditis is a severe infection arising in the lining of the chambers of the heart. It can be caused by fungi, but most often is caused by bacteria. Many dental procedures cause bacteraemia, which could lead to bacterial endocarditis in a small proportion of people. The incidence of bacterial endocarditis is low, but it has a high mortality rate.  Guidelines in many countries have recommended that antibiotics be administered to people at high risk of endocarditis prior to invasive dental procedures. However, guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales states that antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis is not recommended routinely for people undergoing dental procedures. This is an update of a review that we first conducted in 2004 and last updated in 2013.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine whether prophylactic antibiotic administration, compared to no antibiotic administration or placebo, before invasive dental procedures in people at risk or at high risk of bacterial endocarditis, influences mortality, serious illness or the incidence of endocarditis. Secondary objectives To determine whether the effect of dental antibiotic prophylaxis differs in people with different cardiac conditions predisposing them to increased risk of endocarditis, and in people undergoing different high risk dental procedures. Harms Had we foundno evidence from randomised controlled trials or cohort studies on whether prophylactic antibiotics affected mortality or serious illness, and we had found evidence from these or case-control studies suggesting that prophylaxis with antibiotics reduced the incidence of endocarditis, then we would also have assessed whether the harms of prophylaxis with single antibiotic doses, such as with penicillin (amoxicillin 2 g or 3 g) before invasive dental procedures, compared with no antibiotic or placebo, equalled the benefits in prevention of endocarditis in people at high risk of this disease.

Search Methods

An information specialist searched four bibliographic databases up to 10 May 2021 and used additional search methods to identify published, unpublished and ongoing studies SELECTION CRITERIA: Due to the low incidence of bacterial endocarditis, we anticipated that few if any trials would be located. For this reason, we included cohort and case-control studies with suitably matched control or comparison groups. The intervention was antibiotic prophylaxis, compared to no antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo, before a dental procedure in people with an increased risk of bacterial endocarditis. Cohort studies would need to follow at-risk individuals and assess outcomes following any invasive dental procedures, grouping participants according to whether or not they had received prophylaxis. Case-control studies would need to match people who had developed endocarditis after undergoing an invasive dental procedure (and who were known to be at increased risk before undergoing the procedure) with those at similar risk who had not developed endocarditis.  Our outcomes of interest were mortality or serious adverse events requiring hospital admission; development of endocarditis following any dental procedure in a defined time period; development of endocarditis due to other non-dental causes; any recorded adverse effects of the antibiotics; and the cost of antibiotic provision compared to that of caring for patients who developed endocarditis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened search records, selected studies for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias in the included study and extracted data from the included study. As an author team, we judged the certainty of the evidence identified for the main comparison and key outcomes using GRADE criteria. We presented the main results in a summary of findings table.

Main Results

Our new search did not find any new studies for inclusion since the last version of the review in 2013. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) or cohort studies were included in the previous versions of the review, but one case-control study met the inclusion criteria. The trial authors collected information on 48 people who had contracted bacterial endocarditis over a specific two-year period and had undergone a medical or dental procedure with an indication for prophylaxis within the past 180 days. These people were matched to a similar group of people who had not contracted bacterial endocarditis. All study participants had undergone an invasive medical or dental procedure. The two groups were compared to establish whether those who had received preventive antibiotics (penicillin) were less likely to have developed endocarditis. The authors found no significant effect of penicillin prophylaxis on the incidence of endocarditis. No data on other outcomes were reported. The level of certainty we have about the evidence is very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There remains no clear evidence about whether antibiotic prophylaxis is effective or ineffective against bacterial endocarditis in at-risk people who are about to undergo an invasive dental procedure. We cannot determine whether the potential harms and costs of antibiotic administration outweigh any beneficial effect. Ethically, practitioners should discuss the potential benefits and harms of antibiotic prophylaxis with their patients before a decision is made about administration.

### Recurrence of skin and soft tissue infections: identifying risk factors and treatment strategies [^b75b6ca2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

Management of recurrent SSTIs includes individuation of predisposing conditions and treatment whenever possible. Nonpharmacological interventions include weight and diabetes control, and patient education regarding skin care.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated only for recurring nonpurulent SSTIs (i.e. cellulitis and erysipelas), for patients with more than two episodes of recurrence per year. Prophylaxis targets beta-haemolytic Streptococci and drugs of choice are low dose oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, or erythromycin in case of penicillin allergy.

Recently, a Cochrane analysis reviewed the five clinical trials designed to set utility of antibiotic prophylaxis and found a reduction in recurrence by 69% (risk ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13–0.72), with an estimated number needed to treat (NNT) of six patients with nonpurulent SSTI to prevent a recurrence.

Duration of prophylaxis is not clearly defined, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, but usually continued for at least 6 months. Since the protective effect is lost after discontinuation, a personalized approach is suggested, based on frequency of recurrence and persistence of risk factors.

The counterpart of antibiotic prophylaxis is development of antimicrobial resistance, pharmacological side effects and risk of Clostridioides difficile infection. In particular, high rates of macrolide resistance are already described in Europe for Streptococcus spp. and cross resistance between macrolide and clindamycin is largely documented.

With these premises, the suggested approach is to target prophylaxis only for high-risk patients, selected by clinical scores, reducing antibiotics misuse.

In case of recurrent purulent infections and abscesses associated with pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa and foreign bodies, surgical debridement and cultures should be performed. After incision and drainage, 7 days of antibiotic course showed higher curative rate and less recurrences than surgery alone, even for noncomplicated abscesses.

### Reply to thornhill et al [^c01bc8b7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Regarding the study that indicates an excess 35 cases per month of IE in the United Kingdom 5 years after the guideline change, the statistical editor for the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care concluded that the methodology was at high risk of bias. A reanalysis of the same data showed no effect on IE trend.

In the study by Thornhill et al in 2022, once again, microbiological data are missing, and the methodology may cause inflated estimates. The distinction between IE and viridans group streptococcal IE (VGS-IE) is important because 73% of IE cases are caused by microorganisms not commonly attributed to dental procedures.

Our current study provides a 5-year follow-up of VGS-IE cases that could theoretically be associated with dental procedures. We are confident that we identified virtually all high-risk individuals from 1964 living in Sweden from 2008 to 2018. In our article, we note that although our results seem reassuring for Swedish policy makers, any extrapolation of the results depends on the assumption that Swedish dentists have adhered to the recommendation not to prescribe AP to high-risk individuals. It is problematic to compare the fall of AP in England and Sweden in the way that Thornhill et al do. They write that “dentists more frequently prescribe amoxicillin to treat dentoalveolar and other orofacial infections than for AP purposes.” This may be the case in England, but Swedish dentists have no such tradition because penicillin V is the first choice to treat these infections, sometimes combined with metronidazole. We also recognize that there are remaining indications for AP other than prevention of IE. AP is commonly used during dental implant placement, a procedure that is more frequent than invasive dental procedures among high-risk individuals (>30 000 vs >10 000 procedures/year, respectively). Because of this, if Swedish dentists adhere to the changed recommendation as diligently as UK dentists, we do not expect as dramatic a fall in amoxicillin prescriptions as seen in England.

Dental procedures in patients already receiving antibiotics—agent selection guidance states that if a patient is already receiving chronic antibiotic therapy with an antibiotic that is also recommended for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, it is prudent to select an antibiotic from a different class rather than to increase the dosage of the current antibiotic. For those taking an oral penicillin for secondary prevention of rheumatic fever or for other purposes and likely to harbor viridans group streptococci relatively resistant to penicillin or amoxicillin, the provider should select either clindamycin, azithromycin or clarithromycin for IE prophylaxis for a dental procedure, but only for patients shown in Box 3.

Definitions of certainty in the evidence and strength of recommendations—levels of certainty and user-facing implications are specified as follows: High certainty is defined as “We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect”; moderate certainty as “We are moderately confident in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different”; low certainty as “Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited. The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect”; and very low certainty as “We have very little confidence in the effect estimate. The true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.” For implications of strong versus conditional recommendations, patients: strong—“Most patients in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not. Formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences”; patients: conditional—“Most patients in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not.” Clinicians: strong—“Most patients should receive the intervention. Adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator”; clinicians: conditional—“Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that the clinician must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with his or her values and preferences. Decision aids may be useful in helping patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences.” Policy makers: strong—“The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations”; policy makers: conditional—“Policy making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.”

Journal of the American Dental Association (2015). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic prophylaxis–related harms and resistance in patients with prosthetic joints are outlined, noting that there is a long-standing and increasing concern that repeated exposure to antibiotics is a risk factor for the development of resistant bacterial species. Although there are no data regarding the risk of developing a drug reaction from 1 dose of amoxicillin prescribed to prevent a distant site infection such as PJI, older regimens with intramuscular injections and multiple oral doses suggest that more people who are given antibiotic prophylaxis would experience drug reactions from penicillin-type drugs—some of which may be fatal—than would be prevented from developing PJI, and there also is an increased risk of experiencing adverse reactions with increasing patient age (that is, in patients 70 years or older). Prolonged treatment with antibiotics is associated with infections secondary to changes in the gastrointestinal microbial flora, and Clostridium difficile infection potentially can cause pseudomembranous colitis; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that annually there are approximately 250,000 people with C difficile infections that require hospitalization or already affect hospitalized patients, resulting in 14,000 deaths per year, and investigators have identified clindamycin, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones as the inducing agents.

American Dental Association guideline—follow-up and duration of antibiotic therapy: There is little to no evidence supporting the common belief that a shortened course of antibiotics contributes to antimicrobial resistance; clinicians should reevaluate or follow up with their patient after 3 days to assess if there is resolution of systemic signs and symptoms, and if the patient’s signs and symptoms begin to resolve, clinicians should instruct the patient to discontinue antibiotics 24 hours after complete resolution, irrespective of reevaluation after 3 days; prescription medications, including antibiotics, should not be saved for later use nor shared with others, and the panel emphasizes the importance of patients’ discarding antibiotics safely at local disposal centers.

### Is spurious penicillin allergy a major public health concern only in high-income countries? [^ebb48b48]. BMJ Global Health (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Penicillins are the most common antibiotic class prescribed globally in primary, secondary and tertiary care for common and serious bacterial infections, including sepsis. They are cost-effective medications, available in parenteral and oral formulations and have an excellent safety profile. The downside to the use of penicillins is that they are most commonly implicated in adverse drug reactions including allergy or hypersensitivity, the latter owing to a greater chance of becoming sensitised following frequent exposure.

### Optimizing antimicrobial therapy in children [^1ed1f8ef]. The Journal of Infection (2016). Low credibility.

Management of common infections and optimal use of antimicrobial agents are presented, highlighting new evidence from the medical literature that enlightens practice. Primary therapy of staphylococcal skin abscesses is drainage. Patients who have a large abscess (>5 cm), cellulitis or mixed abscess-cellulitis likely would benefit from additional antibiotic therapy. When choosing an antibiotic for outpatient management, the patient, pathogen and in vitro drug susceptibility as well as tolerability, bioavailability and safety characteristics of antibiotics should be considered. Management of recurrent staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections is vexing. Focus is best placed on reducing density of the organism on the patient's skin and in the environment, and optimizing a healthy skin barrier. With attention to adherence and optimal dosing, acute uncomplicated osteomyelitis can be managed with early transition from parenteral to oral therapy and with a 3-4 week total course of therapy. Doxycycline should be prescribed when indicated for a child of any age. Its use is not associated with dental staining. Azithromycin should be prescribed for infants when indicated, whilst being alert to an associated ≥2-fold excess risk of pyloric stenosis with use under 6 weeks of age. Beyond the neonatal period, acyclovir is more safely dosed by body surface area (not to exceed 500 mg/m(2)/dose) than by weight. In addition to the concern of antimicrobial resistance, unnecessary use of antibiotics should be avoided because of potential later metabolic effects, thought to be due to perturbation of the host's microbiome.

### Ulcerated yellow-brown nodules on the chest [^e6f7148c]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 3: What is the most effective medical treatment for this disease? 
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V
B. Metronidazole
C. Liposomal amphotericin B
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol

Answers: 
A. Initial high dose parenteral penicillin G, followed by high dose oral penicillin V – Correct. Actinomyces are non–spore-forming, anaerobic Gram positive bacteria. Long-term intensive antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for actinomycosis. Actinomyces species have traditionally shown exquisite sensitivity to penicillin; however, prolonged treatment is necessary due to poor antibiotic penetration of the thick-walled masses and sulfur granules. This typically entails 2 to 6 weeks of initial parenteral antibiotics followed by oral antibiotics for 6 to 12 months.Severe disease may require surgical management.
B. Metronidazole – Incorrect. Metronidazole should not be used to treat actinomycotic infections without added antimicrobial agents as it is not active against pathogenic actinomycetes.
C. Liposomal amphotericin B – Incorrect. Although it may sound like one, actinomycosis is not a fungal infection. Liposomal amphotericin B is the treatment of choice for mucormycosis.
D. Long-term oral fluoroquinolone therapy – Incorrect. In vitro data suggest that fluoroquinolones should be avoided in actinomycosis. Other antibiotics that should be avoided include oxacillin, dicloxacillin, cephalexin, metronidazole, and aminoglycosides.
E. Rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol – Incorrect. This combination of antibiotics is the treatment of choice for tuberculosis.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^944881ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a detrimental effect on quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for these conditions should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists frequently prescribe antibiotics in the absence of these signs. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This review is the second update of the original version first published in 2014.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling, or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

We searched Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (26 February 2018 (discontinued)), CENTRAL (2022, Issue 10), MEDLINE Ovid (23 November 2022), Embase Ovid (23 November 2022), CINAHL EBSCO (25 November 2022) and two trials registries, and performed a grey literature search. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage, or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used a fixed-effect model in the meta-analysis as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to request missing information. We used GRADE criteria to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

There was one new completed trial on this topic since the last update in 2018. In total, we included three trials with 134 participants. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess One trial (72 participants) compared the effects of a single preoperative dose of clindamycin versus a matched placebo when provided with a surgical intervention (endodontic chemo-mechanical debridement and filling) and analgesics to adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis. We assessed this study at low risk of bias. There were no differences in participant-reported pain or swelling across trial arms at any time point assessed. The median values for pain (numerical rating scale 0 to 10) were 3.0 in both groups at 24 hours (P = 0.219); 1.0 in the antibiotic group versus 2.0 in the control group at 48 hours (P = 0.242); and 0 in both groups at 72 hours and seven days (P = 0.116 and 0.673, respectively). The risk ratio of swelling when comparing preoperative antibiotic to placebo was 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 2.56; P = 0.41). The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in this comparison was low. Two trials (62 participants) compared the effects of a seven-day course of oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo when provided with a surgical intervention (total or partial endodontic chemo-mechanical debridement) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth. Participants in both trials also received oral analgesics. We assessed one study at high risk of bias and the other at unclear risk of bias. There were no differences in participant-reported pain or swelling at any time point assessed. The mean difference for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3, where 0 was no pain) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours; and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The standardised mean difference for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours; and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The certainty of evidence for all the outcomes in this comparison was very low. Adverse effects, as reported in two studies, were diarrhoea (one participant in the placebo group), fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant in the antibiotic group) and dizziness preoperatively (one participant in the antibiotic group). Systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence suggests that preoperative clindamycin for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis results in little to no difference in participant-reported pain or swelling at any of the time points included in this review when provided with chemo-mechanical endodontic debridement and filling under local anaesthesia. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of postoperative phenoxymethylpenicillin for adults with localised apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth when provided with chemo-mechanical debridement and oral analgesics. We found no studies which compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

### New British and American guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis: do the changes make sense? A critical review [^0c08bd23]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy and the American Heart Association have radically revised their guidelines for the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis. This review discusses the evidence behind the most controversial changes and considers possible future developments.

Recent Findings

The new guidelines emphasize good oral hygiene for preventing viridans streptococcal endocarditis. Antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures is only recommended for patients with the highest-risk cardiac conditions. American Heart Association guidelines no longer recommend prophylaxis for urological and gastrointestinal procedures.

Summary

While only up to 6% of endocarditis cases may be prevented by antibiotic prophylaxis there is controversy as to what to recommend for the individual cardiac patient undergoing a given procedure. The new guidelines about dental prophylaxis are based on epidemiological studies that failed to include sufficient subjects undergoing specific interventions. When considering viridans streptococcal rather than total bacteraemia rates, asserting that the prevalence of bacteraemia after invasive dental procedures is similar to that after toothbrushing may be incorrect. The British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy report probably overestimates the risk of fatal anaphylaxis after an oral dose of amoxicillin. In contrast, the American Heart Association guidelines comment on the absence of any reports of fatal anaphylaxis associated with the antibiotic prophylaxis of endocarditis.

### Systemic antibiotics for symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess in adults [^56ad092a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dental pain can have a considerable detrimental effect on an individual's quality of life. Symptomatic apical periodontitis and acute apical abscess are common causes of dental pain and arise from an inflamed or necrotic dental pulp, or infection of the pulpless root canal system. Clinical guidelines recommend that the first-line treatment for teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis or an acute apical abscess should be removal of the source of inflammation or infection by local, operative measures, and that systemic antibiotics are currently only recommended for situations where there is evidence of spreading infection (cellulitis, lymph node involvement, diffuse swelling) or systemic involvement (fever, malaise). Despite this, there is evidence that dentists continue to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions. There is concern that this could contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacterial colonies both within the individual and within the community as a whole.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of systemic antibiotics provided with or without surgical intervention (such as extraction, incision and drainage of a swelling or endodontic treatment), with or without analgesics, for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 1 October 2013); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 9); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 1 October 2013); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 1 October 2013) and CINAHL via EBSCO (1980 to 1 October 2013). We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) International Trials Registry Platform and the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) on 1 October 2013 to identify ongoing trials. We searched for grey literature using OpenGrey (to 1 October 2013) and ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 1 October 2013). We placed no restrictions on the language or date of publication when searching the electronic databases.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of systemic antibiotics in adults with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess, with or without surgical intervention (considered in this situation to be extraction, incision and drainage or endodontic treatment) and with or without analgesics.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the results of the searches against inclusion criteria, extracted data and assessed risk of bias independently and in duplicate. We calculated mean differences (MD) (standardised mean difference (SMD) when different scales were reported) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous data and, where results were meta-analysed, we used a fixed-effect model as there were fewer than four studies. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information.

Main Results

We included two trials in this review, with 62 participants included in the analyses. Both trials were conducted in university dental schools in the USA and compared the effects of oral penicillin V potassium (penicillin VK) versus a matched placebo given in conjunction with a surgical intervention (total or partial pulpectomy) and analgesics to adults with acute apical abscess or symptomatic necrotic tooth (no signs of spreading infection or systemic involvement (fever, malaise)). We assessed one study as having a high risk of bias and the other study as having unclear risk of bias.The primary outcome variables presented were participant-reported pain and swelling (one trial also reported participant-reported percussion pain). One study reported the type and number of analgesics taken by participants. One study recorded the incidence of postoperative endodontic flare-ups (people who returned with symptoms that necessitated further treatment). Adverse effects as reported in one study were diarrhoea (one participant, placebo group) and fatigue and reduced energy postoperatively (one participant, antibiotic group). No studies reporting quality of life measurements were suitable for inclusion. Objective 1: systemic antibiotics versus placebo with surgical intervention and analgesics for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. Two studies provided data for the comparison between systemic antibiotics (penicillin VK) and a matched placebo for adults with acute apical abscess or a symptomatic necrotic tooth. Participants in one study all underwent a total pulpectomy of the affected tooth while participants in the other study had their tooth treated by either partial or total pulpectomy. Participants in both trials received oral analgesics. There were no statistically significant differences in participant-reported measures of pain or swelling at any of the time points assessed within the review. The MD for pain (short ordinal numerical scale 0 to 3) was -0.03 (95% CI -0.53 to 0.47) at 24 hours; 0.32 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.86) at 48 hours and 0.08 (95% CI -0.38 to 0.54) at 72 hours. The SMD for swelling was 0.27 (95% CI -0.23 to 0.78) at 24 hours; 0.04 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.55) at 48 hours and 0.02 (95% CI -0.49 to 0.52) at 72 hours. The body of evidence was assessed as at very low quality. Objective 2: systemic antibiotics without surgical intervention for adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess. We found no studies that compared the effects of systemic antibiotics with a matched placebo delivered without a surgical intervention for symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess in adults.

Authors' Conclusions

There is very low quality evidence that is insufficient to determine the effects of systemic antibiotics on adults with symptomatic apical periodontitis or acute apical abscess.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^ea139dd1]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Secondary outcomes

Table 2 shows the results of bacteriological eradication according to the culture taken at the test of cure evaluation (presence of group A streptococcus or not); frequency of relapses one month after first diagnosis; and frequency of complications or new pharyngotonsillitis during the study period. Twelve of the 15 patients who experienced relapses had bacteriological eradication at test of cure, including six out of eight in the five day group and six out of seven in the 10 day group. Only four patients had complications, all in the 10 day group, which all resolved: three were peritonsillitis and one was psoriasis, probably provoked by streptococci. Two of the three patients with peritonsillitis were referred to a specialist for surgery. According to patient diaries, time to first day of relief of sore throat was significantly shorter in the five day group compared with the 10 day group in the per protocol and modified intention to treat populations (P<0.001, log rank test; fig 2). The median time to relief of sore throat was four days after randomisation for both intervention groups. There was no difference between the groups for time to relief of fever recorded in patient diaries (P=0.48, log rank test).

Fig 2 
Time to first day of relief of sore throat according to patient diaries for five day and 10 day groups (per protocol population, n=381)

No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Most of the adverse events recorded on case report forms (assessed by physicians) were judged to be mild or moderate in intensity: 73% (97/132) and 23% (31/132), respectively, in the five day group and 61% (104/170) and 33% (56/170), respectively, in the 10 day group. The adverse events recorded by physicians were mainly diarrhoea, nausea, and vaginal discharge or itching. In all three categories, the 10 day group had higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events (table 4). Self reported adverse events in the patient diary supported the pattern of events recorded by physicians, but with a slightly higher incidence and longer duration of adverse events in both groups (table 4).

Journal of the American Dental Association (2008). Medium credibility.

Impact of antibiotic therapy on bacteremia from a dental procedure—the ability of antibiotic therapy to prevent or reduce the frequency, magnitude or duration of bacteremia associated with a dental procedure is controversial. Amoxicillin therapy has a statistically significant impact on reducing the incidence, nature and duration of bacteremia from dental procedures but does not eliminate bacteremia, and no data show that such a reduction as a result of amoxicillin therapy reduces the risk of or prevents IE. Trials report mixed results: neither penicillin V nor amoxicillin reduced the frequency of bacteremia versus untreated control subjects; penicillin or ampicillin reduced certain organisms yet there was no significant difference in the percentage of patients with positive cultures 10 minutes after tooth extraction; and patients treated with cefaclor did not have a reduction of postprocedure bacteremia. Contradictory results are also reported for erythromycin and clindamycin. For topical antiseptics, the preponderance of evidence suggests that there is no clear benefit; topical antiseptic rinses do not penetrate beyond 3 mm into the periodontal pocket, and on the basis of these data, it is unlikely that topical antiseptics are effective to significantly reduce the frequency, magnitude and duration of bacteremia associated with a dental procedure.

### A systematic review on effect of single-dose preoperative antibiotics at surgical osteotomy extraction of lower third molars [^caccccec]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of a single dose of preoperative antibiotic administered perorally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or topically for preventing infection and alveolar osteitis in lower third molar surgical extraction applying osteotomy.

Materials and Methods

The Medline, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for RCTs until August 2015. The primary outcome measure was postoperative inflammatory reactions, with a subgroup analysis of surgical site infection (SSI) and alveolar osteitis. A risk-of-bias assessment of the included trials was done according to the Cochrane guidelines.

Results

A total of 53 RCTs were identified; however, only 10 could be included in the present review. A meta-analysis of the 10 trials showed a statistically significant reduction in SSI and alveolar osteitis when antibiotics had been used (odds ratio [OR] = 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.47; P ≤ .00001). A subgroup meta-analysis of 6 trials showed that preoperative administration of antibiotics perorally or intravenously significantly reduced the incidence of SSI (OR = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.45; P = .0002). A meta-analysis of 5 trials showed that 2 g of preoperative oral amoxicillin was able to reduce the incidence of SSI and the difference was statistically significant (OR = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.59; P = .002). Seven trials reported on alveolar osteitis, 6 studies on oral use, 2 studies on amoxicillin, 2 on metronidazole, 2 on penicillin V, and 1 on the intravenous use of penicillin. The pooled results showed that preoperative antibiotics significantly reduced the prevalence of alveolar osteitis (OR = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.96; P = .04). The subgroup analysis showed that penicillin V was effective in reducing the incidence of alveolar osteitis (OR = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.30; P ≤ .0001).

Conclusions

A single oral dose of 2 g of amoxicillin before lower third molar osteotomy surgical extraction significantly decreased the incidence of SSI. A single dose of 0.8 g of penicillin V before lower third molar osteotomy surgical extraction significantly decreased the incidence of alveolar osteitis.

American Dental Association guideline—management when initial antibiotics do not respond and cautions: For cases that do not respond promptly to antibiotics, clinicians may consider either complementing first-line treatment with oral metronidazole or discontinuing first-line treatment and prescribing oral amoxicillin and clavulanate to enhance the efficacy against gram-negative anaerobic organisms; an antibiotic with a spectrum of activity similar to those recommended in Table can be continued if the antibiotic was initiated before the patient sought treatment, patients should be informed about symptoms that may indicate lack of antibiotic efficacy and adverse drug events, and while other antibiotics such as moxifloxacin have a reasonable spectrum of activity for the treatment of oral infections, there are US Food and Drug Administration black box warnings (indicating a serious safety hazard) for this antibiotic.

American Heart Association antibiotic regimens—general principles for dental prophylaxis specify that an antibiotic for prophylaxis should be administered in a single dose before the procedure; if the preprocedural dose is inadvertently not given, the dosage may be administered up to two hours after the procedure, and administration after the procedure should be considered only when the patient did not receive the preprocedural dose. When fever or other manifestations of systemic infection are present, it is important to obtain blood cultures and other relevant tests before administration of antibiotics intended to prevent infective endocarditis.

### Conference report on public health and clinical guidelines for anthrax [^f5585f2a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Treatment of Cutaneous Anthrax

Treatment with oral ciprofloxacin or doxycycline for 7–10 days is recommended for localized or uncomplicated cases of naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax, such as that associated with exposure to animals with anthrax, or to products such as hides from animals with anthrax. If susceptibility testing is supportive, oral therapy with penicillin V or amoxicillin may be used to complete the course of treatment. For severe cases of naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax with signs of systemic involvement, extensive edema, or lesions of the head and neck, IV therapy for 7–10 days using ciprofloxacin or doxycycline is preferred; IV penicillin G, if supported by susceptibility testing, may be used to finish the 7- to 10-day course. It was considered widely accepted knowledge that penicillin is very effective against B. anthracis, can render cutaneous lesions culture-negative within 24 hours, and has long been the treatment of choice in many parts of the world. Therefore, despite reports of penicillin-resistant isolates and the potential for inducible beta-lactamases, participants agreed that 7–10 days of penicillin is usually sufficient for treatment of uncomplicated naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax. However, adequate dosages of penicillins must be used, patients must be monitored for clinical response, and susceptibility testing must be conducted to confirm the appropriateness of the antimicrobial choice. Other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin are recommended as additional options for antimicrobial treatment of naturally acquired cutaneous anthrax.

### Once-daily amoxicillin versus twice-daily penicillin V in group A β-haemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis [^be9f93ef]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Rheumatic fever is a preventable chronic disease preceded by group A beta-haemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis.

Objective

To test the non-inferiority of once-daily (QD) oral amoxicillin to the recommended twice-daily (BID) oral penicillin V in GABHS pharyngitis.

Methods

This was a randomised non-inferiority trial carried out in a school-based clinic in New Zealand. Children presenting with GABHS pharyngitis were randomised to oral amoxicillin 1500 mg QD (or 750 mg if bodyweight was <or=30 kg) or to oral penicillin V 500 mg BID (or 250 mg if bodyweight was <or=20 kg) for 10 days. Observed medication and weekend diary cards were used to monitor adherence.

Outcome

Eradication of GABHS, determined with follow-up throat cultures on days 3-6, 12-16 and 26-36. GABHS isolates were serotyped to distinguish bacteriological treatment failures (and relapses) from new acquisitions. Non-inferiority was defined as an upper 95% confidence limit (CL) for the difference in success of eradication in the amoxicillin and penicillin V treatment groups of <or=10%.

Results

353 children with positive throat swabs for GABHS were randomised to amoxicillin (n = 177) or penicillin V (n = 176). The upper 95% CL for the differences in positive cultures between the antibiotics was 4.9% at days 3-6, 6.5% at days 12-16 and 8.5% at days 26-36. Treatment failures (including relapses) occurred at each visit in 5.8%, 12.7% and 10.7% of amoxicillin recipients and 6.2%, 11.9% and 11.3% of penicillin V recipients, respectively. No significant differences in resolution of symptoms were noted between treatment groups. One case of unsubstantiated acute rheumatic fever occurred after 7 days of amoxicillin.

Conclusion

In this adequately powered study, once-daily oral amoxicillin is not inferior to twice-daily penicillin V for the treatment and eradication of GABHS in children with pharyngitis.
