## Question

Hypercarbic respiratory failure etilogies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the etiologies of hypercarbic respiratory failure, organized by pathophysiology and supported by evidence. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition and diagnostic thresholds for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Then, I should categorize the causes by mechanism to structure the differential. Next, I will enumerate the major etiologies within each category, verify prevalence and overlap where available, and consider special populations. Finally, I will double-check for pitfalls like metabolic alkalosis and oxygen-induced hypercarbia and close with a concise synthesis that reflects multifactorial causation in many patients.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't anchor incorrectly. Hypercarbic respiratory failure, also called type II respiratory failure, is characterized by reduced alveolar ventilation leading to CO2 retention with respiratory acidosis, typically operationalized as PaCO2 greater than 50 mmHg and pH less than 7.35 in the acute setting, though GOLD also stratifies severity by PaCO2 and pH thresholds during COPD exacerbations, which helps align terminology across studies and guidelines [^115brhLM] [^115brhLM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanisms before I organize them. The most coherent way to classify causes is by pathophysiology: impaired respiratory drive from the central nervous system, increased dead space ventilation, ventilatory pump failure from neuromuscular or chest wall disorders, and increased CO2 production states. I should also keep in mind that many patients have multifactorial disease, so overlap is common and clinically important [^116fmvXg] [^116N24LF].

> I will now examine central nervous system depression of respiratory drive, because missing this delays definitive therapy. Sedative or opioid overdose, including heroin, depresses ventilatory control and can precipitate acute hypercarbia; similarly, anesthesia-related hypoventilation after procedures can present with hypercarbia even when oxygenation looks deceptively normal, so I need to check medication exposures carefully and correlate with blood gases rather than relying on pulse oximetry alone [^115brhLM] [^114Y9DD5]. Wait, let me verify the role of metabolic alkalosis; I initially thought it was a primary cause of hypercarbia, but that's not quite right — metabolic alkalosis blunts ventilatory drive and can perpetuate or worsen hypercarbia in patients with underlying ventilatory limitation, particularly COPD, so I should treat the alkalosis rather than label it as a primary etiology of hypercarbia itself [^114ZQdyr].

> Next, I should review increased dead space ventilation, since this is a classic driver in obstructive lung disease. COPD exacerbations increase physiologic dead space and dynamic hyperinflation, impairing CO2 elimination. Severe asthma can behave similarly during status asthmaticus, and both scenarios can progress to hypercarbic failure if not promptly treated with bronchodilators, corticosteroids, and appropriate ventilatory strategies when indicated [^115brhLM] [^112AieBR]. Let me consider the overlap syndromes as well. COPD plus obstructive sleep apnea compounds hypoventilation and is a recognized contributor to chronic and acute hypercarbia, reinforcing the need to screen for sleep-disordered breathing in appropriate patients [^115brhLM] [^114VQrkh].

> I need to check ventilatory pump failure next, because this is frequently underrecognized. Neuromuscular weakness such as myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, spinal cord injury, and myopathies reduce inspiratory capacity and can precipitate hypercarbia when vital capacity falls and respiratory rate rises; guidelines advise early consideration of noninvasive ventilation in these settings and careful monitoring of forced vital capacity to anticipate failure, which I should verify at the bedside rather than relying on appearance alone [^116dqaez] [^112Uz73V]. Chest wall and pleural diseases like severe kyphoscoliosis, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and large pleural effusions also impose restrictive mechanics and can lead to chronic hypercarbia; in obesity hypoventilation syndrome, leptin resistance and blunted chemoreflexes further impair ventilatory responses, so I should confirm BMI, sleep history, and baseline bicarbonate to identify this phenotype early [^117LJ3HK] [^111VUGBZ].

> But wait, what if CO2 production is the driver rather than impaired elimination. Increased metabolic CO2 load from fever, sepsis, or high carbohydrate loads can transiently raise PaCO2, and in patients with limited ventilatory reserve this can tip them into hypercarbic failure; I should double-check for systemic infection, hyperthermia, and nutrition sources when the clinical picture doesn't fit purely mechanical explanations [^116fmvXg].

> Let me consider prevalence and overlap to ensure I'm not oversimplifying. In severe COPD, hypercarbic respiratory failure is common, with estimates around 25%, and contemporary cohorts show that most patients with hypercarbic failure have more than one contributing cause, with at least two causes in nearly half and three or more in a substantial minority, underscoring the need for a comprehensive assessment rather than a single-diagnosis mindset [^115brhLM] [^116N24LF]. I should confirm that population data also implicate heart failure, opioid use, and respiratory muscle weakness as independent associations with hypercarbic failure hospitalizations, which aligns with bedside experience [^116fmvXg].

> I should double-check special populations where the threshold to escalate support differs. In pregnancy, normal physiologic changes can mask and complicate hypercarbic failure, and airway management is more challenging, so I need a lower threshold for early blood gas assessment and ventilatory support planning. In pediatrics, noninvasive ventilation can be effective for selected hypercarbic presentations, but evidence is limited and patient selection is crucial, so I must weigh risks and benefits carefully and monitor closely for early failure [^113eMMZU] [^1169fNGN].

> Hold on, I should verify diagnostic adjuncts that help me avoid unnecessary arterial punctures. A venous blood gas with PvCO2 less than 45 mmHg reliably rules out hypercarbia, whereas values above that threshold warrant confirmatory arterial testing; end-tidal CO2 correlates with PaCO2 but has wide limits of agreement, so I can use it for trending but should not substitute it for blood gas confirmation when decisions hinge on precise CO2 levels [^115F4EsF] [^112Hh2wx]. Let me reconsider the role of bicarbonate; an elevated serum bicarbonate, especially greater than 27 mmol/L, can flag occult sleep-related hypoventilation in at-risk patients and prompt early evaluation for obesity hypoventilation syndrome or neuromuscular disease even before daytime hypercapnia is overt [^111VUGBZ].

> Next, I should review oxygen titration because iatrogenic hypercarbia is preventable. In patients at risk of hypercarbic failure, liberal oxygen can suppress hypoxic drive and worsen V/Q mismatch, so I should target SpO2 88–92% and avoid abrupt withdrawal that can trigger rebound hypoxemia. This is particularly important in COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and neuromuscular disease, where ventilatory drive is fragile [^114tKPGd] [^112Uz73V]. Wait, let me verify that this applies beyond COPD; yes, BTS oxygen guidance extends the 88–92% target to other hypercapnia-prone conditions pending blood gas results, which supports a conservative oxygen strategy while diagnostics proceed [^114tKPGd].

> I will now synthesize the etiologies succinctly while preserving the mechanistic framework. Hypercarbic respiratory failure arises from four principal mechanisms: central depression of respiratory drive including sedative or opioid overdose and anesthesia-related hypoventilation; increased dead space ventilation in COPD, asthma, and overlap syndromes; ventilatory pump failure from neuromuscular weakness, chest wall deformity, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and pleural disease; and increased CO2 production in hypermetabolic states, with many patients harboring multiple concurrent causes that compound impairment and delay recovery if not all addressed [^116fmvXg] [^115brhLM] [^116N24LF].

---

Hypercarbic respiratory failure (HRF) is caused by **alveolar hypoventilation** [^116fmvXg] from impaired respiratory drive, increased dead space, or reduced minute ventilation [^116fmvXg]. The most common etiologies are **COPD exacerbations** [^1137ocL1], obesity hypoventilation syndrome, and opioid or sedative overdose [^115brhLM]; other causes include neuromuscular disorders, chest wall deformities, severe asthma, and advanced heart failure [^114Nv9o2]. Less frequent contributors are metabolic alkalosis [^114ZQdyr], sleep-related hypoventilation, and high CO2 production states [^116fmvXg]. Management centers on **treating the underlying cause** [^112XA9Ur], correcting acidosis, and providing ventilatory support (NIV or invasive ventilation) when indicated [^111LmNWc].

---

## Impaired respiratory drive

Impaired respiratory drive reduces ventilatory effort and leads to CO2 retention [^116fmvXg]. Common causes include:

- **Opioid or sedative overdose**: Commonly causes HRF by depressing central respiratory drive [^114Nv9o2].

- **Metabolic alkalosis**: Elevated HCO3− blunts ventilatory drive, worsening hypercarbia, especially in COPD [^114ZQdyr].

- **Sleep-related hypoventilation**: OSA and obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) cause nocturnal hypoventilation and daytime hypercarbia [^111VUGBZ].

---

## Increased dead space ventilation

Increased dead space reduces effective ventilation and causes CO2 retention [^116fmvXg]. Key causes include:

- **COPD exacerbations**: Air trapping and increased dead space are major drivers of HRF [^112AieBR].

- **Severe asthma**: Airflow obstruction and gas trapping increase dead space [^notfound].

- **Pulmonary embolism**: Increased physiological dead space from V/Q mismatch [^112AVLgN].

---

## Reduced minute ventilation

Reduced minute ventilation from **pump failure** or **mechanical constraints** causes CO2 retention [^115kv5Ld]. Common causes include:

- **Neuromuscular disorders**: Myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré, ALS, and diaphragmatic paralysis reduce ventilatory capacity [^115kv5Ld].

- **Chest wall deformities**: Kyphoscoliosis, severe obesity, and pleural effusions restrict ventilation [^115kv5Ld].

- **Advanced heart failure**: Pulmonary edema and respiratory muscle fatigue reduce ventilation [^116fmvXg].

---

## Increased CO2 production

Increased CO2 production can overwhelm normal ventilatory capacity, especially when baseline ventilation is impaired [^116fmvXg]. Causes include **fever**, **sepsis**, and **high carbohydrate loads** [^notfound].

---

## Summary of common etiologies

| **Category** | **Common etiologies** |
|-|-|
| Impaired respiratory drive | - Opioid/sedative overdose <br/> - Metabolic alkalosis <br/> - Sleep-related hypoventilation (OSA, OHS) |
| Increased dead space | - COPD exacerbation <br/> - Severe asthma <br/> - Pulmonary embolism |
| Reduced minute ventilation | - Neuromuscular disorders <br/> - Chest wall deformities <br/> - Advanced heart failure |
| Increased CO2 production | - Fever <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - High carbohydrate load |

Hypercarbic respiratory failure reflects **alveolar hypoventilation** from diverse causes; **identifying and treating the underlying etiology** — along with appropriate ventilatory support — are essential to management [^112XA9Ur].

### Comparison of end-tidal, arterial, venous, and transcutaneous P [^112Hh2wx]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We investigated the measurement of end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P ETCO2) with a capnometer in patients with respiratory failure, and we determined whether this technique could provide an alternative to measurement of P aCO2 using arterial blood gas analysis in the clinical setting.

Methods

We measured P ETCO2 in subjects with hypoxemic and hypercarbic respiratory failure using a capnometer. We simultaneously measured P aCO2, venous partial pressure of carbon dioxide (P v̄CO2), and transcutaneously measured partial pressure P CO2 (P tcCO2). We analyzed agreements among these parameters with Bland-Altman analysis. We obtained 30 samples from subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure and 30 samples from subjects with hypercarbic respiratory failure.

Results

Thirty subjects with hypoxemic respiratory failure and 18 subjects with hypercarbic respiratory failure participated in this study. Significant relationships were found between P ETCO2 and P aCO2, between P tcCO2 and P aCO2, and between P v̄CO2 and P aCO2. Bland-Altman analysis of P ETCO2 and P aCO2 in all subjects revealed a bias of 6.48 mm Hg (95% CI 4.93–8.03, P < .001) with a precision of 6.01 mm Hg. Bland-Altman analysis of P ETCO2 and P aCO2 with hypoxemic respiratory failure revealed a bias of 5.14 mm Hg (95% CI 3.35–6.93, P < .001) with a precision of 4.80 mm Hg. Bland-Altman analysis of P ETCO2 and P aCO2 in subjects with hypercarbic respiratory failure revealed a bias of 7.83 mm Hg (95% CI 5.27–10.38, P < .001) with a precision of 6.83 mm Hg.

Conclusions

P ETCO2 can be measured simply using a capnometer, and P ETCO2 measurements can estimate P aCO2. However, the limits of agreement were wide. Therefore, care providers must pay attention to the characteristics and errors of these devices. These results suggest that measurement of P ETCO2 might be useful for screening for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the clinical setting.

### Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure in COPD [^112AieBR]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

COPD is a progressive inflammatory process affecting both the airways and alveolar structures of the lungs. Exacerbations of COPD are episodes of acute worsening of this inflammatory process, often triggered by infections. The most severe exacerbations are characterized by substantial air trapping and inspiratory muscle overload, which leads to hypercapnic respiratory failure. Pharmacologic therapies focus on intense bronchodilator administration (usually by aerosol), corticosteroids, and antibiotics. Respiratory life support technologies are often needed for severe exacerbations and range from carefully titrated supplemental O 2 administration to positive-pressure ventilation (both invasive and noninvasive). Future life support strategies will likely involve extracorporeal life support technologies.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^114UbfqK]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Heart failure in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — prevalence and management: The prevalence of systolic or diastolic heart failure in COPD patients ranges from 20% to 70%, and its annual incidence is between 3–4%. Incident heart failure is a significant and independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Unrecognized heart failure may mimic or accompany acute COPD; 40% of COPD patients that are mechanically ventilated because of hypercapnic respiratory failure have evidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Treatment with β1-blockers improves survival in heart failure and is recommended in patients with heart failure who also have COPD. Selective β1-blockers should be used, and only used, to treat people with COPD for approved cardiovascular indications; not solely for the purpose of preventing exacerbations of COPD. Acute heart failure should be treated according to usual heart failure guidelines since there is no evidence to support an alternative management strategy, and noninvasive ventilation added to conventional therapy improves outcomes for patients with either hypercapnic respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD as well as heart failure with acute pulmonary edema.

### Myasthenia gravis crisis coinciding with asthma exacerbation in a patient with recent heroin use: three causes of acute hypercarbic respiratory failure [^1164A5Pb]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old woman with a history of asthma, hypertension and substance abuse disorder was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with hypercapnic respiratory failure. After the history was obtained, patient admitted heroin use earlier that day. The initial physical examination revealed right eye ptosis, diplopia, fatigability of neck flexion and extension. She also presented with wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase. Pupils were 4mm, with sluggish response to light bilaterally. CT chest with contrast showed a large mediastinal mass. Three different processes coexisted in this patient: simultaneous occurrence of a myasthenia gravis crisis, asthma exacerbation and a component of heroin use. This case highlights a series of overlapping clinical features that could lead to potential confounding and misdiagnosis. Respiratory symptoms improved after initial treatment for asthma exacerbation, but ptosis, diplopia and fatigability of neck muscles persisted.

### An official American Thoracic Society statement: update on the mechanisms, assessment, and management of dyspnea [^115kv5Ld]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Dyspnea — physiological mechanisms and example causes are organized into increased respiratory drive (e.g., interstitial lung disease, pleural effusion, pulmonary vascular disease, congestive heart failure) and chemoreceptor stimulation with conditions leading to acute hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and/or acidemia; additional categories include increased dead space and/or acute hypercapnia, impaired ventilatory pump (e.g., muscle weakness, airflow obstruction), metabolic acidosis, renal disease, decreased oxygen carrying capacity (e.g., anemia), decreased release of oxygen to tissues (e.g., hemoglobinopathy), decreased cardiac output, pregnancy, and behavioral factors (hyperventilation syndrome, anxiety disorders, panic attacks). Impaired ventilatory mechanics are listed separately and include airflow obstruction (asthma, COPD, laryngospasm, aspiration of foreign body, bronchitis), muscle weakness (myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre, spinal cord injury, myopathy, post-poliomyelitis syndrome), and decreased compliance of the chest wall (severe kyphoscoliosis, obesity, pleural effusion). Notes indicate that in most cardiopulmonary disease states a combination of increased respiratory drive and impaired mechanics will be present, and that heart failure includes both systolic and diastolic dysfunction with differing symptom patterns and potential contributions from metaboreceptors.

### Association between the acidemia, lactic acidosis, and shock severity with outcomes in patients with cardiogenic shock [^111pRzMw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Overall, severe systemic acidemia with a low blood pH in patients with CS likely reflects the inability of the respiratory system and endogenous buffering mechanisms to compensate for acid‐base derangements including lactic and nonlactic acidosis. Respiratory acidosis (hypercarbic respiratory failure) appeared to be a major contributor to low blood pH in our cohort, particularly for patients without elevated lactate levels. Potential contributors to hypercarbic respiratory failure in patients with CS may include increased physiologic dead space from chronic lung disease, acute lung injury, and pulmonary vascular disease in addition to compromised lung perfusion from CS itself. These noncardiovascular disease processes may confer an adverse prognosis in patients with CS, explaining in part the association between acidemia and mortality and highlighting the importance of inadequate compensation for metabolic acidosis attributable to respiratory failure as a determinant of poor prognosis in CS. Although lactate appeared to be a better overall predictor of mortality, patients with CS with a lower blood pH were more likely to die independent of their shock severity; this was less apparent in SCAI shock stage B, presumably caused by the presence of nonlactic metabolic and respiratory acidosis, which may be less harmful. The patients with the worst outcomes were those who simultaneously manifested both marked lactic acidosis and severe systemic acidemia, particularly in SCAI shock stage E. This suggests that the severity of lactic acidosis coupled with an impaired homeostatic response leading to severe systemic acidemia is particularly detrimental. Notably, the observed survival for patients in SCAI shock stage E appeared worse for those with low blood pH than those with high lactate levels. As we attempt to develop an evidence‐based definition of hemometabolic CS using laboratory variables, these data suggest that both high lactate levels and low blood pH should be incorporated into the definition to reflect both severe hypoperfusion and failing homeostatic mechanisms.

Guidelines

Table 2 lists recent guideline documentsthat provide a useful perspective for clinicians.

Table 2
Clinical guidelines and recommendations on key issues relating to non-invasive ventilation for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

These documents are largely concordant with some nuances. All documents recommend the use of non-invasive ventilation for patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnia; two guidelines suggest the use of high intensity non-invasive ventilation (ie, near or complete normalization of PaCO 2). The ONMAP document endorses a specific threshold of PaCO 2 (≥ 52 mm Hg) to provide guidance for Medicare coverage determination. Although the European Respiratory Society and the ONMAP documents allow for clinician discretion for the initiation of non-invasive ventilation treatment around the time of the exacerbation (with a recommendation to reassess hypercapnia after two to four weeks), the American Thoracic Society endorses reassessment in two to four weeks after the initial episode based on the findings in the RESCUEand UK HOT-HMVstudies.

### NIV for hypercapnic respiratory failure: AVAPS vs S / T BIPAP… [^114xf1Ho]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

NIV for Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure: AVAPS vs S/T BIPAPClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview 1. Overall Study Design and Plan This is a single center, randomized trial that will include a total of 100 adult subjects aged 18 or older with hypercapnic respiratory failure of all etiologies. The investigators will randomize patients in a single-blinded fashion to BIPAP S/T or AVAPS during the duration of their hospitalization. The investigators will assess ABG at baseline, 1 hour after initial placement on BIPAP S/T or AVAPS, and between hours 24–48 of use. The investigators will record the pre-NIV pH and PaCO2, post-NIV pH and PaCO2, length of hospital stay in the medical ICU or telemetry unit, days on NIV, need for intubation, transition to medical ICU care in patients who were initially admitted to telemetry, and in-hospital mortality.

All collected laboratory data are already done as part of usual care for all patients placed on NIV when a patient is on the telemetry unit or medical ICU. The groups will undergo stratified randomization based on whether they are initially admitted to medical ICU or medical telemetry. Patients from medical ICU or telemetry units will be randomized to one of the following arms: Arm 1: AVAPS mode Arm 2 2: BIPAP S/T mode Device: Average Volume-Assured Pressure Support Device: Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure Spontaneous Timed

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^116aBdMc]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Personalised treatments are interventions with a substantial impact on meaningful clinical outcomes, such as decreased dyspnea, reduced healthcare use, and reduced mortality for well defined subgroups of patients with a particular disorder. For example, provision of oxygen to patients with severe hypoxemia, lung volume reduction surgery for patients with heterogeneous emphysema and low exercise capacity, and possibly the use of bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids for symptomatic patients with frequent exacerbationscould improve survival for well defined subgroups of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Emerging data suggest that non-invasive ventilation in patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure could provide a similar clinical benefit to patients. The objective of this narrative review is to describe the current state of the practice of non-invasive ventilation for this patient population, provide a framework for understanding the benefits, and discuss potential future directions in its implementation.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1127uJQN]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Treatment of patients with COPD and chronic stable hypercapnia with non-invasive ventilation is associated with improvements in several clinical outcomes, including mortality. Clinicians should note that the intervention has only been shown to be beneficial when initiated in chronic stable state or during recuperation from a severe exacerbation. Patient selection, ideal device and ventilator mode to deliver treatment, and implementation of ambulatory non-invasive ventilation remain important areas of research. Meanwhile, internists should consider screening patients with COPD for referral to specialized centers that provide this service. Although recurrent acute hypercapnic respiratory failure is the most frequent reason for referral, we should be reminded that this intervention might offer benefits to some patients with COPD who have stable chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Early consideration and implementation of non-invasive ventilation in these patients could potentially improve quality of life and reduce healthcare use.

Methodology

Clinical questions were gathered in the PICOT (Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Time) format to define the scope of the guideline and inform the literature search. Systematic electronic database searches were conducted in order to identify potentially relevant studies for inclusion in the guideline. For each clinical question the following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (including MEDLINE In-Process), Ovid EMBASE, EMSCO CINAHL, Ovid PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library (including the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). An initial search was carried out in November 2010 using a combination of indexed and free-text terms defining the clinical questions that had been agreed by the guideline group as important in formulating guidelines in AHRF. It was limited to studies after 1990, in adults, in journals published in English and where at least an abstract was available. The searches identified a total of 582 potential papers which were subsequently supplemented by publications known to members or resulting from additional searches undertaken by the writing groups after 2010. The literature search was run again for relevant publications between 2010 and 2013 in September 2013, yielding a further 308 potentially relevant references. Additional references were subsequently included from personal collections.

Appraisal was performed using the criteria stipulated by the AGREE collaboration. Each paper was appraised by at least two reviewers. The writing lead for each section read the title and abstract of papers identified and agreed with at least one member of each writing group whether such a paper was definitely, possibly relevant or not relevant to the section. The criteria used were whether the paper addressed a clinical question, whether the study method used was satisfactory and that it was available in English. Full papers were obtained for all relevant or possibly relevant abstracts. Two members for each section independently appraised each paper using the SIGN critical appraisal checklists. An evidence level was assigned to each study using SIGN methodology (table 1) and recommendations formulated according to this evidence base (table 2).

### Severe respiratory failure: advanced treatment options [^114HaHTS]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Severe respiratory failure (including acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome) continues to be associated with significant mortality and morbidity in patients of all ages.

Objective

To review the laboratory and clinical data in support of and future directions for the advanced treatment of severe respiratory failure.

Data Sources

MEDLINE/PubMed search of all relevant primary and review articles.

Data Synthesis

Our understanding of lung pathophysiology and the role of ventilator-induced lung injury through basic science investigation has led to advances in lung protective strategies for the mechanical ventilation support of patients with severe respiratory failure. Specific modalities reviewed include low-tidal volume ventilation, permissive hypercapnia, the open lung approach, recruitment maneuvers, airway pressure release ventilation, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, prone positioning, and extracorporeal life support. The pharmacologic strategies (including corticosteroids, surfactant, and nitric oxide) investigated for the treatment of severe respiratory failure are also reviewed.

Conclusion

In patients with severe respiratory failure, an incremental approach to the management of severe hypoxemia requires implementation of the strategies reviewed, with knowledge of the evidence base to support these strategies.

Epidemiology

COPD prevalence estimates vary widely depending on the applied diagnostic criteria and ascertainment method. One study estimates that 174.5 million individuals worldwide had moderate to severe COPD in 2015. The global prevalence of COPD has increased from 10.7% in 1990, to 11.7% in 2010, and further to 13.1% in a report from 2019. These findings are in sharp contrast to the marked decline in global smoking prevalence by 27.2% in men and 37.9% in women since 1990and highlight the prolonged course of COPD as well as the potential increasing role of other exposures and host factors to its development. In the US, 28.9 million individuals (13.5% of adults aged 20–79 years) are estimated to have been diagnosed with COPD by spirometry. Approximately one in 10 of these individuals has severe COPD characterised by a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) result of < 50% of predicted. By contrast, data are scant for the prevalence of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD. In a study from Germany, the prevalence of arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) of ≥ 50 mm Hg (roughly the threshold for considering non-invasive ventilation for domiciliary use) was found to be 9% in a group of 231 consecutive patients with severe COPD (FEV 1 < 50%). Using the aforementioned prevalence estimates of severe COPD and elevated concentrations of arterial carbon dioxide, we estimate that approximately 260 000 patients with COPD may be considered for domiciliary non-invasive ventilation in the US.

### Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in critically ill children with cardiac disease [^113Tzy6G]. Pediatric Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive ventilation is effective in respiratory failure from various etiologies. This study aimed to analyze the efficacy of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in pediatric cardiac patients. NPPV was used (1) as an alternative means of respiratory support in patients with hypoxemic or hypercarbic respiratory failure or with signs of respiratory distress that were considered to require intubation; or (2) as a preventive measure in patients with high risk for extubation failure. Between 2008 and 2011, there were 107 episodes of NPPV use in 82 patients. Their median age was 57 days (range 1 day to 18 years), and weight was 4.1 kg (range 1.7–68). Within the first hour of NPPV, partial pressure of carbon dioxide/fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) was significantly increased, and arterial pCO2, and respiratory rate were decreased. This decrease in respiratory rate and increase in PaO 2/FiO2 continued during the first 24 h of therapy, and pCO2 was decreased during the first 6 h. In 59.8% of cases, NPPV was successfully used without the need for tracheal intubation. The Aristotle Basic Complexity score, presence of infection, residual cardiac defect, and pH < 7.36 in the first hour were independent predictors of NPPV failure. We conclude that NPPV improved oxygenation and decreased respiratory effort in pediatric cardiac patients, 59.8% of whom eventually did not receive intubation. A high-complexity surgical score, presence of infection, residual cardiac defect, and pH < 7.36 in the first hour are predictors of NPPV failure, which occurs in most patients > 24 h after the onset of therapy.

### Oxygen supplementation and hyperoxia in critically ill cardiac patients: from pathophysiology to clinical practice [^116oZwWF]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

An important subgroup of critically ill patients who may be particularly harmed by a liberal oxygen strategy and subsequent hyperoxia are those with hypercarbic respiratory failure, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In these patients, chronic elevation in carbon dioxide (CO 2) results in a drive to breathe triggered primarily by hypoxia, with excess oxygen administration serving to decrease respiratory drive. Supplemental oxygen also destabilizes already optimized ventilation-perfusion matching, further exacerbating hypercarbia. For these patients, we recommend careful titration of FiO 2 to maintain SpO 2 at 88% to 92% and no higher.

COVID-19 infection is associated with both cardiovascular complications and poorer outcomes for patients with cardiovascular disease. Compared with the evidence for other causes of hypoxic respiratory failure, there is limited high-quality evidence to suggest oxygen targets should be any different in COVID-19. An ongoing RCT is comparing lower (60 mm Hg) vs higher (90 mm Hg) PaO 2 goals with a planned enrollment of 780 COVID-19 patients. Until more data are available, consistent with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines, we recommend an SpO 2 goal between 92% and 96% for patients with acute COVID-19 infection.

G1. (also A3) For most patients with known COPD or other known risk factors for hypercapnic respiratory failure (eg, morbid obesity, cystic fibrosis, chest wall deformities or neuromuscular disorders or fixed airflow obstruction associated with bronchiectasis), a target saturation range of 88–92% is suggested pending the availability of blood gas results (grade A for COPD, grade D for other conditions).
G2. Some patients with COPD and other conditions are vulnerable to repeated episodes of hypercapnic respiratory failure. In these cases, it is recommended that treatment should be based on the results of previous blood gas estimations during acute exacerbations. For patients with prior hypercapnic failure (requiring NIV or intermittent positive pressure ventilation) who do not have an alert card, it is recommended that low-concentration oxygen treatment should be started using a 24% Venturi mask at 2–3 L/min (or a 28% Venturi mask at 4 L/min or nasal cannulae at 1–2 L/min if a 24% mask is not available) with an initial target saturation of 88–92% pending urgent blood gas results. These patients should be treated as a high priority by emergency services, and the oxygen concentration should be reduced if the saturation exceeds 92% but increased if it falls below 88% (grade D).

Discussion

Implementation of ECMO

The first report of successful ECMO support in an adult patient was published by Hill in 1972. ECMO can be implemented either as veno-arterial (VA) or veno-venous (VV) therapy. For complete cardiopulmonary support, VA ECMO is used while primary respiratory failure including severe oxygenation failure is usually treated with VV ECMO. Both VA and VV approaches require a pump that is capable of generating flow rates of 3–5 L · min -1 in order to ensure sufficient organ perfusion and oxygenation. This discussion will confine itself to VV ECMO used in refractory respiratory failure, including clinical indications of pneumonia (bacterial, fungal, viral, aspiration), status asthmaticus, traumatic pulmonary contusions, pulmonary embolism, as well as for secondary causes such as ARDS associated with overwhelming sepsis or systemic inflammatory conditions. Large bore cannulae drain venous blood that is pumped through an oxygenator where it is cleared of carbon dioxide, oxygenated, and then actively returned back to the patient's circulation. While both ECMO and CPB use somewhat similar technologies in terms of vascular cannulation, tubing for blood flow, and even oxygenators and pumps, the fundamental difference is that CPB incorporates a reservoir for adjusting real-time, total blood volume. Because there is no such reservoir in ECMO, meticulous attention to de-airing is critical when establishing perfusion.

It is important to remember that hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis are very potent pulmonary vasoconstrictors and these patients often have evidence of acute right heart failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Addressing these issues with ECMO can often break the vicious and often fatal downward spiral of hypoxemia, hypercarbic (respiratory) acidosis, right heart failure, low cardiac output and the resulting metabolic acidosis from impaired oxygen availability at the cellular level. In fact, severe respiratory acidosis with hemodynamic instability requiring vasoactive support can be an indication for ECMO.

The most comprehensive guidelines on ECMO are published by the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). These guidelines address personnel, training, resources, use of ECMO, and quality assurance. In the subsequent sections, we will discuss the points that most challenge a new practitioner who is newly faced with care of the patient placed on VV ECMO and its clinical implementation, focusing on practical clinical applicability of this life-saving therapy.

Miscellaneous risk factors of NIV failure

Other risk factors for NIV failure in hypoxemic ARF are the delay between admission and NIV use, number of fiberoptic bronchoscopies performed, duration of NIV use, increase in radiographic infiltrates within the first 24 h, and causal diagnosis (as de novo) of ARF. Age has been demonstrated to be a risk factor (with a low OR) only in a minority of studies.

Hypercapnic respiratory failure

The utilization of NIV in hypercapnic ARF, as well as the risk factors for its failure, has probably been more intensively studied compared to its use in hypoxic ARF (Table 2). Although hypercapnic ARF covers ARF due to neurological disorders (such as neuromuscular disorders) or other acute or chronic lung disorders (such as restrictive lung disease), most of the studies done in this field have involved patients with COPD exacerbations.

High-flow nasal therapy (HFNT) — COPD exacerbations and hypercapnia: HFNT delivers heated and humidified air-oxygen blends via special devices at rates up to 8 L/min in infants and up to 60 L/min in adults and has been associated with decreased respiratory rate and effort, decreased work of breathing, improved gas exchange, improved lung volume and dynamic compliance, and improved oxygenation and clinical outcomes in acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. In COPD with hypercapnia, HFNT has been reported to improve oxygenation and ventilation, decrease hypercarbia and improve health-related quality of life during an acute exacerbation and in select patients with stable hypercapnic COPD, although interpretation is limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity, and short follow-up. HFNT did not prevent intubation in a randomized controlled trial in patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation. The European Respiratory Society Clinical Practice Guidelines recommend trialling NIV prior to use of HFNT in patients with COPD and hypercapnic ARF, and there is a stated need for well-designed, prospective, randomized and controlled multicenter trials to study HFNT effects in acute or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^115icLu5]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

WHY YOU SHOULD ORDER A VBG TO SCREEN FOR ACUTE HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE

Hospitalists often order blood gases to evaluate patients with RF for the presence of hypercarbia. Hypercarbic RF occurs when ventilatory lung dysfunction leads to excess CO 2 in the blood. Many mechanisms lead to hypercarbia, including central nervous system depression and respiratory neuromuscular/thoracic cage dysfunction. It is important to note that patients can have hypercarbia without acute hypercarbic respiratory failure. Increases in physiologic dead space account for CO 2 accumulation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Timely diagnosis may prevent delayed treatment or unnecessary low‐value care, such as a neurological workup for altered mentation from hypercarbia.

Studies comparing blood gas analysis have shown promising results when looking at PvCO 2 as a screening tool for hypercarbia. A 2002 prospective study first reported data on the efficacy of VBG screening for hypercarbic RF. Investigators compared 196 paired samples of VBG and ABG of patients presenting with RF (including COPD exacerbation, pneumonia, heart failure, and asthma). In this study, a PvCO 2 of 45 mmHg or greater identified all 56 cases of arterial hypercarbia (PaCO 2 > 50 mmHg) with 100% sensitivity and 57% specificity. A prospective validation study assessed 107 patients who presented with acute COPD exacerbations. When comparing ABG and VBG samples using the screening cut‐off of PvCO 2 of 45 mmHg or greater, VBG detected all 43 cases of arterial hypercarbia with 100% sensitivity and 47% specificity. Investigators concluded that employing the VBG screening test would decrease ABG orders by 29%.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114eHfDY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Mechanisms of benefit and rationale of non-invasive ventilation

Respiratory symptoms of COPD originate from hyperinflation of the lungs due to emphysematous loss of elastic recoil and increased airflow resistance in small airways from inflammatory changes of chronic bronchitis. These parenchymal and airway changes result in mismatching of the lung ventilation and perfusion and in consequent gas exchange abnormalities. Hyperinflation, in turn, means that respiratory muscles have to operate at a shorter than optimal resting length. Consequently, respiratory muscles have chronic adaptions that include atrophy and a tendency for more slow twitch, high endurance fibre types. A disequilibrium between the elastic (hyperinflation) and resistive (narrowed, collapsible airways) loads and capacity to counteract these loads (respiratory pump function) result in respiratory failure.

Non-invasive ventilation involves the provision of positive airway pressure to augment inspiration. The positive airway pressure from the ventilator is provided via a mask interface placed on a patient's face (figure 1). Although the exact mechanism of benefit is unknown in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, non-invasive ventilation can favorably impact several of these pathophysiological mechanisms. After the first night of non-invasive ventilation, patients with COPD have higher average tidal volumes (the amount of inspired and expired air with each respiratory cycle) compared with matched controls without non-invasive ventilation, despite cessation of assisted ventilation, throughout the day. This favorable breathing pattern of higher tidal volume and unchanged respiratory rate is maintained over six months. One explanation might be that ventilatory response to carbon dioxide inhalation after non-invasive ventilation is improved. Indeed, a strong correlation has been shown between the decrease in nocturnal PaCO 2 during non-invasive ventilation and a heightened ventilatory response to carbon dioxide rebreathing. Windisch and colleagues showed persistent improvements in diurnal PaCO 2 concentrations after non-invasive ventilation was applied with the goal of normocapnia. Normocapnia while on non-invasive ventilation was accompanied by sustained improvement in PaCO 2 and bicarbonate concentrations while the patient was awake and off non-invasive ventilation. Functional respiratory imaging data suggest the recruitment of collapsed small airway units and improved ventilation or perfusion matching. Application of positive airway pressure at the airway opening could serve as a splint that abrogates a premature small airway closure, thereby improving exhalation. As such, several studies have shown non-invasive ventilation results in modest decreases in total lung capacity, residual volumeand higher FEV 1. Although these studies did not aim to determine exact onset and duration of the salutary changes in lung volumes, these effects seem to be evident as early as day fiveand persist through six to 12 months. Furthermore, non-invasive ventilation might improve lung edema, reduce a pro-inflammatory state, and enhance innate immunity, most likely by facilitating the elimination of carbon dioxide, a signalling molecule that mediates adverse effects in the lung. The improvement in hyperinflation seems to correlate with the reduction in PaCO 2 concentrations. Non-invasive ventilation could allow respiratory muscle rest and reversal of muscle fatigue. Nonetheless, respiratory muscle strength appears unchanged when measured directly via electromagnetic phrenic nerve stimulation, in contrast to some studies that showed an improved performance in volitional indices, presumably due to motivational factors. A study from 2022 of 30 patients with COPD on non-invasive ventilation for a year showed an improvement in the thickening fraction of the diaphragm with a statistically significant change in hyperinflation indices, perhaps indicating improved function of the diaphragm. Figure 2 briefly summarises the pathophysiology of hyperinflation and potential salutary effects of non-invasive ventilation.

### Carbon dioxide intoxication: the clinical syndrome, its etiology and management with particular reference to the use of mechanical respirators… [^116XoiNA]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

INTRODUCTION Carbon dioxide intoxication is now recognized as a syndrome that can occur in persons with disorders which greatly reduce alveolar ventilation. The symptoms and clinical findings in this condition vary in character and severity and may simulate other disease entities. With moderate acidosis and hypercapnia, the patient may have no complaints, or the only symptoms noted may be weakness, lassitude, irritability, mild confusion, or headache. More severe respiratory acidosis can cause carbon dioxide narcosis with coma, respiratory depression and circulatory failure. Frequently, severe or prolonged narcosis results in the death of the patient. Retention of carbon dioxide is most commonly observed in individuals with chronic lung disease which results in impaired ventilation, particularly obstructive emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis.

On this background carbon dioxide intoxication can develop when ventilation becomes mechanically more difficult; e.g., with a respiratory infection: 637–670.

### Bench-to-bedside review: permissive hypercapnia [^115FsWKw]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Current protective lung ventilation strategies commonly involve hypercapnia. This approach has resulted in an increase in the clinical acceptability of elevated carbon dioxide tension, with hypoventilation and hypercapnia 'permitted' in order to avoid the deleterious effects of high lung stretch. Advances in our understanding of the biology of hypercapnia have prompted consideration of the potential for hypercapnia to play an active role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and tissue injury. In fact, hypercapnia may protect against lung and systemic organ injury independently of ventilator strategy. However, there are no clinical data evaluating the direct effects of hypercapnia per se in acute lung injury. This article reviews the current clinical status of permissive hypercapnia, discusses insights gained to date from basic scientific studies of hypercapnia and acidosis, identifies key unresolved concerns regarding hypercapnia, and considers the potential clinical implications for the management of patients with acute lung injury.

### Acute metabolic alkalosis perpetuating hypercarbia… [^114ZQdyr]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

METABOLIC alkalosis leads to hypercarbia. The increase in the blood Pco2 owing to alveolar hypoventilation is the respiratory compensation for metabolic alkalosis as the ventilatory drive is blunted by the elevated Hco3- levels. 1 Hypercarbia induced by a metabolic alkalosis is of no clinical consequence in most normal persons, since the rise in Pco2 rarely exceeds 10 mm Hg, but it can lead to severe carbon dioxide narcosis in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who already are severely hypoxic and hypercarbic. Metabolic alkalosis owing to diureticinduced intravascular volume, chloride, or potassium depletion2 usually requires more than 24 hours to be generated. 2, 3 Because of this, metabolic alkalosis as the cause for persistent hypercarbia in subjects with COPD is generally not considered in the first few hours after hospitalization.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114VQrkh]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

An important subgroup to consider in the discussion of non-invasive ventilation is the obstructive sleep apnea and COPD overlap syndrome. These patients have been systematically excluded from most randomized controlled trials of non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD, although they might benefit particularly well from the intervention. Another important consideration is whether one should modify the positive airway pressure modality strategy to continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation when obstructive sleep apnea is the predominant pathology in the overlap syndrome, akin to the recommendation in the obesity hypoventilation syndrome with severe sleep apnea, where continuous positive airway pressure rather than non-invasive ventilation is the first line option. Patients with the overlap syndrome have lower 5 year survival rates than those obstructive sleep apnea even when treated with continuous positive airway pressure. However, in a prospective cohort, continuous positive airway pressure treatment in patients with the overlap syndrome improved survival and decreased hospital admissions. Whether adding high intensity non-invasive ventilation strategy to adequate end-expiratory pressure to maintain airway patency would serve to improve outcomes in this group of patients is not known. When confronted with patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome and COPD overlap, it might be challenging to determine the primary factor responsible for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Nonetheless, pragmatic goals relating to positive airway pressure treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome are similar to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD and include correction of sleep hypoxemia, obstructive events and hypercapnia. In the absence of robust clinical trials in this population, the authors tend to use high intensity non-invasive ventilation when clinical evaluation points toward COPD as the biological cause for chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure, and positive airway pressure treatment when obesity hypoventilation syndrome or obstructive sleep apnea predominate.

Abstract

Venous blood gases (VBGs) are safe and effective at screening for hypercarbic respiratory failure. Multiple studies have validated that a VBG with a PvCO 2 less than 45 reliably rules out hypercarbia. The use of VBGs for the initial screening of hypercarbia when hypercarbic respiratory failure is suspected can reduce the overall use of arterial blood gases which are more painful and take more time and expertise to perform.

### Sodium bicarbonate therapy for acute respiratory acidosis [^115yXbBJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Respiratory acidosis is commonly present in patients with respiratory failure. The usual treatment of hypercapnia is to increase ventilation. During the recent surge of COVID-19, respiratory acidosis unresponsive to increased mechanical ventilatory support was common. Increasing mechanical ventilation comes at the expense of barotrauma and hemodynamic compromise from increasing positive end-expiratory pressures or minute ventilation. Treating acute respiratory acidemia with sodium bicarbonate remains controversial.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized controlled trials of administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidemia. A recent review concluded that alkali therapy for mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis might be useful but was based on the conflicting and not conclusive literature regarding metabolic acidosis. This strategy should not be extrapolated to treatment of respiratory acidemia. Low tidal volume ventilation in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has beneficial effects associated with permissive hypercapnia. Whether the putative benefits will be negated by administration of alkali is not known. Hypercapnic acidosis is well tolerated, with few adverse effects as long as tissue perfusion and oxygenation are maintained.

Summary

There is a lack of clinical evidence that administration of sodium bicarbonate for respiratory acidosis has a net benefit; in fact, there are potential risks associated with it.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^114A1ywW]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should no longer be seen as a condition for which little can be done. Novel pharmacotherapeutic interventions, surgical and procedural advances, and respiratory assist devices have provided numerous ways to help patients with COPD and treatable traits. For nearly 30 years, non-invasive ventilation, the application of positive pressure through a mask interface placed outside of the airway, has been the cornerstone for treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure due to COPD exacerbation. Clinical trials indicate that this intervention could benefit patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure in a stable state. This narrative review aims to provide the necessary background for internists to consider this therapeutic option for their COPD patients. We discuss the mechanism of action and implementation, and provide a glimpse into the future of this promising intervention.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1133nt6p]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effects of acidosis in critical illness are complex and depend on multiple factors, including the etiology of the acidosis (hypercapnic versus metabolic), the degree of acidosis and whether the acidosis accumulates acutely or more gradually, where compensatory or adaptive mechanisms may blunt its effects. While acidosis is traditionally associated with poor outcome in critical illness, it is not clear to what extent - if any - this is a causal relationship. In any case, simple avoidance of acidosis is generally not feasible in the critically ill. In fact, conventional protective ventilation strategies that minimize lung stretch increase the prevalence of hypercapnic acidosis (HCA) in the critically ill, and have been clearly demonstrated to save lives in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, there is also a clear potential for harm with HCA or metabolic acidosis (MAC), whether due to acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), exposure for prolonged periods of time (for example, increased risk of infection) or high concentrations. These complexities are further underlined by the findings in multiple preclinical studies that acidosis may have direct effects which can protect cells and organs in the setting of acute organ injury. Thus, managing acidosis is an integral component of critical care, and efforts to deepen our understanding of its consequences are therefore welcome.

If a patient is known to have chronic hypercarbia, and the patient's chronic baseline level is known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's chronic baseline level (Level B). If a patient is known or suspected to have chronic hypercarbia but the patient's chronic baseline PaCO2 level is not known, the PaCO2 level before apnea testing should be at the patient's estimated chronic baseline. However, in this circumstance, if apnea is present, clinicians should perform ancillary testing in addition (Level A).

### Causes of hypercapnic respiratory failure: a population-based case-control study [^114Nv9o2]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, our study provides evidence for the multifactorial nature of HRF and the range of potential contributing factors. In addition to COPD, other causes including CCF, opioid use and respiratory muscle weaknesses are significantly associated with HRF hospitalisations. These findings have important implications for the assessment and management of patients with HRF and highlight the need for comprehensive evaluation to ensure that all treatable factors are addressed.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for acute respiratory failure: a review of potential indications, clinical practice and open research questions [^115VPPPW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R) is a form of extracorporeal life support (ECLS) largely aimed at removing carbon dioxide in patients with acute hypoxemic or acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, so as to minimize respiratory acidosis, allowing more lung protective ventilatory settings which should decrease ventilator-induced lung injury. ECCO 2 R is increasingly being used despite the lack of high-quality evidence, while complications associated with the technique remain an issue of concern. This review explains the physiological basis underlying the use of ECCO 2 R, reviews the evidence regarding indications and contraindications, patient management and complications, and addresses organizational and ethical considerations. The indications and the risk-to-benefit ratio of this technique should now be carefully evaluated using structured national or international registries and large randomized trials.

### Permissive hypercapnia [^112NYue6]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Mechanical ventilation using high tidal volume (VT) and transpulmonary pressure can damage the lung, causing ventilator-induced lung injury. Permissive hypercapnia, a ventilatory strategy for acute respiratory failure in which the lungs are ventilated with a low inspiratory volume and pressure, has been accepted progressively in critical care for adult, pediatric, and neonatal patients requiring mechanical ventilation and is one of the central components of current protective ventilatory strategies.

### Pediatric noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [^1169fNGN]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in both acute hypoxic and hypercarbic forms of pediatric respiratory failure, including its mechanism of action and implementation. DATA SOURCES: Studies were identified through a MEDLINE search using respiratory failure, pediatrics, noninvasive ventilation, and mechanical ventilation as key words. STUDY SELECTION: All original studies, including case reports, relating to the use of noninvasive positive pressure in pediatric respiratory failure were included. Because of the paucity of published literature on pediatric NPPV, no study was excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Study design, numbers and diagnoses of patients, types of noninvasive ventilator, ventilator modes, outcome measures, and complications were extracted and compiled. DATA SYNTHESIS: For acute hypoxic respiratory failure, all the studies reported improvement in oxygenation indices and avoidance of endotracheal intubation. The average duration of NPPV therapy before noticeable clinical improvement was 3 hrs in most studies, and NPPV was applied continuously for 72 hrs before resolution of acute respiratory distress. In patients with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure, application of NPPV resulted in reduction of work of breathing, reduction in CO(2) tension, and increased serum bicarbonate and pH. These patients are older than patients in the acute hypoxic respiratory failure group and, in addition to improved blood gas indices, they reported improvement in subjective symptoms of dyspnea. Improvement in gas exchange abnormalities and subjective symptoms occurred within the same time span (the first 3 hrs) as in the acute hypoxic respiratory failure group. However, use of noninvasive techniques in patients with acute hypercarbic respiratory failure continued after resolution of acute symptoms. Complications related to protracted use of NPPV were common in this group. CONCLUSIONS: NPPV has limited benefits in a group of carefully selected pediatric patients with acute hypoxic and hypercarbic forms of respiratory failure. The routine use of this technique in pediatric respiratory failure needs to be studied in randomized controlled trials and better-defined patient subsets.

### Effect of ventilator mode on ventilator-free days in critically ill adults: a randomized clinical trial [^114U3RNv]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

In sensitivity analyses, we used alternative definitions of the trial population and alternative statistical methods for analyzing the primary outcome, including an analysis adjusting for baseline covariates and an analysis among all patients enrolled in the trial, including those enrolled during the washout periods. Effect modification was assessed in a proportional odds model by including an interaction term between trial-group assignment and a prespecified baseline variable. Prespecified potential effect modifiers included age, presence of COPD, duration of invasive mechanical ventilation before enrollment, F 2 before enrollment, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score at enrollment, presence of shock requiring vasopressors at enrollment, and the indication for mechanical ventilation (hypoxemic respiratory failure, hypercarbic respiratory failure, and altered mental status).

The data and safety monitoring board reviewed a single, planned interim analysis for safety after the first 3 months of enrollment (e-Appendix 1). No interim analysis for efficacy was carried out. For the final analysis of the primary outcome, a 2-sided P value of < .05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. All analyses other than the primary analysis of the primary outcome were considered hypothesis generating, and no statistical corrections were made for multiple comparisons. All analyses were performed using R version 4.3.0 software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### Risk of readmission and mortality following hospitalization with hypercapnic respiratory failure [^115brhLM]. Lung (2020). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypercapnic respiratory failure:

- **Definition**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure (type II respiratory failure) is a state of reduced alveolar ventilation with subsequent respiratory acidosis (PaCO₂ > 50 mmHg).
- **Pathophysiology**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure is most frequently caused by drug overdose, COPD, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, and the overlap syndrome of COPD and obstructive sleep apnea.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of hypercapnic respiratory failure in patients with severe COPD is approximately 25%.
- **Disease course**: Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure develops rapidly (within minutes to hours). Clinical manifestations include increasing dyspnea, lethargy, hypoxemic, disorientation, tachycardia, altered mental status, hypoventilation, hyperinflation, and need for ventilatory support. The disease decreases the QoL with increased risk of readmission and longer periods of hospital stay.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypercapnic respiratory failure in hospitalized patients is associated with significant mortality (36%).

### A case of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal for postpneumonectomy acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113xQ9jw]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, the advantages of VV-ECMO include comprehensive support for both hypercarbic and hypoxic respiratory failure and greater flow rates, allowing anticoagulation levels to be titrated to patient risk profile. With proper securement of cannulae, patients can be mobilized pending institutional policy and provider experience. The disadvantages of VV ECMO are that it requires more resources for initiation (potentially transesophageal echocardiography or fluoroscopy) and monitoring (dedicated specialized staff) of the circuit and oxygenator function. Whether 2-site or a single-site dual-lumen strategy, VV ECMO is susceptible to recirculation requiring further resources to reposition. Depending upon the patient's type of respiratory failure (hypoxic, hypercarbic, mixed), risk profile for bleeding, and need to mobilize in the context of hospital policy, the appropriate support platform can be selected.

Conclusion

The present systematic review demonstrates that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are associated with favorable blood gas parameters in patients with respiratory failure and metabolic alkalosis, but did not provide conclusive results for clinically important outcomes. Future well-designed and large randomized trials should investigate the effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors on these outcomes, particularly mortality, duration of hospital stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation.

### The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation / Heart Failure Society of America guideline on acute mechanical circulatory support [^115m417J]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Acute hypoxemic and hypercapnic respiratory failure — definitions and ARDS scoring tied to ECMO consideration — are outlined as follows: Acute hypoxemic failure is defined as severe arterial hypoxemia refractory to supplemental oxygen, and Murray scores are commonly used to assess the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with scores of 3 or more prompting consideration of veno-venous (VV)-ECMO use. Acute hypercapnic respiratory failure involves inadequate gas exchange with a PCO2 value of more than 50 mm Hg owing to carbon dioxide retention, and some degree of hypercapnia can also be an anticipated and acceptable consequence of a lung-protective ventilation strategy used as part of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment. In selected patients who are not responsive to usual management strategies and have inadequate gas exchange despite supportive measures and ventilation strategies, ECMO can be a useful modality.

### Diurnal hypercapnia in patients with neuromuscular disease [^111gcx6w]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Subjects with progressive neuromuscular diseases undergo a typical sequence of respiratory compromise, leading from normal unassisted gas exchange to nocturnal hypoventilation with normal daytime gas exchange, and eventually to respiratory failure requiring continuous ventilatory support. Several different abnormalities in respiratory pump function have been described to explain the development of respiratory failure in subjects with neuromuscular weakness. Early in the progression of respiratory failure, the use of nocturnal assisted ventilation can reverse both night- and day-time hypercapnia. Eventually, however, diurnal hypercapnia will persist despite correction of nocturnal hypoventilation. The likely beneficial effects of mechanical ventilatory support include resting fatigue-prone respiratory muscles and resetting of the central chemoreceptors to PaCO(2). Recent experience shows that select patients who require daytime ventilation can be supported with non-invasive ventilation continuously to correct gas exchange abnormalities while avoiding detrimental aspects of tracheostomy placement.

### Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow oxygen therapy for severe community-acquired pneumonia [^112pNTkf]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

NIV is the first-line treatment for acute hypercapnic respiratory failure because of COPD exacerbations, obesity, neuromuscular disease and chest wall deformity. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure demonstrated that NIV compared with usual care decreases the risk of mortality by 46% and reduces the risk of tracheal intubation by 65%. Moreover, NIV reduced the PaCO 2 levels, the length of hospital stay, the incidence of complications not associated with such therapy, and improved pH as well as PaO 2 levels. Specifically, in patients with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and SCAP, NIV was associated with significant reduction of endotracheal intubation and length of ICU stay. Moreover, in a subgroup of patients with COPD, NIV was associated with 2-months improved survival. Among more than 900 patients enrolled in RCTs, positive inspiratory pressure-NIV reduced the need for tracheal intubation by 65% and led to an overall reduction of 55% of in-hospital mortality, with increasing benefit with lower pH at inclusion: such evidence is corroborated by observational data indicating similar efficacy outside the procedures of RCTs. The number of patients needed to treat in order to avoid tracheal intubation and death are, respectively, around 4 and 10, making NIV in hypercapnic patients one of the most efficient treatments in ICU. Until other data emerge, a NIV trial through oronasal or face mask should be considered as the gold standard for the first-line treatment of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure.

CONCLUSIONS

Hospitalists frequently consider the diagnosis of hypercarbic RF. Hospitalists can safely reduce the number of medically unnecessary and uncomfortable ABGs by substituting VBGs. In revisiting the case, the hospitalist should order the easily obtained VBG testing as an initial screen for hypercarbic RF. If normal, this can rule out hypercarbic RF.

Good practice point

Management of hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis due to excessive oxygen therapy (avoidance of life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia):
✓ If a patient is suspected to have hypercapnic or respiratory failure due to excessive oxygen therapy, the oxygen therapy must be stepped down to the lowest level required to maintain a saturation range of 88–92%. This may be achieved using 28% or 24% oxygen from a Venturi mask or 1–2 L/min via nasal cannulae depending on oxygen saturation and subsequent blood gas measurements.
✓ Sudden cessation of supplementary oxygen therapy can cause life-threatening rebound hypoxaemia with a rapid fall in oxygen saturations below the starting oxygen saturation prior to the start of supplementary oxygen therapy.

G3. Initial oxygen treatment of cystic fibrosis exacerbations should be similar to the initial oxygen treatment of COPD exacerbations with target saturation 88–92% (see sections 8.12.1–8.12.2) (grade D).
G4. In the initial management of musculoskeletal and neurological disorders with acute respiratory failure, or acute-on-chronic respiratory failure, aim at an oxygen saturation of 88–92% and measure blood gases to determine if NIV will be required (grade D).

Good practice point regarding patients with neurological disorders

✓ Patients with respiratory failure due to neurological disorders or muscle disease are at high risk of dying and require urgent assessment to determine if they are likely to require non-invasive or invasive ventilator support rather than oxygen therapy. Monitor these patients with blood gases and regular spirometry (forced vital capacity). Patients' wishes regarding this form of treatment should established as early as possible in the course of the illness, ideally before an acute episode has developed.
G5. Morbidly obese patients (body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m 2), even without evidence of coexistent obstructive sleep apnoea are at risk of hypoventilation and should be given titrated oxygen to maintain a target saturation of 88–92% (grade D).
G6. NIV should be considered for hypercapnic patients with COPD, CF, neuromuscular disorders or morbid obesity who are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure if the pH is < 7.35 or [H+] > 45 nmol/L (grade D) (see BTS/ICS Guidelines for the Ventilatory Management of Acute Hypercapnic Respiratory Failure in Adults).

### Peripheral venous blood gas analysis for the diagnosis of respiratory failure, hypercarbia and metabolic disturbance in adults [^112zNcvJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) is the reference standard for the diagnosis of respiratory failure (RF) and metabolic disturbance (MD), but peripheral venous blood gas analysis (PVBGA) is increasingly being used for the estimation of carbon dioxide, pH, and other variables in the context of acutely unwell adults presenting to hospitals and emergency departments.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review is to evaluate the performance of PVBGA by comparing it with the reference standard ABGA, which is assumed to be error-free for the diagnosis of (1) respiratory failure, (2) hypercarbia, and (3) metabolic disturbance (the three target conditions) in adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the performance of the index test to diagnose nine specific subtypes of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance. The definitions for these additional conditions are determined by changes to one or more of the following: pH (acidity), pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), HCO 3 (bicarbonate), as stated in the Methods section of this review (target conditions). We aimed to explore the following covariates: participant demographics (e.g. age, weight, and sex); participant comorbidities (e.g. chronic lung disease, chest wall deformity, and central nervous system disorder such as spinal cord injury); and the indication for blood gas sampling (e.g. shortness of breath, critical illness, resuscitation, trauma, or whilst under general anaesthesia).

Search Methods

On 10 July 2024, we searched the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and LILACS. We also manually searched 19 respiratory and critical care journals, and we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

We considered consecutive series studies and case-control studies that directly compared the index test PVBGA to the reference standard ABGA for adults over the age of 16 years. The included studies contained data for any one of the target conditions of respiratory failure and metabolic disturbance, as determined by individual changes to pO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen), pCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide), pH (acidity), and HCO 3 (bicarbonate) concentration. Studies that only provided mean values for summed data were ineligible for inclusion. However, we invited authors of such studies to provide individual patient data for inclusion in this systematic review. There are nine studies awaiting classification.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently evaluated the quality of the relevant studies and extracted data from them. We conducted a quality assessment using the QUADAS-2 tool. Our statistical analysis used 2 x 2 tables for the positive and negative results of each test. We estimated a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity.

Main Results

We included six studies (919 participants) in our quantitative analysis. All studies were at high risk of bias due to one or more of the following factors: patient selection, since it was unclear if consecutive patients were included or where they were located; index test, with poor reporting of cut-offs; flow and timing domain because the fraction of inspired oxygen was frequently not stated and any difference between the collection of the VBGA and the ABGA could introduce bias. Respiratory failure For the diagnosis of respiratory failure of any type, when using PVBGA, the estimated summary sensitivity (Sn) was 97.6% (95% credible interval (CI) 94.1 to 99.4) and the estimated summary specificity (Sp) was 36.9% (95% CI 17.1 to 60.1) (6 studies, 805 participants of whom 291 (36%) were diagnosed with respiratory failure by ABGA; sensitivity: low-certainty evidence; specificity: very low certainty evidence). Isolated hypercarbia For the diagnosis of isolated hypercarbia (regardless of oxygen level), when using PVBGA, the estimated summary Sn was 97.1% (95% CI 93.3 to 99.2); the estimated summary Sp value was 53.9% (95% CI 39.8 to 66.7) (6 studies with 805 participants, 269 (33%) with ABGA confirmation; low-certainty evidence). Other findings Results for metabolic disturbance and our secondary target conditions are presented in the full review.

Authors' Conclusions

Very limited data suggest PVBGA performs poorly as a diagnostic test for respiratory failure compared to the reference standard of ABGA. The index test PVBGA was highly sensitive for the diagnosis of respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia, but its specificity was poor for these two primary target conditions. The high sensitivity means PVBGA may have a useful role as a "rule out test" for respiratory failure and isolated hypercarbia; however, the high false-positive rates make the clinical interpretation of a positive test difficult. Moreover, we are uncertain regarding these estimates because we have only low to very low certainty about the evidence. Further studies that use (ABGA) established thresholds for the diagnosis of each target condition are needed.

WHAT YOU SHOULD DO INSTEAD

When a patient has suspected hypercarbic RF, hospitalists should obtain a VBG due to the ease, safety, and relative comfort of an VBG as compared to an ABG. Depending on the clinical case and pre‐test probability, hospitalists may proceed with treatment directed towards hypercarbic RF or obtain an ABG to confirm and quantify the hypercarbia. Hospitalists can rule out hypercarbic respiratory failure by finding a normal venous pH and PCO 2.

### Respiratory acidosis [^116fmvXg]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Respiratory acidosis, or primary hypercapnia, is the acid-base disorder that results from an increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Acute respiratory acidosis occurs with acute (Type II) respiratory failure, which can result from any sudden respiratory parenchymal (eg, pulmonary edema), airways (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or asthma), pleural, chest wall, neuromuscular (eg, spinal cord injury), or central nervous system event (eg, drug overdose). Chronic respiratory acidosis can result from numerous processes and is typified by a sustained increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, resulting in renal adaptation, and a more marked increase in plasma bicarbonate. Mechanisms of respiratory acidosis include increased carbon dioxide production, alveolar hypoventilation, abnormal respiratory drive, abnormalities of the chest wall and respiratory muscles, and increased dead space. Although the symptoms, signs, and physiologic consequences of respiratory acidosis are numerous, the principal effects are on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Treatment for respiratory acidosis may include invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support and specific medical therapies directed at the underlying pathophysiology.

### Obesity hypoventilation syndrome: current theories of pathogenesis [^117LJ3HK]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent primary publications and discuss the impact these finding have on current understanding on the development of hypoventilation in obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS), also known as Pickwickian syndrome.

Recent Findings

As a result of the significant morbidity and mortality associated with OHS, evidence is building for pre-OHS intermediate states that can be identified earlier and treated sooner, with the goal of modifying disease course. Findings of alterations in respiratory mechanics with obesity remain unchanged; however, elevated metabolism and CO2 production may be instrumental in OHS-related hypercapnia. Ongoing positive airway pressure trials continue to demonstrate that correction of nocturnal obstructive sleep apnea and hypoventilation improves diurnal respiratory physiology, metabolic profiles, quality of life, and morbidity/mortality. Finally, CNS effects of leptin on respiratory mechanics and chemoreceptor sensitivity are becoming better understood; however, characterization remains incomplete.

Summary

OHS is a complex multiorgan system disease process that appears to be driven by adaptive changes in respiratory physiology and compensatory changes in metabolic processes, both of which are ultimately counter-productive. The diurnal hypercapnia and hypoxia induce pathologic effects that further worsen sleep-related breathing, resulting in a slowly progressive worsening of disease. In addition, leptin resistance in obesity and OHS likely contributes to blunting of ventilatory drive and inadequate chemoreceptor response to hypercarbia and hypoxemia.

### Acidosis in the critically ill-balancing risks and benefits to optimize outcome [^1152N3eJ]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Acidosis is associated with poor outcome in critical illness. However, acidosis - both hypercapnic and metabolic - has direct effects that can limit tissue injury induced by many causes. There is also a clear potential for off-target harm with acute exposure (for example, raised intracranial pressure, pulmonary hypertension), and with exposure for prolonged periods (for example, increased risk of infection) or at high doses. Ongoing comprehensive determination of molecular, cellular and physiologic impact across a range of representative pathologies will allow us to understand better the risks and benefits of hypercapnia and acidosis during critical illness.

### Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and non-invasive ventilation in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111uZTNY]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Economic and societal perspective

Chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD carries a poor prognosis. In a query of electronic medical records, among 491 patients with compensated hypercapnia of various causes, with 170 (35%) having COPD, each 5 mm Hg increase in PaCO 2 was associated with an increased all cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 1.03 to 1.16). Over the course of a year, these patients accounted for 1030 hospital admissions and 218 (44.4%) had ≥ two hospital admissions. Therefore, implementing non-invasive ventilation in this context could reduce healthcare use and costs. In a retrospective study of the Medicare Limited Data Set (2012–18), patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure who received non-invasive ventilation treatment experienced reduced risk of mortality (relative risk reduction 39%) and reduced hospital admissions (17%) compared with a matched cohort who did not have reductions. Furthermore, a cost effectiveness analysis, based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, showed a favorable incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of $50 856 (£42 406, €49 818) in the USA.

Clearly, the burden of the evidence suggests a salutary effect for non-invasive ventilation in the setting of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and COPD. In the following sections, we provide the reader with general recommendations for some of the unresolved issues that surround non-invasive ventilation implementation.

Which patients with COPD would benefit from non-invasive ventilation?

Early data for the efficacy of non-invasive ventilation in patients with COPD and stable, chronic hypercapnia were not very encouraging. In 2013, a meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled trials encompassing 245 patients suggested benefits for patients who had higher PaCO 2 concentrations at baseline (≥ 55 mm Hg), who used nocturnal non-invasive ventilation > 5 h per night and with high inspiratory positive airway pressure (≥ 18 cm H 2 O). This general notion of patient selection for optimal outcomes guided the design of three randomized controlled trials of one year duration, which inform contemporary practice. The details of these clinical trials are summarized in table 1.

### Alkali therapy for respiratory acidosis: a medical controversy [^113iDKf1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Alkali therapy for certain organic acidoses remains a topic of ongoing controversy, but little attention has been given to a related medical controversy, namely the prescription of alkali for respiratory acidosis. We first describe the determinants of carbon dioxide retention in the 2 types of respiratory failure; hypercapnic respiratory failure and hypoxemic respiratory failure with coexisting hypercapnia. We then highlight the deleterious consequences of severe acidemia for several organ systems, particularly the cardiovascular and central nervous systems. We argue that alkali therapy is not indicated for respiratory acidosis as a simple acid-base disturbance. Notwithstanding, we recommend prescription of alkali for severe acidemia caused by mixed acidosis (ie, combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis) or permissive hypercapnia. We examine the utility of alkali therapy in various clinical scenarios incorporating respiratory acidosis. We conclude that controlled studies will be required to test the impact of alkali therapy on clinical outcomes of these clinical settings. Such studies should also examine the optimal mode of administering alkali (amount, rate, and tonicity) and the blood pH to be targeted. The development of new buffers should be explored, especially systems that do not generate carbon dioxide or even consume it.

### Things we Do for No reason ™: arterial blood gas testing to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure [^113LQ6Rv]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hospitalists use blood gas analysis to evaluate respiratory and metabolic conditions. Information from blood gas testing can confirm or rule out diagnoses, assess the severity of conditions, and monitor treatments. Blood gases measure the pH, PCO 2 (partial pressure of carbon dioxide) and PO 2 (partial pressure of oxygen); and provide calculated values including bicarbonate and base excess. Hypercarbia (or hypercapnea) may be identified on a blood gas and can be the result of respiratory failure. Acute exacerbations of COPD were the ninth most common primary discharge diagnosis in 2018 and are a frequent cause of hypercarbic respiratory failure. Collectively, this results in the regular use of a blood gas to screen for hypercarbic respiratory failure in the hospital setting.

### Navigating hypoxemic respiratory failure in critically ill cardiac patients [^112AVLgN]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory failure is a common reason for admission to cardiac intensive care units (CICUs), and the prevalence of respiratory failure is increasing. In their tertiary care CICUs, Jentzer and colleagues described a rising prevalence of respiratory failure, from 15% in 2007 to 38% in 2018. Acute respiratory failure is an umbrella term encompassing acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (AHRF) and hypercarbic failure. Hypoxemia, or a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO 2) below the normal range of 80–100 mm Hg, frequently leads to hypoxia, a failure of oxygenation at the tissue level. AHRF is often defined as a PaO 2 to fraction of inspiratory oxygen < 300. This narrative review focuses on the pathophysiology, epidemiology, and management of AHRF for patients with significant left ventricle (LV) or right ventricle (RV) dysfunction.

Physiologic mechanisms of hypoxemia in patients with cardiac critical illness are multifold and synergistic. They include ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, or an imbalance between ventilation and perfusion in the lungs. An extreme V/Q mismatch occurs with right to left shunts, either due to anatomical intracardiac shunts, such as atrial and ventricular septal defects, or physiologic shunts from alveolar disorders (ie, atelectasis, cardiogenic or noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, or pneumonia). The other extreme is physiologic dead space due to decreased perfusion of gas exchange surfaces (ie, large pulmonary embolism). Other important mechanisms of hypoxemia include diffusion impairment at the alveolar-pulmonary capillary interface (ie, interstitial lung disease); and hypoventilation secondary to reduced minute ventilation from central neurologic conditions (ie, sedation, central apnea in cardiac arrest survivors) or peripheral neuromuscular disorders (ie, cervical spine injuries, diaphragmatic weakness). Finally, of particular importance in a cardiac population is decreased mixed venous oxygen content (ie, low cardiac output due to pump failure). In low cardiac output states, low mixed venous hemoglobin saturation can cause severe hypoxemia if even a small degree of V/Q mismatch or shunt simultaneously coexists (Central Illustration).

### Bicarbonate from arterial blood gas analysis as predictor of sleep-related hypoventilation: a diagnostic accuracy study [^111VUGBZ]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

The most common causes of chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and indications for home mechanical ventilation (HMV) are obesity, neuromuscular disease (NMD), chest wall disease (CWD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). If left untreated, patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure require frequent hospitalisation and have a high mortality rate. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is particularly common in restrictive ventilatory disorders and also contributes to hypoventilation. OSA can also lead to sleep-related hypoventilation and chronic alveolar hypoventilation (hypercapnic OSA). Hypoventilation first manifests during sleep. Thus, the goal is to treat the sleep-disordered breathing before it progresses to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. In most cases, correction of nocturnal hypercapnia leads to a reset of the respiratory centre and chemosensitivity, restoring ventilation during the day.

Hypercapnic respiratory failure is defined by an arterial CO 2 partial pressure (paCO 2) in the awake state of > 45 mm Hg (6 kPa). It can occur as acute, acute-on-chronic or chronic failure. These types can be distinguished on the basis of the constellation of pH, paCO 2 and bicarbonate concentration (cHCO 3-) in the arterial blood gas analysis if no additional metabolic acidosis or alkalosis is present. Metabolic compensation of respiratory acidosis occurs over a period of hours to days. The kidneys respond to respiratory acidosis during sleep by increasing bicarbonate, which may remain elevated during wakefulness. Thus, elevated bicarbonate, especially after waking, can occur as a result of sleep hypoventilation before the onset of daytime hypercapnia. It is therefore used as a screening tool for early diagnosis of sleep hypoventilation in patients at risk of developing chronic hypercapnic ventilatory failure, such as those with obesity, NMD and CWD. A bicarbonate level of 24 ± 2 mmol/L is considered normal. The bicarbonate value is either calculated using acid-base formulas or measured directly in the serum. It has been suggested that a serum bicarbonate concentration of > 27 mmol/L could be used as an indicator of obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) and should prompt to measure arterial blood gases. An elevated bicarbonate is also used as one of the indicators of residual hypoventilation under HMV.

### Permissive hypercapnia in acute respiratory failure… [^1121goGd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Objective. — To evaluate the potential efficacy of pressure limitation with permissive hypercapnia in the treatment of acute respiratory failure/adult respiratory distress syndrome on the basis of current theories of ventilator-induced lung injury, potential complications of systemic hypercarbia, and available human outcome studies. Data Sources. — Articles were identified through MEDLINE, reference citations of published data, and consultation with authorities in their respective fields. Study Selection. — Animal model experimentation and human clinical trials were selected on the basis of whether they addressed the questions of pressure limitation with or without hypercapnia, the pathophysiologic effects of hypercapnia, or the concept of ventilator-induced parenchymal lung injury. Frequently cited references were preferentially included. Data Extraction.

— Data were analyzed with particular emphasis on obtaining the following variables from the clinical studies: peak inspiratory pressures, tidal volumes, minute ventilation, and Pco2. Quantitative aspects of respiratory physiology were used to analyze the theoretical effects of permissive hypercapnia on ventilatory requirements in normal and injured lungs. Data Synthesis. — Extensive animal model data support the hypothesis that ventilator-driven alveolar overdistention can induce significant parenchymal lung injury. The heterogeneous nature of lung injury in adult respiratory distress syndrome, with its small physiologic lung volume, may render the lung susceptible to this type of injury through the use of conventional tidal volumes. Permissive hypercapnia is an approach whereby alveolar overdistention is minimized through either pressure or volume limitation, and the potential deleterious consequences of respiratory acidosis are accepted.

Uncontrolled human trials of explicit or implicit permissive hypercapnia have demonstrated improved survival in comparison with models of predictive mortality. Conclusions. — Avoidance of alveolar overdistention through pressure or volume limitation has significant support based on animal models and computer simulation. Deleterious effects of the associated hypercarbia in severe lung injury do not appear to be a significant limiting factor in preliminary human clinical trials. Although current uncontrolled studies suggest benefit, controlled trials are urgently needed to confirm these findings before adoption of the treatment can be endorsed.

### Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal to De-escalate venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in severe COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114aQJkx]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

In a subset of patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), there is a need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for pulmonary support. The primary extracorporeal support tool for severe COVID-19 ARDS is venovenous (VV) ECMO; however, after hypoxemic respiratory failure resolves, many patients experience refractory residual hypercarbic respiratory failure. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO 2 R) for isolated hypercarbic type II respiratory failure can be used in select cases to deescalate patients from VV ECMO while the lung recovers the ability to exchange CO 2. The objective of this study was to describe the authors' experience in using ECCO 2 R as a bridge from VV ECMO.

Design

Hemolung Respiratory Assist System (RAS) is a commercially available (ECCO 2 R) device, and the United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated its use under its Emergency Use Authorization for the treatment of refractory hypercarbic respiratory failure in COVID-19-induced ARDS. This created an environment in which selected and targeted mechanical circulatory support therapy for refractory hypercarbic respiratory failure could be addressed. This retrospective study describes the application of Hemolung RAS as a VV ECMO deescalation platform to treat refractory hypercarbic respiratory failure after the resolution of hypoxemic COVID-19 ARDS.

Setting

A quaternary-care academic medical center, single institution.

Participants

Patients with refractory hypercarbic respiratory failure after COVID-19 ARDS who were previously supported with VV ECMO.

Measurements and Main Results

Twenty-one patients were placed on ECCO 2 R after VV ECMO for COVID-19 ARDS. Seventeen patients successfully were transitioned to ECCO 2 R and then decannulated; 3 patients required reescalation to VV ECMO secondary to hypercapnic respiratory failure, and 1 patient died while on ECCO 2 R. Five (23.8%) of the 21 patients were transitioned off of VV ECMO to ECCO 2 R, with a compliance of < 20 (mL/cmH 2 O). Of these patients, 3 with low compliance were reescalated to VV ECMO.

Conclusions

Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal can be used to continue supportive methods for patients with refractory type 2 hypercarbic respiratory failure after COVID-19 ARDS for patients previously on VV ECMO. Patients with low compliance have a higher rate of reescalation to VV ECMO.

### Respiratory failure [^111wqwX4]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

On the basis of research evidence, (1)(2) numerous diseases and conditions can impair gas exchange, resulting in failure to meet the body's metabolic demands and leading to respiratory failure. On the basis of consensus, (1)(2)(7)(8)(9)(10) the clinical presentations of respiratory failure depend on the underlying cause and the level of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Early diagnosis, close monitoring, and timely intervention are of utmost importance. On the basis of research evidence, (5)(14)(25) interventions range from noninvasive methods, such as close monitoring and supplemental oxygen, to full respiratory support with mechanical ventilation and in extreme cases even the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
