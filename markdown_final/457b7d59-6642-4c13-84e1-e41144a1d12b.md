## Question

Bilirubin in urine

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about interpreting bilirubin in urine, including pathophysiology, test performance, clinical significance, differential diagnosis, and a practical decision algorithm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biochemistry of bilirubin handling and why conjugated bilirubin appears in urine. Then, I should verify the limitations and false positives of dipstick urinalysis for bilirubin. Next, I will review the clinical significance of a positive urine bilirubin and when it changes management. After that, I need to construct a stepwise diagnostic approach, including confirmatory testing and imaging. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise, actionable algorithm with caveats and follow-up needs.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiology so I don't jump to conclusions: unconjugated bilirubin is albumin-bound and water-insoluble, so it is not filtered by the glomerulus and should not appear in urine, whereas conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and can be filtered and excreted when serum conjugated bilirubin is elevated, which is why urine bilirubin positivity indicates cholestasis or hepatocellular injury rather than isolated hemolysis [^111pL38E] [^113jyM3S].

> Wait, let me verify the test performance before overinterpreting a dipstick result: urine dipsticks detect conjugated bilirubin but have notable false positives and limited sensitivity, and bilirubin and urobilinogen degrade with time and temperature, so delayed processing can yield false negatives. Fluorescence-based methods can quantify total bilirubin in urine and correlate with hepatobiliary disease, but they are not widely available for routine care, reinforcing the need to confirm unexpected positives with serum testing and clinical context [^113PVjaR] [^116DUaEF] [^111U5UYA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical significance: a positive urine bilirubin is uncommon in general urinalysis cohorts, and most positives occur in patients with concurrent liver test abnormalities. In a large retrospective series, 60% of positives aligned with recent abnormal LFTs, and among the remaining 40% labeled "unexpected", 85% later had abnormal LFTs, suggesting that a positive urine bilirubin is a sensitive but nonspecific sentinel for hepatobiliary disease even when liver tests are initially normal [^113PVjaR].

> I should double-check the differential so I don't miss key etiologies: conjugated hyperbilirubinemia leading to urine bilirubin reflects hepatocellular injury (viral hepatitis, alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, drug-induced liver injury), cholestatic processes (biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis), and infiltrative or granulomatous liver disease. In infants, persistent jaundice with dark urine and pale stools mandates urgent evaluation for neonatal cholestasis, with biliary atresia requiring early surgical intervention, and in adults, obstructive causes such as gallstones, malignancy, or strictures must be excluded promptly [^116MrcMJ] [^111fjDtB] [^112zf4UR] [^1135ixgv].

> Let me think about a practical, stepwise approach so I don't overtest or undertest: if urine bilirubin is positive, I should immediately obtain fractionated serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, INR, albumin, and a CBC. If conjugated bilirubin is elevated, I should proceed to right upper quadrant ultrasound to assess biliary dilation and liver parenchyma, escalating to MRCP or ERCP if obstruction is suspected. If ultrasound is unrevealing and cholestasis persists, I should consider autoimmune serologies, viral hepatitis testing, and, when indicated, liver biopsy or MRCP for cholangiopathies [^116MrcMJ].

> But wait, what if the patient is an infant or has special risk factors: in breastfed infants jaundiced beyond 3–4 weeks or formula-fed infants jaundiced beyond 2 weeks, I should measure total and direct bilirubin urgently to exclude cholestasis, with expedited imaging and pediatric hepatology referral given the time-sensitive nature of biliary atresia. In patients with ventricular assist devices or suspected hemolysis, dark tea-colored urine with a positive blood dipstick but few RBCs on microscopy suggests hemoglobinuria rather than true bilirubinuria, prompting LDH, plasma free hemoglobin, and haptoglobin testing. In patients on drugs with hepatotoxic risk, I should correlate with medication timing and consider drug-induced liver injury algorithms [^111fjDtB] [^115jXdWo] [^115PThft] [^117AbP9B].

> I need to ensure I address false positives and preanalytical pitfalls: phenolic metabolites of etodolac can cause a false-positive urine bilirubin on some dipsticks, so I should review medications and, if suspected, confirm with serum testing. Storage and processing delays can degrade bilirubin and urobilinogen, so unexpected negatives in the setting of jaundice should be interpreted cautiously and repeated on a fresh specimen when feasible [^115coYxX] [^116DUaEF].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical utility so I don't overstate it: although a positive urine bilirubin is uncommon and often redundant when liver tests are already abnormal, it remains a useful screen that can unmask early cholestasis or hepatocellular injury, particularly in patients without recent LFTs. Given its low standalone specificity, it should trigger confirmatory serum testing rather than serve as a diagnostic endpoint [^113PVjaR] [^113jyM3S].

> Next, I should review a concise decision algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence: if urine bilirubin is positive, obtain fractionated serum bilirubin and a comprehensive liver panel. If conjugated bilirubin is normal, reassess for false positives and repeat urinalysis on a fresh specimen if clinical suspicion persists. If conjugated bilirubin is elevated, obtain right upper quadrant ultrasound and proceed based on findings to MRCP/ERCP, autoimmune and viral testing, or liver biopsy. In infants with persistent jaundice, prioritize direct bilirubin measurement and urgent hepatology referral. In all cases, correlate with symptoms, stool color, and medication exposures to guide the workup and avoid unnecessary testing [^111fjDtB] [^116MrcMJ].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and safety netting: for patients with initially normal LFTs but a positive urine bilirubin, repeating liver tests within 1–2 weeks is prudent because delayed abnormalities are common. Educating patients to report dark urine, pale stools, pruritus, or jaundice ensures timely escalation, and in infants, adherence to cholestasis pathways prevents delays in diagnosing surgically correctable disease [^113PVjaR] [^111fjDtB] [^112zf4UR].

Bilirubin in urine (bilirubinuria) reflects **conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** from hepatobiliary disease or obstruction [^111pL38E] and is not seen with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (e.g. hemolysis, Gilbert syndrome) [^111pL38E]. Urine bilirubin is detected by dipstick [^113jyM3S] but should be confirmed with **serum fractionated bilirubin** and liver enzymes [^116wTJS9]; if cholestasis is suspected, obtain RUQ ultrasound [^116MrcMJ] and consider MRCP/ERCP. False positives can occur with certain drugs or outdated samples [^115coYxX], so interpret results in clinical context and confirm with laboratory testing [^113jyM3S].

---

## Physiological basis of bilirubin in urine

Bilirubin is a yellow pigment produced during heme breakdown [^111U5UYA]; unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble and protein-bound, so it is not filtered by the glomerulus and does not appear in urine. Conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble and is filtered and excreted in urine when serum levels are elevated [^111pL38E]; thus, **urine bilirubin indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** from hepatobiliary disease or obstruction [^116MrcMJ].

---

## Clinical significance of bilirubin in urine

Bilirubinuria is **pathological** and indicates conjugated hyperbilirubinemia from hepatobiliary disease or obstruction [^111pL38E]. Common causes include:

- **Hepatocellular injury**: viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis [^116MrcMJ].
- **Cholestatic disorders**: biliary obstruction (gallstones, tumors, strictures), primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis [^116MrcMJ].
- **Infantile cholestasis**: biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, congenital infections [^112zf4UR].

---

## Laboratory methods for detecting bilirubin in urine

Several methods detect urine bilirubin, including:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| Dipstick test | Rapid, semi-quantitative; detects conjugated bilirubin | Screening; false positives/negatives occur [^113PVjaR] [^116DUaEF] |
| Ictotest | Tablet test; more specific than dipstick | Confirmatory test [^notfound] |
| Spectrophotometric methods | Quantitative; precise | Research/reference labs [^111U5UYA] |

---

Dipstick testing is convenient but less specific; **confirmatory testing** is recommended when results are positive or clinical suspicion is high [^113jyM3S].

---

## Clinical implications and diagnostic approach

Bilirubinuria warrants a **structured evaluation**:

- **Confirm conjugated hyperbilirubinemia**: measure total and direct serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and INR [^116MrcMJ].
- **Imaging**: RUQ ultrasound to assess biliary obstruction, liver parenchyma, and vascular structures [^116MrcMJ].
- **Advanced imaging**: MRCP or ERCP if obstruction or cholangiopathies are suspected [^116MrcMJ].
- **Specialized tests**: autoimmune serologies, viral hepatitis panels, and genetic testing as indicated [^116MrcMJ].

---

## Conditions associated with bilirubin in urine

Bilirubinuria is associated with:

- **Hepatocellular injury**: viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis [^116MrcMJ].
- **Cholestatic disorders**: biliary obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis [^111pL38E].
- **Infantile cholestasis**: biliary atresia, neonatal hepatitis, congenital infections [^11134N7L].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Several factors can confound urine bilirubin testing:

- **False positives**: certain drugs (e.g. etodolac) and outdated samples [^115coYxX].
- **False negatives**: low bilirubin levels or early disease [^114GXXi1].
- **Sample handling**: improper storage or prolonged exposure to light can degrade bilirubin [^116DUaEF].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **confirming bilirubinuria** with serum testing and imaging to determine etiology and guide management [^116MrcMJ]. In infants, persistent jaundice with bilirubinuria requires urgent evaluation for cholestasis and possible biliary atresia [^112zf4UR].

---

Bilirubin in urine reflects **conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** from hepatobiliary disease or obstruction and is not seen with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia [^111pL38E]. Confirm with serum fractionated bilirubin and liver enzymes, then use imaging to define the cause and guide management [^116MrcMJ].

Results

Characteristics of the 1363 subjects enrolled in this study are shown in Table 1.

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of subjects

Among the 1363 adult subjects, the mean age and total bilirubin were 55.6 (± 14.1) years and 0.75 (± 0.21) mg/dL, respectively. An eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and a 24-hour urine protein ≥ 150 mg/day were present in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of the subjects, respectively. Diabetes and hypertension were present in 44.9% (n = 612) and 14.0% (n = 191) of patients.

The clinical and biochemical characteristics of subjects stratified according to eGFR category are summarized in Table 2. Compared with patients with normal or near-normal eGFR, persons with lower eGFR were older, more likely to be male, and had greater prevalence for high serum total bilirubin concentration. A positive correlation was found between serum total bilirubin concentration and eGFR in all subjects and in diabetic patients (r = 0.128, p = 0.0001; r = 0.202, p = 0.0001) (Figure 1, 2). An inverse correlation was found between total serum bilirubin concentration and 24-hour urine albumin in all subjects and in subjects with diabetes (r = -0.228, p = 0.0001; r = -0.227, p = 0.0001) (Figure 3, 4).

Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the area under the curvewas calculated to be 0.95 (95% CI, 0.9005 to 0.9957; fig. S11) as an overallROCperformance [n = 48 cases, n = 53 controls; significance level, 0.05; power, 1]. At a threshold of 14 pg/ml, this ROC analysis yielded a sensitivity of 0.96 and a specificity of 0.81 for true-positive pulmonary TB patients in the present study set (positive predictive value, 0.82; negative predicted value, 0.95; power, 0.96) (Fig. 3C). By these criteria, the single false-positive urine in the diseased controlswas patient #234, whose urinalysis had +++ leukocyte esterase, +++ protein, +++ blood, and + bilirubin (table S3). These urinalysis values would meet the exclusion criteria for clinical urine diagnostic testing. Notably, eight of the nine culture-positive but smear-negative patients were positive for urinary LAM.

What initial laboratory tests may be useful in aiding a diagnosis of haemolytic anaemia and what might you expect from these investigations?

A haemolytic screen should be carried out and its result interpreted collectively: full blood count (FBC) and film, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), split bilirubin (unconjugated and conjugated), reticulocytes, haptoglobin and urinalysis (dipstick and microscopy). Typical findings and limitations in interpretation are noted in figure 7. Laboratory results in extravascular haemolysis are generally less severe, as haemolysis occurs in the reticuloendothelial system, with fewer degradation products released into the circulation.

Figure 7
Comparison between the typical laboratory findings in an extravascular versus an intravascular haemolysis. Note: Haptoglobin is not produced efficiently in children under 2 years or those with liver disease (levels are artificially low) and rises with acute inflammation, so it may be misleadingly normal in infection/inflammation despite haemolysis. LDH is non-specifically elevated in tissue damage and may remain low in extravascular haemolysis as red cells are mopped up by the reticuloendothelial system. Reticulocytes may be depressed initially because infection is often myelosuppressive and then rebound. ↑↑, significantly increased; ↑, increased; ↓, decreased; ↓↓, significantly decreased; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

Haemolysis causes anaemia if the bone marrow RBC production cannot compensate for increased RBC destruction. Haemoglobinuria should be suspected if the urine dipstick is positive for blood but urine microscopy shows minimal red cells. Haptoglobin, the most sensitive laboratory indicator of haemolysis and last marker to normalise, is significantly decreased due to free haemoglobin (Hb) exceeding the Hb-binding capacity of the circulating haptoglobins. A reticulocytosis is usually seen, although with AIHA reticulocytopenia can commonly occur in the acute phase due to myelosuppression secondary to a recent infection or inadequate compensatory reticulocytosis. The patient's blood results are shown in figure 1.

### Etodolac [^115coYxX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin andetodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed.

Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 mg to 1,000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy.

### Serum bilirubin concentration is associated with eGFR and urinary albumin excretion in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus [^114kVnff]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

Although relationships of serum bilirubin concentration with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin excretion (UAE) in patients with type 2 diabetes have been reported, whether such relationships exist in patients with type 1 diabetes is unknown.

Methods

A total of 123 patients with type 1 diabetes were investigated in this cross-sectional study. The relationship between bilirubin (total and indirect) concentrations and log(UAE) as well as eGFR was examined by Pearson's correlation analyses. Multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the association of bilirubin (total and indirect) with eGFR as well as log(UAE).

Results

A positive correlation was found between serum bilirubin concentration and eGFR; total bilirubin (r = 0.223, p = 0.013), indirect bilirubin (r = 0.244, p = 0.007). A negative correlation was found between serum bilirubin concentration and log(UAE); total bilirubin (r = -0.258, p = 0.005), indirect bilirubin (r = -0.271, p = 0.003). Multivariate regression analyses showed that indirect bilirubin concentration was an independent determinant of eGFR and log(UAE).

Conclusions

Bilirubin concentration is associated with both eGFR and log(UAE) in patients with type 1 diabetes. Bilirubin might have a protective role in the progression of type 1 diabetic nephropathy.

### Early evolution and correlates of urine albumin excretion in patients presenting with acutely decompensated heart failure [^1154tzD8]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Urine albumin excretion is an important predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in various populations. Its correlation in patients with acute heart failure has not been described.

Methods and Results

This prospective, observational study included 115 patients presenting with acute heart failure. The urine albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) was measured from spot urine samples collected on days 1 and 7 of hospitalization. Median UACR decreased from 83 to 22 mg/gCr on days 1 and 7, respectively (P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with normoalbuminuria (UACR < 30 mg/gCr) increased from 31% on day 1 to 60% on day 7, whereas the proportion with microalbuminuria (UACR between 30 and 299 mg/gCr) and macroalbuminuria (UACR ≥ 300 mg/gCr) decreased, respectively, from 42% and 27% on day 1 to 30% and 10% on day 7 (P < 0.0001). These changes in UACR were correlated with changes in serum bilirubin and N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide concentrations (correlation coefficients 1.087 and 0.384, respectively; 95% confidence interval, 0.394–1.781 and 0.087–0.680, respectively; and P = 0.003 and 0.013, respectively), although they were not correlated with change in estimated glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusions

In this sample of patients presenting with acute heart failure, urine albumin excretion was often increased at admission to the hospital and decreased significantly within 7 days of treatment. The decrease was correlated with serum N-terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide and bilirubin concentrations, although neither with baseline nor with changes in indices of renal function.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^116v3phg]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

The significant associations between total serum bilirubin and eGFR or albuminuria observed in diabetic individuals of our cohort were the same as those from Fukui et al. That previous study found that total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with albuminuria in a hospital-based sample of 633 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (mean age: 64.4 ± 11.5 years; 52% male). However, in that study, no adjustment was made for important confounders, such as eGFR. In our study, a positive correlation was found between total serum bilirubin concentration and eGFR in all subjects as well as in diabetic patients.

Based on in vitro as well as animal studies, bilirubin is generally recognized as an important antioxidant substance. Kumar et al. demonstrated that serum bilirubin concentration is inversely correlated with a marker of oxidative stress and is positively correlated with antioxidative enzyme activities such as those of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These results are also supported by clinical studies focused on the protective effects of serum bilirubin concentration on atherosclerosis. In this study, serum bilirubin concentration correlated negatively with proteinuria and positively correlated with renal function, and total cholesterol in the normal proteinuria group level was lower than that in the abnormal proteinuria group. However, we were unable to assess the antioxidant effect of serum bilirubin, because tests for an oxidative stress marker and antioxidant enzyme were not carried out.

In addition to being an antioxidant, bilirubin also has anticomplement properties that protect against inflammation. Furthermore, bilirubin has been suggested to have cytoprotective properties through its influence on protein kinase C. Through these mechanisms, bilirubin could protect diabetic patients from the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. However, in this study, the 24-hour proteinuria level in the diabetic group was lower than that in the non-diabetic group because CKD patients were included in the non-diabetic group.

In results of this study, we might think serum bilirubin concentration may be utilized as a provisional new risk factor of diabetic nephropathy that can be measured easily in the clinical laboratory and applied in medical practice.

It could be hypothesized that the bilirubin-kidney dysfunction relationship primarily reflects the association of serum bilirubin concentration with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD represents the most common cause of mild to moderate increases in serum bilirubin and other liver enzymes in Western countries. Recent studies have found that NAFLD is independently associated with an increased incidence of CKD in both non-diabetic and diabetic populations.

Monitoring

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate. Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam).

### Future directions in acute liver failure [^112Lyy9j]. Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Acute liver failure (ALF) describes a clinical syndrome of rapid hepatocyte injury leading to liver failure manifested by coagulopathy and HE in the absence of pre-existing cirrhosis. The hallmark diagnostic features, defined in the 1950s, are a prolonged prothrombin time (ie, an international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (INR) of ≥ 1.5) and any degree of mental status alteration (HE). The annual incidence of ALF ranges from 2000 to 4000 cases per year in the United States. As a rare, orphan disease, it seemed an obvious topic/target for a multicenter network. Thus, the Acute Liver Failure Study Group (ALFSG) was developed with this express purpose in mind to more thoroughly study and understand the causes, natural history, and management of ALF, with initial patient enrollment beginning on January 1, 1998. Over the years, the number of sites increased from the initial 12 to a peak of 23 (total 31) and enrollment continued through August 2019, funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases from 1997 through the present. In 2010, hospitalized patients with severe acute liver injury (ALI) (defined as an INR > 2.0 and bilirubin of > 3.0 mg/dL but without HE) were added to the registry. Over the course of 22 years, 3364 adult patients were enrolled in the study registry (2614 ALF and 857 ALI) and > 150,000 biosamples collected, including serum, plasma, urine, DNA, and liver tissue. Detailed data were recorded, including clinical features, laboratory findings, clinical course, transplantation details, and outcome. In addition, 2 interventional [N -acetylcysteine (NAC) and ornithine phenylacetate], 1 prognostic [13 C-methacetin breath test (MBT)], and 1 mechanistic [rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM)] clinical trials were conducted and published. These data and corresponding biosamples are now in the public domain. Ancillary studies using clinical data and biosamples combined with the study investigators' efforts have led to 148 published manuscripts over the past 25 years (see acuteliverfailure.org for list and manuscript links). To review accomplishments and consider next steps, a 2-day in-person conference was held at UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, entitled "Acute Liver Failure: Science and Practice", in May 2022. The 26 speakers covered a wide range of topics varying from molecular pathogenesis to causality assessment, clinical management, and the role of liver transplantation (LT) and other investigational approaches.

### Anastomotic leaks can be detected within 5 days following ileorectal anastomosis: a case-controlled study in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis [^116NncrK]. Colorectal Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Aim

To determine the earliest time point at which anastomotic leaks can be detected in patients undergoing total colectomy with primary ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis.

Method

This was a case-controlled study of 10 anastomotic leak patients vs 20 controls following laparoscopic total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis for familial adenomatous polyposis (from 96 consecutive patients between 2006 and 2013). Panel time-series data regression was performed using a double subscript structure to include both variables. A generalized least squares multivariate approach was applied in a random effects setting to calculate correlations for observations, with anastomotic leak being the dependent variable. Univariate and multivariate regression calculations were then performed according to individual observations at each recorded time point. Time-series analysis was used to determine when a variable became significant in the leak group.

Results

Multivariate analysis identified a significant difference between leak and control groups in mean heart rate (P < 0.001), mean respiratory rate (P = 0.017) and mean urine output (P = 0.001). Time-point analysis showed that heart rate was significantly different between leak and control groups at postoperative day 4.25. Multivariate analysis identified a significant difference between groups in alanine transaminase (P = 0.006), bilirubin (P = 0.008), creatinine (P = 0.001), haemoglobin (P < 0.001) and urea (P = 0.007). There were no differences between groups with regard to markers of inflammation such as albumin, white blood cell count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein.

Conclusion

Anastomotic leaks can be detected early (within 4.5 days of surgery) through changes in physiological, blood test and observational parameters, providing an opportunity for early intervention in these patients to salvage the anastomosis.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^116G6aU4]. Seminars in Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Any infant who is jaundiced beyond two to three weeks of life should be evaluated for neonatal cholestasis. Neonatal cholestasis is defined as accumulation of bile substances in blood due to impaired excretion. These infants should always have fractionated serum bilirubin levels checked to differentiate the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia of cholestasis from unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that is usually benign and spontaneously resolves. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, pale stools and dark urine are the cardinal features of neonatal cholestasis. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive and a systematic approach is helpful to quickly establish the diagnosis. Biliary atresia is a common cause of neonatal cholestasis and affected infants need surgery before 60 days of life for better prognosis. Premature infants have multifactorial cholestasis and need a modified approach to the evaluation of cholestasis. Management of cholestasis is mostly supportive, consisting of medical management of complications of chronic cholestasis like pruritus and nutritional support for malabsorption and vitamin deficiency.

### Early detection of Parkinson's disease through multiplex blood and urine biomarkers prior to clinical diagnosis [^115oX8yg]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study leveraged the UK Biobank's extensive dataset of blood and urine biomarkers to advance our understanding of PD through case-control studies, genetic analysis, and MR. We identified 13 biomarkers associated with PD, including newly explored markers such as the AST/ALT ratio, IRF, and phosphates, alongside IGF-1 and CRP, which had previously shown inconsistent results in research. Genetic correlation analysis revealed significant inverse genome-wide correlations between PD and several biomarkers like eosinophil count, IRF, CRP, glucose, and total bilirubin, while showing a positive correlation with IGF-1. Among these, the relationships with IGF-1 and CRP were the most pronounced. Our pleiotropy analysis confirmed four significant shared genetic loci linked to PD, including three previously reported (HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQA1, MAPT) and one less commonly reported locus, SETD1A. Ultimately, MR studies supported the nature of these associations, indicating potential causal relationships between the immunoinflammatory biomarkers IGF-1 and CRP and PD. These MR findings help resolve inconsistencies reported in earlier studies and provide robust support for these biomarkers' roles in PD.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^116RNja5]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional design, which allows us to identify only associations and should not yield any conclusions about causation. In addition, results of this study may not be applicable to the general population or to patients with type 2 diabetes in a primary care clinic because the data were collected from patients in an outpatient clinic of a university hospital. This study's results are not definitive because a Pearson's correlation coefficient of less than ± 0.25 is generally considered to be a weak correlation. We think prompt further research into this interesting correlation will be needed. Second, we were unable to explain the reason why both the non-diabetic and diabetic group had the same results. Third, liver ultrasonography for diagnosing NAFLD was not performed. Finally, we used eGFR instead of a directly measured GFR to assess renal function. It is known that current eGFR experiences greater inaccuracy in populations with no known CKD than in those with CKD. Nonetheless, the current eGFR technique facilitates the detection, evaluation, and management of renal disease.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the relationship between serum bilirubin concentration and 24-hour urine protein excretion in non-diabetic subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although we are unable to determine whether hypobilirubinemia has a causative effect, these findings suggest that hypobilirubinemia combined with diabetes might be associated with advanced diabetic nephropathy. Large prospective trials are needed to better assess the effects of bilirubin on diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Total bilirubin in prognosis for mortality in end-stage renal disease patients on peritoneal dialysis therapy [^112iWURW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Serum bilirubin is derived from biliverdin via biliverdin reductase, which is found in all tissues, especially in the macrophages of the liver and spleen. Bilirubin is a normal end product of the heme metabolism pathway. It plays an important role in detecting jaundice. Although a high serum level is associated with a high mortality rate among jaundice patients, bilirubin has been discovered to have antioxidant properties, whether conjugated or unconjugated, 7 free or protein bound. 8 Bilirubin exerts its beneficial effect by cellular protection via the biliverdin reductase antioxidant cycle. 9 Heme oxygenase‐1‐induced bilirubin was recently found to protect endothelial cells against high glucose–induced damage. 10 Based on this favorable characteristic, it was postulated that a high total bilirubin level within physiological range could have a beneficial effect on patient health. Previous studies observed that the serum total bilirubin level predicted the progression of chronic kidney disease, showing better renal outcomes among groups with higher serum total bilirubin. 11, 12 A negative correlation with daily amount of urine protein was also identified. 13 The incidence of end‐stage renal disease among patients with IgA nephropathy was inversely correlated with the serum bilirubin level. 14 A similar conclusion was also reached regarding cardiac outcomes, where a higher level of total bilirubin was associated with fewer major adverse cardiovascular events among patients with cardiac syndrome X. 15 A higher level of serum bilirubin was also found to be associated with higher functional independence in the elderly population. 16 As a result, serum bilirubin level might be another novel biomarker for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients with end‐stage renal disease who undergo PD. Recently, our research team found that total bilirubin level was associated with mortality among patients undergoing long‐term hemodialysis. 17 The relationship between serum bilirubin level and survival in PD patients remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the predictive ability of serum total bilirubin level in patients requiring PD.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^115jJePY]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults patients who had visited Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) from January 2005 to December 2009 and evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, eGFR and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older (669 men, 694 women, aged 54.6 ± 15.1 years, range 18–93 years). The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Kosin University Gospel Hospital.

Clinical and biochemical assessments

Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed according to the Report of the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classification of Diabetes Mellitus. Nephropathy was graded as follows: normoproteinuria, urinary protein excretion less than 150 mg/day and macroproteinuria, greater than 150 mg/day.

As a surrogate for measuring renal function in the subjects, we estimated the GFR using a simplified form of the Modification of Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. The equation is as follows:

The exclusion criteria were as follows:

1) patients with malignant disease, liver cirrhosis, or hematologic disease;

2) patients with advanced renal dysfunction (serum creatinine level higher than 2.0 mg/dL);

3) patients whose serum bilirubin concentrations were greater than 1.2 mg/dL due to the high possibility of Gilbert syndrome.

4) patients with chronic hepatitis B or C

Total serum bilirubin concentrations (normal ranges: 0.2–1.0 mg/dL) were measured using an enzymatic method with bilirubin oxidase on an automatic analyzer (Hitachi 7600). Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were assessed using standard enzymatic methods. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected from patients who demonstrated proteinuria in a dipstick urine test.

### Bilirubin attenuates the renal tubular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis [^117CrSrt]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bilirubin (BIL) has been recognized as an endogenous antioxidant that shows a protective effect for cardiorenal diseases. We investigated whether administration of BIL had a protective effect on cyclosporine (CsA)-induced nephropathy (CIN), and examined the effects of BIL on the oxidative stress and apoptosis.

Methods

BIL was pretreated intraperitoneally three times for a week (60 mg/kg), and CsA was injected for 4 weeks (15 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous). Proximal tubular epithelial (HK2) cells were pretreated with 0.1mg/ml of BIL for 24 hours, and then treated with 20 μM of CsA for another 24 hours.

Results

CsA induced marked increases in urine kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) concentrations (P < 0.05). BIL reduced urine Kim-1 in CIN (P < 0.05), while urine NGAL exhibited a decreasing tendency. In CsA-treated rat kidneys, the protein expression of NOX4 and p22phox was reduced by BIL (P < 0.05). BIL ameliorated CsA-induced arteriolopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, tubular injury, and the apoptosis examined by TUNEL assay (P < 0.01). In HK2 cells, BIL reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species in CsA-treated cells. CsA increased the protein expression of bax, cleaved caspase-9, caspase-3 and the activity of caspase-3; however, the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein was reduced. These changes were recovered by BIL (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

The direct administration of BIL protected against CsA-induced tubular injury via inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis.

### Circulating bilirubin levels and risk of colorectal cancer: serological and mendelian randomization analyses [^111oKndw]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The SNP with the largest contribution was rs6431625 in the UTG1A1 gene on chromosome 2. This SNP explained 16.9% of phenotypic variance and was in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD R 2 = 0.74) with the UGT1A1*28 promoter TA repeat polymorphism (rs3064744) in European populations. The other SNPs explained a 3.1% of phenotypic variance with an F-statistic of 89.1. All SNPs were independently associated with total bilirubin levels (LD R 2 < 0.001), and SNPs with ambiguous strand codification (A/T or C/G) were replaced by SNPs in LD R 2 > 0.8 in European populations using the proxysnps R package. As described in the GWAS where SNPs were identified, raw total bilirubin levels were adjusted for age, sex and their interaction, the top 40 principal components for population stratification, recruitment center, socioeconomic status, and potential technical confounders (blood draw time and its square and interactions with age and sex; urine sample time and its square and interactions with age and sex; sample dilution factor; fasting time, its square, and interactions with age and sex; and interactions of blood draw time and urine sample time with dilution factor). These adjusted residuals were inverse-normal-transformed and reflect the genetic association with bilirubin levels in standard deviation units (Supplementary Table 1, see Additional file 1). Total bilirubin is the sum of UCB (~ 80–85%) and conjugated bilirubin (~ 15–20%), and this ratio is constant under physiologic conditions.

American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) acute liver failure — Recommendation 1 addresses testing for Wilson's disease in patients presenting with acute liver failure (ALF) and states the AGA "suggests against routinely testing all patients for Wilson's disease", with a "Conditional recommendation; very low quality of evidence". In settings of high clinical suspicion, testing "can be considered", recognizing "the low positive predictive value", and that ALF management "would not be altered", while detection enables "appropriate post-transplantation management and screening of the patient's family members". Common diagnostic tests include "serum ceruloplasmin, serum and hepatic copper assessment, and 24-hour urine collection for copper", but the tests have "high false-positive and false-negative rates", and ALF-specific diagnostic accuracy data are limited. One study reported serum copper threshold performance: "sensitivity of serum copper greater than 200 ug/dL was 75% and specificity was 96%". Given the "very low prevalence in the ALF population", testing "would have a high negative predictive value but a low positive predictive value".

### Bilirubin oxidation provoked by nitric oxide radicals predicts the progression of acute cardiac allograft rejection [^115k96Ef]. American Journal of Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, a strong intrinsic antioxidant, quenches free radicals produced under inflammatory conditions. The oxidized bilirubin metabolites, i.e. biopyrrins, are immediately excreted into urine and can indicate the intensity of oxidation in vivo. Our preliminary studies suggested the involvement of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in generation of biopyrrins. However, little is known about biological significance of bilirubin oxidation by RNS. Here, we analyzed the correlation between bilirubin oxidation and nitric oxide (NO) radicals during rat acute cardiac allograft rejection. In allograft recipients, urinary biopyrrins steeply increased on day 3 prior to the increase in myocardial tissue damage marker, serum troponin-T. In contrast, no significant changes in urinary biopyrrins were evident in recipients of isografts or cyclosporine-A treated allografts. Urinary nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxidation by NO radicals also increased on day 3, while administration of a NO synthase inhibitor, N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine apparently diminished the elevation of urinary biopyrrins as well as nitrotyrosine. Immunohistochemistry revealed enhanced local expression of heme oxygenase-1, biopyrrins and nitrotyrosine in allografts in accordance with the cellular infiltrates, suggesting that changes in urinary biopyrrins reflect the bilirubin oxidation in grafts undergoing rejection. These results indicate that locally evoked bilirubin oxidation by NO radicals can predict the progression of rejection.

### Impact of a standardized protocol for the management of prolonged neonatal jaundice in a regional setting: an interventional quasi-experimental study [^1133kGi5]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

There was a significant reduction in the total number of investigations done before referral to the hospital (from 2.2 to 1.7, p = 0.020).
d. Number of laboratory investigations done at the hospital level

A total of 1758 tests were done in 199 patients pre-intervention compared to 811 tests in 145 patients post-intervention. The new protocol had significantly reduced the total number of laboratory investigations done per patient at the hospital level, from 9.01 laboratory investigations per patient to 5.81 per patient (p < 0.001).
e. Type of laboratory investigations done at the hospital level

The type and number of laboratory investigations done at the hospital level was more reasonable after the implementation of the new protocol (see Table 3). Pre-intervention, out of a total of 1758 tests, total serum bilirubin without differential was the most frequently done (249 tests), followed by urine culture and sensitivity test (237 tests), liver function test (198 tests), and total serum bilirubin with differentials (194 tests). Post-intervention, out of a total of 811 tests, the top four laboratory investigations done were total serum bilirubin with differentials (203 tests), urine dipstick & microscopy test (107 tests), free T4/TSH (105 tests), and full blood count (98 tests).

### A novel kidney failure prediction model in individuals with CKD: impact of serum bilirubin levels [^114AjRVF]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations

Our current study had several limitations. First, we did not perform a competitive risk analysis of death. However, only 95 of 4103 (2.3%) death cases occurred during the study, so the potential impact on prediction risk may be limited. Second, in our study, we employed dipstick-proteinuria due to the low rate of albuminuria measurement in our electronic medical record (EMR) data. However, it is important to note that dipstick-proteinuria is much more readily available in clinical practice and offers a cost-effective measurement. In fact, the UACR measurement for CKD remains infrequent in routine clinical care worldwide. The UACR screening rate was 35.1% for diabetes and only 4.1% for hypertension. Additionally, a previous study suggested that dipstick-proteinuria is a strong, independent predictor for ESKD, although the use of dipstick-proteinuria is not usually recommended for the purpose of screening for early renal disease. The excellent performance of our model in the validation cohort as well as development cohort may support the clinical significance of dipstick-proteinuria in predicting ESKD. Third, we adopted only total bilirubin levels in this study due to the very low rate of measurements of direct and indirect levels in EMR data. There are several differences in the functional characteristics between the 2 forms of bilirubin. Most importantly, serum indirect bilirubin, but not serum direct bilirubin, can serve as an antioxidant inside the cells, because indirect bilirubin is lipophilic and can cross the plasma membrane. Additionally, indirect bilirubin is reported to affect several signaling mechanisms, such as activating Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthetase and the synthesis of nitric oxide, which improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Future studies are needed to compare the predictive ability of total, indirect, and direct bilirubin. Fourth, both the development and validation cohorts were from Japan. As race, healthcare systems, and treatment strategies may affect risk estimates and their calibration, further studies are needed to validate the predictive performance of the model in more diverse populations, including those from different ethnic backgrounds and in cohorts outside Japan.

### A fluorescence-based quantitative analysis for total bilirubin in blood and urine [^111U5UYA]. Laboratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a catabolic product of heme metabolism that circulates in the bloodstream in its unconjugated or glucuronide-conjugated form. Because the accumulation of bilirubin in the blood is a common symptom of liver diseases, its measurement in plasma (serum) is important for the diagnosis of these diseases.

Method

We developed a method to assess total bilirubin levels in serum and urine, using the fluorescent protein UnaG and β-glucuronidase.

Results

Our results indicate good correlation in serum total bilirubin levels between UnaG and the conventional bilirubin oxidase (BOD) methods. We found low levels of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in the urine of healthy subject individuals. Urinary bilirubin levels were elevated in patients with liver or bile duct diseases. A simple spot test of bilirubin using serum and urine showed a strong signal in patients with liver diseases.

Conclusion

The proposed method to assess bilirubin levels in serum and urine will contribute to the accurate diagnosis of health conditions such as jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.

### Early detection of Parkinson's disease through multiplex blood and urine biomarkers prior to clinical diagnosis [^113DwTTF]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Among the biomarkers we studied, IRF, phosphate, and the AST/ALT ratio are newly identified concerning PD with minimal prior investigation. Established biomarkers like urate, total bilirubin, NLR, platelet crit, platelet count, eosinophil count, Glucose and basophil count have been examined primarily in experimental settings and are now being analyzed using large-scale longitudinal data from the UK Biobank for the first time –. Furthermore, IGF-1 and CRP, known for their roles in systemic inflammation, have demonstrated potential links with PD in clinical and epidemiological studies, though these findings have historically been inconsistent –. To address these discrepancies and deepen our understanding, our study has conducted extensive genetic analyses to further elucidate the relationships between these biomarkers and PD.

Finally, we conducted stratified analyses by sex and age. In males, NLR, glucose, phosphate, and total bilirubin were no longer significant, while in females, there were no differences (See Supplementary Table 1). In the age-stratified analysis, CRP and phosphate were no longer significant in individuals older than 65 years. After excluding individuals who developed diseases within three years from the baseline measurement, the results remained unchanged, confirming the reliability and stability of our findings. (See Supplementary Table 2).

### Mendelian randomization study of the relationship between blood and urine biomarkers and schizophrenia in the UK biobank cohort [^112ZC2KA]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we conducted a large observational and genetic PRS analysis to comprehensively evaluate the associations between blood/urine biomarkers and TRS using the UKB cohort. We then performed bidirectional MR analysis to validate the candidate causal relationship. Our findings revealed several potential correlations in blood and urine biomarkers. Further analysis provided tentative evidence for sex differences in the characteristics between TRS with blood and urine biomarkers.

Currently, there is no objective biological measurement available for the diagnosis of TRS. Phosphate is an essential mineral for humans and plays numerous functions in the body. The blood level of phosphate is tightly regulated within a narrow range. Both hyperphosphatemia and hypophosphatemia can lead to the development of diseases. The disturbed integrity of myelin and white matter, along with dysregulation of lipid metabolism, may be involved in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Previous studies have reported increased high-energy phosphate metabolism in the basal ganglia of neuroleptic-naive schizophrenia patients using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). However, there are very few studies investigating the relationship between phosphate concentration and TRS in schizophrenia patients. Our study provides evidence for a correlation between phosphate and TRS, suggesting that blood phosphate may be a potential biomarker in TRS.

Previous studies have identified some biomarkers associated with TRS or schizophrenia, but not with TRS PRS in our study, such as bilirubin and creatinine. Bilirubin, the final product of heme metabolism in the body, is an endogenous antioxidant with an anti-inflammatory effect. Unbound bilirubin has been studied as a promising molecule that could be used as a possible biological marker for schizophrenia. In a prospective study, blood levels of unbound bilirubin were higher in patients with schizophrenia than in patients with bipolar disorder. Serum creatinine is one of the most commonly measured products in clinical chemistry laboratories worldwideand has been linked with many neurodegenerative diseases. The evidence linking schizophrenia and creatinine is primarily from observational studies. Researchers have identified multiple potential metabolite biomarkers of schizophrenia, such as reduced levels of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids and creatinine. Additionally, an association with schizophrenia was also found in urine. Previous studies have shown that urinary creatinine concentrations were reduced in patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. These studies, together with our results, suggest that these biomarkers may not be influenced by individual genetic inclination.

### Hepatitis C in 2020: a north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper [^116JPiVY]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric chronic hepatitis C — laboratory and radiologic monitoring (Table 1) provides suggested testing intervals before, during, and after therapy. Laboratory tests AST, ALT, GGT, total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin are obtained every 4 weeks until completed during treatment, with pretreatment assessment noted as annual and repeat if clinically indicated. Complete blood count is obtained every 4 weeks during treatment, while prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR) is monitored only if clinically indicated during and after treatment. HCV RNA quantitative PCR is checked every 4 weeks during treatment and at 12 weeks and 12 months post-treatment. Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for females of childbearing age is assessed prior to treatment and every 4 weeks if sexually active during treatment. For hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance, alpha-fetoprotein is performed every 6 months if cirrhotic and is not applicable if SVR 12 is achieved and the patient is non-cirrhotic, and liver ultrasound is performed every 6 months if cirrhotic and continued every 6 months until becomes non-cirrhotic. These are framed as suggestions for monitoring before, during, and after treatment.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^1149FGNH]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the associations among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein and kidney function in Korean adults.

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 1363 adults aged 18 years or older who were seen at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) in the five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. This study demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and was positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

Our findings are in contrast to the results of Targher et al. in their observational large hospital-based sample of 2678 adult outpatients (mean age: 55 ± 18 years; 43% male), including 210 diabetic patients. In that study, they found that serum total bilirubin was inversely associated with eGFR in both non-diabetic (r = -0.17; p < 0.0001) and diabetic patients (r = -0.14; p < 0.05). However, no information was available on albuminuria, comorbidites, alcohol consumption or other important potential confounders. In this study, we could not analyzed the effects of alcohol and smoking on proteinuria, because we were unable to locate data on alcohol drinking and smoking.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^116L7Sc5]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, kidney function and proteinuria have yet to be fully elucidated, nor have these relationships been investigated in Korean adults.

Method

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of Korean adults who were evaluated at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009. We evaluated the relationships among serum bilirubin concentration, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24-hour urinary protein excretion in a sample of 1363 Korean adults aged 18 years or older.

Results

The values of eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 24-hour urine albumin ≥ 150 mg/day were observed in 26.1% (n = 356) and 40.5% (n = 553) of subjects, respectively. Fasting glucose levels ≥ 126 mg/dL were observed in 44.9% (n = 612) of the total sample. After adjustment for potential confounding factors including demographic characteristics, comorbidities and other laboratory measures, total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with proteinuria both in the whole cohort and in a subgroup of diabetic individuals.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first hospital-based study specifically aimed at examining the relationships among serum total bilirubin concentration, 24-hour urine protein and kidney function in Korean adults. We demonstrated that serum total bilirubin concentration was negatively correlated with 24-hour urine protein and positively correlated with eGFR in Korean non-diabetic and diabetic adults.

Other infections — such as congenital syphilis and urinary tract infections — may present early, with infants showing jaundice in the first 24 hours of life; congenital syphilis incidence is rising in the United States, and a urine culture should be obtained early on in the diagnostic evaluation of cholestasis.

### Relationship of serum bilirubin concentration to kidney function and 24-hour urine protein in Korean adults [^111LUstM]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease is increasing worldwide. Reduced eGFR and abnormal proteinuria have been associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular disease and other comorbidities. Because renal disease often progresses to ESRD, the identification of risk factors for kidney disease progression is essential.

Increased concentrations of serum bilirubin have long been used as a marker of liver dysfunction. In addition, serum bilirubin is not merely an end product of heme degradation but is also a potent antioxidant that acts via inhibitions of NADPH oxidase, a key source of oxidants in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells, and of protein kinase C activity.

Information on the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with renal function and proteinuria is limited and controversial. Fukui et al. found that total serum bilirubin was positively associated with eGFR and negatively associated with albuminuria in a hospital-based sample of 633 Japanese type 2 diabetic patients, indicating that bilirubin has a potential renoprotective effect. In contrast, Targher et al. found that a higher total serum bilirubin was significantly associated with lower eGFR in both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals in a group of 2678 unselected outpatients 35 years of age or older.

To date, the associations of serum bilirubin concentration with kidney function and proteinuria have not been established in a Korean adult population. Therefore, we examined the associations among serum bilirubin concentration, eGFR and the degree of 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients at Kosin University Gospel Hospital (Busan, Republic of Korea) during a five-year period from January 2005 to December 2009.

### Bilirubin attenuates the renal tubular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis [^112v1817]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Kim-1 and NGAL have been proposed as kidney injury markers. Kim-1 is a type 1 transmembrane glycoprotein with an immunoglobulin and mucin domain, and NGAL is a protein of the lipocalin family consisting of 8β-strands that form a β-barrel enclosing calyx. After renal injury, they are highly up-regulated in damaged renal proximal tubular cells, and can be detected in urine. The degree of renal injury is correlated with the increased urine concentration of NGAL and Kim-1. The functions of Kim-1 and NGAL are unclear, but their relations with apoptosis have been documented. According to the severity of renal damage, both the number of apoptotic cells and the expression of Kim-1 were increased, and Kim-1 was expressed in all the tubules displaying apoptotic labeling. In addition, the up-regulation of Kim-1 and NGAL was identified in CsA-induced renal injury, suggesting that renal tubular cells are injured by CsA. We confirmed the reno-protective effect of BIL by the significant reduction of urine Kim-1 and the decreased tendency of urine NGAL concentration, indicating that BIL helps to prevent epithelial cell injury. Histologic improvements in arteriolopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and tubular injury were found in BIL-treated rat kidneys, and these recoveries appeared to be associated with the reduction of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and tubular damage. The administration of bilirubin could be a target for protecting against the progression of renal injury, but further studies will be needed to facilitate such a potential therapy.

Secondly, an intronic SNP in UGT1A6, rs6742078 (chr2:233763993G > T), identified with both imputation panels, was found to be associated with disorders of porphyrin and bilirubin metabolism. UGT1A6 encodes a uridine 5′-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UDP-glucuronosyltransferase [UGT]). UGTs are enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation of lipophilic molecules, including bilirubin, into the conjugated, hydrophilic form that can be excreted in the urine. UGT1A6 has been shown to be associated with bilirubin levels in the GWASs on liver traits and bilirubin levels. Mutations in UGTs, specifically UGT1A1, cause the well-known autosomal recessive conditions Gilbert's syndromeand Crigler-Najjar syndrome, in which affected individuals present with excess unconjugated bilirubin. The findings presented here demonstrate novel recessive associations between another UGT not previously reported and dysfunctional bilirubin clearance.

### BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen [^115aBDnp]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Main

Bilirubin, an intermediate of the haem degradation pathway, plays a critical role in human physiology through the gut–liver axis. Alongside other organic molecules in bile such as cholesterol and bile acids, bilirubin diglucuronide (conjugated bilirubin) is secreted into the gut where it is either excreted or reabsorbed. When bilirubin diglucuronide is deconjugated by human or bacterial beta-glucuronidases into unconjugated bilirubin, it can be readily reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation or further metabolized via reduction reactions by gut microorganisms into the more excretable metabolites urobilinogen and stercobilinogen. Bilirubin reabsorption elevates serum bilirubin levels, while excretion as urobilinogen and stercobilinogen in stool and urine facilitates its clearance, completing the haem degradation pathway – (Fig. 1a).

Excretion

S-methyl DM4 and DM4-sulfo-SPDB-lysine were detected in urine within 24 hours of infusion as the main metabolites.

Specific Populations

No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx were observed based on age (32 to 89 years), race (White, Black, or Asian), body weight (36 to 136 kg), mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and any AST > ULN or total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST), or mild to moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 89 mL/min).

The pharmacokinetics of mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 1.5 ULN with any AST) or severe renal impairment (CLcr 15 to 30 mL/min) is unknown.

Drug Interaction Studies

### Are unexpected positive dipstick urine bilirubin results clinically significant? A retrospective review [^113PVjaR]. Laboratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Urine-bilirubin measurement is common in urinalysis dipsticks, which are known to yield a high rate of false positive results. We evaluated the usefulness of this test after multiple physicians in our system reported that they do not act on positive dipstick urine bilirubin findings.

Methods

We queried past records to determine how many samples with positive urine bilirubin results had associated abnormal results for liver function tests (LFTs) within 2 weeks before the positive urine bilirubin result. (LFTs included aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine transaminase [ALT], gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [GGT], and total bilirubin.) We labeled positive results on these test as expected positives. We labeled the positive test results for samples from patients who had not had abnormal LFT results within 2 weeks before the current testing as unexpected positives.

Results

During a 20-month period, we performed 241,929 urine-bilirubin tests. Of these, 831 (0.3%) yielded positive results. Of these positives, 60% were from patients who had abnormal LFT results in the previous 2 weeks. The remaining 40% of positive results were deemed to be unexpected positives. Of these, 80% had had LFTs ordered within 2 weeks after the positive urine bilirubin results. A total of 85% of those LFTs yielded an abnormal result.

Conclusion

In patients with an unexpected positive urine bilirubin test result, 85% had abnormal LFT results after their positive urine bilirubin result. However, these unexpected positives amounted to only 0.13% of all test results. Urine bilirubin does not appear to add significant information toward the diagnosis of most patients.

### Biomarkers in sepsis [^113rBjGB]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF ORGAN DYSFUNCTION

A systemic inflammatory response to infection (sepsis) can lead on to multiple organ dysfunction (severe sepsis). At present, the tools available for clinicians to diagnose organ dysfunction are limited in their capacity to detect early change. Renal dysfunction is currently diagnosed by a fall in urine output and a rise in serum urea and creatinine. However, oliguria may be an appropriate physiological response to hypovolaemia whereas, in patients with previously normal kidneys, creatinine does not rise above normal values until the glomerular filtration rate has fallen by approximately 75%. A vast array of blood and urine biomarkers, of which more than 30 are currently described, can detect decreases in renal function (e.g. cystatin C) or direct tubular stress or injury [e.g. neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)] at a much earlier stage. In addition, biomarkers can be used to predict renal recovery. At present, it is unclear which biomarkers best prognosticate for significant renal dysfunction and injury, and which can be successfully used to direct therapy to prevent (or at least ameliorate) acute kidney injury.

The same applies to the liver where traditional markers of dysfunction such as hyperbilirubinaemia and coagulopathy occur relatively late, peaking at 3–5 days after the diagnosis of sepsis. However, we have recently shown impaired biotransformation and hepatobiliary transport in a rat model as early as 6 h after faecal peritoneal contamination. This early dysfunction is supported by a significant rise in plasma bile acids in 48 patients on the day severe sepsis was diagnosed; unlike bilirubin (AUC 0.59), bile acid levels predicted 28-day mortality with high sensitivity and specificity (AUC up to 0.87).

To the Editor: — After reading the editorial entitled "Methylene Blue Test for Urinary Bilirubin" in The Journal, April 21, it seemed probable that a practical solution of the clinical problem of detecting small amounts of bile in the urine had been attained. According to the recent article by Myers, whose work is based on that of Franke and of Fellinger and Menkes, when 2 drops of Loeffler's methylene blue are added to 10 cc. of urine containing bilirubin the urine turns a brilliant green. Consequently the occurrence of such a "positive" test with the second normal urine specialmen which we tested according to directions was disturbing.

As the specimen, though containing no bile, was concentrated, yellow sample from a normal subject, it appeared to be possible that the "positive" test was entirely nonspecific for Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Diagnostic accuracy of semiquantitative point of care urine albumin to creatinine ratio and urine dipstick analysis in a primary care resource limited setting in South Africa [^116DUaEF]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations: the POC testing was performed in a laboratory environment on the same day as laboratory measurements and not at the patient side, in a less controlled environment it is possible the POC instrument will not perform to the same standards. The urine samples were kept in a fridge overnight and then frozen the next day at -80 °C before being shipped frozen to the central laboratory. Previous studies have shown good stability of urine albumin and ACR with long term storage at -70 °C, urine albumin and ACR is stable for up to 7 days when stored at 4 °C. To our knowledge no studies exist on the stability of urine dipstick analysis in previously frozen samples. Dipstick analysis on samples post refrigeration up to 48 h has shown: glucose to be stable up to 48 h at 4 °C; nitrites stable up to 24 h at 4 °C; leucocytes, haemoglobin, red blood cells, bilirubin show increased false negative results at 4 °C from between 4 and 8 h. It is possible the POC device would perform better on fresh urine as this is the recommended sample from the manufacturer (due to bilirubin and urobilinogen deterioration), however frozen and refrigerated samples can be used if returned to room temperature. Despite the widespread use of immunoassays and the kinetic Jaffe method to measure laboratory ACR, these methods remain far from ideal gold standards with which to compare POC ACR. There is currently no reference method or material for urine albumin; as such methods are not standardised despite this being a goal of the National Kidney Disease Education Program. Comparison of results between different methods have generally not found large biases. Although isotope dilution mass spectrometry-traceability has been established for the Jaffe method and a primary reference material exists the lack of matrix-specific secondary reference materials for urine creatinine mean that calibration is not ideal. Consequently, the use of laboratory ACR as the gold standard in our study was a pragmatic rather than ideal choice. Our study also has several advantages, the large sample size from a rural population in South Africa represents an important demographic group where POC testing may be most beneficial. While random urine sampling is not the recommended sample type (versus concentrated early morning sampling) it represents the situation that will be encountered across rural clinics in South Africa. We were able to process all 700 samples, without having to exclude outliers- and so better represent the clinical situation which would be encountered by health care workers.

### Kit for the preparation of technetium tc 99m mebrofenin [^116FrED4]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mebrofenin is an iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) derivative with no known pharmacologic action at the recommended doses.

Following intravenous administration in normal subjects, Technetium Tc 99m Mebrofenin was rapidly cleared from the circulation. The mean percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes was 17%. The injected activity was cleared through the hepatobiliary system with visualization of the liver by 5 minutes and maximum liver uptake occurring at 11 minutes post-injection. Hepatic duct and gallbladder visualization occurred by 10 to 15 minutes and intestinal activity was visualized by 30 to 60 minutes in subjects with normal hepatobiliary function. The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 1% (0.4 to 2.0%).

Elevated serum bilirubin levels increase renal excretion of Tc 99m HIDA agents. In two studies in which Tc 99m Mebrofenin was administered to patients having mean elevated serum bilirubin levels of 9.8 mg/dL (1.7 to 46.3 mg/dL), the mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during the first 3 hours was 3% (0.2 to 11.5%). The mean percent injected dose excreted in the urine during 3–24 hours was 14.9% (0.4 to 34.8%).

In jaundiced patients, the percent injected dose remaining in the blood at 10 minutes may be twice as high or more than the level in normals. Hepatobiliary transit may be delayed and visualization times increased. As a consequence, the quality of the images obtained frequently diminishes.

### Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) [^115t16N1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7	Liver Injury

Clinically significant liver injury, without findings of viral hepatitis, has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies approved for the treatment of MS, including OCREVUS. Signs of liver injury, including markedly elevated serum hepatic enzymes with elevated total bilirubin, have occurred from weeks to months after administration.

Patients treated with OCREVUS found to have an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) greater than 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) with serum total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN are potentially at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury.

Obtain liver function tests prior to initiating treatment with OCREVUS [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)], and monitor for signs and symptoms of any hepatic injury during treatment. Measure serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including new or worsening fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine, or jaundice. If liver injury is present and an alternative etiology is not identified, discontinue OCREVUS.

### BilR is a gut microbial enzyme that reduces bilirubin to urobilinogen [^1159G3qF]. Nature Microbiology (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

Despite the identification of urobilin as the yellow pigment in urine more than 125 years ago, the enzyme responsible for its production has remained a mystery. Though it was previously thought that multiple enzymes were involved in the reduction of bilirubin, our results support the finding that a single enzyme performs the reduction of bilirubin to urobilinogen. The identification of bilirubin reductase allowed us to profile its abundance in 7,960 metagenomes, showing that bilirubin reduction is a core feature of a healthy adult human microbiome and that neonates are often missing bilirubin reductase during the period of the highest incidence of neonatal jaundice. Furthermore, we found that the prevalence of bilirubin reductase is decreased in patients with IBD.

Our experiments have shown that bilirubin reductase can perform the complete reduction of bilirubin to urobilinogen and has the potential to act on multiple substrates, placing this single enzyme in a central role in bilirubin homeostasis. The importance of this process is further highlighted by the limited capacity of the UGT1A1 enzyme in the liver to conjugate serum bilirubin, a rate-limiting step in haem degradation. In addition, conjugated bilirubin is thought to be readily deconjugated by gut microorganisms, and the activity of microorganisms on conjugated bilirubin has been shown to be limited, suggesting that bilirubin reduction is the key step that determines the degree to which haem degradation by-products are reabsorbed or excreted.

### Bilirubin oxidation derived from oxidative stress is associated with disease severity of atopic dermatitis in adults [^116D8qwi]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is an essential antioxidant. Its oxidative metabolites, biopyrrins, are sensitive urinary markers of oxidative stress. Multiple studies suggest that oxidative stress affects the pathogenesis of skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD).

Aim

To examine oxidative stress-induced bilirubin oxidation and its association with AD pathogenesis in adults.

Methods

In total, 11 patients with AD and 7 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. Bilirubin oxidation profiles in the combined urine of the patients and that of the HCs were examined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The concentrations of urinary biopyrrins and serum biomarkers for AD disease severity, such as IgE and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC)/CCL17, were measured by ELISA to determine correlations between urinary biopyrrins and serum biomarkers. Local bilirubin oxidation in AD skin lesions was assessed by immunohistochemical analyses using two antibodies against bilirubin.

Results

Levels of dipyrrole-monopyrrole-aldehyde, a novel urinary biopyrrin, were higher in patients with AD than in HCs, and increased with disease severity based on the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) objective scoring system. Additionally, urinary biopyrrin levels correlated significantly with serum IgE and TARC/CCL17 levels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses revealed that biopyrrins were strongly expressed in both infiltrating and resident cells in AD lesions. However, bilirubin was expressed at low levels in the lesions, suggesting that bilirubin oxidation is augmented in AD lesions.

Conclusions

Bilirubin oxidation derived from oxidative stress in the skin lesions can be associated with disease severity of AD.

### Bilirubin attenuates the renal tubular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis [^112GwUUR]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Physiologic measurements

At the end of experiments, the rats were weighed and placed in metabolic cages, and urine was collected for 24 h. The urine volume was measured, and the albumin concentration was determined by ELISA kit (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Urinary albumin excretion was calculated in terms of milligrams of albumin per 24 hours. Creatinine levels in the serum (Bioassay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) and urine (Exocell, Philadelphia, PA, USA) were also measured using ELISA kit. CsA blood level was measured by a direct CsA radioimmunoassay kit (Immunotech, Czech Republic). Serum LDH was measured by using an automatic analyzer (ADVIA 2400, Siemens, USA). Bilirubin was measured by quantitative colorimetric assay (Bioassay systems #DIBR-180, CA, USA). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored with a tail cuff sphygmomanometer (Panlab S.L. Barcelona, Spain). SBP was recorded as the mean value of three separate measurements that were obtained at each session.

The measurement of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in urine

The urine samples were centrifuged immediately after being collected, and the supernatant was preserved at -70°C until use. The Kim-1 and NGAL were examined with the accompanying procedural instructions by using a Rat Kim-1 ELISA Kit (Bioassay Works LLC, Ijamsville, MD, USA) and a Rat NGAL ELISA Kit (BioPorto Diagnosis A/S, Denmark) in Sandwich ELISA analysis, respectively. The frozen and preserved samples were thawed at room temperature. The average values were derived in duplicate for all of the samples. The standard curve and the absorbance of the samples were measured with a micro-plate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. CA, USA) at a wavelength of 450 nm with reference reading at 650 nm.

Pump thrombosis in ventricular assist device patients — recognition and initial management are summarized as follows: Suspect pump thrombosis with lasting increases in pump power by > 50% accompanied by elevated, inaccurate flow estimates, and hemolysis manifested as an LDH elevation, and note that hemolysis may present as hemoglobinuria with dark, "tea-colored" or frankly bloody urine, and urinalysis may be positive for blood without red blood cells. Hemolysis may be detected by elevations in serum LDH (> 600 mg/dl or 2.5 times baseline depending on the assay used) and elevated free hemoglobin (> 40 mg/dl), with additional markers including increased total and indirect bilirubin or reduced haptoglobin levels, and non-occlusive thrombi can result in significant hemolysis in the absence of hemodynamic instability. When pump thrombosis is suspected or diagnosed, patients should be transported as soon as possible to the nearest VAD center where pump exchange or lysis can be performed if urgently required; proper management begins with hospitalization and systemic anti-coagulation, usually with unfractionated heparin or a direct thrombin inhibitor, and admission to an intensive care unit with inotropic support and diuretic therapy may be appropriate during a period of watchful waiting to determine if the situation reverses.

### The relations existing between bilirubinemia, urobilinuria and urobilinemia… [^114GXXi1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

I. THE QUANTITATIVE DETERMINATION OF BILIRUBIN IN BLOOD SERUM. When one considers the frequency of jaundice as a clinical manifestation and its importance as a diagnostic sign in various diseases, it is somewhat surprising that its detection and measurement should so long have escaped the refinements which come from the application of accurate laboratory methods. It is the every-day experience that both of the usual means of recognizing the presence of bile pigment in the blood — the visible pigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes and the reaction for bilirubin in the urine — are crude and often unsatisfactory. In the lesser grades of cholemia the urine does not react for bile pigment, and the appearance of the skin and membranes is often such as to leave one wholly in doubt as to whether or not a jaundice really exists.

### Office-based urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^113jyM3S]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Comprehensive urinalysis involves inspection of the urine, dipstick chemical analysis, and microscopy and can be performed in the office setting. When testing for urinary tract infection, midstream urine should be collected using the clean-catch technique. A urine collection bag specimen can be used for clinically stable febrile infants with suspected urinary tract infection; however, the presence of leukocyte esterase or nitrites warrants more invasive urine collection. Urine specific gravity shows hydration status. Urinary pH levels can indicate diet, metabolism, or the presence of stones. Bilirubin and urobilinogen may suggest hepatobiliary disease or hemolysis. Glucosuria often indicates uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and ketones suggest illness and inadequate nutrition. Hematuria on dipstick testing can be confirmed in the office using a spun urine sample. Proteinuria on dipstick testing should be followed by a quantitative test such as a spot urine albumin/creatinine ratio. In patients with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, the presence of nitrites is more specific for bacterial infection, and a positive leukocyte esterase result may occur from inflammation and infection. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is often unnecessarily treated in older patients. Without symptoms of urinary tract infection, urine culture is useful only in pregnancy and preparation for endoscopic urologic procedures.

### Repeated negative urine trypsinogen-2 dipstick test rules out diagnosis of post-ERCP pancreatitis [^117V7pdU]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

A dipstick test for urine trypsinogen-2 has been used in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, but there are only a few studies exploring the effectiveness of this test for early diagnose of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) pancreatitis (PEP).

Goals

The authors explore if the rapid point-of-care urine trypsinogen-2 dipstick test can replace assay of amylase in diagnosing PEP.

Study

For this prospective study, from Helsinki University Hospital 400 ERCP patients were enrolled in whom the authors analyzed plasma amylase or pancreas-specific amylase, bilirubin, and urine trypsinogen-2, and urine trypsinogen-2 with dipstick before, 4 and 24 hours after ERCP.

Results

PEP developed in 15 (3.8%) patients. Urine trypsinogen-2 concentrations were significantly higher in PEP than in non-PEP patients 24 hours after ERCP (P = 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test) but not 4 hours after ERCP (P = 0.094). When combined with abdominal pain symptoms at 4 hours the dipstick test had a sensitivity of 60%, a specificity of 99%, a positive predictive value of 64%, and a negative predictive value 98%. At 24 hours, sensitivity was 100%, specificity 98%, positive predictive value 71%, and negative predictive value 100%.

Conclusions

A positive dipstick seems to identify PEP cases and a negative test excludes PEP with high accuracy.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^11134N7L]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

Infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia presents with persistent jaundice as part of a clinical constellation that may include other symptoms based on the underlying etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and requires timely evaluation. The data presented in this review suggest that INH, EHBA, and infection (with CMV being the most common infection) account for 63.36% of all cases of infants presenting with elevated serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin.

The diagnostic evaluation should be guided by symptomatology and may include various imaging studies and serologic, hematologic, and urine investigations for various infections and endocrinopathies, as well as genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism. While the definitive diagnosis of EHBA requires a percutaneous liver biopsy, ongoing research is investigating less invasive methods of differentiating EHBA from other etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Inconsistency of the diagnostic approach is a major limitation of this review. While there are general guidelines directing the evaluation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, reports published prior to establishment of these guidelines are included in the present review. Moreover, diagnostic practices vary by country and multiple studies focused on the ability of a specific radiologic test to differentiate EHBA from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Together, these conditions may introduce inherent disparities in evaluation and may contribute to bias among these studies.

Variability in sample populations is also a potential source of bias. While 12 countries and 5 continents are represented, there is no data from Eastern Europe or South America. Disorders that may be uniquely prevalent in these areas may be underrepresented. Finally, summary data that includes subjects from all over the world may be less relevant to any specific country given the uneven distribution of etiologies between developed and developing countries as well as diseases endemic to the East and West.

Finally, the use of the category of INH to include all idiopathic cases of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a potential source of bias in this review. While Ipek et. al defined INH as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that persists beyond 3 months without another identifiable cause, multiple studies did not specifically use the term INH or provide a definition.

### A novel kidney failure prediction model in individuals with CKD: impact of serum bilirubin levels [^115oakdM]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Serum bilirubin levels, along with eGFR and proteinuria, were strong predictors for the progression of CKD to ESKD. Our novel prediction model, incorporating serum bilirubin levels, could accurately predict ESKD in individuals with CKD in clinical practice. This model may serve as a valuable tool to assist primary care clinicians in their decision-making process, whether it involves intensifying monitoring, initiating preventive therapies, or referring patients to specialists. It can also facilitate more effective risk communication between clinicians and patients and their families. Prospective clinical trials are needed to determine whether this prediction model can significantly improve the outcomes of individuals with CKD. Furthermore, the reason behind the highly predictive performance of serum bilirubin levels for CKD progression should be fully clarified in future studies.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review… [^111pL38E]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Persistent proteinuria is divided into three general categories: glomerular, tubular, and overflow. In glomerular proteinuria, the most common type, albumin is the primary urinary protein. Tubular proteinuria results when malfunctioning tubule cells no longer metabolize or reabsorb normally filtered protein. In this condition, low–molecular-weight proteins predominate over albumin and rarely exceed 2 g per day. In overflow proteinuria, low–molecular-weight proteins overwhelm the ability of the tubules to reabsorb filtered proteins. Further evaluation of persistent proteinuria usually includes determination of 24-hour urinary protein excretion or spot urinary protein-creatinine ratio, microscopic examination of the urinary sediment, urinary protein electrophoresis, and assessment of renal function.
32. NITRITES Nitrites normally are not found in urine but result when bacteria reduce urinary nitrates to nitrites.

Many gram-negative and some gram-positive organisms are capable of this conversion, and a positive dipstick nitrite test indicates that these organisms are present in significant numbers. This test is specific but not highly sensitive. Thus, a positive result is helpful, but a negative result does not rule out UTI. LEUKOCYTE ESTERASE Leukocyte esterase is produced by neutrophils and may signal pyuria associated with UTI. To detect significant pyuria accurately, 30 seconds to two minutes should be allowed for the dipstick reagent strip to change color, depending in the brand used. Leukocyte casts in the urinary sediment can help localize the area of inflammation to the kidney. BILIRUBIN AND UROBILINOGEN Urine normally does not contain detectable amounts of bilirubin.

Unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble and cannot pass through the glomerulus; conjugated bilirubin is water soluble and indicates further evaluation for liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction when it is detected in the urine. Normal urine contains only small amounts of urobilinogen, the end product of conjugated bilirubin after it has passed through the bile ducts and been metabolized in the intestine. Urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the portal circulation, and a small amount eventually is filtered by the glomerulus. Hemolysis and hepatocellular disease can elevate urobilinogen levels, and antibiotic use and bile duct obstruction can decrease urobilinogen levels.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^112zf4UR]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Infant cholestasis — diagnostic and laboratory evaluation underscores timely workup and key tests: In addition to laboratory studies, imaging, and liver histopathology are important to evaluate for bile duct patency because cholestatic infants must be evaluated promptly to exclude treatable surgical conditions, and performance of the Kasai HPE for BA is much less likely to benefit infants if performed after 3 months of age, underscoring the need for an expedient evaluation. During the evaluation of the infant with cholestasis, laboratory investigations will help define the etiology, with a critical and important initial blood test being the measurement of serum conjugated (direct) bilirubin (DB), which, if elevated, is a reliable laboratory indicator of cholestasis at this age; additionally, bacterial cultures of blood, urine, and other fluids should be obtained as dictated by the clinical assessment, and when evaluating a patient with cholestasis, it is crucial to review the standard local newborn screening as many diseases that cause cholestasis are tested such as hypothyroidism, galactosemia, tyrosinemia, and CF.

### Early detection of Parkinson's disease through multiplex blood and urine biomarkers prior to clinical diagnosis [^116GUeAS]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Genetic correlation analysi s

To estimate the genetic correlation between 13 biomarkers and PD, we utilized LD Score Regression (LDSC) and Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GNOVA), employing GWAS summary statistics. Our analysis covered 11 of these biomarkers, identifying significant genetic correlations with PD in six instances. Notably, both CRP and IGF-1 exhibited significant correlations in both LDSC and GNOVA analyses, with CRP showing a negative correlation (genetic correlation: -0.14, P = 6.31 × 10 −5) and IGF-1 a positive correlation (genetic correlation: 0.12, P = 7.52 × 10 −6). This consistent significance across both methodologies underscores their robust association with PD (See Supplementary Table 3).

Additionally, the superior performance of GNOVA in single-trait analyses enabled the detection of four additional fluid biomarkers associated with PD that were not identified in the LDSC analysis. Specifically, eosinophil count (genetic correlation: -0.08, P = 3.34 × 10–03), IRF (genetic correlation: -0.08, P = 3.45 × 10 −3), glucose (genetic correlation: -0.06, P = 3.51 × 10 −2), and total bilirubin (genetic correlation: 0.04, P = 3.18 × 10 −6) demonstrated notable correlations only in the GNOVA analysis.

These findings not only validate some of the previously identified biomarkers associated with PD risk but also confirm their genetic correlation with the disease.

### Cholic acid therapy in zellweger spectrum disorders [^114x77bA]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment with a combination of CA and CDCA was previously reported to lower bile acid intermediates in urine and plasma in a single ZSD patient with a severe phenotype. Additionally, levels of liver enzymes in plasma declined, growth rate improved and the degree of steatorrhea reduced (Setchell et al). Another two ZSD patients were treated with CDCA and/or ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) with different results on biochemical outcome. CDCA treatment alone resulted in decreased levels of THCA and DHCA in urine and plasma, but with an increase in the total serum bilirubin level. Similar results were found with UDCA treatment, albeit without increase in plasma transaminases and bilirubin. The second patient was treated with UDCA combined with CDCA, leading to decreased bile acid intermediates in plasma. Short single treatment with CDCA resulted in an increase of ALT, which recovered after the initiation of UDCA (Maeda et al). Furthermore, it has been reported that liver enzymes levels in plasma improved in patients with a defect in bile acid synthesis (Gonzales et al). In our study, we also observed decreased levels of DHCA and THCA in urine and plasma, but no positive effect on liver enzymes was observed. It should be noted that some patients, especially those in group 1, already had normal levels of AST, ALT and conjugated bilirubin at baseline. In patients with an increased AST and/or ALT at baseline (patient 1, 11, 13–19), these levels remained unaltered or increased after treatment with CA, particularly in those with advanced liver disease.

Limitations of our study are that the degree of steatorrhea and the effect of CA therapy on this parameter was not measured, the small size of the cohort, especially the number of patients in group 2, and the lack of a placebo arm in this trial. Despite the small number of patients in group 2, the correlation between the advanced liver disease and increase in plasma ALT, AST and conjugated bilirubin upon cholic acid treatment in these patients seems to be clearly present. This is supported by the finding that the levels of conjugated bilirubin, ALT and AST returned to baseline after cessation of cholic acid supplementation in one of these four patients (patient 16). Furthermore, Fibroscan® liver stiffness measurement is an accurate method to diagnose liver cirrhosis, which we used to define our patient groups, but is probably less useful to discriminate between various stages of liver fibrosis and therefore to assess therapeutic effect of CA (Chang et al).

### Is It bile or bilirubin? [^114p4aX4]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

From time to time there appear articles which make a plea for greater specificity in speaking and writing. 1, 2 This is as it should be, since precision in the communication of knowledge is important to the progress of science. In line with this thesis, we shall point out reasons for abandoning the inappropriate use of "bile in the urine, " a term long entrenched in medical tradition. Exactly how or when this phrase became common jargon is not certain. As early as 400 B. C. Hippocrates described jaundice and mentioned dark urine. 3 In the 13th Century John Actuarius wrote that discolored urine resulted from admixture with bile, or, more rarely, with blood. 4 Richard Bright, in an excellent treatise on jaundice published in 1836, referred to the urine of his patients as being "highly tinged with bile" or "loaded with bile.

### Bilirubin attenuates the renal tubular injury by inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis [^112VC5Yo]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Bilirubin (BIL) reduced the urine concentration of kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) in CsA-induced nephropathy (CIN)

Table 1 shows the physiologic parameters of animals at the end of experiment. CsA-treated rats presented a significant increase in serum creatinine (P < 0.01), but this was not improved by BIL treatment. The excretion of 24-hr urine albumin was not significantly increased in CsA-treated rats (5.4 ± 4.1 mg/day, 4.8 ± 5.1 mg/day, 9.1 ± 6.5 mg/day, and 6.6 ± 3.0 mg/day in vehicle (VH), BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA groups, respectively). There were no significant differences in body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), AST, and ALT among the groups. CsA blood level increased in CsA and BIL + CsA groups (P < 0.01). Serum bilirubin was not increased in VH and BIL groups at the time of sacrifice, and increased in CsA and BIL + CsA groups (P < 0.01) (Table 1). Urine NGAL and KIM-1 have been recognized as markers of renal tubular injuries. CsA significantly increased the urine concentrations of KIM-1 and NGAL (P < 0.05). BIL pretreatment reduced the CsA-induced increase of urine concentration of KIM-1(P < 0.05) (urine KIM-1, 1050.0 ± 261.3 pg/ml, 735.0 ± 120.2 pg/ml, 2278.0 ± 1523.3 pg/ml, and 858.0 ± 340.3 pg/ml; VH, BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA, respectively). In addition, a tendency, although statistically insignificant, for decreased urine NGAL concentration was shown in BIL-pretreated rats; urine NGAL, 512.2 ± 451.3 ng/ml, 852.6 ± 536.3 ng/ml, 1457.5 ± 1060.0 ng/ml and 668.0 ± 345.7 ng/ml; VH, BIL, CsA, and BIL + CsA, respectively (Figure 2 A, 2 B).

### Increased urinary excretion of bilirubin oxidative metabolites in septic patients: a new marker for oxidative stress in vivo [^113p1vRZ]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bilirubin oxidative metabolites (BOMs) are generated from bilirubin as a result of its scavenging action against free radicals. During sepsis, excess amounts of free radicals are produced, and they play an important role in the pathophysiological process. We studied whether urinary excretion of BOMs would increase under septic conditions in humans and compared BOM levels with other well-established clinical parameters of inflammation.

Methods

In 19 septic patients and 28 nonseptic control patients, the BOM concentrations in urine were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with an anti-bilirubin antibody.

Results

Urinary BOM levels in septic patients were much higher than those in control patients (21.6 ± 2.5 vs 1.4 ± 0.4 micromol/g creatinine, P < 0.001). Although there was a linear correlation between urinary BOM and serum total bilirubin levels (r = 0.392, P = 0.008), serum bilirubin levels were not significantly higher in the septic group than in the control group (P = 0.072). BOM levels correlated with body temperature (r = 0.801, P < 0.001), white blood cell counts in the peripheral blood (r = 0.590, P < 0.001), serum C-reactive protein (r = 0.653, P < 0.001), and the acute physiological and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score (r = 0.467, P = 0.003).

Conclusions

These results demonstrated a urinary increase in BOMs in septic patients. This increase indicates that urinary BOM level is a possible marker for continuous monitoring of sepsis severity in clinical practice.

### Increased urinary excretion of biopyrrins, oxidative metabolites of bilirubin, in patients with schizophrenia [^112yLonC]. Psychiatry Research (2007). Low credibility.

During periods of psychological stress, excess amounts of free radicals are produced, and they play an important role in the pathophysiological process. Bilirubin oxidative metabolites, biopyrrins, are generated from bilirubin as a result of this scavenging action against free radicals. We investigated whether the urinary excretion of biopyrrin is altered during the psychotic state in patients with schizophrenia. Biopyrrin concentrations in urine of 15 patients with schizophrenia and 100 age-matched healthy subjects were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with an anti-bilirubin antibody. Urine samples were obtained from the patients on first admission (acute state), 1 month after admission (sub-acute state), and on discharge (remission state). Urinary concentrations of biopyrrins in patients with schizophrenia on admission were significantly higher than those in the controls. Response to treatment was associated with a significant decrease in the concentrations of biopyrrins. Moreover, urinary concentrations of biopyrrins were still significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia in the sub-acute and remission states than in the controls. These results demonstrated an increase in urinary biopyrrins in patients with schizophrenia and a decrease with recovery from the psychotic state. These findings indicate that the urinary biopyrrin level is a possible indicator that can be useful in the continuous monitoring of psychotic states in clinical practice.

### Guideline for the evaluation of cholestatic jaundice in infants: joint recommendations of the north American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition and the European society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition [^116wTJS9]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Persistently cholestatic infant — targeted investigations (Tier 1 and Tier 2) are organized stepwise. Tier 1 aims "to evaluate after cholestasis has been established in order to both identify treatable disorder as well as to define the severity of the liver involvement", including laboratory tests such as "Blood — CBC + differential, INR, AST, ALT, AP, GGTP, TB, DB (or conjugated bilirubin), albumin and glucose", urine testing ("Urine — urinalysis, culture, reducing substances (rule out galactosemia)"), confirmation of newborn screening results ("Verify results of treatable disorders (such as galactosemia and hypothyroidism) from newborn screen"), and imaging ("Obtain fasting ultrasound"). Tier 2 aims "to complete a targeted evaluation in concert with pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist", expanding to endocrine and bile acid labs ("General — TSH and T4 values, serum bile acids, cortisol"), infectious and genetic assessments ("ID — direct nucleic acid testing via PCR for CMV, HSV, listeria" and "Genetics — in discussion with pediatric gastroenterologist/hepatologist, with a low threshold for gene panels or exome sequencing"), cystic fibrosis testing ("Sweat chloride analysis (serum immunoreactive trypsinogen level or CFTR genetic testing as appropriate)"), additional imaging ("CXR — lung and heart disease" and "Spine — spinal abnormalities (such as butterfly vertebrae)"), cardiac evaluation ("Echocardiogram — evaluating for cardiac anomalies seen in Alagille syndrome"), tissue diagnosis ("Liver biopsy (timing and approach will vary according to institution and expertise)"), and selected specialty consultations ("Cardiology/ECHO (if murmur present or has hypoxia, poor cardiac function)").

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^114SK92t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positive to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the 3 total serum bilirubin ranges.

Results

Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the 3 total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < .0001). There was no significant trend in comparable sensitivity values (0.380, 0.417, and 0.241, respectively) with P = 0.55. The false-positive proportion also increased as a function of total serum bilirubin (17.5%, 17.3%, and 72.0%) with P < .0001. Thus, if a patient's total serum bilirubin was elevated to the point of jaundice (> 3.0 mg/dL), it was approximately 4 times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive" (ie, nitrite-positive/culture-negative) compared with those with normal serum bilirubin levels.

Conclusions

Specificity of the urine nitrite test for urinary tract infection decreases as a function of increasing serum bilirubin. Most patients with hyperbilirubinemia and a positive nitrite test in our sample did not have an associated urinary tract infection.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### ABM clinical protocol # 10: breastfeeding the late preterm (34–36 6 / 7 weeks of gestation) and early term infants (37–38 6 / 7 weeks of gestation), second revision 2016 [^112V9hBf]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Outpatient follow-up for late preterm and early term infants — initial visit assessment: Although timing of length of hospital stay may vary, these infants require close follow-up in the early postpartum period and the first follow-up appointment or home health visit should normally occur 1 or 2 days after hospital discharge. The visit should review prenatal, parental, infant, and feeding history; review feeding since discharge with attention to frequency, duration, and any supplementation; obtain information about stool and urine output and infant behavior and review any written feeding record; examine the infant, obtain an accurate naked weight, and calculate percentage change from birth and from discharge; assess for jaundice with a transcutaneous bilirubin screening device and/or serum bilirubin determination if indicated; whenever possible, observe a breastfeed to evaluate latch, suck, and swallow; caution mothers not to taper expressing sessions too rapidly; and review safe sleeping practices.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of jaundice in infants — initial testing and timing at the 2‑week visit: The most important initial step in evaluating a jaundiced infant is measurement of total and direct (or conjugated) bilirubin, as visual estimation is unreliable and cannot determine indirect versus direct hyperbilirubinemia. Jaundice at 2 weeks of age is a relatively common finding, observed in 2.4% to 15% of newborns, but it should alert the provider of the possibility of cholestasis. Providers have several options: the most direct is to test serum for total and direct bilirubin at the 2‑week visit (or if concerned at any age). If the 2‑week‑old infant is breast‑fed with a normal physical examination and no history of dark urine or acholic stool, another option is follow‑up in 1 week; if jaundice persists at 3 weeks of age, laboratory evaluation is recommended to include fractionation of serum bilirubin.

### Syndromic variants of biliary atresia [^117Uy7hQ]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Biliary atresia (BA) presents in a stereotypical fashion with persisting neonatal jaundice, pale stools, and dark urine during infancy and is usually seen as an isolated anomaly in otherwise normal infants who, initially at least, are able to maintain normal growth and development. Cholestasis is present at the time of birth with raised conjugated bilirubin levels, although with a visibly normal liver and absence of fibrosis.

In a minority, other anomalies are present, and in most, these can be classified into various distinct syndromes. The aim of this review is to characterize clinical, genetic, and biological features of such syndromes using a literature review and illustration from the King's College Hospital series.
