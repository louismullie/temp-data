## Question

how to treat gout in knee

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat gout in the knee, and how to integrate acute flare management and long-term urate-lowering strategies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis versus key mimics, especially septic arthritis. Then, I should assess comorbidities that drive therapy choice. Next, I will address prompt treatment of the acute knee flare, including knee-specific options like intra-articular corticosteroid. After that, I need to decide whether and when to start urate-lowering therapy and how to provide flare prophylaxis. Finally, I will consider treat-to-target urate goals, agent selection and titration, monitoring, imaging adjuncts, and what to do if targets are not met or standard agents are contraindicated.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis before treating aggressively, because knee monoarthritis from gout can be difficult to distinguish from septic arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease, osteoarthritis flare, or other inflammatory arthritides, and a missed septic arthritis is dangerous. I should confirm with synovial fluid analysis when feasible to identify negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals and exclude infection, especially in a large joint like the knee or in prosthetic joints where infection risk and overlap are high [^111NWXYW] [^1148tMm5] [^117KwPXg].

> Wait, let me verify alternatives if aspiration is not feasible or crystal analysis is unavailable. I should not jump to conclusions; imaging can help. Characteristic ultrasound features such as the double contour sign or tophus, or dual-energy CT demonstrating urate deposition, can be used to establish gout without fluid analysis per contemporary EULAR imaging recommendations, and I must remember that residual crystals may persist in the knee even when asymptomatic, which can confound interpretation of serial aspirations [^115sXLbA] [^113MVkTw].

> Wait, when I cannot aspirate, I should apply validated clinical and imaging criteria to probabilistically diagnose gout, using ACR/EULAR tools and considering features like rapid onset, monoarticular involvement, erythema, hyperuricemia, and prior similar episodes, with the understanding that these are suggestive rather than definitive and must be integrated with the whole clinical picture [^1152rKQM] [^116XCZDk].

> Next, I should review patient factors that influence therapy choice for a knee flare. I need to check renal function to guide colchicine dosing or avoidance, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk to guide NSAID/COX-2 use and gastroprotection, diabetes or infection risk for glucocorticoids, and concurrent medications that interact with colchicine via P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4, because strong inhibitors like cyclosporine or clarithromycin make colchicine unsafe [^112iwfhS] [^114WSd67].

> Now, I will treat the acute knee flare promptly; hold on, let me ensure I act early because earlier treatment improves outcomes. All major guidelines support starting within 24 hours when possible and selecting from NSAIDs, low-dose colchicine, or glucocorticoids based on comorbidities and preferences; low-dose colchicine regimens are preferred to limit gastrointestinal toxicity, and short courses of oral steroids are acceptable when NSAIDs/colchicine are unsuitable [^116D1smR] [^1139UKZq] [^113ZunYn] [^1112yejL].

> For a large monoarticular knee flare, let me consider a knee-specific strategy. I should confirm there is no joint infection, then strongly consider aspiration and intra-articular corticosteroid for rapid local control with minimal systemic adverse effects, while recognizing that systemic NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are also efficacious and roughly comparable for pain relief in trials when appropriately used with protections [^116eZv8m] [^113Cax1z].

> I should not forget adjunctive measures during the acute episode. I need to advise joint rest, elevation, ice, and a cool environment; if pain is severe while anti-inflammatory therapy takes effect, short-term analgesic support may be considered with careful attention to risks, keeping the primary focus on anti-inflammatory control of the flare [^1167Wetv].

> But wait, what if we are considering starting urate-lowering therapy during the flare — will that worsen or prolong it. I should double-check the evidence and guidelines: if the decision to start ULT has been made, ACR permits initiation during a flare so long as adequate anti-inflammatory therapy is in place, and small RCTs suggest starting allopurinol during a flare does not prolong pain, while a recent RCT indicates starting febuxostat during a flare also did not prolong the episode and may help achieve the urate target more quickly, though anti-inflammatory cover remains essential [^1178sm23] [^111kgTxe] [^1178vY6y].

> Next, I should review prophylaxis against flares when initiating or uptitrating ULT, because mobilization of crystals increases flare risk early in therapy. I need to ensure concomitant prophylaxis for at least 3–6 months using low-dose colchicine or a low-dose NSAID when safe, and consider low-dose prednisone/prednisolone only if the first two options are contraindicated or not tolerated, extending prophylaxis if flares persist during titration [^113ZunYn] [^111dWSet] [^113UXfU7] [^114o8nJD].

> I will now examine whether to start long-term ULT at all after a knee flare. I should confirm classic indications: frequent flares, tophi, or radiographic damage; additionally, consider ULT after a first flare if CKD stage 3 or higher, serum urate above 9 mg/dL, or urolithiasis are present, while noting ACP recommends against ULT after a first or infrequent attack unless such risk features exist or patient preference drives shared decision-making [^113ZunYn] [^114VoGtr] [^1141dTky] [^1131DPMo] [^112dAtCQ].

> Let me think about targets and strategy if ULT is pursued. I need to ensure a treat-to-target approach with serial serum urate monitoring to achieve and maintain urate below 6 mg/dL for all patients, and below 5 mg/dL in severe disease with tophi or frequent flares, continuing therapy to sustain target and crystal dissolution rather than stopping once symptoms abate [^113ZunYn] [^1161UGP6] [^114Ny1jR] [^114N8dyy] [^112yeJDc] [^116z9DFQ].

> For agent selection and dosing, I should confirm allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT for essentially all patients, including those with moderate-to-severe CKD, and start low with careful uptitration to target; I need to start at 100 mg daily or lower and at 50 mg daily if stage 4 CKD or worse, then titrate every 2–4 weeks toward the urate goal while monitoring tolerability and labs, using smaller 50 mg increments in renal impairment [^11323pWu] [^114mYfJc] [^113ao6x8] [^11232od9] [^1136WZY2].

> Hold on, I should verify follow-up frequency and adherence measures, because treat-to-target requires structured monitoring. During titration I should check serum urate every 2–5 weeks and, once at goal, reassess every 6 months to maintain the target and reinforce adherence and prophylaxis until flares cease and tophi resolve if present [^115GKEfs] [^113ZunYn].

> If targets are not achieved or allopurinol is not tolerated, I need to reconsider options. I can consider a uricosuric such as probenecid initiated at low dose with titration in patients with adequate renal function, or combination XOI plus uricosuric therapy for refractory hyperuricemia; in severe, refractory tophaceous gout not meeting targets despite optimized oral therapy, pegloticase may resolve tophi but requires careful selection and monitoring [^11549yBk] [^1132QA8x] [^114FabdH] [^115RUWgX].

> Finally, for patients with frequent flares and contraindications to colchicine, NSAIDs, and glucocorticoids, I should confirm whether advanced anti-inflammatory options are appropriate. IL-1 inhibitors can be considered for acute flare management in highly selected cases without active infection, recognizing the evidence base and regulatory contexts, and they are not substitutes for achieving urate targets with ULT [^112ZXcoP] [^114gt9LN].

Treat gout in the knee by **confirming diagnosis with synovial fluid analysis** and starting **NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids** promptly to control inflammation [^111NWXYW] [^111ZX6nR]. Use intra-articular corticosteroids if systemic therapy is contraindicated or ineffective [^116eZv8m]. Initiate **urate-lowering therapy** (allopurinol first-line) in patients with ≥ 2 flares/year, tophi, or radiographic damage, and titrate to maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^113ZunYn] [^116z9DFQ]. Provide **lifestyle counseling** (weight loss, low-purine diet, limit alcohol) and monitor serum urate regularly; refer to rheumatology for refractory disease or diagnostic uncertainty [^1149vEW6].

---

## Diagnosis and initial assessment

- **Synovial fluid analysis**: Confirm diagnosis by identifying negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals [^111NWXYW].

- **Clinical evaluation**: Assess for acute monoarthritis, erythema, swelling, and severe pain [^116XCZDk].

- **Imaging**: Use ultrasound or dual-energy CT if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible [^115sXLbA].

---

## Acute management

### Pharmacologic therapy

- **NSAIDs**: First-line therapy; use maximum recommended doses short-term [^111ZX6nR].

- **Colchicine**: Effective at low doses; fewer gastrointestinal adverse events than high-dose [^111ZX6nR].

- **Corticosteroids**: Oral or intra-articular options for patients intolerant to NSAIDs or colchicine [^111ZX6nR].

- **IL-1 inhibitors**: Consider for refractory cases or contraindications to standard therapy [^112ZXcoP].

---

### Non-pharmacologic therapy

Recommended measures include **rest, elevation, and ice** to reduce inflammation [^1167Wetv], and **lifestyle modifications** such as weight loss, a low-purine diet, limiting alcohol, and maintaining hydration [^113AVMrk].

---

## Chronic management and prevention

### Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)

- **Indications**: ≥ 2 flares/year, tophi, or radiographic damage [^11323pWu].

- **First-line therapy**: Allopurinol, start low and titrate to serum urate < 6 mg/dL [^11323pWu].

- **Alternative therapy**: Febuxostat if allopurinol is contraindicated or ineffective [^11323pWu].

- **Uricosuric agents**: Probenecid for patients intolerant to xanthine oxidase inhibitors [^1132QA8x].

---

### Monitoring and follow-up

Key elements include **serum urate monitoring** every 2–5 weeks during titration, then every 6 months once at target [^115GKEfs], and **patient education** emphasizing adherence and lifestyle changes to prevent flares [^113bRmD5].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Rheumatology **referral** is indicated for refractory disease with persistent symptoms despite optimal therapy [^1149vEW6]. Referral is also appropriate for diagnostic uncertainty due to unclear etiology or atypical presentation [^1149vEW6]. Severe disease characterized by tophi, chronic arthropathy, or significant comorbidities likewise warrants specialist evaluation [^1149vEW6].

---

## Potential complications if untreated

If untreated, **gout can lead to joint damage**, including chronic arthritis, tophi, and irreversible joint destruction [^114EJ7Xd]. Functional impairment with reduced mobility and quality of life is common [^114EJ7Xd]. There is also an increased risk of total joint replacement [^114EJ7Xd].

---

Effective management of gout in the knee requires **prompt diagnosis**, acute inflammation control, and long-term urate lowering to prevent recurrence and joint damage.

### New developments in gout [^116kwExV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common type of inflammatory arthritis. This review summarizes the most recent studies on newer therapeutics, disease management strategies, and treatment recommendations.

- **Recent findings**: There are several new therapeutic agents being investigated for the management of acute gout symptoms, targeting interleukin-1β, as well as urate-lowering therapies, including uricase and inhibitors of renal urate transporter proteins. Interventions led by pharmacists and nurses, which include patient education, lifestyle advice, monitoring, and titration of urate-lowering medications, have been implemented to improve gout management. Recently, the American College of Rheumatology has published guidelines for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches for hyperuricemia and acute gouty arthritis.

- **Summary**: New therapeutic agents targeting the mechanism of inflammation (IL-1β) are under investigation. In addition, new urate-lowering medications are being rigorously evaluated for use alone or in combination with allopurinol for patients who do not respond to or are unable to take current therapies. There is also increasing interest in redesigning clinical care to improve patient education, self-management training, and urate-lowering medication titration. Although we await results of these investigations, the American College of Rheumatology treatment guidelines provide a framework for clinicians to deliver optimal gout care.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^116D1smR]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout. Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients following a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

- **Recommendation 4**: ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113ZunYn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). High credibility.

To provide guidance for the management of gout, this guideline includes indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review. This included network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, alongside patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

- **Results**: Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; designating allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); and using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day). A treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl, was advised. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

### Initiation of allopurinol at first medical contact for acute attacks of gout: a randomized clinical trial [^111kgTxe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Streamlining the initiation of allopurinol could result in a cost benefit for a common medical problem and obviate the perception that no treatment is required once acute attacks have resolved. Our objective was to test the hypothesis that there is no difference in patient daily pain or subsequent attacks with early versus delayed initiation of allopurinol for an acute gout attack.

- **Methods**: A total of 57 men with crystal-proven gout were randomized to allopurinol 300 mg daily or matching placebo for 10 days. All subjects received indomethacin 50 mg 3 times per day for 10 days, a prophylactic dose of colchicine 0.6 mg 2 times per day for 90 days, and open-label allopurinol starting at day 11. Primary outcome measures were pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the primary joint on days 1 to 10 and self-reported flares in any joint through day 30.

- **Results**: On the basis of 51 evaluable subjects (allopurinol in 26, placebo in 25), mean daily VAS pain scores did not differ significantly between study groups at any point between days 1 and 10. Initial VAS pain scores for the allopurinol and placebo arms were 6.72 versus 6.28 (P = 0.37), declining to 0.18 versus 0.27 (P = 0.54) at day 10, with neither group consistently having more daily pain. Subsequent flares occurred in 2 subjects taking allopurinol and 3 subjects taking placebo (P = 0.60). Although urate levels decreased rapidly in the allopurinol group (from 7.8 mg/dL at baseline to 5.9 mg/dL at day 3), sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein levels did not differ between groups at any point.

- **Conclusions**: Allopurinol ini

### 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for management of gout. Part 1: Systematic nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapeutic approaches to hyperuricemia [^1149vEW6]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for gout, especially with respect to indications for specialist referral, the ACR 2012 guidelines recommend referring patients for specialist consultation in the following situations:

- **Unclear etiology of hyperuricemia**: When the cause of hyperuricemia is not clear, a specialist referral is advised.

- **Refractory signs or symptoms of gout**: Referral is necessary if the symptoms persist despite standard treatment.

- **Difficulty in reaching the target serum urate level**: This is particularly significant in cases of renal impairment and following a trial of xanthine oxidase inhibitor treatment.

- **Multiple and/or serious adverse events from pharmacologic urate-lowering therapy**: If patients experience severe side effects from urate-lowering treatments, specialist advice is recommended.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^113zn2tH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Colchicine is regarded as beneficial in the treatment of acute gout but has a high frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of colchicine for relief of the signs and symptoms of acute gouty arthritis, compared to placebo and other treatment interventions.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the following electronic databases up to March 2006: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (from 1966), EMBASE (from 1980), CINAHL (from 1982), AMED (from 1985), Web of Science (from 1945), and Controlled Trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials evaluating symptom relief and adverse outcomes of colchicine therapy in acute gout were considered for this review.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently screened search results for inclusion, collected the data in a standardized form, and assessed the methodological quality of the trial using validated criteria. Results for continuous outcome measures were expressed as weighted mean differences. Dichotomous outcome measures were pooled using relative risk. The number needed to treat was calculated for significant outcomes.

- **Main results**: One RCT (N = 43) comparing colchicine to placebo for the treatment of acute gout was included in this review. The results favor the use of colchicine over placebo with an absolute reduction of 34% for pain and a 30% reduction in clinical symptoms such as tenderness.

### Treatment of chronic gout. Can we determine when urate stores are depleted enough to prevent attacks of gout [^113MVkTw]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine if lowering serum uric acid (SUA) concentrations below 6 mg/dl, or maintaining a longer duration of lowered SUA, would result in the depletion of urate crystals from the knee joints and prevent further attacks of gout.

A prospective study was initiated 10 years ago at the Philadelphia VA Medical Center. Its aim was to maintain SUA levels in patients with crystal-proven gout at 6 mg/dl. Patients in Group B, with SUA levels maintained for more than 12 months, displayed promising results. Nearly half of the patients experienced no gout attacks for 2 or more years, with the group having an average of 1 attack in the last year. Among these patients, three with tophi did not experience major flares of gout within the past year. Knee joint aspiration was performed on 16 asymptomatic patients, revealing that seven (44%) of them still had monosodium urate (MSU) crystals present in their knees.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^1132QA8x]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, specifically with respect to uricosuric therapy, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of uricosuric agents in patients who are resistant to or intolerant of xanthine oxidase inhibitors. Prefer sulfinpyrazone (200–800 mg/day) or probenecid (500–2,000 mg/day) in patients with normal or mildly impaired renal function. Alternatively, consider benzbromarone (50–200 mg/day) for patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency.

### The impact of gout guidelines [^115xVoQq]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

This review discusses the impact of recent treatment guidelines for the management of gout and the barriers to treating gout patients.

- **Recent findings**: Multiple guidelines for both the treatment and prevention of gout have been put forth in the last decade, including those from the British Rheumatism Society, the European League Against Rheumatism, the Multinational Evidence, Expertise, Exchange Initiative, the Japanese Society of Gout and Nucleic Acid Metabolism, and the American College of Rheumatology. These guidelines are designed to facilitate the management of gout by providers, with key recommendations for the management of hyperuricemia, which is the greatest risk factor for developing gout. However, despite the existence of these guidelines, overall adherence to recommendations has been slow. The initiation of urate-lowering therapy, titration of dosing, and monitoring of serum urate are infrequent. Greater education in proper management, as well as increased awareness of new treatment strategies, appear to be the primary reasons for this gap and offer avenues for improvement in management, as well as areas for further research.

Gout remains a treatment challenge for both acute and chronic disease. Despite the availability of management guidelines, primary care providers are struggling with appropriate management of the disease. More research tools and strategies are needed to improve overall outcomes and quality of care.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1135R2x9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite colchicine being used as a first-line therapy for acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. Furthermore, we searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared to another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with a 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants' withdrawal due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardized form, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous.

### Updates in the management of gout [^115dzN3p]. The American Journal of Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with gout are cared for by primary care physicians. Although both the physician and patient may easily recognize the acute arthritis of gout, errors in selecting the most appropriate medication and proper dose are common. The clinical stages of gout include asymptomatic hyperuricemia, intermittent gouty arthritis, and chronic tophaceous gout. Treatment of gout is usually considered after the first attack of arthritis, typically podagra. The aims of treatment are to alleviate the pain and inflammation associated with acute attacks, prevent future attacks, and decrease uric acid levels. Confusion frequently arises because certain medications, such as colchicine, may have dual purposes: to treat an acute attack and to suppress future attacks. The purpose of this management update is to provide practical advice about prescribing the proper medication considering both treatment goals and patient comorbidities.

### Treating to target: A strategy to cure gout [^114Pzu3i]. Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute gout attacks and the long-term complications of gout are associated with the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals in the joints and soft tissues, causing acute and chronic inflammation. The aim of long-term treatment is to reduce the serum urate (sUA) level to 6 mg/dl (≤ 360 micromol/l), below the saturation point of MSU, so that new crystals cannot form and existing crystals are dissolved. Serial joint aspiration studies confirmed the disappearance of crystals with effective urate-lowering therapy. There is good evidence that achieving sUA < 6 mg/dl (360 micromol/l) results in freedom from acute gout attacks, and shrinkage and eventual disappearance of tophi.

Gout patients must be informed about their diagnosis and educated about gout management, including the importance of compliance with long-term treatment. Patients starting urate-lowering therapy need to understand the importance of prophylactic therapy with colchicine or NSAIDs to reduce the risk of 'mobilization flares' in the first few months. In the long term, reduction in the sUA below the target level will result in gout being effectively cured.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^112iwfhS]. Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gout, specifically in the context of managing acute flares, the BSR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating an NSAID at the maximum dose or colchicine in doses of 500 mcg taken 2–4 times daily as first-line therapy. The choice of drug should depend on patient preference, renal function, and comorbidities, provided there are no contraindications. It is also advised to co-prescribe a gastroprotective agent for patients on NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors.

### Prophylaxis for acute gout flares after initiation of urate-lowering therapy [^113UXfU7]. Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

This review summarizes evidence relating to prophylaxis for gout flares after the initiation of urate-lowering therapy (ULT). We searched MEDLINE via PubMed for articles published in English from 1963 to 2013 using MeSH terms covering all aspects of prophylaxis for flares. Dispersion of monosodium urate crystals during the initial phase of deposit dissolution with ULT exposes the patient to an increased rate of acute flares that could contribute to poor treatment adherence. Slow titration of ULT might decrease the risk of flares.

- **Prophylaxis options**: According to the most recent international recommendation, the two first-line options for prophylaxis are low-dose colchicine (0.5 mg once or twice a day) or low-dose NSAIDs such as naproxen 250 mg orally twice a day. They can be given for up to 6 months. If these drugs are contraindicated, not tolerated, or ineffective, low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisolone) might be used.

- **Alternative therapies**: Recently, reports from four trials described the efficacy of canakinumab and rilonacept, two IL-1 inhibitors, for preventing flares during the initiation of allopurinol therapy.

Prophylaxis for flares induced by ULT is an important consideration in gout management. Low-dose colchicine and low-dose NSAIDs are the recommended first-line therapies. Although no IL-1 blockers are approved as prophylactic treatment, this class of drug could become an interesting option for patients with gout with intolerance or contraindication to colchicine, NSAIDs, or corticosteroids.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: A systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100,000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100,000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100,000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years against a background of an aging population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics, and inpatient settings.

### Urate-lowering treatment and risk of total joint replacement in patients with gout [^114EJ7Xd]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinically, gout is characterized by acute attacks of synovitis, chronic arthritis, subcutaneous urate crystal concretions (tophi), and an increased risk of urolithiasis. It is also associated with higher mortality and many comorbidities. Gout results from chronic hyperuricemia, which leads to the deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals mainly in and around peripheral joints, causing irreversible joint damage. Similar to osteoarthritis (OA) and other arthropathies, gout may result in the need for total joint replacement (TJR) to restore function and reduce pain.

Mechanistic explanations for the irreversible joint damage associated with gout primarily focus on the interaction between MSU crystals and joint tissues, especially cartilage, bone, and synovium. However, few studies have examined the association between irreversible joint damage in gout and the possible increased need for total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement (TKR). One previous study reported the co-localization of joints affected by acute attacks of gout and OA. We recently examined the risk of comorbidities associated with gout and found a higher prevalence of OA in people with gout. The positive association between gout and OA, the single most important risk factor for TJR, could potentially lead to an increased risk of TJR in patients with gout.

Effective urate-lowering treatment (ULT) reverses hyperuricemia and may help dissolve MSU crystals, which theoretically may retard the progression of joint damage and subsequently reduce the risk of TJR in patients.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^113Cax1z]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This document is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), for acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies up to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with a placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 trials (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 trials (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 trials compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection bias.

### Recent pharmacological advances in the management of gout [^116FjgP5]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite the availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the significant development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialed continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence underlying the recommendations from EULAR can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

### Evolution of management of gout: A comparison of recent guidelines [^114JoBPf]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

There have been several guidelines on the management of gout over the last decade; however, inconsistencies between them create confusion for practitioners. This review highlights areas of agreement between guidelines and discusses data where disagreements exist.

- **Recent findings**: For acute gout, the guidelines agree that anti-inflammatory treatment should start as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours. Older guidelines preferred NSAIDs or colchicine over steroids, but newer ones leave the choice of agent to the physician. For colchicine, all guidelines recommend using a low dose. Intra-articular, oral, or intramuscular steroids are all described as effective. For management of hyperuricemia, indications for initiating urate-lowering therapy (ULT) have become more inclusive over the years by requiring a lower burden of disease severity or including patient comorbidities. Probenecid has fallen out of favor with most guidelines favoring allopurinol over febuxostat. Although there is a disagreement about the timing of initiation for ULT, guidelines recommend treating to a target serum urate (sUA) of less than 6 mg/dl, and less than 5 mg/dl for patients with more severe disease. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis has gained strong support over the years.

- **Summary**: Most guidelines are in agreement with recommendations for the management of gout and most changes have been directional and evolutionary.

### Effectiveness of interventions for the treatment of acute and prevention of recurrent gout — a systematic review [^113sgmdg]. Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to determine the evidence for the effectiveness of treatments for acute gout and the prevention of recurrent gout.

- **Method**: Seven electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials of treatments for gout from their inception to the end of 2004. No language restrictions were applied. All randomized controlled trials of treatments routinely available for the treatment of gout were included. Trials for the prevention of recurrence were included only if patients who had previously had gout and had at least 6 months of follow-up were studied.

- **Results**: We found 13 randomized controlled trials of treatment for acute gout, two of which were placebo-controlled. Colchicine was found to be effective in one study; however, the entire colchicine group developed toxicity. The only robust conclusion from studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is that pain relief from indometacin and etoricoxib is equivalent. We found one randomized controlled trial, reported only as a conference abstract, of recurrent gout prevention.

- **Conclusion**: The shortage of robust data to inform the management of a common problem such as gout is surprising. All of the drugs used to treat gout can have serious side effects. The incidence of gout is highest in the elderly population, and it is in this group — who are at high risk of serious adverse events — that we are using drugs of known toxicity. The balance of risks and benefits for the drug treatment of gout needs to be reassessed.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^1132ms2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

- **Objectives**: To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout. The primary comparison was low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

- **Main results**: We included four trials (803 randomized participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants) and low-dose colchicine (74 participants).

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^113AVMrk]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

The goal of medical treatment for gout is to acutely control inflammation from flares and chronically lower uric acid levels. Gout flares are typically treated with NSAIDs, such as naproxen, indomethacin, or selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, as well as colchicine and oral or intra-articular corticosteroids, either individually or in combination. Patients whose gout flares are refractory to these traditional treatments or have medical contraindications may be considered for monoclonal antibodies against IL-1 or adrenocorticotropic hormone.

- **Medications for gout flares**: The first-line treatment for lowering uric acid is with xanthine oxidase inhibitors, which halt the synthesis of uric acid from hypoxanthine and include allopurinol and febuxostat. Consideration is then given to medications that promote uric acid excretion (uricosuric) such as probenecid and those that facilitate uric acid degradation, like pegloticase, an intravenously administered recombinant uricase. Newer therapeutics include arhalofenate, which has demonstrated both uricosuric and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials, and oral recombinant uricases.

Finally, lifestyle modifications such as weight loss and limiting the intake of purine-rich foods are recommended, in addition to medications, to help decrease inflammation and uric acid levels.

Surgical treatment for gout is generally reserved for cases involving damage to the surrounding soft tissue or concomitant septic arthritis.

### 2016 updated EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the management of gout [^112D3qBA]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of gout, particularly concerning anti-inflammatory therapy, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend initiating colchicine (0.5–1 mg/day, reduced in renal impairment) as first-line prophylactic treatment. It is critical to recognize the potential neurotoxicity and/or muscular toxicity associated with prophylactic colchicine in patients who have renal impairment or are on statin therapy. Co-prescribing colchicine with strong P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided.

### Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment of acute gout [^112fhVor]. JAMA (2015). Low credibility.

- **Clinical question**: Are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) associated with better outcomes than cyclooxygenase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, IL-1 inhibitors, or placebo in the treatment of acute gout?

- **Bottom line**: NSAIDs are not significantly associated with a difference in pain reduction compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors and glucocorticoids for treating acute gout. However, NSAIDs are associated with higher rates of adverse events and higher rates of withdrawal due to adverse events compared with cyclooxygenase inhibitors.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^112N9Jrm]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Numerous publications document deficits in the management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder. This includes the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy, a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers, incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management, and suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations. Additionally, comorbidities and drug interferences complicate the treatment of gout, patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout, and limited urate-lowering alternatives all pose challenges.

The recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

The British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) 2017 guidelines present recommendations for medical management of gout, particularly during acute flares.

- **Joint aspiration and corticosteroids**: Consider performing joint aspiration and administering an intra-articular corticosteroid for patients experiencing acute monoarticular gout.

- **Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids**: For patients unable to tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine, and if intra-articular injection is not feasible, consider administering a short course of oral corticosteroids or a single injection of an intramuscular corticosteroid as an alternative.

- **Oligo- or polyarticular attacks**: Administer systemic therapy, such as corticosteroids, to patients experiencing oligo- or polyarticular attacks of gout.

### Interventions for tophi in gout [^115RUWgX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Tophi develop in untreated or uncontrolled gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014. The objectives of this study were to assess the benefits and harms of non-surgical and surgical treatments for the management of tophi in gout.

- **Search methods**: We updated the search of Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase databases to 28 August 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: We included all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials examining interventions for tophi in gout in adults.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included one trial in our original review and added four more trials (1796 participants) in this update. One trial had three arms: pegloticase infusion every two weeks (biweekly), monthly pegloticase infusion (pegloticase infusion alternating with placebo infusion every two weeks), and placebo. Two studies examined lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with allopurinol. One trial studied lesinurad 200 mg or 400 mg in combination with febuxostat. Another trial compared febuxostat 80 mg and 120 mg to allopurinol. Two trials were at unclear risk of performance and detection bias due to lack of information on the blinding of participants and personnel. All other trials were at low risk of bias. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for imprecision; one study; 79 participants) showed that biweekly pegloticase resolved tophi in 21/52 participants compared with 2/27 on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 5.45, 95% confidence interval (C.

### Gout-induced arthropathy after total knee arthroplasty: A report of two cases [^1148tMm5]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

Gout, although relatively rare in joint replacements, can present as an acute or chronic painful knee or hip arthroplasty. Gout and acute infection of a joint replacement can be difficult to differentiate, with the physical examination and laboratory study results frequently being similar. Both conditions can present with a rapid onset of joint pain, swelling, erythema, and constitutional symptoms, including fevers and malaise. Laboratory findings in both conditions often include an elevated leukocyte count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level. Negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals in the synovial fluid confirm the diagnosis of gout.

The mistaken diagnosis of septic arthritis in a joint replacement with crystal-induced synovitis can lead to inappropriate open debridement or component removal. The study includes a review of the literature and presents two cases of gout after total knee arthroplasty. These cases suggest that in situations of suspected sepsis without synovial fluid crystals, operative intervention is indicated with a presumed diagnosis of septic arthritis. The identification of chalky white or yellow deposits in the synovium or bone is highly suggestive of gout. The definitive diagnosis is made by polarized light histologic evaluation of these tissues. If these deposits are present in the absence of a positive preoperative culture, positive Gram stain for bacteria, or component loosening, component retention is indicated.

### Gout: will the "king of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured [^111dUatd]? BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment guidelines, treat-to-target serum urate, and new drugs for gout.

Treatment guidelines for gout have been recently published by both the ACR in 2012 and the EULAR in 2016. Several key aspects of appropriate management are addressed in these treatment guidelines, which should be helpful to providers since gout care is critically suboptimal. A controversial recommendation to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease by adjusting to creatinine clearance in EULAR guidelines has been challenged since the risk of hypersensitivity reactions associated with allopurinol seems to be related to the starting dose, not the maximal dose. Therefore, there is currently no rationale to limit the maximum dose of allopurinol in patients with gout and chronic kidney disease.

Treat-to-target (T2T) serum urate (sUA) is not a new concept in gout, but one that has been brought to center stage by the leading treatment recommendations in the ACR and the EULAR guidelines, as well as by a recent consensus statement about T2T. The rheumatology community considers the existing evidence regarding T2T to a goal of sUA less than 6 mg/dL in gout as sufficient based on three key correlates for achieving sUA less than 6 mg/dL, namely:

1. Associated benefits of reduction of gout flares, tophi, and medical care costs by achieving and maintaining this target.
2. The fact that this sUA target is below the solubility threshold of urate, which prevents its crystallization in body fluids at 6.8 mg/dL.
3. The use of this sUA threshold as a primary outcome.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^116qMxjN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). High credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout generally comprises three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout, and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE for studies up to 7 October 2013. We also reviewed the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and conducted a hand search of reference lists of articles. Additionally, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. No date or language restrictions were applied.

- **Selection criteria**: We considered all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled clinical trials comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes included pain (the proportion with a 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of the target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, and health-related quality of life.

### Initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flare does not prolong the current episode: a randomized clinical trial [^1178vY6y]. Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Gout is a common arthritic condition resulting from monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition. Urate-lowering treatment (ULT) is important for patients with gout. Previous guidelines have provided conflicting recommendations on whether ULT should be initiated during an acute gout flare. Generally, ULT is initiated after an acute flare has resolved to avoid prolongation of symptoms. The incidence of gout flares has been positively correlated with the reduction of serum uric acid (sUA) levels in the first few months after initiating ULT.

However, ULT could be initiated during an acute flare to reduce the number of outpatient treatment visits required, thereby increasing patient compliance. The 2016 EULAR Gout Management Recommendations have not provided clear guidance on this issue. Additionally, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines for the management of gout have conditionally recommended that pharmacological urate-lowering therapy could be initiated during an acute gout flare based on anti-inflammatory treatment. This recommendation was graded as moderate based on evidence from two small randomized clinical trials and an observational study.

Two small randomized clinical trials observed that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. Febuxostat (40 mg/day) demonstrated a superior urate-lowering effect compared to limited allopurinol doses (maximum 200–300 mg/day). At present, no studies have been published regarding the initiation of febuxostat for acute gout flares.

The response rate of patients with gout is about 80% within 7 days of using traditional non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with maximum 'days to resolution' being 28 days. Hence, diclofenac was continued for 4 weeks in this study. We found that initiation of febuxostat administration during an acute gout flare did not prolong acute flares, and the rate of 'treat to target' was higher in the febuxostat group. This may increase patient compliance.

Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated that initiating allopurinol treatment during an acute gout flare did not prolong painful gout flares. In one of the trials, allopurinol was initiated at 100 mg daily for the first 14 days and then increased to 200 mg daily for the next 14 days. The investigators observed that the days to resolution were 15.4 days for the allopurinol group and 13.4 days for the placebo group (P = 0.05). However, the sample cohort used in the study was small (17 in the placebo and 14 in the allopurinol group), and the type of anti-inflammatory drugs used in the study increased the experimental uncertainty. In addition, the days to resolution coincided with the time it takes to spontaneously resolve inflammation during typical gout flares. In another published study, patients presenting within the first 7 days of onset of an acute gout flare were evaluated. The mean daily visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores did not differ significantly between the study groups at any point between days 1–10. However, allopurinol was initiated at 300 mg daily, which was not consistent with the standard practice at that time.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^114gt9LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability, making quick and effective pain relief important. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids.

- **Objectives**: To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

- **Search methods**: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE on 19 June 2013, applying no date or language restrictions. We hand-searched the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the US National Institutes of Health.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab, or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent, or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis.

### Remembering the forgotten non-communicable diseases [^111N3yZt]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The epidemiology, diagnosis, and optimal management of gout presents several challenges, beginning with the issue of correctly diagnosing the condition. Gout often manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis in the early phase, progressing to chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in later stages. Patients may also experience tophi and renal stones alongside arthritis. The confirmed diagnosis through joint fluid aspiration is notably low. Given that the great toe and other lower extremity joints are commonly affected in conditions such as osteoarthritis and pseudogout, making a presumptive diagnosis of gout based on a history of big toe pain coupled with a borderline high or elevated serum urate level is problematic (Figure 8).

- **Diagnostic challenges**: Additional clinical features, such as acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margins, and punched-out erosions typical of gout, should be documented. It is crucial to consider differential diagnoses, including osteoarthritis, pseudogout, and rheumatoid arthritis, to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

- **ARA criteria and aspiration**: The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria are commonly used for classifying acute gouty arthritis but prove inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. Therefore, attempts should always be made to aspirate the joint, bursa, or tophus to confirm the diagnosis, as identifying urate crystals in synovial fluid is definitive for gout. This is essential because the treatment for gout often requires a lifelong commitment.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). High credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to "cure" the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practices, barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout.

Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensure adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Joint nociceptor nerve activity and pain in an animal model of acute gout and its modulation by intra-articular hyaluronan [^115TTA2A]. Pain (2018). Low credibility.

In this study, we describe for the first time in mammals that injection of MSU crystals in the rat knee joint evokes an augmented joint nociceptor activity. This evolves in parallel with the local inflammation and behavioral signs of pain, closely resembling those observed in human gouty attacks. Thus, it appears as a potentially useful animal model of gout arthritis. Our data further show that intra-articular injection of high molecular weight (HMW) sodium hyaluronate reduces joint nociceptor impulse activity elicited by movements that likely cause joint pain. This demonstrates that the analgesic action of HMW-HA, previously observed in osteoarthritis, also occurs in gouty arthritis.

- **Mechanisms for augmented joint nociceptor activity, local inflammation, and pain induced by monosodium urate crystals**: In human gout and pseudogout arthritis, it has been proposed that the deposition of MSU or calcium pyrophosphate crystals in joint synovial fluid and tissues mechanically harms joint surfaces, contributing to acute inflammation and pain. Several other mechanisms possibly determine the reaction to intra-articular crystals, and many lines of evidence support the central role of immune cell activation as the main triggering mechanism. Our observation in rats that larger, needle-shaped MSU crystals were not more effective than the small, amorphous ones in causing inflammation, nocifensive behavior, and enhancement of joint nociceptor activity speaks against direct mechanical injury by crystals as the mechanism for stimulation of sensory nerve terminals in gout pain.

### What makes gouty inflammation so variable [^115mVtZi]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The intersecting effects of therapeutics on gouty inflammation involve several key mechanisms. The primary treatment options for prophylaxis and acute gout treatment intersect with multiple novel inflammation-mediating pathways. Specifically, indomethacin, ibuprofen, and certain other NSAIDs activate PPAR-γ. Corticosteroids inhibit the transcription of many inflammatory genes but simultaneously regulate annexin A1. Paradoxically, corticosteroids may induce NLRP3, potentially contributing to rebound flares of acute gout after cessation of steroid therapy. Low doses of colchicine suppress not only neutrophil and endothelial function but also multiple inflammatory effects in macrophages, largely due to colchicine-induced activation of AMPK.

Regarding investigational agents, randomized clinical trials of the IL-1β-specific monoclonal antibody canakinumab have demonstrated superiority over a single dose of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide in reducing pain in acute gout and delaying the time to the next acute gout flare. Canakinumab is approved in Europe for acute gout therapy. Multiple retrospective case series have reported on the efficacy of anakinra (recombinant IL-1ra) in acute gout in many, but not all, patients. The failure of the IL-1 blocker rilonacept in acute gout (but not for anti-inflammatory flare prophylaxis) may have been due to binding of rilonacept to IL-1ra. Finally, the partial PPAR-γ agonist arhalofenate, which is uricosuric, has been associated with a decreased frequency of acute gout flares compared to other treatments.

### Management of gout: A systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1135h9gE]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

- **Purpose**: To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

- **Data sources**: Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

- **Study selection**: Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

- **Data synthesis**: High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

- **Methods**: This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases from their inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes, such as results of laboratory and radiographic tests (including serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making regarding additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management; short-term, patient-centered clinical outcomes like pain, joint swelling, and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) method.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

- **Recommendation**: ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

### An appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the management of gout [^1168EXpt]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to provide an appraisal of the 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for the management of gout.

Recent findings highlight that the ACR's first clinical practice guidelines for the management of gout primarily focus on recommendations for both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approaches to hyperuricemia and the treatment and prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis. The RAND/UCLA appropriateness methodology was employed to assess the risks and benefits of alternative treatments concerning efficacy, safety, and quality, although not for cost-effectiveness. Notably, novel recommendations include the use of either allopurinol or febuxostat for first-line urate-lowering drug therapy (ULT), the importance of screening for HLA-B✱5801 prior to initiating allopurinol in Asians at relatively high risk for allopurinol hypersensitivity, and the use of pegloticase for patients with severe, symptomatic, tophaceous gout that is refractory to, or intolerant of, appropriately dosed ULTs.

An appraisal and comparison with other guidelines using the Guidelines International Network and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) criteria demonstrated good scores for scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, rigor of development, clarity of presentation, editorial independence, and overall quality. However, the guidelines did not score well for applicability.

The ACR guidelines provide comprehensive, up-to-date, good-quality, evidence-based, expert consensus recommendations for the management of gout in clinical practice but score poorly for applicability. To improve the management of gout within the community, a summary of key recommendations, criteria for audit, and standards is necessary.
