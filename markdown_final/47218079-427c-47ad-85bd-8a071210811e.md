## Question

ICP Monitoring

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical rationale and pathophysiology that justify ICP monitoring. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including randomized and observational data. Next, I will review guideline-based indications and how they vary by population and context. After that, I need to examine device selection, accuracy, and procedural considerations. Then, I should appraise management thresholds and the concept of ICP dose. I will also consider special populations and noninvasive alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic, risk–benefit framework and outline knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure to double-check conflicting findings and correct any misinterpretations as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale. Elevated ICP is a key driver of secondary brain injury after acute brain insults, reducing cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP = MAP − ICP) and threatening herniation; continuous ICP monitoring aims to detect and treat intracranial hypertension early, thereby mitigating secondary injury and guiding CPP-targeted therapy, although the causal benefit remains debated and likely depends on how the data are used in practice [^111naWNo] [^115Qb6dK].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before drawing conclusions. The BEST:TRIP randomized trial found no mortality or functional benefit to protocolized ICP monitoring versus imaging/clinical examination–guided care, which tempers enthusiasm for universal monitoring, yet multiple large observational cohorts associate ICP monitoring with lower mortality, including SYNAPSE-ICU and several trauma registry analyses. Reconciling these findings requires acknowledging confounding by severity, practice patterns, and the impossibility of blinding in this domain [^1151sSxV] [^115UAYUL] [^1141cRoP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should double-check the nuances. Observational signals of benefit may reflect earlier detection and more aggressive, protocolized management rather than the monitor itself, and a CREACTIVE analysis even linked ICP monitoring to worse 6‑month outcomes and more complications, highlighting the risk of therapeutic intensity without clear benefit in some settings. This heterogeneity argues for careful patient selection and standardized protocols rather than blanket use [^111g42Ww] [^1144Jt1d].

> Next, I should review guideline-based indications and make sure I cite them correctly. Adult BTF 4th Edition supports ICP monitoring in severe TBI with abnormal CT and GCS ≤ 8, and considers it in select patients with normal CT but high-risk features (age > 40, motor posturing, SBP < 90 mmHg); ACS guidance aligns with this, while pediatric BTF suggests ICP monitoring at Level III due to limited evidence; for spontaneous ICH, AHA/ASA and ESO/EANS acknowledge uncertainty and recommend selective use, particularly with hydrocephalus or altered consciousness, rather than routine monitoring [^112uSqAN] [^1117u4mu] [^112sYQjA] [^11785x6C].

> I need to check how real-world practice compares with guidelines. Surveys and observational cohorts show substantial center variability and low adherence, with only about one-third of eligible patients actually monitored in some cohorts. This variability complicates interpretation of outcome studies and underscores the need for clearer, context-specific criteria and quality-improvement efforts [^115UAYUL] [^111g42Ww] [^114HVD1n].

> Let me consider device selection and measurement accuracy. External ventricular drains (EVDs) remain the gold standard because they measure global ICP and enable CSF drainage, whereas intraparenchymal monitors are reliable but do not allow therapeutic drainage; subdural/epidural sensors are less accurate and not recommended for routine use; meta-analytic data suggest small average differences between devices, but clinically meaningful discrepancies can occur, especially with intracranial gradients or catheter drift, so waveform quality and zeroing matter [^115wwZpq] [^111pdcR6] [^112LvsJs] [^112LvsJs].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said EVDs are the "most accurate" without qualification. I should verify and correct that. While EVDs are considered the reference method and allow CSF drainage, head-to-head data indicate average differences on the order of 1–2 mmHg with parenchymal probes, and the main limitation is compartmental gradients and occasional drift, not a uniform superiority of accuracy across all contexts; therefore, the choice should be individualized by pathology and the need for CSF diversion [^116qQURf].

> I will now examine management thresholds and the ICP "dose" concept. Traditional targets treat sustained ICP > 20–22 mmHg, but emerging data suggest cumulative exposure (area under the curve of ICP over time) better predicts outcomes than isolated spikes. Thresholds may need individualization based on autoregulation and injury phenotype, and expert algorithms advocate tiered escalation integrating CPP, autoregulation status, and clinical trajectory rather than a single number trigger [^113dHCWh] [^111ACQ6b] [^112i2EzU].

> But wait, what if the patient is elderly or has posterior fossa pathology? Do the same rules apply? In older adults, cerebral atrophy may blunt ICP elevation risk, and observational data conflict on benefit, with some suggesting harm, so a more selective approach is reasonable; for pediatrics, monitoring is variably used and evidence is weaker, supporting judicious application; for posterior fossa lesions, supratentorial ICP may not reflect infratentorial pressure, and dedicated infratentorial monitoring may be warranted in select cases [^1137Cgd3] [^111cNcV1] [^1117u4mu] [^115pREUR].

> Next, I should review noninvasive alternatives and be careful not to overstate their readiness. Techniques such as optic nerve sheath diameter ultrasound, transcranial Doppler, and near-infrared spectroscopy show promise but cannot yet replace invasive monitoring for continuous, accurate ICP assessment; they may serve as adjuncts or triage tools where invasive monitoring is unavailable or contraindicated, with explicit acknowledgment of limited sensitivity/specificity and the lack of continuous data [^114Gbtxq] [^113AcAVG] [^1111DH1d].

> I need to ensure procedural and safety considerations are addressed. Early initiation of monitoring may reduce the "ICP dose", and trained intensivists can place intraparenchymal catheters faster than neurosurgeons in some settings with similar low complication rates; complications are uncommon but include hemorrhage and infection, with EVDs carrying higher overall risk that rises with duration, reinforcing the need for timely removal once stability is established [^115JcUeR] [^112B8zVC] [^111NZBKe] [^1145apUU].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk–benefit framework and double-check internal consistency. Potential benefits include early detection of intracranial hypertension, guidance of CPP-targeted therapy, and integration with multimodal monitoring; potential harms include unnecessary interventions, complications, and increased resource use without outcome gain; therefore, use is most compelling when the pretest probability of intracranial hypertension is high, when clinical examination is unreliable, when CSF diversion is anticipated, or when protocolized neurocritical care is available, with ongoing re-evaluation to de-escalate when low risk or no benefit is evident [^115Qb6dK] [^111naWNo].

> Finally, I should outline knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure not to overpromise. High-quality, pragmatic randomized trials are unlikely given equipoise and logistics, so progress will hinge on better phenotyping of brain injury, standardized definitions of ICP dose, integration of autoregulation-guided CPP targets, and development of validated noninvasive continuous monitors. Emerging signal analytics and machine learning may personalize thresholds and anticipate ICP crises, but robust validation and clinical trials are still needed [^111g42Ww] [^113hUZ52] [^112XYJmx].

ICP monitoring is essential in neurocritical care for detecting and managing **intracranial hypertension**, guiding therapy, and preventing secondary brain injury [^115Qb6dK]. It is indicated in severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8 with abnormal CT), select ICH/SAH with hydrocephalus or mass effect, and intractable intracranial hypertension. EVDs are **the gold standard** (monitor + CSF drainage) [^112uSqAN], while intraparenchymal monitors are reliable alternatives; noninvasive methods are not yet accurate enough to replace invasive monitoring [^113AcAVG]. ICP > **22 mmHg** should trigger treatment, and CPP is typically maintained at 60–70 mmHg; complications are uncommon but include infection and hemorrhage [^1142eLv1] [^111NZBKe].

---

## Physiological basis of ICP monitoring

ICP is determined by brain tissue, blood, and CSF volumes within the rigid skull [^113bQiKE]; elevation reduces cerebral perfusion, risking ischemia and herniation. Monitoring detects intracranial hypertension early, enabling timely interventions to maintain CPP and prevent secondary injury [^113hUZ52].

---

## Indications for ICP monitoring

ICP monitoring is indicated in select acute brain injuries, including:

- **Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)**: GCS ≤ 8 with abnormal CT [^112uSqAN] [^1114A44t]; consider if GCS > 8 with high-risk features or deterioration [^112uSqAN].
- **Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)**: Hydrocephalus or mass effect causing reduced consciousness [^112sYQjA].
- **Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)**: Hydrocephalus, mass effect, or neurological deterioration [^116wyqbZ].
- **Refractory intracranial hypertension**: Persistent elevation despite medical therapy [^notfound].

## Methods of ICP monitoring

| **Method** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| External ventricular drain (EVD) | Gold standard; ventricular catheter with transducer | Accurate; CSF drainage | Infection; hemorrhage; placement difficulty |
| Intraparenchymal monitor | Fiberoptic/microtransducer in brain parenchyma | Accurate; low infection | No CSF drainage; drift |
| Subdural/epidural monitors | Less invasive; less accurate | Lower infection | Less accurate; not recommended [^111pdcR6] |
| Noninvasive methods | ONSD, TCD, NIRS | No infection | Limited accuracy; not continuous [^113AcAVG] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and thresholds

- **Treatment threshold**: ICP > 22 mmHg [^113dHCWh] [^111pdcR6].
- **CPP target**: 60–70 mmHg, individualized to autoregulation [^1142eLv1].
- **Pediatrics**: ICP > 20 mmHg; CPP 40–50 mmHg (infants), 50–60 mmHg (children) [^112uSqAN].

---

## Benefits of ICP monitoring

Early detection of **intracranial hypertension** enables timely intervention to prevent secondary injury [^113hUZ52]. Quantitative ICP data guide **hyperosmolar therapy**, sedation, and surgical decisions, and CPP calculation supports perfusion-targeted care [^111naWNo]. Observational data suggest **reduced mortality** in severe TBI and ICH when monitoring guides therapy [^115UAYUL] [^117GcRsa].

---

## Risks and complications

- **Infection**: Meningitis or ventriculitis, especially with EVDs [^111NZBKe].
- **Hemorrhage**: Intracranial bleeding during insertion [^111NZBKe].
- **Device malfunction**: Drift or failure [^1161Bpqn].
- **Complication rates**: 8–10% for EVDs; 2–5% for intraparenchymal monitors [^notfound].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

Evidence is mixed: the BEST:TRIP RCT found no outcome difference between ICP-guided and clinical/radiologic care, whereas observational studies suggest lower mortality with monitoring, particularly in severe cases [^1151sSxV] [^115UAYUL]. Outcomes likely depend on patient selection, protocols, and center expertise [^1121Sk77] [^117GcRsa] [^115UAYUL].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Evidence quality**: Mostly observational; RCTs are limited [^113zYLFq].
- **Variability**: Center differences in use and thresholds [^114HVD1n].
- **Over-treatment**: Risk of harm from aggressive therapy without benefit [^111g42Ww].
- **Noninvasive methods**: Not yet reliable replacements [^113AcAVG].

---

## Recent advances and future directions

- **Multimodality monitoring**: Integrating ICP with brain oxygen, microdialysis, and autoregulation indices [^notfound].
- **Waveform analysis**: ICP-derived metrics (PRx, RAP) to personalize care [^113DWU5x].
- **Noninvasive technologies**: Improving accuracy and validation [^114Gbtxq].
- **AI/machine learning**: Predictive models for ICP crises [^112XYJmx].

---

ICP monitoring is a cornerstone of neurocritical care that enables early detection and management of intracranial hypertension, with the potential to improve outcomes in selected patients. Its benefits must be balanced against risks, and use should be guided by clinical context, evidence, and evolving technologies [^113hUZ52].

Severe traumatic brain injury — intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and mortality (Alali 2013; Talving 2013) describe cohorts of patients who, according to the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, should have received ICP monitoring, comparing outcomes for monitored versus not monitored patients. They found that those who were monitored had lower odds of mortality. In Alali's retrospective analysis, 10,628 patients treated at 155 Level I and II trauma centers in the United States and Canada were identified; treatments were not controlled, hospital-level analysis suggested care varied, and this restricts attributing lower mortality to ICP monitor-driven treatment alone. Talving 2013 prospectively followed 216 patients admitted to a single Level I medical center in California and found that in-hospital mortality (both all-cause and mortality due to brain herniation) was significantly lower for monitored patients; the treatments were not controlled or documented.

Types of invasive ICP monitors - how do we measure ICP?

Currently, patients at high risk for developing significant intracranial pressure elevations undergo placement of invasive ICP monitors. External ventricular drains (EVDs) are the gold standard and the most used means for ICP monitoring in patients with ABI. EVDs are placed into the intracranial ventricular system and continuously record ICP. EVDs offer the additional benefit of draining CSF to a set ICP level, thereby offering a mechanism to treat elevated ICP in addition to monitoring. Intraparenchymal ICP monitors are an alternative to EVDs and use implantable micro-transducers to measure local ICP at the tip of the probe placed into the brain's parenchyma, usually close to the surface. Both EVDs and intraparenchymal brain monitors carry the risk of hemorrhage and infection. EVDs have a higher overall risk of both complications, and their incidence increases with the length of monitoring. Therefore, choosing to use an invasive ICP monitor to monitor a patient's ICP requires an analysis of benefit and risks to the patient.

An active area of research is the development of Non-invasive ICP monitoring techniques. These aim to estimate ICP without the need for surgical intervention, using methods like transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, optic nerve sheath diameter measurement, and near-infrared spectroscopy. While these methods have the potential to be more convenient and less risky, as of now, they currently lack the accuracy and reliability of invasive ICP monitoring. This review does not go into detail about non-invasive ICP monitoring, which has been extensively reviewed elsewhere in the literature. The table below outlines some commonly studied methods for non-invasive ICP measurement. Of note, these methods are still being researched and have not replaced invasive ICP monitors in the clinical setting.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^1155PELb]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is of paramount importance in managing patients with acute brain injury, allowing accurate diagnosis and treatment of intracranial hypertension.

Intracranial pressure dose, which reflects both the intensity and duration of the intracranial hypertensive episode, has been identified as an independent predictor of mortality and severe disability in several studies, highlighting the importance of prompt diagnosis in the effort to improve patient outcomes.

The placement of invasive devices for ICP monitoring has traditionally been a procedure reserved exclusively for neurosurgeons. However, factors such as shortages of neurosurgeons in certain areas and limited resources can delay the placement of these devices, thereby increasing the ICP dose to which patients are exposed. In recent years the placement of devices for ICP monitoring (in particular IPCs), has been increasingly performed by non-neurosurgeons, including intensivists, with a similar low incidence of complications, as described in literature. The ability of trained intensivists to intervene directly at the patient's bedside by safely placing an invasive device as soon as intracranial hypertension is suspected, and its monitoring is indicated, could lead to a reduction in the ICP dose. With these assumptions in mind, the TIMING-ICP study group (T iming of I nvasive intracranial pressure M onitor I ng placement between N eurosur G eons and I ntensive C are P hysicians) decided to carefully analyze the timing required to initiate invasive ICP monitoring. The goal was to assess the magnitude of any delays in its implementation and to examine whether there are significant differences when the procedure is performed directly by intensivists versus neurosurgeons called to carry it out.

Objectives of the study

The primary objective of the study was to compare the amount of time required to initiate invasive ICP monitoring, following its indication, when performed by neurosurgeons versus intensive care physicians. Importantly, this is a consecutive series and therefore randomization was not performed. Given the observational nature of the study, the choice of operator performing the procedure was based solely on the standard clinical practices at the center.

The secondary objective was to compare post-procedural complications between the group in which the device was placed by intensivists and the group treated by neurosurgeons.

### Guidelines for the management of pediatric severe traumatic brain injury, third edition: update of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines [^1162k8Uy]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury includes a treatment series (n = 22) reporting mortality 5 (23%) died, with 86% of children having ICPs exceeding 20 mm Hg and drainage increasing pressure-volume index (PVI) and decreasing ICP in 14 of 16; ICP could be controlled in 14 of the 16 children with measured PVI with no deaths in those patients. A prospective series (n = 85; n = 40 with ICP monitoring; age mean 7.1, range 4 mo to 18 yr) reported mortality 8 (9%) died and, among monitored patients, outcome varied by ICP level: ICP < 20 (n = 9): 67% good recovery/moderate disability; 11% severe disability/persistent vegetative state; 22% died; ICP > 20 ≤ 40 (n = 17): 88% good recovery/moderate disability; 6% severe disability/persistent vegetative state; 6% died; ICP > 40 (n = 14): 57% good recovery/moderate disability; 7% severe disability/persistent vegetative state; 36% died. Observational database analyses reported associations including monitoring performed in only 7.7% of patients who met recommended monitoring criteria, hospitals with higher standardized ICP monitoring rates having better patient outcomes with lower rates of mortality or severe disability, and in a propensity-weighted analysis linking two national databases (n = 3,084; 1,002 with ICP monitoring and 2,082 without), no significant difference in functional survival between groups, no significant association between monitoring and hospital mortality, but an association between monitoring and higher mortality, discharge to hospice, or either tracheostomy or gastrostomy tube placement.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^1136ScRA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Sufficient research-based literature on individual ICP treatments exists to allow creation of an evidence report. Unfortunately, there is insufficient research on the amalgamation of these individual treatments into a management algorithm to allow evidence-based development of a treatment approach. Since daily care consists of amalgamating individual treatments into a care plan, leaving this process to individual, non-expert practitioners without specific guidance is undesirable. Despite its limitations and weaknesses, the Delphi method remains the best current methodology for developing recommendations from expert consensus. As an evidentiary basis for prioritizing, sequencing, and combining sTBI treatments does not currently exist, we applied the Delphi method rigorously to this work, concomitantly recognizing the relative weakness of this approach.

Protracted specialist experience provides the expert practitioner repeated feedback on their manner of combining individual therapies. Although neither conditions nor outcomes are rigorously controlled, the impact of many repeated exposures to the influence of their therapeutic approach on short-term results (such as acute ICP control) should bestow a form of wisdom ("Medicine-Based Evidence"; the time-tested experience of an individual practitioner). An individual's wisdom is likely confounded by factors such as personal biases, technical idiosyncrasies, the care environment, patient population and injury demographics, etc. The concept of a consensus conference is to combine a large cohort of such experts and determine where their experiences overlap. As it is unlikely that individual-specific confounding factors will be shared, areas where there is general agreement should reflect a degree of clinical efficacy. The inclusion of multiple specialties, international sites, and varying practices should improve generalizability. We used this theoretical framework here to construct this set of recommendations.

### Escalation therapy in severe traumatic brain injury: how long is intracranial pressure monitoring necessary? [^112yQPzD]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury frequently causes an elevation of intracranial pressure (ICP) that could lead to reduction of cerebral perfusion pressure and cause brain ischemia. Invasive ICP monitoring is recommended by international guidelines, in order to reduce the incidence of secondary brain injury; although rare, the complications related to ICP probes could be dependent on the duration of monitoring. The aim of this manuscript is to clarify the appropriate timing for removal and management of invasive ICP monitoring, in order to reduce the risk of related complications and guarantee adequate cerebral autoregulatory control. There is no universal consensus concerning the duration of invasive ICP monitoring and its related complications, although the pertinent literature seems to show that the longer is the monitoring maintenance, the higher is the risk of technical issues. Besides, upon 72 h of normal ICP values or less than 72 h if the first computed tomography scan is normal (none or minimal signs of injury) and the neurological exam is available (allowing to observe variations and possible occurrence of new-onset pathological response), the removal of invasive ICP monitoring can be justified. The availability of non-invasive monitoring systems should be considered to follow up patients' clinical course after invasive ICP probe removal or for substituting the invasive monitoring in case of contraindication to its placement. Recently, optic nerve sheath diameter and straight sinus systolic flow velocity evaluation through ultrasound methods showed a good correlation with ICP values, demonstrating their potential role in place of invasive monitoring or in the early weaning phase from the invasive ICP monitoring.

Conclusions

No current noninvasive technology can replace invasive ICP monitoring. Where invasive monitoring is unavailable, however, multimodal assessment with noninvasive techniques may be useful. Further innovation and research are required to develop a reliable, continuous technique of noninvasive ICP assessment.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^112uSqAN]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — indications and modality: ICP monitoring is recommended in comatose patients (GCS ≤ 8) when evidence of structural brain damage is seen on initial CT imaging, and ICP monitoring should be carefully considered for other patients: patients with a GCS > 8 who have structural brain damage and high risk for progression, patients with a GCS > 8 when knowing the ICP might facilitate management of other issues, patients with evidence of pathology progression on CT imaging or clinical deterioration, and patients who require urgent surgery for extracranial injuries or sedation to facilitate mechanical ventilation. The gold standard for ICP measurement is an external ventricular drain (EVD) attached to an external strain-gauge transducer, and an intraparenchymal transducer can also be used to monitor ICP; in pediatric patients, ICP monitoring by an EVD or an intraparenchymal transducer may result in similar clinical outcomes, although an EVD may facilitate a lower ICP. An upper limit of 20 mm Hg is recommended for children based on retrospective evidence, and ICP monitoring is generally not indicated in comatose patients without evidence of structural brain damage or of elevated ICP on initial CT imaging; these patients may continue to be observed without ICP monitoring by neurological exams and serial CT imaging.

### Perceived utility of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury: a Seattle international brain injury consensus conference consensus-based analysis and recommendations [^116fovXs]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Precise ICP monitoring indications are unavailable. Suggested guidelines have low penetrance.-, Lacking new evidence, edition 4 of the guidelinesdefaulted to edition three's recommendationsbased on the incidence of intracranial hypertension in sTBI. They cited Class III papers, - reporting low incidence of intracranial hypertension with a normal CT to recommend monitoring patients with abnormal imaging. For patients with normal scans, they cited a single retrospective study of 207 patientsreporting that the presence of 2 of 3 adverse features (older than 40 years, motor posturing, or systolic BP < 90 mm Hg) was associated with an intracranial hypertension incidence similar to patients with abnormal scans.

Studies such as Alali et alexamine the sensitivity and specificity of models in predicting intracranial hypertension; however, they are limited to the models tested and are not useful in creating new indicators. In addition, no studies have addressed the value of knowing that ICP is normal regarding directing triage and treatment. It often seems that ICP monitoring frequency is as dependent on an institution's academic focus and resident availability as it is on suspicion of intracranial hypertension.

After the BEST TRIP trialand its interpretation consensus conference, an international group of 14 multidisciplinary TBI experts developed the Milan consensus document on applications of ICP monitoring in TBI. They considered scenarios including diffuse injury, contusions, mass lesion evacuation, and secondary decompressive craniectomy. Consensus was that comatose patients with a normal CT should not undergo monitoring unless the clinical examination was unreliable or unavailable. They recommended monitoring after secondary decompressive craniectomy or mass lesion evacuation, as both are associated with the risk of ICP elevation. Notably, that meeting's focus reflected the literature in concentrating on the likelihood of intracranial hypertension as the sole indication for ICP monitoring. This differs from the question asked here, which does not specify why a monitor is placed but only whether the information from monitoring would be considered useful.

### Perceived utility of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury: a Seattle international brain injury consensus conference consensus-based analysis and recommendations [^115nJ3gG]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is widely practiced, but the indications are incompletely developed, and guidelines are poorly followed.

OBJECTIVE:

To study the monitoring practices of an established expert panel (the clinical working group from the Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference effort) to examine the match between monitoring guidelines and their clinical decision-making and offer guidance for clinicians considering monitor insertion.

METHODS:

We polled the 42 Seattle International Brain Injury Consensus Conference panel members' ICP monitoring decisions for virtual patients, using matrices of presenting signs (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] total or GCS motor, pupillary examination, and computed tomography diagnosis). Monitor insertion decisions were yes, no, or unsure (traffic light approach). We analyzed their responses for weighting of the presenting signs in decision-making using univariate regression.

RESULTS:

Heatmaps constructed from the choices of 41 panel members revealed wider ICP monitor use than predicted by guidelines. Clinical examination (GCS) was by far the most important characteristic and differed from guidelines in being nonlinear. The modified Marshall computed tomography classification was second and pupils third. We constructed a heatmap and listed the main clinical determinants representing 80% ICP monitor insertion consensus for our recommendations.

CONCLUSION:

Candidacy for ICP monitoring exceeds published indicators for monitor insertion, suggesting the clinical perception that the value of ICP data is greater than simply detecting and monitoring severe intracranial hypertension. Monitor insertion heatmaps are offered as potential guidance for ICP monitor insertion and to stimulate research into what actually drives monitor insertion in unconstrained, real-world conditions.

### Variation in monitoring and treatment policies for intracranial hypertension in traumatic brain injury: a survey in 66 neurotrauma centers participating in the CENTER-TBI study [^114HVD1n]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Indications for ICP monitoring

The majority of participants (n = 58, 91%) indicated that they would generally place an ICP monitor in patients with GCS ≤ 8 and CT abnormalities (Fig. 1). ICP monitors were less often considered for other indications, such as GCS ≤ 8 without CT abnormalities (n = 15, 23%), inability to assess a patient with CT abnormalities clinically (e.g. due to sedatives; n = 11, 17%), and intraventricular hemorrhage (n = 21, 33%). Around one-third of the participants would place an ICP monitor in patients with polytrauma (GCS > 8) who require extracranial surgery or mechanical ventilation but would not otherwise have an indication for ICP monitoring. Patient-specific reasons for not monitoring ICP included when the risk of raised ICP was considered low (n = 40, 62%), patients were considered unsalvageable (n = 37, 57%), or GCS was > 8 (n = 37, 57%) (Additional file 2).

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^113zYLFq]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring to guide treatment in severe traumatic brain injury — evidence synthesis indicates that high-quality evidence from a multi-center, Class 1 randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 324) found that outcomes for patients managed with information from clinical assessment do not differ from those for patients managed with information from the ICP monitor, and "the findings do not constitute the basis for a recommendation to use either method preferentially". Moderate-quality evidence from four Class 2 observational studies (N = 13,164) reports that treatment guided by information from the ICP monitor results in decreased in-hospital and 2-week post-injury mortality. The overall quality of the body of evidence was moderate with low consistency across studies, and Table 12–1 notes Number of Subjects 13,488 with Class of Studies counts of Class 1: 1 and Class 2: 4. Five new Class 3 studies and four from the 3rd Edition were reported but were not used to inform the recommendations. Applicability notes that two of the studies used the same database, strengths included large sample size, multiple sites, and study duration over almost 10 years, but all sites were in New York State.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^113kmYpM]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — Class 3 observational evidence indicates that 1,838 were monitored (44.7%); there was no association between monitoring and mortality in three studies, hospital length of stay (LOS) in one study, or Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at 3 and 6 months in one study, whereas there was a significant association between monitoring and increased mechanical ventilation time in one study, need for tracheostomy in one study, and ICU length of stay in two studies. The four Class 3 studies maintained from the 3rd Edition were retrospective and included comparisons of hospitals using versus not using ICP monitors, monitored versus non-monitored patients, pre-guidelines versus post-guidelines protocols, and time periods with low versus high ICP monitoring compliance; a total of 1,886 patients were observed, with two studies finding decreased mortality and two improved outcomes in the monitored groups, while one study found no difference in mortality. Due to the observational nature and selection factors, they were rated Class 3.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) thresholds — recommendations indicate that Level II B — treating ICP above 22 mm Hg is recommended because values above this level are associated with increased mortality; additionally, there was insufficient evidence to support a Level I or II A recommendation for this topic.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^114t3aQV]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure monitoring — introduction: Monitoring and treatment of intracranial pressure (ICP) has been a mainstay of care for the most severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and ICP monitoring has been included in every guideline for severe TBI published by the Brain Trauma Foundation. In the developed world, ICP monitoring is routinely used, leading to a lack of equipoise for assigning patients to a non‑monitored arm, and observational evidence largely found that ICP crises led to poorer outcomes. A recent study challenged this by randomizing patients to protocols based on either an invasive ICP monitor or a clinical/radiological examination and, performed where equipoise existed for a non‑monitored group, failed to find differences between groups. The text emphasizes that intracranial hypertension is an important secondary insult after severe TBI and that its alleviation plays a pivotal role in providing good patient care to achieve optimal outcomes.

Pediatric severe TBI intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — evidence and utilization — are characterized by limited controlled trials and variable adoption; CPP equals mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) minus mean ICP and is used to reflect global cerebral perfusion, a 2007 U.S. survey found about 60% agreement and conformity with guidelines recommendations, in the United Kingdom in 2006 only 59% of children with severe TBI underwent ICP monitoring with only half of clinical units using the technology, use in children less than 2 years of age may be even less likely with only 33% observed in a North Carolina cohort, and because a monitor is required for directed therapies, outcome benefits are considered supported inferentially; additionally, a single prospective controlled South American study in predominantly adults found no difference in outcomes between ICP monitoring–directed and clinical–radiologic–directed therapy, and recruited patients more than 12 years old, while center-to-center variability in treatment practices persists.

### Consensus summary statement of the international multidisciplinary consensus conference on multimodality monitoring in neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^115Qb6dK]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) monitoring — Monitoring of ICP and CPP is considered to be fundamental to the care of patients with ABI, particularly those in coma, and is routinely used to direct medical and surgical therapy. Increased ICP, and particularly that refractory to treatment, is a well-described negative prognostic factor, specifically for mortality. The threshold that defines intracranial hypertension is uncertain but generally is considered to be greater than 20–25 mmHg, although both lower and higher thresholds are described; recommendations for an optimal CPP have changed over time and may be associated with variability in how mean arterial pressure (MAP) is measured and depend on disease state, and rather than a single threshold optimal CPP, values may need to be identified for each individual. There are several devices available to measure ICP; intraparenchymal monitors or ventricular catheters are the most reliable and accurate, but for patients with hydrocephalus a ventricular catheter is preferred, and the duration of ICP monitoring varies according to the clinical context. ICP treatment is important and is best guided by ICP monitoring, clinical imaging, and clinical evaluation used in combination and in the context of a structured protocol. ICP and CPP monitoring are recommended as a part of protocol-driven care in patients who are at risk of elevated intracranial pressure based on clinical and/or imaging features. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.) We recommend that ICP and CPP monitoring be used to guide medical and surgical interventions and to detect life-threatening imminent herniation; however, the threshold value of ICP is uncertain on the basis of the literature. (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.) We recommend that the indications and method for ICP monitoring should be tailored to the specific diagnosis (e.g. SAH, TBI, encephalitis). (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence.) While other intracranial monitors can provide useful information, we recommend that ICP monitoring be used as a prerequisite to allow interpretation of data provided by these other devices. (Strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence.)

### Routine intracranial pressure monitoring in acute coma [^117S91oq]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Studies in traumatic encephalopathy first led to the insight that the damage seen was not just due to direct consequences of the primary injury. A significant, and potentially preventable, contribution to the overall morbidity arose from secondary hypoxic-ischaemic damage. Brain swelling accompanied by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) resulted in inadequate cerebral perfusion with well-oxygenated blood. Detection of raised ICP could be useful in alerting clinicians to the need to improve cerebral perfusion, with consequent reductions in brain injury.

Objectives

To determine whether routine ICP monitoring in all acute cases of severe coma reduces the risk of all-cause mortality or severe disability at final follow up.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Injuries Group's specialised register and the reference lists of all relevant articles and review articles. In addition we searched the Index of Scientific and Technical Proceedings using "intracranial pressure" as keyword.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies of real-time ICP monitoring by invasive or semi-invasive means in acute coma (traumatic or non-traumatic aetiology) versus no ICP monitoring (ie clinical assessment of ICP) DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Primary outcome measures were all-cause mortality and severe disability at the end of the follow up period.

Main Results

No studies meeting the selection criteria have been identified to date.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There are no data from randomised controlled trials that can clarify the role of ICP monitoring in acute coma.

### Comparative effectiveness of intracranial pressure monitoring vs No monitoring in severe penetrating brain injury management [^114WnsTY]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

The Guidelines for the Management of Penetrating Brain Injury was published more than 2 decades ago. These guidelines found no sufficient data to support any statement about ICP monitoring. We believe the present study provides moderate quality of evidence in favor of ICP monitoring in select patients with severe PBI. Precision is the degree of certainty surrounding the effect size estimate for a given outcome, and the 2 different methods of propensity scoring we undertook showed similar results. Evidence from this study may provide moderate confidence in the true effectiveness of ICP monitoring in patients with the same characteristics as those of the target population. At a minimum, the results should encourage future RCTs evaluating the efficacy of ICP monitoring in PBI.

### Accuracy of intracranial pressure monitoring: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1118WdEJ]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The clinical implications of our findings may be relevant both for future comparisons and for daily care. ICP monitoring is widely used to guide diagnostic and therapeutic decisions, so it is essential to know how reliable are the current techniques. The latest update of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines concluded that parenchymal transducer devices measure ICP similarly to VFC but have the potential for differences. Our findings confirm that the average error is clinically negligible, but the interval of error is wide.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring – A tool of the trade or one that betrays Us? [^1144Jt1d]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Nattino et al2 evaluate the association of ICP monitoring with TBI outcomes using a propensity-score matched analysis in patients satisfying BTF criteria for monitoring in the CREACTIVE Consortium database. The study compared 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended scores between patients who underwent ICP monitoring within 48 hours of injury propensity-score matched to control individuals who were unmonitored or monitored after 48 hours. There was no difference in mortality between monitored vs nonmonitored patients. However, ICP monitoring was associated with worse 6-month outcome, respiratory complications, infections, increased length of intensive care unit stay, and duration of mechanical ventilation. This contrasts with Hungary, where the monitored-to-nonmonitored ratio was the inverse and approximately 60% of patients were monitored.

Although addressed in their rigorous statistical analyses, prior to weighting, patients with ICP monitoring appeared sicker with proportionally more extracranial injuries, surgery or neurosurgery, cardiovascular failure, and petechiae on head computerized tomography scans vs the 945 control individuals. Whether the association between ICP monitoring and unfavorable outcome is mediated by therapeutic intensity level also remains unanswered. Notwithstanding these unavoidable limitations, the findings by Nattino et al2 are provocative and propel discussion. Here, a measure that is supposed to be a means to an end may adversely impact the end itself. The results seemingly contradict those from SYNAPSE-ICU where ICP monitoring was associated with more intensive therapies but lower 6-month mortality in a propensity-score analysis of 2395 patients.

3 Aside from methodological differences, importantly, SYNAPSE-ICU included patients with TBI, and an almost equal number with nontraumatic intracranial and subarachnoid hemorrhage. While both studies identified more frequent ICP-directed treatments and longer length of stay with ICP monitoring, Shibahashi et al2 reported a lower in-hospital mortality with monitoring — particularly pronounced in patients with disorders of consciousness. A definitive conclusion is eluded since 6-month outcomes were not reported by Shibahashi et al, leaving the field open for debate.

### How to define and meet blood pressure targets after traumatic brain injury: a narrative review [^1142eLv1]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Monitoring and Treatment in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)

ICP

Current treatment of severe TBI in intensive care mainly aims to prevent secondary damage in cerebral hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Monitoring and treatment guidelines are still focused on intracranial pressure (ICP) control as the main manageable driver of altered cerebral flow and ischemia. Besides this "static" intracranial volume control, there is increased attention to "dynamic" abnormalities in cerebral volume, perfusion, oxygenation, and metabolism that are only partially or even unrelated to elevated ICP.

Several continuous neuromonitoring techniques are available after admission to intensive care, but multimodal clinical application and experience are still limited. The most commonly applied modality in clinical practice is ICP, together with CPP. CPP is defined as MAP minus ICP. Originally, ICP monitoring was advised to detect the progression of space-occupying cerebral lesions (SOL) together with brain imaging. Nowadays, these numbers and trends are, in addition, used to detect more subtle and dynamic derangements of intracranial physiology and reserves. With the support of these modalities and dedicated software, changes in intracranial volume, compliance, and cerebral perfusion can be estimated over time.

CPP

The guidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation recommend maintaining ICP below 22 mm Hg and CPP within the range of 60–70 mm Hg for patients with TBI. To determine the "optimal" CPP target tailored to individual patients, the guidelines advocate considering cerebral autoregulation status, as indicated by Carney et al. This recommendation is based on the premise that brain tissue exhibiting swelling and with intact cerebral autoregulation may potentially benefit from elevated brain perfusion targets, such as a CPP target of > 70 mm Hg, as delineated in the management protocols in the consensus algorithm proposed by Chesnut et al. However, such an approach also entails inherent risks of exacerbating brain edema and hemorrhage. Therefore, any inclination to target a CPP exceeding 70 mm Hg should be accompanied by compelling justifications substantiated by meticulous monitoring and follow-up. The consensus algorithm among experts advises implementing an intermittent practical "MAP challenge" to evaluate autoregulation status at the bedside. Nevertheless, the practicality, reliability, and representativeness of this bedside intervention in informing clinical decisions remain uncertain, as recently highlighted by Dietvorst et al. Although personalized management remains the ultimate objective, its feasibility and effectiveness may vary across different ICUs.

This section addresses the influence on patient outcomes of three types of monitoring: intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring (CPP), and advanced cerebral monitoring (ACM). Clinical practice in most high-income countries incorporates multiple monitoring approaches as well as ongoing clinical assessment, and treatment decisions are not made using one source of information in isolation.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^115JcUeR]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study revealed that within the ICU setting, intraparenchymal catheter placement for invasive ICP monitoring is initiated quicker when performed by intensivists compared to neurosurgeons, with similar low complication rates. This may reduce the overall burden of intracranial hypertension to which the patient is exposed. Further investigation, preferably through a randomized controlled trial, is warranted to investigate the impact of procedural delays, the duration of the device placement itself, and the effect of early monitoring on patient outcomes.

### A comprehensive perspective on intracranial pressure monitoring and individualized management in neurocritical care: results of a survey with global experts [^113bQiKE]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Our understanding of intracranial pressure (ICP), a critical indicator of brain health, is continuously evolving, with satisfactory evidence supporting its monitoring as a means of outcome improvement. However, both the safety limits and therapeutic thresholds for managing and treating ICP are still debatable, although the current recommendation is based on 22 mm Hg. Several notable trials investigating traumatic brain injury (TBI), whether targeting ICP alone or in combination with brain oximetry, employing various therapy strategies, such as decompressive craniectomy, hypothermia, and others, have highlighted the ongoing need for further advancement in outcome improvement. Possibly, part of this issue may be attributed to attempts to oversimplify ICP as a binary "yes" or "no" phenomenon, neglecting to individualize ICP thresholds based on disease processes or individual variations.

The generation of pressure within the cranium is a dynamic process involving various anatomical structures, such as the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, arterial and venous blood volumes, meninges, and bones. Additionally, pressure in abdominal, thoracic, and cervical cavities also influences intracranial space pressure. Following an acute brain injury, inflammatory cascades and impairment in cerebral physiological components contribute to brain tissue volume expansion (cerebral edema) and elevation of ICP. Moreover, factors such as ventilator-patient desynchrony, improper patient positioning, sedation use, arterial blood pressure (ABP), and volemic management, as well as complications such as ischemia, vasospasm, infection, and secondary hemorrhage, may also lead to intracranial hypertension (IH) development.

Among these factors, the intracranial variation of blood volume during each heartbeat is the primary determinant of ICP dynamics, at least on a second-by-second timescale. Beat by beat, ICP pulse slopes can be observed, showing habitual systolic and diastolic phases in dedicated monitors. This pulse morphology can indicate compromised intracranial compliance (ICC) and may predict IH. Therefore, absolute ICP numbers alone may not be precise indicators because they do not reflect ICC and may not assist in determining therapy strategy following different IH syndromes and may lead to imprecise cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) calculation. This underscores the need for additional parameters for guidance. In this context, multimodality neuromonitoring and ICP waveform (ICPW) or pulse morphology emerge as promising options for better differentiation of patients at risk of developing IH crisis (Fig. 1).

### Complications and use of intracranial pressure monitoring in patients with acute liver failure and severe encephalopathy [^113bzawC]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Monitoring of intracranial pressure (ICP) in acute liver failure (ALF) is controversial as a result of the reported complication risk (approximately 20%) and limited therapeutic options for intracranial hypertension. Using prospectively collected information from 332 patients with ALF and severe encephalopathy, we evaluated a recent experience with ICP monitoring in the 24 centers constituting the U.S. ALF Study Group. Special attention was given to the rate of complications, changes in management, and outcome after liver transplantation (LT). ICP monitoring was used in 92 patients (28% of the cohort), but the frequency of monitoring differed between centers (P < 0.001). ICP monitoring was strongly associated with the indication of LT (P < 0.001). A survey performed in a subset of 58 patients with ICP monitoring revealed intracranial hemorrhage in 10.3% of the cohort, half of the complications being incidental radiological findings. However, intracranial bleeding could have contributed to the demise of 2 patients. In subjects listed for LT, ICP monitoring was associated with a higher proportion of subjects receiving vasopressors and ICP-related medications. The 30-day survival post-LT was similar in both monitored and nonmonitored groups (85% vs. 85%). In conclusion, the risk of intracranial hemorrhage following ICP monitoring may have decreased in the last decade, but major complications are still present. In the absence of ICP monitoring, however, patients listed for LT appear to be treated less aggressively for intracranial hypertension. In view of the high 30-day survival rate after LT, future studies of the impact of intracranial hypertension should also focus on long-term neurological recovery from ALF.

### More fateful than fruitful? Intracranial pressure monitoring in elderly patients with traumatic brain injury is associated with worse outcomes [^111cNcV1]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In an expanding elderly population, traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a significant cause of death and disability. Guidelines for management of TBI, according to the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF), include intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Whether ICP monitoring contributes to outcomes in the elderly patients with TBI has not been explored.

Methods

This is a retrospective study extracted from the National Trauma Database 2007–2008 research datasets. Patients were included if aged > 55 y and they met BTF indications for ICP monitoring. Patients that had nonsurvivable injuries (any body region, abbreviated injury score = 6), were dead on arrival, had withdrawal of care, or length of stay < 48 h were excluded. Outcomes were then stratified based on ICP monitoring. The primary outcomes were inhospital mortality and favorable discharge. Logistic regression was used to analyze the effect of ICP monitoring on outcomes.

Results

A total of 4437 patients were included with 11.2% having an ICP monitor placed. Patients requiring an ICP monitor were younger overall, more likely to present hypertensive, had higher injury severity, and more likely to require operative intervention. Median initial Glasgow coma scale (3) was similar between groups. Of those patients with ICP monitoring, overall mortality was significantly higher, and they were less likely to have favorable discharge status. Craniotomy itself was not associated with increased mortality (P = 0.450).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that the use of ICP monitoring according to BTF guidelines in elderly TBI patients does not provide outcomes superior to treatment without monitoring. The ideal group to benefit from ICP monitor placement remains to be elucidated.

### Evolving concepts in intracranial pressure monitoring-from traditional monitoring to precision medicine [^114f91dJ]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the Current Monitoring and Treatment Paradigm

The notion of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to ICP management is increasingly being questioned, particularly in light of emerging evidence from traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature, which suggests that a single ICP threshold may not be the best predictor of outcome. The current paradigm — based on fixed ICP thresholds — may not adequately account for the individual variability in brain compliance, autoregulation, and injury severity. The notion of a "one-size-fits-all" approach to ICP management is increasingly being questioned, particularly in light of emerging evidence from traumatic brain injury (TBI) literature, which suggests that a single ICP threshold may not be the best predictor of outcome [).

The clinical limitations of the current approach of using a single ICP threshold are also illustrated by mixed results regarding the efficacy of using the mean ICP threshold approach in ICP monitoring and management. The BEST:TRIP trial (Benchmark Evidence from South American Trials: Treatment of ICP) demonstrated no improved outcome (mortality, functional status, cognitive outcome) in 324 patients with severe TBI, including all those aged 13 and older, who had invasive ICP monitoring and treatment, versus those that were treated based on physical examination and neuroimaging alone. To date, this is the only randomized control trial to evaluate the effect of monitoring ICP and treating at a threshold of 20 ​mmHg. On the other hand, the SYNAPSE-ICU study, a prospective observational cohort study of 4776 patients with either TBI, acute intraparenchymal brain hemorrhage, and acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, conducted at 146 ICUs in 42 countries, suggested that use of ICP monitoring may be associated with a more intensive therapeutic approach and lower 6-month mortality in more severe cases. The conflicting evidence in the field of ICP management has led to significant variation in practice. The field of evidence suggests that the current approach of using a single mean ICP threshold in guiding treatment is limited in improving outcomes.

Introduction

Acute Brain Injuries (ABIs) are neurological emergencies that carry high morbidity, mortality and costs to the healthcare system. They comprise of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and non-traumatic causes of brain injury including intracerebral hemorrhage, large acute ischemic strokes, subarachnoid hemorrhage from cerebral aneurysm rupture, aggressive brain tumors, encephalitis, and hydrocephalus. In all cases, the initial inciting event leads to an area of initial injury, but also then triggers pathological mechanisms that cause further secondary injury over time. Minimizing the damage from these secondary pathological mechanisms is a major goal in the critical care management of these patients. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a major such secondary pathological mechanism, and monitoring and treating elevated ICP is an important goal in the management of ABI. Despite significant advancements in the understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms, improvement in intracranial monitoring techniques, and discovery of various tools to decrease high ICP, there is a lack of clear consensus on how to best identify patients at risk of developing injury from high ICP and when to initiate treatment. This paper provides historical and physiological context to the problem of elevated ICP, provides an overview of the challenges of the current paradigm of ICP management strategies, and discusses advances in ICP waveform analysis, emerging non-invasive ICP monitoring techniques, and applications of machine learning to create predictive algorithms.

### Factors associated with receipt of intracranial pressure monitoring in older adults with traumatic brain injury [^115bPTqD]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major health problem among older adults. Although individuals 65 years or older represent only 10% of all patients with TBI, they account for 50% of TBI-related deaths. In 2013, TBI was responsible for 485 000 emergency department visits, 123 000 hospitalizations, and 21 000 deaths among adults aged 65 and older in the USA. Furthermore, patients who were older than 75 years of age experienced the highest TBI-related hospitalization rate — twice that of any other age group.

An important but controversial aspect of managing severe TBI is intracranial pressure monitoring (ICPM) to detect and manage intracranial hypertension and reduce secondary insults. In the 2016 Fourth Edition of the Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) recommended ICPM in patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 9 and evidence of CT abnormality as level IIB evidence to reduce in-hospital and 2-week mortality after injury. However, these guidelines do not specifically address older adults with TBI. In fact, many prior studies either excluded older patients or grouped them with younger adults in outcomes assessment. Additionally, there is conflicting evidence on whether ICPM improves outcomes in severe TBI in both youngand older patient populations. Given the lack of clear guidance regarding ICPM and the limited available data on outcomes, the decision of whether or not to place a monitor in an older adult presenting with TBI is typically left to an individual physician's judgment.

The normal cerebral atrophy that occurs with aging may reduce the risk of intracranial hypertension. Thus, conceptually, ICPM may not benefit many elderly patients. Yet this is not reflected in current management guidelines. Given the lack of guidelines specific for ICPM in older adults due to the limited number of studies that have investigated the indications and role of ICPMin this population and specifically in the setting of isolated TBI, we conducted an indepth analysis to better understand which older patients receive ICPM and whether the current BTF recommendations are followed. The objectives of this study were to (1) characterize the utilization of ICPM in a cohort of older adults presenting with isolated TBI and (2) identify factors associated with ICPM among those patients who met the BTF guidelines. We hypothesized, given the lack of evidence-based guidelines specific for older adults, that indications for ICPM in this population are similar to their younger counterparts and in accordance with the most recent and widely available BTF guidelines.

Intracranial pressure monitoring devices have become the standard of care for the management of patients with pathologies associated with intracranial hypertension. Given the importance of invasive intracranial monitoring devices in the modern neurointensive care setting, gaining a thorough understanding of the potential complications related to device placement-and misplacement-is crucial. The increased prevalence of intracranial pressure monitoring as a management tool for neurosurgical patients has led to the publication of a plethora of papers regarding their indications and complications.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring in adult patients with traumatic brain injury: challenges and innovations [^113hUZ52]. The Lancet: Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure monitoring enables the detection and treatment of intracranial hypertension, a potentially lethal insult after traumatic brain injury. Despite its widespread use, robust evidence supporting intracranial pressure monitoring and treatment remains sparse. International studies have shown large variations between centres regarding the indications for intracranial pressure monitoring and treatment of intracranial hypertension. Experts have reviewed these two aspects and, by consensus, provided practical approaches for monitoring and treatment. Advances have occurred in methods for non-invasive estimation of intracranial pressure although, for now, a reliable way to non-invasively and continuously measure intracranial pressure remains aspirational. Analysis of the intracranial pressure signal can provide information on brain compliance (ie, the ability of the cranium to tolerate volume changes) and on cerebral autoregulation (ie, the ability of cerebral blood vessels to react to changes in blood pressure). The information derived from the intracranial pressure signal might allow for more individualised patient management. Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches are being increasingly applied to intracranial pressure monitoring, but many obstacles need to be overcome before their use in clinical practice could be attempted. Robust clinical trials are needed to support indications for intracranial pressure monitoring and treatment. Progress in non-invasive assessment of intracranial pressure and in signal analysis (for targeted treatment) will also be crucial.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^113ZCms2]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Management algorithms for adult severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) were omitted in later editions of the Brain Trauma Foundation's sTBI Management Guidelines, as they were not evidence-based.

Methods

We used a Delphi-method-based consensus approach to address management of sTBI patients undergoing intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Forty-two experienced, clinically active sTBI specialists from six continents comprised the panel. Eight surveys iterated queries and comments. An in-person meeting included whole- and small-group discussions and blinded voting. Consensus required 80% agreement. We developed heatmaps based on a traffic-light model where panelists' decision tendencies were the focus of recommendations.

Results

We provide comprehensive algorithms for ICP-monitor-based adult sTBI management. Consensus established 18 interventions as fundamental and ten treatments not to be used. We provide a three-tier algorithm for treating elevated ICP. Treatments within a tier are considered empirically equivalent. Higher tiers involve higher risk therapies. Tiers 1, 2, and 3 include 10, 4, and 3 interventions, respectively. We include inter-tier considerations, and recommendations for critical neuroworsening to assist the recognition and treatment of declining patients. Novel elements include guidance for autoregulation-based ICP treatment based on MAP Challenge results, and two heatmaps to guide (1) ICP-monitor removal and (2) consideration of sedation holidays for neurological examination.

Conclusions

Our modern and comprehensive sTBI-management protocol is designed to assist clinicians managing sTBI patients monitored with ICP-monitors alone. Consensus-based (class III evidence), it provides management recommendations based on combined expert opinion. It reflects neither a standard-of-care nor a substitute for thoughtful individualized management.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring in posterior fossa lesions-systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ft8nx]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) with reduced cerebral perfusion pressure are long-established and well-known causes of secondary brain injury associated with poor clinical outcome. Among a variety of ICP measuring devices, the most commonly used include ventricular catheter or intraparenchymal ICP probe. Irrespective of the location of the pathology or mass effect, it is a clinical practice that a single location for ICP measurement reflects an accurate pressure throughout the brain. In view of the anatomic subdivision of our intracranial compartments by the falx or tentorium, the question arises if the ICP value is reliably independent from the location of the mass and ICP monitoring. Interestingly, the standardized clinical management of infratentorial mass lesions (cerebellar hemorrhage, stroke, tumor) relies on the supratentorial ventricular ICP measurement. Previously, there have been several reports of patients, cadavers, and primates showing significant differences of ICP values depending on the location of mass and ICP monitoring. We therefore aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature focusing on supra- and infratentorial ICP measurements to clarify the issue of intracranial compartments and ICP monitoring in case of infratentorial mass lesions.

### Noninvasive methods to monitor intracranial pressure [^114Gbtxq]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intracranial pressure (ICP) is determined by the production of and outflow facility of cerebrospinal fluid. Since alterations in ICP are implicated in several vision-threatening and life-threatening diseases, measurement of ICP is necessary and common. All current clinical methods to measure ICP are invasive and carry the risk for significant side effects. Therefore, the development of accurate, reliable, objective, and portal noninvasive devices to measure ICP has the potential to change the practice of medicine. This review discusses recent advances and barriers to the clinical implementation of noninvasive devices to determine ICP.

Recent Findings

Many noninvasive methods to determine ICP have been developed. Although most have significant limitations limiting their clinical utility, several noninvasive methods have shown strong correlations with invasively obtained ICP and have excellent potential to be developed further to accurately quantify ICP and ICP changes.

Summary

Although invasive methods remain the mainstay for ICP determination and monitoring, several noninvasive biomarkers have shown promise to quantitatively assess and monitor ICP. With further refinement and advancement of these techniques, it is highly possible that noninvasive methods will become more commonplace and may complement or even supplant invasively obtained methods to determine ICP in certain situations.

### Intracranial pressure: current perspectives on physiology and monitoring [^111naWNo]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is now viewed as integral to the clinical care of many life-threatening brain insults, such as severe traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and malignant stroke. It serves to warn of expanding intracranial mass lesions, to prevent or treat herniation events as well as pressure elevation which impedes nutrient delivery to the brain. It facilitates the calculation of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and the estimation of cerebrovascular autoregulatory status. Despite advancements in our knowledge emanating from a half century of experience with this technology, important controversies remain related even to fundamental aspects of ICP measurements, including indications for monitoring, ICP treatment thresholds, and management of intracranial hypertension. Here, we review the history of ICP monitoring, the underlying pathophysiology as well as current perspectives on why, when and how ICP monitoring is best used. ICP is typically assessed invasively but a number of emerging, non-invasive technologies with inherently lower risk are showing promise. In selected cases, additional neuromonitoring can be used to assist in the interpretation of ICP monitoring information and adapt directed treatment accordingly. Additional efforts to expand the evidence base relevant to ICP monitoring, related technologies and management remain a high priority in neurosurgery and neurocritical care.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^115z4wHp]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

This study allowed us to assess the time required to initiate intracranial pressure monitoring, revealing a statistically significant average difference of 76 min between the two groups. However, the average time of 69 min in the intensivist group also warrants improvement. Literature suggests that even short episodes of intracranial hypertension are associated with worse outcomes. We hope these findings encourage physicians managing at-risk patients to implement strategies that minimize delays in initiating invasive monitoring.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the timing required to initiate invasive intracranial pressure monitoring performed by intensivists and neurosurgeons.

Based on the promising results of this study, we plan to conduct an international multicenter study, possibly a randomized controlled trial, to confirm our findings. This study will also assess how delays in intracranial pressure monitoring impact patient outcomes, including mortality, long-term neurological outcomes, and the need for additional interventions.

Additionally, a further parameter marking the conclusion of the invasive device placement procedure should be included in future studies to assess potential discrepancies in procedural timing between the two groups, as this aspect was not considered in the current study.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^111Uu8z2]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology

The parameter identified for comparison between the group treated by intensivists and the group treated by neurosurgeons was the time interval (ΔT2-T1) between the moment at which invasive ICP monitoring was deemed necessary, indicated as T1, and the moment at which device placement procedure began, defined as skin incision and denoted as T2.

The primary outcome was the comparison of the mean time interval (ΔT2-T1) in patients managed by neurosurgeons versus those managed by intensivists. Subgroups were created based on the type of device used and the location where the procedure was performed (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Visual representation of the study design. T1 is the moment at which invasive intracranial pressure monitoring is stated; T2 is the moment at which skin incision is performed to allow intracranial device placement. ICU: Intensive Care Unit, ER; Emergency Room, OR: operatory room

We excluded the procedural time from the analysis, as it was performed by trained personnel. Specifically, the neurosurgeons and intensivists were all attending physicians, and the intensivists who performed the procedure had specific training. Therefore, the procedural time was considered consistent. The greater variability in timing was expected due to delays in starting the maneuver itself, which was the focus of the study.

Indication for invasive ICP monitoring could be provided in the emergency department, during ICU stay or in the hospital ward where the patient was first admitted.

The decision to perform invasive ICP monitoring in traumatic brain injury (TBI) was made following consultation between the intensivist and the neurosurgeon, in accordance with the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, fourth edition.

In cases of spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhage, the main criteria for indicating invasive ICP monitoring were a GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score ≤ 8, evidence of transtentorial herniation on CT scan, hemorrhagic involvement of the ventricular system or hydrocephalus, and recent guideline recommendations for managing spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.

Changes from the 3rd Edition — ICP monitoring indications note that in the 3rd Edition there were three sections about ICP monitoring (Indications, Technology, and Thresholds), and Indications for ICP Monitoring was organized around sub-questions on who to monitor, the utility of information from the monitor, and the influence of the information on outcomes for patients. For the first and second sub-questions, the studies in the 3rd Edition do not meet the inclusion criteria for this update and therefore have been dropped; for the third sub-question, four Class 3 studies have been maintained and two studies rated Class 2 in the 3rd Edition have been excluded. Study-specific notes indicate that Eisenberg, 1988 was an RCT of barbiturates and was not designed to test ICP-directed management, while Palmer 2001 was a pre/post natural experiment comparing cohorts before and after guideline implementation in which all patients had ICP monitors and there was no non-monitored comparison group, resulting in exclusion as not designed to assess the impact of using a monitor to guide treatment on outcomes.

### Evolving concepts in intracranial pressure monitoring-from traditional monitoring to precision medicine [^111ayNpp]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral autoregulation

Since one major way elevated ICP causes secondary injury to the brain is causing ischemia through brain tissue compression, an additional approach to the problem of elevated ICP is through the lens of maintaining appropriate tissue perfusion in the brain.

Cerebral autoregulation refers to the brain's ability to maintain stable blood flow despite changes in systemic blood pressure, ensuring adequate oxygen and nutrient delivery. This mechanism keeps cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) — the difference between mean arterial pressure (MAP) and intracranial pressure (ICP) — within an optimal range to avoid ischemia or hyper-perfusion. Elevated ICP is associated with a CPP less than 60 ​mmHg and with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity. CPP has emerged as another key target in ICP management of ABI, where maintaining adequate blood flow is critical. Effective ICP management focuses on maintaining CPP to prevent secondary brain injury, often targeting a CPP of 60–70 ​mmHg based on clinical guidelines. Current guideline support these parameters and definitive clinical trial evidence is still needed.

Current clinical paradigm and guidelines on ICP monitoring and management in ABI

In intensive care units tending to patients with sABIs, patients with lesions of a significant size or severity tend to undergo ICP monitor placement. The International Multidisciplinary Consensus Conference on Multimodality Monitoring recommends ICP and CPP monitoring for patients at risk of elevated ICP based on clinical or imaging features. They advocate for the use of these monitoring techniques to guide both medical and surgical interventions and to detect life-threatening conditions, such as imminent herniation. The Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines have evolved over time; the current iteration of their guidelines is to recommend ICP monitoring for patients with TBI who either have abnormal CT scans of the head and are comatose, or have normal CT scans but are at high risk based on age greater than 40 years, posturing on neurological exam, or systolic blood pressure less than 90 ​mmHg. However, significant variability exists between centers in how these guidelines are interpreted and applied to TBI patients, as highlighted by the CENTER-TBI study. In terms of establishing a threshold of what constitutes a clinically elevated ICP that ought to be treated, the current clinical paradigm is a 'one-size-fits all' approach where guidelines focus on treating based on the mean ICP crossing a certain threshold of either 20 ​mmHg (in non-TBI patients) or 22 ​mmHg in TBI patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of intracranial pressure monitoring vs No monitoring in severe penetrating brain injury management [^113ioanW]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring and ICP-guided management are a cornerstone in the approach to blunt severe TBI. Intracranial hypertension has been associated with mortality in observational cohorts. Additionally, several studies have suggested that care in specialized centers that practice protocol-driven therapy — typically including ICP monitoring — is associated with lower mortality and better outcomes in patients with severe TBI. Reports of benefit are not universal, however, as several studies have found either no benefit or harm from ICP-guided management. A single RCT conducted in Bolivia and Ecuador compared ICP monitoring with no monitoring in the management of severe TBI and reported no significant between-group difference in morbidity or mortality measured at 6 months postinjury.

In view of these findings, the latest iteration of the Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines issued a level IIb recommendation (low-quality evidence) of ICP monitoring to reduce in-hospital and 2-week postinjury mortality. This recommendation is based solely on reports for blunt TBI, as there are insufficient data available to support a treatment standard for the use of ICP monitoring in PBI. Given the paucity of evidence, we extracted data from the NTDB to conduct a propensity score (PS)–matched comparative effectiveness research study of PBI management guided by monitoring vs no monitoring. We aimed to examine the association of ICP monitoring with mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and dispositional outcomes in patients with severe PBI.

### Noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring: are we there yet? [^113AcAVG]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of Noninvasive ICP Monitoring Technology

Clarity on the proposed clinical role of any new noninvasive device is essential. The requirements of a device used for triage are distinct from the requirements of a device that replaces standard-of-care invasive monitoring. The former requires excellent sensitivity and good specificity, whereas the latter requires excellent sensitivity and specificity relative to the gold standard. Sensitivity may also be most important, with some compromise on specificity acceptable, when the gold standard is unavailable, given the life-threatening consequences of ICP elevation.

Studies of the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive ICP monitoring techniques are especially susceptible to some of the potential sources of bias listed in the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) checklist. The noninvasive (index) test should be compared to the gold standard (invasive monitoring) and not an imperfect surrogate, such as brain imaging or lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The index test should ideally be performed simultaneously with gold standard invasive measurement. The individual performing the noninvasive measurement should be blinded to the gold standard, particularly when the results of the noninvasive test may be operator dependent. For quantitative tests such as ONSD measurement, following initial exploratory analysis, a consistent threshold should be used and validated across studies. Following confirmation of diagnostic accuracy, use of the device should ideally be shown to improve patient-centered clinical outcomes. This is most important when a new device will be added on to the standard of care. It is preferred but not essential when the device is used as a screening test to select patients for gold standard invasive monitoring or in settings where the gold standard is unavailable. Of note, invasive monitoring has itself never been demonstrated to improve outcomes in a clinical trial but remains a guideline-recommended intervention on the basis of observational studies that demonstrate a reduction in mortality.

It should also be noted that currently available noninvasive techniques cannot reliably provide continuous data and, for that reason alone, cannot replace invasive ICP monitoring. Although serial assessments may mitigate this issue, there is little doubt that ICP can fluctuate greatly, and continuous measurement is the gold standard.

### Evolving concepts in intracranial pressure monitoring-from traditional monitoring to precision medicine [^111ACQ6b]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Another notable limitation in the current use of a single ICP threshold is the emerging evidence supporting the concept of an overall 'ICP dose' that is associated with outcome; An ICP dose accounts for both the degree of ICP elevation as well as the duration of elevation. In their 2015 study, Guïza et al. investigated the relationship between the intensity and duration of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) episodes and six-month neurological outcomes in adult and pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients. Analyzing minute-by-minute ICP data from 261 adults and 99 children, they found that worse outcomes were associated with prolonged durations of ICP elevation, with critical thresholds identified at 15, 20, 25, and 30 ​mmHg. Specifically, in adults, ICP above 30 ​mmHg lasting more than 8 ​min correlated with significantly worse outcomes. The study also highlighted the impact of cerebrovascular autoregulation and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), showing that impaired autoregulation and CPP below 50 ​mmHg further reduced the brain's tolerance to elevated ICP. These findings underscore the importance of monitoring both the intensity and duration of ICP increases and suggest that individualized management strategies incorporating these factors could improve clinical outcomes in TBI patients. These findings were then further validated in cohorts of TBI patients. These findings are likely to translate to ICP thresholds in non-traumatic causes of SABI, but, to date, similar explorations have not been done in the non-traumatic SABI population.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — observational mortality association from a large multicenter cohort. The study included N = 10,628 patients from 155 level I and II Trauma Centers in the United States and Canada, with ICP monitored = 1,874 (17.6%), and assessed in-hospital mortality. ICP monitoring was associated with significantly lower odds of death (adjusted odds ratio 0.44; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.63, p < 0.0001, patient-level analysis), with the association more pronounced in patients under 65. At the hospital level, hospitals with higher levels of ICP monitoring had lower mortality; however the variability in ICP monitoring explained only a small portion of the variability in mortality.

### The path from intracranial pressure to clinical outcomes in pediatric traumatic brain injury… [^113gScen]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In the first publication on continuous intracranial pressure monitoring in patients with traumatic brain injury in 1965, Lundberg et al1 described periodic increases in ICP, which were treated with mechanical ventilation, hyperosmolar therapy, and surgical decompression. Nearly 60 years later, contemporary management of severe TBI emphasizes continuous monitoring to facilitate immediate detection and timely treatment of elevated ICP. 2 Hyperosmolar therapy with mannitol or hypertonic saline is a mainstay of ICP-targeted therapy. Whereas Lundberg et al1 used urea, current pediatric guidelines recommend bolus 3% HTS to rapidly reduce ICP and improve cerebral perfusion pressure.
2. The timing of hyperosmolar therapy is a critical determinant of its physiologic effect. This is supported by a retrospective study of 28 pediatric patients with severe TBI, where 3% HTS boluses uniformly lowered ICP.

5 Patients with favorable outcomes had greater ICP reduction and longer duration of reduced ICP after 3% HTS. Given the low rate of ICP monitoring, as Chong et al4 discuss, their findings may be most applicable in resource-limited settings, where ICP monitoring occurs infrequently. However, in an observational study in 3084 children in US hospitals comparing outcomes after severe TBI with vs without ICP monitoring, only 32. 4% underwent monitoring, with comparable outcomes to unmonitored patients. 8 However, ICP-monitored patients received more therapies, including hyperosmolar therapy, suggesting potential confounding by disease severity. Taken together with the work of Chong et al4 and because ICP monitoring has only level 3 evidence in pediatric TBI guidelines, 2 heterogeneity in patients, monitoring, and treatment identifies major challenges for meaningful evaluation of therapies in pediatric severe TBI, particularly those targeting ICP.

Initial steps have been taken for adult TBI, supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, to better characterize TBI severity and endotypes by moving beyond relying solely on GCS scores and incorporating additional clinical information, serum biomarkers, and imaging to improve prognostication, assessment of standard treatments, and trial design to test novel therapies. 9 A parallel approach is needed in pediatric TBI. We need to define who would benefit from ICP monitoring for ICP-directed guideline-based therapies and for whom monitoring, use of therapies targeting ICP, or both may have no benefit or may be deleterious.

Study Overview The new Integra CereLink ICP monitor integrate the possibility of recording and displaying continuously the AUC and other ICP derived variables and provide the possibility of evaluating the utility of this information at the bedside. It offers the opportunity to test in a standardized way the clinical value of the PTD computation in this setting. Intracranial pressure monitoring is the most common neuromonitoring modality used in neurocritical care. Its application both as a stand-alone monitoring or in association with other systems has several indications, which rely on local, national policies, and international guidelines. However, several single center studies showed that this manual acquisition method is suboptimal and could miss episodes of high ICP compared to high-resolution, computerized acquisition systems.

Computers allow also the computation offline of ICP derived parameters. Vik proposed that the degree of ICP above the treatment threshold can be estimated by the area under the curve of ICP versus time in patients with TBI, i.e. the "ICP dose". The new Integra CereLink ICP monitor integrate the possibility of recording and displaying continuously the AUC and other ICP derived variables and provide the possibility of evaluating the utility of this information at the bedside. It offers the opportunity to test in a standardized way the clinical value of the PTD computation in this setting. A reduced set of demographic characteristics, past medical history information, diagnosis, timeline, clinical presentation of ABI and administered treatments will be extracted from patients' medical records. ICP high-resolution data will be downloaded from the Integra CereLink ICP monitor:

- mean ICP;
- ICP dose.

Centres will collect mortality and GOSE at ICU/hospital discharge and GOSE at 6 months. The GOSE at the End-of-Study will be collected via phone structured interviews to patients and/or family members using a validated questionnaire.
- The PTD recorded by the Integra CereLink ICP monitor is related with outcome. Higher PTD are associated with worse outcomes.
- The max PTD associated with good outcomes will be estimated.
- The Investigators aim to identify the best way of summarizing PDT for clinical use.
- To demonstrate that PTD is a better predictor of outcome compared with end-hour ICP values.

### Children with severe traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, what does it mean? A review of the literature [^117FZMM3]. Pediatric Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Severe traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children. In 2003 the Brain Trauma Foundation released guidelines that have since been updated (2010) and have helped standardize and improve care. One area of care that remains controversial is whether the placement of an intracranial pressure monitor is advantageous in the management of traumatic brain injury. Another aspect of care that is widely debated is whether management after traumatic brain injury should be based on intracranial pressure-directed therapy, cerebral perfusion pressure-directed therapy, or a combination of the two. The aim of this article was to provide an overview and review the current evidence regarding these questions.

Despite the most aggressive and novel antimicrobial therapies for meningitis, the mortality rate associated with this disease is far from satisfactory. Although intracranial hypertension and subsequent death have long been known to complicate meningitis, no specific guidelines targeting ICP monitoring are available. A review of the literature was performed to understand the pathophysiology of elevated ICP in meningitis, diagnostic challenges, and clinical outcomes in the use of ICP monitoring.

### Does intracranial pressure management hurt more than it helps in traumatic brain injury? [^114qDJc1]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Severe TBI constitutes a major source of trauma mortality and morbidity. The avoidance of extremes in blood pressure, oxygenation and carbon dioxide levels are critical to successful outcome. ICP monitoring remains a contentious subject with retrospective evidence demonstrating equipoise. The limited level 1 evidence available does not demonstrate harm or a survival benefit, but these findings are not easily generalizable to North American patients. It is unlikely that a further trial will be forthcoming, but ICP monitoring remains a recommended tool of TBI management.

Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — observational evidence and study design considerations are described: A prospective design 'increases confidence that all eligible patients were included and minimizes the likelihood of missing data', yet being 'conducted in one medical center' means 'the applicability may be more limited than studies conducted at multiple sites'. In Farahvar et al., the study 'defined the population as patients with severe TBI who received at least one of five specific ICP-lowering therapies', and 'Defining the population this way limited inclusion to only patients considered at high risk for intracranial hypertension or who had documented intracranial hypertension', so that 'the population was more specific than those in the Alali or Talving studies'. Accordingly, 'the conclusion is that treatment directed by ICP monitoring results in better outcomes for patients with or at high risk for intracranial hypertension', but 'using treatment to identify the comparison group may make it difficult to replicate the results', and 'Whether this is a serious threat to the generalizability of results cannot be known until attempts are made to replicate the results'. The approach 'is problematic in terms of application to clinical practice', because 'a clinician needs to decide whether to monitor a patient before and during, not after, treatment', and although the study offers a stronger conclusion about benefit, 'it does not offer a practical application for how to implement more targeted monitoring that could replicate these gains in patient survival' Class 3 studies — 'The evidence from the Class 3 studies of intracranial pressure monitoring is summarized in Table 12–3'.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring and management in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^11164vyW]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a medical condition that can lead to intracranial hypertension, negatively impacting patients' outcomes. This review article explores the underlying pathophysiology that causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during hospitalization. Hydrocephalus, brain swelling, and intracranial hematoma could produce an ICP rise. Although cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal via an external ventricular drain is commonly used, ICP monitoring is not always consistently practiced. Indications for ICP monitoring include neurological deterioration, hydrocephalus, brain swelling, intracranial masses, and the need for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. This review emphasizes the importance of ICP monitoring and presents findings from the Synapse-ICU study, which supports a correlation between ICP monitoring and treatment with better patient outcomes. The review also discusses various therapeutic strategies for managing increased ICP and identifies potential areas for future research.

### Accuracy of intracranial pressure monitoring: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112LvsJs]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Key messages

A systematic literature review and meta-analysis indicates that the average error between simultaneous ICP measures is small (in the order of 1.5–1.6 mmHg), but in 30% of readings it could exceed ± 6 mmHg
When there are intracranial gradients due to expanding masses or unilateral hemorrhages, there are likely to be larger differences between separate ICP measures.
In the absence of intracranial gradients, the risk of inaccurate measurement seems rare.
These findings are important both for future comparisons studies and for daily care.

### Perceived utility of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury: a Seattle international brain injury consensus conference consensus-based analysis and recommendations [^1139i8ii]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is the "monitor of choice" in severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), but indications for insertion remain nebulous. Edition 3 of the Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) Guidelinesprovided ICP monitoring recommendations, and the latest revisiondefaulted to those recommendations in the absence of new evidence. Practice surveys, however, have demonstrated tremendous variability in monitoring on individual and institutional levels, - with poor penetrance of BTF recommendations. This implies that the decision process is inconsistent and poorly understood — a critical problem when examining the efficacy of ICP monitor–based care in noncontrolled studies. As well, some providers may consider ICP monitoring data of little additional clinical utility in ambiguous situations.

A tacit but unproven assumption of monitoring recommendations is that the sole/primary purpose is treating intracranial hypertension. Monitoring for the purpose of triage and timing of extracranial procedures is not subsumed under such an assumption. The value of monitoring to establish that ICP is acceptable is unaddressed.

Following the recent Seattle Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Consensus Conference (SIBICC) recommendations, the consensus working group (CWG) saw value in demonstrating how a large group of experienced, multidisciplinary TBI specialists make decisions about ICP monitor insertion based on common admission characteristics. Such an amalgamated assessment should reflect the perceived balance between having quantitative ICP values and the risks of monitoring, based on extensive, hands-on clinical management in a variety of environments (eg, "medicine-based evidence"). Therefore, the CWG members have constructed heatmaps demonstrating the likelihood of initial ICP monitor insertion in patients with TBI based on a matrix of clinical examination variables and computed tomography (CT) findings.

Our goals are to (1) examine the amalgamated monitoring results ("perceived utility") of very experienced neurotraumatologists over the entire spectrum of acute patients with TBI and (2) to offer consensus-based guidance potentially useful in making or understanding monitoring decisions.

Intracerebral hemorrhage intracranial pressure (ICP) management — Ventricular drainage should be performed in patients with ICH/IVH with hydrocephalus contributing to decreased level of consciousness. In patients with ICH with a GCS score ≤ 8, ICP monitoring and treatment might be considered to reduce mortality and improve outcomes. Hyperosmolar therapy may be considered for transiently reducing ICP, and corticosteroids should not be administered for the treatment of elevated ICP in the setting of ICH. ICP is typically measured by insertion of ICP monitors into the brain parenchyma or an EVD into the ventricles, though the indications for use of ICP monitoring are less clear.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring in experimental traumatic brain injury: implications for clinical management [^111SwRBB]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often associated with long-term disability and chronic neurological sequelae. One common contributor to unfavorable outcomes is secondary brain injury, which is potentially treatable and preventable through appropriate management of patients in the neurosurgical intensive care unit. Intracranial pressure (ICP) is currently the predominant neurological-specific physiological parameter used to direct the care of severe TBI (sTBI) patients. However, recent clinical evidence has called into question the association of ICP monitoring with improved clinical outcome. The detailed cellular and molecular derangements associated with intracranial hypertension (IC-HTN) and their relationship to injury phenotype and neurological outcomes are not completely understood. Various animal models of TBI have been developed, but the clinical applicability of ICP monitoring in the pre-clinical setting has not been well-characterized. Linking basic mechanistic studies in translational TBI models with investigation of ICP monitoring that more faithfully replicates the clinical setting will provide clinical investigators with a more informed understanding of the pathophysiology of IC-HTN, thus facilitating development of improved therapies for sTBI patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of intracranial pressure monitoring on 6-month outcomes of critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury [^111g42Ww]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Although contradictory literature on the efficacy of ICP monitoring in sTBI provides the ideal setting for a large-scale RCT, performing such a study in high-income countries appears unworkable because ICP monitoring is widely perceived as an essential component of sTBI management. Additionally, ICP monitoring is not amenable to direct evaluation and can only be tested as part of a comprehensive protocol that includes the therapeutic options used in response to monitored values. Simultaneously evaluating multiple ICP-monitor–based protocols against a nonmonitored control would require a huge, highly complex RCT protocol, which might still not fully answer the question.

A productive way to explore the issue of ICP monitoring is to interrogate multicenter, prospective, observational studies explicitly conceived for this purpose, such as CREACTIVE. This approach has 3 important advantages. First, it allows for assessing the procedure's effectiveness in current clinical practice rather than its efficacy in highly controlled environments. Second, collecting data on the use of the numerous treatments for intracranial hypertension helps us understand how ICP monitoring modifies TBI care. Finally, we can study the epidemiology of the use of ICP monitoring. Such insights are critical to formulating clinically relevant research questions to direct future studies.

In this prospective, observational study conducted at 43 ICUs, only one-third of the patients meeting the Brain Trauma Foundation criteria were actually monitored, and the use of monitoring varied considerably across centers. These results reflect a high degree of uncertainty within the TBI-management community about the procedure. Although the mortality among monitored and nonmonitored patients was similar, the monitored group had significantly more patients with severe disability and fewer with good recovery at 6 months. Monitored patients also received significantly more medical interventions and surgery for epidural hematomas or intraparenchymal mass lesions (eg, contusions). Single-event surgical procedures likely mirror the use of monitoring to determine surgical indications for initially marginal lesions. In contrast, medical interventions reflect a complex interaction among ICP thresholds, choice of treatments, perceived and real underlying TBI pathophysiology, management protocols, and responses to such treatments. We observed a much higher therapeutic intensity level, longer ICU stays, and more respiratory and infectious complications in the monitored group.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^112B8zVC]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The duration of episodes of intracranial hypertension is related to poor outcome, hence the need for prompt diagnosis. Numerous issues can lead to delays in the implementation of invasive intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, thereby increasing the dose of intracranial hypertension to which the patient is exposed. The aim of this prospective, observational, multicenter study was to assess the magnitude of this delay, evaluating the time required for initiation of invasive ICP monitoring, from indication (T1) to initiation of the maneuver (T2) when performed by neurosurgeons compared to intensive care physicians.

Methods

We evaluated the impact of the operator performing the maneuver (neurosurgeon vs. intensivist) on the T2-T1 time interval, where T1 represents the time at which indication for invasive ICP monitoring is declared, and T2 the time at which the maneuver starts, defined as the skin incision. The effect of the operator performing the maneuver was evaluated through a parametric survival model. Both intraparenchymal catheters (IPCs) and external ventricular drains (EVDs) were considered as invasive ICP monitoring devices. Invasive monitoring could be performed in intensive care unit (ICU) or in operating room (OR).

Results

A total of 112 patients were included into the final analysis; 39 IPCs were placed by intensivists within the ICU, and a total of 73 IPCs and EVDs by neurosurgeons both within the ICU and OR settings. The mean difference in T2-T1 time for IPCs placement in the ICU was 69 min (CI 50.1–94.8) in the intensivist group and 145 min (CI 103.4–202.9) in neurosurgeon group. The mean difference between these groups, 76 min, was found to be statistically significant (p-value = 0.0021). In the group treated by neurosurgeons, no statistically significant differences were found in timing between the ICU and the OR.

Conclusions

Invasive ICP monitoring performed with IPCs in ICU begins earlier when performed by intensivists rather than neurosurgeons. This finding suggests the possibility to obtain a prompt diagnosis of intracranial hypertension when intensivists intervein directly at patient's bedside. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and investigate their effect on outcome.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring, cerebral perfusion pressure estimation, and ICP / CPP-guided therapy: a standard of care or optional extra after brain injury? [^111cFpkf]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Measurement of intracranial pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) is used to derive cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and to guide targeted therapy of acute brain injury (ABI) during neurointensive care. Here we provide a narrative review of the evidence for ICP monitoring, CPP estimation, and ICP/CPP-guided therapy after ABI. Despite its widespread use, there is currently no class I evidence that ICP/CPP-guided therapy for any cerebral pathology improves outcomes; indeed some evidence suggests that it makes no difference, and some that it may worsen outcomes. Similarly, no class I evidence can currently advise the ideal CPP for any form of ABI. 'Optimal' CPP is likely patient-, time-, and pathology-specific. Further, CPP estimation requires correct referencing (at the level of the foramen of Monro as opposed to the level of the heart) for MAP measurement to avoid CPP over-estimation and adverse patient outcomes. Evidence is emerging for the role of other monitors of cerebral well-being that enable the clinician to employ an individualized multimodality monitoring approach in patients with ABI, and these are briefly reviewed. While acknowledging difficulties in conducting robust prospective randomized studies in this area, such high-quality evidence for the utility of ICP/CPP-directed therapy in ABI is urgently required. So, too, is the wider adoption of multimodality neuromonitoring to guide optimal management of ICP and CPP, and a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the different forms of ABI and what exactly the different monitoring tools used actually represent.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death after traumatic injury. Raised intracranial pressure (ICP) is particularly associated with poor TBI outcomes, prompting clinicians to monitor this parameter, using it to guide therapies aimed at reducing pressures. Despite this approach being recommended by several bodies such as the Brain Trauma Foundation and the American College of Surgeons, the evidence demonstrating that ICP-guided therapy improves outcome is limited. The topic was debated at the 36th Annual Point/Counterpoint Acute Care Surgery Conference and the following article summarizes the discussants points of view along with a summary of the evidence.

### A management algorithm for patients with intracranial pressure monitoring: the Seattle international severe traumatic brain injury consensus conference (SIBICC) [^112i2EzU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Management algorithms for adult severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) were omitted in later editions of the Brain Trauma Foundation's sTBI Management Guidelines, as they were not evidence-based.

Methods

We used a Delphi-method-based consensus approach to address management of sTBI patients undergoing intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Forty-two experienced, clinically active sTBI specialists from six continents comprised the panel. Eight surveys iterated queries and comments. An in-person meeting included whole- and small-group discussions and blinded voting. Consensus required 80% agreement. We developed heatmaps based on a traffic-light model where panelists' decision tendencies were the focus of recommendations.

Results

We provide comprehensive algorithms for ICP-monitor-based adult sTBI management. Consensus established 18 interventions as fundamental and ten treatments not to be used. We provide a three-tier algorithm for treating elevated ICP. Treatments within a tier are considered empirically equivalent. Higher tiers involve higher risk therapies. Tiers 1, 2, and 3 include 10, 4, and 3 interventions, respectively. We include inter-tier considerations, and recommendations for critical neuroworsening to assist the recognition and treatment of declining patients. Novel elements include guidance for autoregulation-based ICP treatment based on MAP Challenge results, and two heatmaps to guide (1) ICP-monitor removal and (2) consideration of sedation holidays for neurological examination.

Conclusions

Our modern and comprehensive sTBI-management protocol is designed to assist clinicians managing sTBI patients monitored with ICP-monitors alone. Consensus-based (class III evidence), it provides management recommendations based on combined expert opinion. It reflects neither a standard-of-care nor a substitute for thoughtful individualized management.

### Telemetric intracranial pressure monitoring: a systematic review [^113mdgTT]. Neurocritical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Telemetric intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is a new method of measuring ICP which eliminates some of the shortcomings of previous methods. However, there are limited data on specific characteristics, including the advantages and disadvantages of this method. The main aim of this study was to demonstrate the indications, benefits, and complications of telemetric ICP monitoring. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for relevant studies without language or date restriction in May 2019. Human studies in which telemetric ICP monitoring was the main subject of the study were included. Our initial search resulted in 1650 articles from which 50 studies were included. There were no randomized controlled trials. The majority of the studies were case reports or case series (68%). The most common aim of studies was testing of the device (52%), and monitoring the disease progression or recovery (46%). The most common indications for telemetric ICP monitoring in these studies were testing cerebrospinal fluid shunt function (46%), ICP control after the procedure (36%), and diagnosing intracranial hypertension (22%) and hydrocephalus (12%). In total, 1423 brain disease patients had been monitored in studies. The possibility of long-term ICP monitoring as the main benefit was reported in 38 (76%) studies. The associated complication rate was 7.1%. Despite the increasing application of telemetric monitoring devices, studies to evaluate specific characteristics of this method have been infrequent and inadequate. Future research using a higher level of scientific methods is needed to evaluate advantage and disadvantages.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring in posterior fossa lesions-systematic review and meta-analysis [^115pREUR]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

As reported, there are several studies reporting a difference in pressures between various compartments of the brain. However, there are no studies reporting the relationship between infratentorial ICP monitoring and the outcome of patients. This should be addressed in future studies to establish an evidence-based treatment strategy for posterior fossa pathologies to promote better ICP monitoring and outcome of our patients.

### Monitoring intracranial pressure in traumatic brain injury [^113DWU5x]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2008). Low credibility.

Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) is an important cause of secondary brain injury, and ICP monitoring has become an established component of brain monitoring after traumatic brain injury. ICP cannot be reliably estimated from any specific clinical feature or computed tomography finding and must actually be measured. Different methods of monitoring ICP have been described but intraventricular catheters and microtransducer systems are most widely used in clinical practice. ICP is a complex variable that links ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure and provides additional information from identification and analysis of pathologic ICP wave forms. ICP monitoring can also be augmented by measurement of indices describing cerebrovascular pressure reactivity and pressure-volume compensatory reserve. There is considerable variability in the use of ICP monitoring and treatment modalities among head injury centers. However, there is a large body of clinical evidence supporting the use of ICP monitoring to detect intracranial mass lesions early, guide therapeutic interventions, and assess prognosis, and it is recommended by consensus guidelines for head injury management. There remains a need for a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to identify the value of ICP monitoring and management after head injury.

### Complications following intracranial pressure monitoring in children: a 6-year single-center experience [^11268Zha]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is an important tool in the neurosurgeon's armamentarium and is used for a wide range of indications. There are many different ICP monitors available, of which fiber-optic intraparenchymal devices are very popular. Here, the authors document their experience performing ICP monitoring from 2005 to 2015 and specifically complication rates following insertion of the Microsensor ICP monitor. METHODS A retrospective case series review of all patients who underwent ICP monitoring over a 10-year period from 2005 to 2015 was performed. RESULTS There were 385 separate operations with an overall complication rate of 8.3% (32 of 385 cases). Hardware failure occurred in 4.2% of cases, the CSF leakage rate was 3.6%, the postoperative hemorrhage rate was 0.5%, and there was 1 case of infection (0.3% of cases). Only patients with hardware problems required further surgery as a result of their complications, and no patient had any permanent morbidity or mortality from the procedure. Younger patients (p = 0.001) and patients with pathologically high ICP (13% of patients with high ICP vs 6.5% of patients with normal ICP; p = 0.04) were significantly more likely to have complications. There was no significant difference in the complication rates between general neurosurgical patients and craniofacial patients (7.6% vs 8.8%, respectively; p = 0.67). CONCLUSIONS Intraparenchymal ICP monitoring is a safe procedure associated with low complications and morbidity in the pediatric craniofacial and neurosurgical population and should be offered to appropriate patients to assess ICP with the reassurance of the safety record reported in this study.

### Consensus summary statement of the international multidisciplinary consensus conference on multimodality monitoring in neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^115wwZpq]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Medium credibility.

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — practice recommendations: We recommend the use of standard insertion and maintenance protocols to ensure safety and reliability of the ICP monitoring procedure. (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.) Both parenchymal ICP monitors and external ventricular catheters (EVD) provide reliable and accurate data and are the recommended devices to measure ICP. In the presence of hydrocephalus, use of an EVD when safe and practical is preferred to parenchymal monitoring. (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.) We recommend the continuous assessment and monitoring of ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) including waveform quality using a structured protocol to ensure accuracy and reliability. Instantaneous ICP values should be interpreted in the context of monitoring trends, CPP, and clinical evaluation. (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.) While refractory ICP elevation is a strong predictor of mortality, ICP per se does not provide a useful prognostic marker of functional outcome; therefore, we recommend that ICP not be used in isolation as a prognostic marker. (Strong recommendation, high quality of evidence.)

### Routine intracranial pressure monitoring in acute coma [^1151sSxV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

We know that the brain damage resulting from traumatic and other insults is not due solely to the direct consequences of the primary injury. A significant and potentially preventable contribution to the overall morbidity arises from secondary hypoxic-ischaemic damage. Brain swelling accompanied by raised intracranial pressure (ICP) prevents adequate cerebral perfusion with well-oxygenated blood. Detection of raised ICP could be useful in alerting clinicians to the need to improve cerebral perfusion, with consequent reductions in brain injury.

Objectives

To determine whether routine ICP monitoring in severe coma of any cause reduces the risk of all-cause mortality or severe disability at final follow-up.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (OvidSP), EMBASE (OvidSP), CINAHL Plus, ISI Web of Science (SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S), clinical trials registries and reference lists. We ran the most recent search on 22 May 2015.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled studies of real-time ICP monitoring by invasive or semi-invasive means in acute coma (traumatic or non-traumatic aetiology) versus clinical care without ICP monitoring (that is, guided only by clinical or radiological inference of the presence of raised ICP).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (ET and RF) worked independently to identify the one study that met inclusion criteria. JR and RF independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted study authors for additional information, including details of methods and outcome data.

Main Results

One randomized controlled trial (RCT) meeting the selection criteria has been identified to date. The included study had 324 participants. We judged risk of bias to be low for all categories except blinding of participants and personnel, which is not feasible for this intervention. There were few missing data, and we analysed all on an intention-to-treat basis. Participants could be 13 years of age or older (mean age of sample 29; range 22 to 44), and all had severe traumatic brain injury, mostly due to traffic incidents. All were receiving care within intensive care units (ICUs) at one of six hospitals in either Bolivia or Ecuador. Investigators followed up 92% of participants for six months or until death. The trial excluded patients with a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than three and fixed dilated pupils on admission on the basis that they had sustained brain injury of an unsalvageable severity. The study compared people managed using either an intracranial monitor or non-invasive monitoring (imaging and clinical examination) to identify potentially harmful raised intracranial pressure. Both study groups used imaging and clinical examination measures. Mortality at six months was 56/144 (39%) in the ICP-monitored group and 67/153 (44%) in the non-invasive group. Unfavourable outcome (defined as death or moderate to severe disability at six months) as assessed by the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) was 80/144 (56%) in the ICP-monitored group and 93/153 (61%) in the non-invasive group. Six percent of participants in the ICP monitoring group had complications related to the monitoring, none of which met criteria for being a serious adverse event. There were no complications relating to the non-invasive group. Other complications and adverse events were comparable between treatment groups, 70/157 (45%) in the ICP-monitored group and 76/167 (46%) in the non-invasive group. Late mortality in both the monitored and non-invasive groups was high, with 35% of deaths occurring > 14 days after injury. The authors comment that this high late mortality may reflect inadequacies in post-ICU services for disabled survivors requiring specialist rehabilitation care.

Authors' Conclusions

The data from the single RCT studying the role of routine ICP monitoring in acute traumatic coma fails to provide evidence to support the intervention. Research in this area is complicated by the fact that RCTs necessarily assess the combined impact of measurement of ICP with the clinical management decisions made in light of this data. Future studies will need to assess the added value of ICP data alongside other information from the multimodal monitoring typically performed in intensive care unit settings. Additionally, even within traumatically acquired brain injury (TBI), there is great heterogeneity in mechanisms, distribution, location and magnitude of injury, and studies within more homogeneous subgroups are likely to be more informative.

### Intracranial pressure monitor in patients with traumatic brain injury [^1114A44t]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines recommend intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8 or less with an abnormal head computed tomography, or a normal head computed tomography scan with systolic blood pressure ≤ 90 mm Hg, posturing, or in patients of age ≥ 40. The benefits of these guidelines on outcome remain unproven. We hypothesized that adherence to BTF guidelines for ICP monitoring does not improve outcomes in patients with TBI.

Methods

All TBI patients with an admission Glasgow Coma Scale ≤ 8 admitted to our level I trauma center over a 3-y period were identified. Adherence to the individual components of our institutional TBI Bundle (ICP monitoring, SpO2 ≥ 95%, PaCO2 30–39 mm Hg, systolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressure ≥ 60 mm Hg, ICP ≤ 25 mm Hg, and temperature 36°C-37°C) was assessed. Patients were stratified into two groups as follows: patients with ICP monitoring (ICP) and patients without ICP monitoring (no-ICP). Outcome measures were survival and discharge disposition. Multivariate regression analysis was performed.

Results

We identified 2618 TBI patients, 261 of whom met the BTF criteria for ICP monitoring. After excluding those with nonsurvivable injuries (n = 67), 194 patients were available for analysis. The two groups were similar in demographics and severity of head injury. Survival rate was higher in the no-ICP group compared with that in the ICP group (98% versus 76%, P < 0.004). Non-monitored patients were discharged with higher levels of function per discharge location (28% home versus 4% home; P < 0.001). Patients without ICP monitoring were 1.21 times more likely to survive compared with that of patients with ICP monitoring (odds ratio: 1.21, 95% confidence interval [1.1–1.9], P = 0.01). In the ICP group, the overall compliance rate to the ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure goals as required by the BTF guidelines was poor.

Conclusions

Our data suggest that there is a subset of patients meeting BTF criteria for ICP monitoring that do well without ICP monitoring. This finding should provoke reevaluation of the indication and utility of ICP monitoring in TBI patients.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring and management in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^111GAwMY]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Intracranial hypertension significantly contributes to poor outcomes in patients with aneurysmal SAH. However, the indications for ICP monitoring and management in aneurysmal SAH are highly variable and lack clear guidelines. ICP monitoring is crucial in managing patients with aneurysmal SAH, including those with good grades. Invasive monitoring devices are the gold standard, and in cases of hydrocephalus, an EVD for CSF diversion is necessary, along with the possible use of an intraparenchymal probe to allow continuous ICP monitoring. Although specific studies are lacking, using a stepwise approach, ICP-guided and CPP-guided management can be derived from observations in other pathological entities. Therefore, further research in aneurysmal SAH is necessary to define the best management strategies for ICP in these patients.

### Evolving concepts in intracranial pressure monitoring-from traditional monitoring to precision medicine [^112XYJmx]. Neurotherapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

A wide range of acute brain injuries, including both traumatic and non-traumatic causes, can result in elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), which in turn can cause further secondary injury to the brain, initiating a vicious cascade of propagating injury. Elevated ICP is therefore a neurological injury that requires intensive monitoring and time-sensitive interventions. Patients at high risk for developing elevated ICP undergo placement of invasive ICP monitors including external ventricular drains, intraparenchymal ICP monitors, and lumbar drains. These monitors all generate an ICP waveform, but each has its own unique caveats in monitoring and accuracy. Current ICP monitoring and management clinical guidelines focus on the mean ICP derived from the ICP waveform, with standard thresholds of treating ICP greater than 20 ​mmHg or 22 ​mmHg applied broadly to a wide range of patients. However, this one-size fits all approach has been criticized and there is a need to develop personalized, evidence-based and possibly multi-factorial precision-medicine based approaches to the problem. This paper provides historical and physiological context to the problem of elevated ICP, provides an overview of the challenges of the current paradigm of ICP management strategies, and discusses advances in ICP waveform analysis, emerging non-invasive ICP monitoring techniques, and applications of machine learning to create predictive algorithms.

### Comparative effectiveness of intracranial pressure monitoring on 6-month outcomes of critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury [^116bpD7n]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a worldwide public health challenge. Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) is a frequent consequence of severe TBI (sTBI). The injury triggers primary and secondary pathophysiological processes, possibly leading to uncontrolled intracranial hypertension. Untreated, this condition results in brain structure herniation, brainstem compression, and brain ischemia, each associated with increased mortality and worse functional outcomes.

Intracranial pressure monitoring has consequently been advocated in sTBI management to detect intracranial hypertension and guide its treatment. However, while the association between higher ICP and poorer outcomes is generally accepted, determining indications for ICP monitoring and the effectiveness of therapy driven by ICP monitoring remains controversial. According to the most recent Brain Trauma Foundation guidelines, the efficacy of ICP monitoring on clinical outcomes is supported by low-quality evidence. Previous studies have provided contradictory results, including 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT) where care driven by ICP monitoring was not found to be superior to care based on imaging and neurologic examination.

Our study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of ICP monitoring on 6-month functional outcomes as measured by the Glasgow Outcome Scale–Extended (GOS-E), for patients with TBI who meet Brain Trauma Foundation monitoring criteria. To address this question, we leveraged the database of the CREACTIVE (Collaborative Research on Acute Traumatic Brain Injury in Intensive Care Medicine in Europe) Consortium. CREACTIVE is an international prospective observational study aimed at describing the epidemiology of TBI in Europe and improving the quality of care in the field.

### Respect your elders: effects of ageing on intracranial pressure monitor use in traumatic brain injury [^111GQfVt]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a considerable cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. From 2007 to 2013, the number of TBIs sustained in the USA increased significantly. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, TBI was responsible for approximately 2.5 million emergency department visits, 300 000 hospitalizations and 56 000 deaths in 2013 alone. In addition to the increasing prevalence of TBI, these injuries significantly add to the national financial burden of healthcare, accounting for direct and indirect costs totaling $60 billion in the year 2000.

Monitoring and control of intracranial pressure (ICP) have been studied as a means of reducing secondary insults after TBI. In the past 40 years many studies have looked at the efficacy of ICP monitor placement, but there is still a lack of consensus on indications for use. The Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) has published guidelines for ICP monitor use, however the impact of these guidelines on patient outcomes remains uncertain. The most recent edition of the BTF guidelines recommends the use of ICP monitoring in patients with a survivable, severe TBI (defined as Glasgow Coma Scale, or GCS, scores of 3–8) with an abnormal CT scan. ICP monitoring may also be indicated in patients with severe TBI with a normal CT scan and two of the following features: age > 40, unilateral or bilateral motor posturing, or systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg. Since the publication of these guidelines, many studies have assessed their efficacy, with mixed results. A lack of consensus on the role of ICP monitoring in patients with severe TBI persists.

Elderly patients (aged 65 and older) have the highest rate of TBI-related deaths with mortality rates increasing in recent years. This elevated mortality rate has been attributed to the higher risk of falls in this age group. Despite the high risk of mortality in elderly patients with severe TBI, the evidence for ICP monitor efficacy in this subgroup is limited. There is a void in the literature on the effect of ICP monitoring specifically in the elderly, as well as whether or not deferring ICP monitor placement in these patients is appropriate. Our study was developed to evaluate for potential age disparities in ICP monitor placement. We hypothesized that ICP monitors would be placed less frequently in elderly patients with severe TBI compared with younger patients.

### The management of traumatic brain injury [^111pdcR6]. ACS (2024). High credibility.

Traumatic brain injury intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring — thresholds, escalation, and measurement — includes that a randomized controlled trial compared patient treatment using ICP monitoring to maintain ICP ≤ 20 mm Hg to treatment based on imaging and neurological examination, and although no difference in outcomes was found, the result did not support discontinuation of ICP monitoring and emphasized aggressive treatment using ICP monitoring or frequent clinical and radiographic examination to identify intracranial hypertension. The currently accepted alert threshold is an ICP of 22 mm Hg, with a reasonable range of 20–25 mm Hg for more than 5 minutes as a trigger for treatment, though ongoing research suggests this threshold is dependent upon individual patient factors; the ICP "dose", reflecting both magnitude and time, might be more important than a fixed threshold, and higher ICP dose is associated with worse outcomes across the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Escalation of treatment needs to be based on both the level and duration of ICP elevation, with higher-tier therapies such as decompressive craniectomy requiring a higher ICP threshold or "dose", and with a trend over time being more relevant than a momentary value, differentiating gradual rises from short-term events and interpreting ICP in relation to arterial blood pressure, CPP, and autoregulatory responses. For measurement, the gold standard is an external ventricular drain (EVD) attached to an external strain-gauge transducer that can measure global ICP and drain cerebrospinal fluid, intraparenchymal ICP monitoring is also reliable but does not allow CSF drainage, and subdural and epidural monitors are not recommended due to lower accuracy.

### Accuracy of intracranial pressure monitoring: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161Bpqn]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring is widely used in neurointensive care, especially for the management of patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). ICP levels are used to decide interventions, to verify the efficacy of therapeutic maneuvers, and in formulating a prognosis. For all these purposes accurate measurements are essential.

Clinicians rely on numbers provided by different methods, and generally believe that those numbers reflect actual ICP with a high degree of accuracy. For instance, a recent trial on decompressive craniectomy randomized patients to different treatments when ICP exceeded 20 mmHg, assuming that the sensors used ensured a clear-cut threshold.

In real life, however, ICP measurement is challenging. A basic assumption is that the ICP read at one point in the intracranial system properly reflects the average pressure throughout all other locations. Under normal conditions the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure should in fact be in equilibrium in the whole of the CSF space. Under pathological conditions (as when CSF circulation is obstructed or intracranial masses are expanding), however, ICP cones can develop leading to uneven ICP levels. Even when ICP is homogeneous in the whole intracranial space measurements may not all be accurate, depending on the devices used and the duration of the measurement.

Our hypothesis is that clinically used systems measure ICP with different degrees of accuracy, not always providing a precise measure. Therefore, our goal was to evaluate the accuracy and precision over time (drift) of different ICP measurements on the basis of a review of the literature.

### Perceived utility of intracranial pressure monitoring in traumatic brain injury: a Seattle international brain injury consensus conference consensus-based analysis and recommendations [^112aPiJW]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The perceived utility of ICP monitoring in TBI, as expressed by experienced, international neurotraumatologists, is underrepresented in current monitoring guidelines. Knowing the ICP seems desirable in a broader spectrum of patients with TBI than simply those with intracranial hypertension. We provide consensus-based insertion heatmaps and recommendations for use in clinical decision-making and in analyzing survey-based ICP monitoring efficacy studies.

### 2022 guideline for the management of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113qVYm1]. Stroke (2022). High credibility.

Intracranial pressure monitoring after ICH — The frequency at which ICP elevations occur after ICH is unclear; a large institutional cohort found intracranial hypertension is common after ICH, especially in younger patients with supratentorial hemorrhage, whereas an analysis of 2 RCTs suggests ICP is infrequently elevated during EVD monitoring and drainage in severe IVH. A 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that the prevalence and mortality of intracranial hypertension are high after ICH, and studies including secondary analysis of 1 RCT suggest that increased ICP levels, durations, and variability are associated with poor outcome and mortality, but no randomized studies have addressed the utility of ICP monitoring in patients with ICH and the impact on patient outcome is unclear. Observational data conflict, with a retrospective database analysis suggesting benefit in moderate to severe ICH/IVH with reduced levels of consciousness, especially those with GCS scores of 9 to 12, while secondary analyses of ERICH and MISTIE III do not support the routine use of ICP monitoring in patients with ICH; small sample size and selection biases should be considered in interpreting these findings.

### Intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure monitoring in non-TBI patients: special considerations [^1119WXtp]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The effect of intracranial pressure (ICP) and the role of ICP monitoring are best studied in traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, a variety of acute neurologic illnesses e.g., subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, meningitis/encephalitis, and select metabolic disorders, e.g., liver failure and malignant, brain tumors can affect ICP. The purpose of this paper is to review the literature about ICP monitoring in conditions other than TBI and to provide recommendations how the technique may be used in patient management. A PubMed search between 1980 and September 2013 identified 989 articles; 225 of which were reviewed in detail. The technique used to monitor ICP in non-TBI conditions is similar to that used in TBI; however, indications for ICP monitoring often are intertwined with the presence of obstructive hydrocephalus and hence the use of ventricular catheters is more frequent. Increased ICP can adversely affect outcome, particularly when it fails to respond to treatment. However, patients with elevated ICP can still have favorable outcomes. Although the influence of ICP-based care on outcome in non-TBI conditions appears less robust than in TBI, monitoring ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure can play a role in guiding therapy in select patients.

### From indication to initiation of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring time differences between neurosurgeons and intensive care physicians: can intracranial hypertension dose be reduced? TIMING-ICP, a multicenter, observational, prospective study [^116MeonP]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study found a statistically significant difference of 76 min in the average time from indication to initiation of ICP monitoring with IPCs between patients treated by intensivists (mean ΔT2-T1: 69 min) and those treated by neurosurgeons (mean ΔT2-T1: 145 min) within the ICU setting.

It is clear that involving the intensivist directly at patient's bedside in the ICU, as soon as intracranial hypertension is suspected, offers a significant benefit. This early intervention has the potential of reducing the duration of elevated ICP, minimizing the patient's exposure to intracranial hypertension. Indeed, numerous studies have demonstrated that both the intensity and duration of the episode are pivotal determinants of the patient's ultimate outcome. As highlighted in this analysis, the neurosurgeon may not always be readily available for the placement of an invasive device, which is currently considered crucial for managing intracranial hypertension. This can lead to delays in the targeted treatment, potentially affecting patient outcomes.

Although invasive intracranial pressure monitoring is traditionally performed by neurosurgeons in most parts of the world, to the best of our knowledge, its implementation by other specialists is increasingly common in several European countries, the United States, and some low-income nations. Therefore, we believe the results are generalizable. However, conducting a multicenter international study would provide more robust evidence for their generalizability.

The chi-square test did not show statistically significant differences in the presence of opening pressure values indicative of intracranial hypertension (defined as ICP > 20) between the groups treated within a ΔT2-T1 of 60 min or less and those treated beyond this ΔT2-T1 (p -value = 0.33). This result was also confirmed when considering a ΔT2-T1 of 35 min (p -value = 0.53). This may be due to confounding factors, such as emergency interventions performed shortly before based on strong clinical and radiological suspicion of intracranial hypertension. However, the data collection did not include information on therapeutic interventions. Additionally, opening pressure may not be entirely accurate; nevertheless, it was chosen as the endpoint to standardize measurements. Further studies, extending into the post-device placement period with sequential time points, may provide more clarity. Finally, our findings further support the importance of invasive intracranial pressure monitoring, which remains the gold standard for evaluating intracranial pressure.

### Guidelines for the management of severe traumatic brain injury, fourth edition [^1172bFRo]. Neurosurgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Guidelines for the Management of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury, Fourth Edition — intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring scope is clarified: no new studies were identified to address the 3rd Edition sub-questions about who to monitor and the utility of the ICP monitor, and the sub-question on the influence of ICP monitor information on outcomes was maintained and addressed in this 4th Edition. The ICP Monitoring Technology topic from the 3rd Edition is no longer included because assessing technology uses different methods and standards than systematic evidence review or treatment guideline development. The Intracranial Pressure Thresholds topic from the 3rd Edition was expanded for the 4th Edition and moved into a section that includes thresholds for blood pressure, CPP, ACM, and ICP.

### Increased mortality in patients with severe traumatic brain injury treated without intracranial pressure monitoring [^117LM5SA]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2012). Low credibility.

Object

Evidence-based guidelines recommend intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring for patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but there is limited evidence that monitoring and treating intracranial hypertension reduces mortality. This study uses a large, prospectively collected database to examine the effect on 2-week mortality of ICP reduction therapies administered to patients with severe TBI treated either with or without an ICP monitor.

Methods

From a population of 2134 patients with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] Score < 9), 1446 patients were treated with ICP-lowering therapies. Of those, 1202 had an ICP monitor inserted and 244 were treated without monitoring. Patients were admitted to one of 20 Level I and two Level II trauma centers, part of a New York State quality improvement program administered by the Brain Trauma Foundation between 2000 and 2009. This database also contains information on known independent early prognostic indicators of mortality, including age, admission GCS score, pupillary status, CT scanning findings, and hypotension.

Results

Age, initial GCS score, hypotension, and CT scan findings were associated with 2-week mortality. In addition, patients of all ages treated with an ICP monitor in place had lower mortality at 2 weeks (p = 0.02) than those treated without an ICP monitor, after adjusting for parameters that independently affect mortality.

Conclusions

In patients with severe TBI treated for intracranial hypertension, the use of an ICP monitor is associated with significantly lower mortality when compared with patients treated without an ICP monitor. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that ICP-directed therapy in patients with severe TBI should be guided by ICP monitoring.

Regarding medical management for intracerebral hemorrhage, more specifically with respect to management of ICP, monitoring, EANS/ESO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining invasive ICP monitoring in adult patients with severe acute spontaneous space-occupying ICH if clinical symptom monitoring alone is not feasible. Prefer intraventricular measurements with the additional option of CSF drainage.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring and management in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116wyqbZ]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a medical condition that can lead to intracranial hypertension, negatively impacting patients' outcomes. This review article explores the underlying pathophysiology that causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during hospitalization. Hydrocephalus, brain swelling, and intracranial hematoma could produce an ICP rise. Although cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal via an external ventricular drain is commonly used, ICP monitoring is not always consistently practiced. Indications for ICP monitoring include neurological deterioration, hydrocephalus, brain swelling, intracranial masses, and the need for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. This review emphasizes the importance of ICP monitoring and presents findings from the Synapse-ICU study, which supports a correlation between ICP monitoring and treatment with better patient outcomes. The review also discusses various therapeutic strategies for managing increased ICP and identifies potential areas for future research.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring: fundamental considerations and rationale for monitoring [^112jTwzs]. Neurocritical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. In large part critical care for TBI is focused on the identification and management of secondary brain injury. This requires effective neuromonitoring that traditionally has centered on intracranial pressure (ICP). The purpose of this paper is to review the fundamental literature relative to the clinical application of ICP monitoring in TBI critical care and to provide recommendations on how the technique maybe applied to help patient management and enhance outcome. A PubMed search between 1980 and September 2013 identified 2,253 articles; 244 of which were reviewed in detail to prepare this report and the evidentiary tables. Several important concepts emerge from this review. ICP monitoring is safe and is best performed using a parenchymal monitor or ventricular catheter. While the indications for ICP monitoring are well established, there remains great variability in its use. Increased ICP, particularly the pattern of the increase and ICP refractory to treatment is associated with increased mortality. Class I evidence is lacking on how monitoring and management of ICP influences outcome. However, a large body of observational data suggests that ICP management has the potential to influence outcome, particularly when care is targeted and individualized and supplemented with data from other monitors including the clinical examination and imaging.

ICP management does not hurt more than it helps (abridged summary)

Dr Deborah M Stein, MD, Professor of Surgery, R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center

Modern management of TBI is targeted towards the prevention and mitigation of secondary brain insults such as the prevention of systemic hypotension and hypoxia. ICP monitoring has become customary in the modern ICU, but is largely based on retrospective data.

The Brain Trauma Foundation's (BTF) most recent guidelines were published in 2016 and recommend ICP monitoring to '… reduce in-hospital and 2 week post-injury mortality… '. What remains to be analyzed is exactly what patient population needs to be monitored, for how long and in what form.

ICP monitoring is the most rapid and consistent methods for identifying cerebral edema. It can also give advanced warning of SOL expansion, venous outflow compromise, loss of autoregulation, among other important neurological events. Although other methods do exist, such as serial CT scans and pauses in sedation to allow for neurological assessment, these methods are associated with real risks such as radiation exposure and altered physiology which can adversely affect functional outcome.

The only randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to address the issue of whether ICP monitoring changes outcome failed to demonstrate a difference between groups. There are several important methodological issues which affect the interpretation and generalizability of this trial (which will be discussed in detail later); however, and importantly, there was no specific harm associated with ICP monitoring.

### Intracranial pressure monitoring in patients with acute brain injury in the intensive care unit (SYNAPSE-ICU): an international, prospective observational cohort study [^115UAYUL]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The indications for intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring in patients with acute brain injury and the effects of ICP on patients' outcomes are uncertain. The aims of this study were to describe current ICP monitoring practises for patients with acute brain injury at centres around the world and to assess variations in indications for ICP monitoring and interventions, and their association with long-term patient outcomes.

Methods

We did a prospective, observational cohort study at 146 intensive care units (ICUs) in 42 countries. We assessed for eligibility all patients aged 18 years or older who were admitted to the ICU with either acute brain injury due to primary haemorrhagic stroke (including intracranial haemorrhage or subarachnoid haemorrhage) or traumatic brain injury. We included patients with altered levels of consciousness at ICU admission or within the first 48 h after the brain injury, as defined by the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) eye response score of 1 (no eye opening) and a GCS motor response score of at least 5 (not obeying commands). Patients not admitted to the ICU or with other forms of acute brain injury were excluded from the study. Between-centre differences in use of ICP monitoring were quantified by using the median odds ratio (MOR). We used the therapy intensity level (TIL) to quantify practice variations in ICP interventions. Primary endpoints were 6 month mortality and 6 month Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) score. A propensity score method with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate the association between use of ICP monitoring and these 6 month outcomes, independently of measured baseline covariates. This study is registered with ClinicalTrial.gov, NCT03257904.

Findings

Between March 15, 2018, and April 30, 2019, 4776 patients were assessed for eligibility and 2395 patients were included in the study, including 1287 (54%) with traumatic brain injury, 587 (25%) with intracranial haemorrhage, and 521 (22%) with subarachnoid haemorrhage. The median age of patients was 55 years (IQR 39–69) and 1567 (65%) patients were male. Considerable variability was recorded in the use of ICP monitoring across centres (MOR 4.5, 95% CI 3.8–4.9 between two randomly selected centres for patients with similar covariates). 6 month mortality was lower in patients who had ICP monitoring (441/1318 [34%]) than in those who were not monitored (517/1049 [49%]; p < 0.0001). ICP monitoring was associated with significantly lower 6 month mortality in patients with at least one unreactive pupil (hazard ratio [HR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.26–0.47; p < 0.0001), and better neurological outcome at 6 months (odds ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.26–0.56; p = 0.0025). Median TIL was higher in patients with ICP monitoring (9 [IQR 7–12]) than in those who were not monitored (5 [3–8]; p < 0.0001) and an increment of one point in TIL was associated with a reduction in mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.91–0.98; p = 0.0011).

Interpretation

The use of ICP monitoring and ICP management varies greatly across centres and countries. The use of ICP monitoring might be associated with a more intensive therapeutic approach and with lower 6-month mortality in more severe cases. Intracranial hypertension treatment guided by monitoring might be considered in severe cases due to the potential associated improvement in long-term clinical results.

### Accuracy of intracranial pressure monitoring: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116qQURf]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Intracranial pressure (ICP) measurement is used to tailor interventions and to assist in formulating the prognosis for traumatic brain injury patients. Accurate data are therefore essential. The aim of this study was to verify the accuracy of ICP monitoring systems on the basis of a literature review.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted from 1982 to 2014, plus additional references from the selected papers. Accuracy was defined as the degree of correspondence between the pressure read by the catheter and a reference "real" ICP measurement. Studies comparing simultaneous readings from at least two catheters were included. Drift was defined as the loss of accuracy over the monitoring period. Meta-analyses of data from the studies were used to estimate the overall mean difference between simultaneous ICP measurements and their variability. Individual studies were weighted using both a fixed and a random effects model.

Results

Of 163 articles screened, 83 compared two intracranial catheters: 64 reported accuracy and 37 drift (some reported both). Of these, 10 and 17, respectively, fulfilled the inclusion criteria for accuracy and zero drift analysis. The combined mean differences between probes were 1.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–2.3) with the random effects model and 1.6 mmHg (95% CI 1.3–1.9) with the fixed effects model. The reported mean drift over a long observation period was 0.75 mmHg. No relation was found with the duration of monitoring or differences between various probes.

Conclusions

This study confirms that the average error between ICP measures is clinically negligible. The random effects model, however, indicates that a high percentage of readings may vary over a wide range, with clinical implications both for future comparison studies and for daily care.
