## Question

Can ibs cause high crp and white count or it's just functional disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can cause high C-reactive protein (CRP) and a high white blood cell (WBC) count, or if IBS is purely a functional disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition of IBS and whether it is truly a functional disorder. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about using CRP and WBC to evaluate IBS. Next, I will examine the evidence for low-grade inflammation in IBS and whether this translates into clinically meaningful CRP or leukocytosis. After that, I need to check the diagnostic performance of CRP and WBC for distinguishing IBS from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Finally, I will synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant interpretation and testing strategy, including when fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin should be used instead of CRP or WBC.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain associated with altered bowel habits, diagnosed by symptom-based criteria after excluding organic disease; it is not defined by mucosal inflammation or systemic inflammatory activity, which is why routine inflammatory markers are not expected to be elevated in uncomplicated IBS [^115gkP8t] [^111A8KTd] [^112XdoBy].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually recommend about CRP and WBC in IBS. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests against using CRP or ESR to screen for IBD in patients with chronic diarrhea or suspected IBS-D because of limited diagnostic accuracy, and instead recommends fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin; the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) includes CBC and CRP or ESR in a limited initial panel for new-onset IBS symptoms, but emphasizes that abnormalities should prompt evaluation for organic disease rather than confirming IBS; the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology advises against routine CRP or fecal calprotectin in typical IBS without alarm features; and the American College of Gastroenterology suggests considering CRP or fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin selectively in IBS-D without alarm features to rule out IBD, underscoring that these tests are for exclusion rather than confirmation of IBS [^115AesYt] [^112URHZp] [^116ySw9U] [^115tL4Qy] [^115tmT8A] [^112HuXUe] [^113T3Wtr].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some patients with IBS do show evidence of low-grade immune activation or mucosal changes, so I should double-check whether this ever meaningfully elevates CRP or WBC. Observational studies using high-sensitivity CRP show that median hs-CRP in IBS may be slightly higher than in healthy controls but generally remains within the normal laboratory range, and correlations with symptom severity are weak; similarly, while post-infectious IBS cohorts and mechanistic studies describe low-grade mucosal inflammation or immune cell alterations, these findings have not translated into consistent leukocytosis or clinically significant CRP elevation in IBS populations [^113f99Qr] [^112Bqg73] [^1145P7NQ] [^113f99Qr].

> I need to check the diagnostic performance of CRP and WBC for distinguishing IBS from IBD. Meta-analytic and comparative data show that CRP has only modest sensitivity and specificity for IBD, with substantial false positives and false negatives; using low CRP cutoffs can reduce false negatives but increases false positives, and ESR performs even worse; fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin consistently outperform CRP and WBC for detecting intestinal inflammation, with calprotectin around 81–93% sensitivity and 87–96% specificity at commonly used thresholds, whereas WBC count has poor diagnostic utility for this discrimination [^112URHZp] [^115vQZeL] [^111pbEFB] [^113T3Wtr] [^112rgZot].

> But wait, what if the WBC is mildly elevated — could that still fit IBS? Mild leukocytosis is nonspecific and can reflect stress, medications, or intercurrent illness; in the context of IBS, a normal or mildly elevated WBC does not support the diagnosis of IBD and should not be overinterpreted, whereas marked leukocytosis or a left shift should prompt reconsideration of alternative diagnoses such as infection, diverticulitis, or IBD flare; importantly, even in IBD, up to 40% of patients with mild inflammation can have normal CRP, so normal CRP/WBC never fully excludes IBD when clinical suspicion is high [^112rgZot] [^114khZJE].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overstating anything. IBS itself does not cause a high CRP or leukocytosis; minor elevations of hs-CRP within the normal range have been reported in subsets of IBS, particularly IBS-D, but these are not reliable disease markers and should not be used to diagnose IBS; conversely, a clearly elevated CRP or WBC should raise suspicion for organic disease such as IBD or infection and warrants further evaluation with fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin and, if positive or if alarm features are present, colonoscopy with biopsies rather than labeling the disorder as IBS [^112Bqg73] [^115AesYt] [^112HuXUe] [^111pbEFB].

> Next, I should review a practical, guideline-aligned approach. In patients with typical IBS symptoms and no alarm features, a limited panel of CBC, CRP or ESR, and celiac serology is reasonable in primary care; if diarrhea predominates, add fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for IBD, recognizing that fecal markers outperform serum CRP for this purpose; if fecal calprotectin is > 50–100 μg/g (thresholds vary by assay and local practice), exclude infection and refer for colonoscopy; if CRP is clearly elevated or WBC is significantly elevated, broaden the differential and proceed to fecal markers and endoscopic evaluation rather than attributing symptoms to IBS [^116ySw9U] [^113T3Wtr] [^111pbEFB] [^112QJnNe].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. IBS is a functional disorder and, by definition, does not cause clinically significant CRP elevation or leukocytosis; low-grade immune activation may be present in some patients, but routine inflammatory markers remain normal or only trivially altered and cannot be used to diagnose IBS; when CRP or WBC are clearly abnormal, prioritize evaluation for organic disease, using fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin and endoscopy as indicated, rather than anchoring on IBS [^112Bqg73] [^115AesYt] [^112HuXUe] [^111pbEFB].

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder and **does not cause a high CRP or leukocytosis** [^115gkP8t]. CRP and WBC are typically normal in IBS; if elevated, **evaluate for organic disease** such as IBD, infection, or malignancy [^112HuXUe] [^114khZJE]. Low-grade inflammation may occur in IBS, but it is not sufficient to raise CRP or WBC [^112Bqg73]. Use fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to screen for IBD in IBS-D, as CRP/WBC are nonspecific and can be normal in IBD [^115AesYt] [^113T3Wtr].

---

## Pathophysiology of IBS

IBS is characterized by **altered gut motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and brain–gut axis dysfunction** [^115gkP8t]; low-grade mucosal inflammation and immune activation may be present but are not sufficient to cause systemic inflammation or elevate CRP/WBC [^1118ZF6A].

---

## C-reactive protein (CRP) in IBS

- **Normal CRP**: CRP is typically normal in IBS; if elevated, suspect organic disease (IBD, infection, malignancy) [^112Bqg73] [^111vqCs1] [^114khZJE].
- **Low-grade inflammation**: Some IBS subtypes (e.g. post-infectious) may show low-grade inflammation, but CRP usually remains normal [^1118ZF6A].
- **Guidelines**: ACG and AGA recommend fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin, not CRP, to screen for IBD in IBS-D [^111fHfF1] [^115AesYt].

---

## White blood cell (WBC) count in IBS

- **Normal WBC**: WBC is typically normal in IBS; leukocytosis suggests infection, IBD, or other organic disease [^117NmNr4].
- **Low-grade inflammation**: Immune activation in IBS does not cause significant leukocytosis [^notfound].
- **Guidelines**: WBC is not recommended to diagnose or exclude IBD in IBS; fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin are preferred [^113T3Wtr] [^115AesYt].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Crp testing** | **Wbc testing** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ACG 2021 | Not recommended to exclude IBD in IBS-D | Not recommended | - Fecal calprotectin <br/> - Fecal lactoferrin |
| AGA 2019 | Suggests against CRP/ESR to screen for IBD in IBS-D | Not recommended | - Fecal calprotectin <br/> - Fecal lactoferrin |
| BSG 2021 | Routine CRP not recommended | Not recommended | - Fecal calprotectin <br/> - Celiac serology |

## Clinical implications of elevated CRP or WBC in IBS-suspected patients

If CRP or WBC are elevated in a patient with suspected IBS, **evaluate for organic disease** — particularly IBD, infection, or malignancy — using fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin, colonoscopy, or other appropriate tests [^112HuXUe] [^115AesYt].

---

## Conclusion

IBS is a functional disorder and **does not cause a high CRP or leukocytosis** [^115gkP8t]; if CRP or WBC are elevated, evaluate for organic disease. Fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin are the preferred screening tests for IBD in IBS-D, as CRP/WBC are nonspecific and can be normal in IBD [^115AesYt].

Laboratory

CRP and white blood cell (WBC) count are largely used to assess acute inflammatory status due to different causes. The Dutch College of General Practitioners' guideline on diverticulitis recommends CRP testing, even using an in-office device, when specific signs and/or symptoms are present, with concentrations of > 20 mg/L and > 100 mg/L supporting the diagnosis of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis, respectively. However, data from other studies suggest that perforation is unlikely in acute sigmoid diverticulitis when CRP is < 50 mg/L, whereas only values > 200 mg/L are a strong indicator of perforation. Elevated WBC (> 10,000/dL) showed an 88% sensitivity and 44% specificity for diverticulitis perforation. However, a WBC count > 12,000 was adopted as cutoff for diagnosing acute diverticulitis in several studies. A WBC count > 10,000–15,000/dL, and CRP ≥ 50 mg/L had an OR for diagnosis of acute diverticulitis of 2.53 and 3.78, respectively. A recent study found that a procalcitonin value > 0.1 ng/L has 81% sensitivity and 91% specificity for differentiating complicated and uncomplicated diverticulitis when combined with abdominal CT scans. It has been also found that hyponatremia (< 136 mg/L) was significantly associated with diverticulitis (or appendicitis) perforation in patients older than 50 years. In 2009, Tursi et al published the first study showing increased semi-quantitative levels of fecal calprotectin in patients with either uncomplicated diverticulitis or SUDD, but not in asymptomatic DD, IBS patients or controls. However, the accuracy of fecal calprotectin testing in distinguishing different gastrointestinal diseases has been questioned.

### The science, evidence, and practice of dietary interventions in irritable bowel syndrome [^112uNiCn]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent disorder that is characterized by symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and/or diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made using Rome III criteria or published guidelines after taking a thoughtful history, excluding warning signs, and performing a careful physical examination. Limited testing (ie, complete blood count and C-reactive protein level) may be useful in appropriate patients. A number of pharmacologic options are available, although many patients fail to respond to pharmacologic therapy. Although several IBS diets frequently are recommended, data supporting their use are limited. This article provides a rationale as to why specific diets might improve IBS symptoms and evaluates published trials.

Importance

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects 7% to 21% of the general population. It is a chronic condition that can substantially reduce quality of life and work productivity.

Objectives

To summarize the existing evidence on epidemiology, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of IBS and to provide practical treatment recommendations for generalists and specialists according to the best available evidence.

Evidence Review

A search of Ovid (MEDLINE) and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was performed for literature from 2000 to December 2014 for the terms pathophysiology, etiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, irritable bowel syndrome, and IBS. The range was expanded from 1946 to December 2014 for IBS, irritable bowel syndrome, diet, treatment, and therapy.

Findings

The database search yielded 1303 articles, of which 139 were selected for inclusion. IBS is not a single disease but rather a symptom cluster resulting from diverse pathologies. Factors important to the development of IBS include alterations in the gut microbiome, intestinal permeability, gut immune function, motility, visceral sensation, brain-gut interactions, and psychosocial status. The diagnosis of IBS relies on symptom-based criteria, exclusion of concerning features (symptom onset after age 50 years, unexplained weight loss, family history of selected organic gastrointestinal diseases, evidence of gastrointestinal blood loss, and unexplained iron-deficiency anemia), and the performance of selected tests (complete blood cell count, C-reactive protein or fecal calprotectin, serologic testing for celiac disease, and age-appropriate colorectal cancer screening) to exclude organic diseases that can mimic IBS. Determining the predominant symptom (IBS with diarrhea, IBS with constipation, or mixed IBS) plays an important role in selection of diagnostic tests and treatments. Various dietary, lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions have proven effective in randomized clinical trials.

Conclusions and Relevance

The diagnosis of IBS relies on the identification of characteristic symptoms and the exclusion of other organic diseases. Management of patients with IBS is optimized by an individualized, holistic approach that embraces dietary, lifestyle, medical, and behavioral interventions.

### What is the faecal calprotectin test? [^111A1HPZ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Calprotectin is a protein released by white blood cells involved in inflammation of the bowel.1 It can be detected in faeces using laboratory or point of care tests. Although an elevated calprotectin level indicates inflammation in the bowel, it cannot identify the cause.1 Faecal calprotectin testing is mainly used in distinguishing between 'functional' disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome and 'organic' disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, a group of conditions including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis that require referral to specialist services. Here we explain the role of faecal calprotectin testing in adults in primary care.

AGA guideline — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C‑reactive protein (CRP): "Recommendation 2: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the AGA suggests against the use of erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C‑reactive protein to screen for IBD. Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence". Evidence summary shows that for CRP, "using a value of 5–6 mg/L as a threshold", pooled sensitivity was "0.73 (95% CI, 0.64–0.80)" and pooled specificity was "0.78 (95% CI, 0.58–0.91)", whereas ESR thresholds "10–15 mm/h… resulted in lower estimates of diagnostic accuracy for IBD". A pragmatic note states that "if testing for fecal lactoferrin or calprotectin are either not available or not covered by insurance, the use of CRP might be considered to be a reasonable option to screen for IBD".

### Inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or what? a challenge to the functional-organic dichotomy [^112tSAGK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Many patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in clinical remission continue to have symptoms of pain and diarrhea despite minimal or no ongoing inflammation. These patients may be considered to have an overlap of IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBD-IBS). In this month's Journal, a proposal is made that continued symptoms in patients with elevated calprotectin, a marker of inflammation, is related to IBD. We propose an alternate biopsychosocial model whereby mutual effects of peripheral and central factors influence symptom generation in both IBD and IBS. Understanding this model has important implications for treatment of patients with IBD-IBS.

### The quest for biomarkers in IBS-where should it lead us? [^112MMXkx]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2014). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorder which represents a major cost to health-care services. The diagnosis of IBS is currently performed by means of symptom-based diagnostic criteria, but there has been an ongoing interest in developing biomarkers which could simplify the diagnosis and/or evaluating the effect of treatments. This article reviews the current literature concerning the proposed biomarkers including those of altered gut motility, of visceral hypersensitivity, of abnormal brain mechanisms, of serum, fecal and mucosal inflammation and of increased intestinal permeability.

### Early symptoms preceding post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome following COVID-19: a retrospective observational study incorporating daily gastrointestinal symptoms [^113QR4Yw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the severity of COVID-19 was not validated as an independent predictor of IBS after SARS-CoV-2 infection in this study, possible triggers for IBS would exist in patients with severe COVID-19. Cytokine imbalance frequently occurs in cases of severe COVID-19, and gut functions are disturbed through destructive autoinflammation, which can eventually induce IBS. Moreover, psychological stress in severe COVID-19 can interfere with the brain-gut axis. Here, higher WBC counts with a relatively higher rate of segmented neutrophils on hospital admission, relatively higher WBC counts and CRP levels at the onset of GI symptoms, and prolonged ICU stays were observed among patients with IBS following COVID-19. The relationship between the severity of COVID-19 and the development of IBS should be further examined in future studies with larger sample sizes.

Detailed GI symptoms during the treatment of COVID-19 were extensively examined in this study, and some distinctive daily changes in GI symptoms would be considered as early clinical signs of IBS following COVID-19. Although the GI symptoms during hospitalization for COVID-19 treatment are not necessarily equal to those for the diagnosis of IBS, predominant stool patterns until discharge were similar to those of IBS with diarrhea, known as IBS-D, or mixed IBS, known as IBS-M. Conversely, abdominal pain during COVID-19 treatment was not necessary for the development of post-infectious IBS.

The present study obtained data regarding daily GI symptoms from real-world practice that were retrieved directly from a hospital information system. Therefore, a more robust association between GI symptoms during hospitalization for the treatment of COVID-19 and the development of IBS would be expected in this study compared with previous studies.

### Assessment of high-sensitivity CRP as a marker of micro-inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome [^112Bqg73]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is symptom-based. Although considered a functional disease, accumulating evidence supports a low-grade gut inflammation as an element of its pathophysiology. Thus, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of micro inflammation, may be elevated in IBS. Our aim was to assess whether hs-CRP is higher in IBS patients compared to healthy controls (HC) and does it differ among the IBS clinical subgroups and correlate with disease severity.

Methods

A diagnostic case control study was conducted in two gastroenterology departments. Eighty-eight IBS patients who were recruited prospectively answered the Rome III diagnostic questionnaire. They all completed the Functional Bowel Disorder Severity Index (FBDSI), dietary, and general health questionnaires. All patients underwent blood sampling for hs-CRP levels. Each IBS patient was matched to four HC by age, gender, and BMI. Blood samples were obtained from the HC at a periodic health survey.

Key Results

The mean hs-CRP level in the IBS group was significantly higher than in HC (1.17 ± 1.26mg L(-1) vs 0.72 ± 0.91mg L(-1) respectively, P = 0.001). Hs-CRP levels were highest in patients with diarrhea-predominant IBS and in patients with greater disease severity. A cut-off value of 1.08mg L(-1) had a sensitivity of 60.2% and a specificity of 68% for differentiating IBS from HC.

Conclusions & Inferences

Hs-CRP levels are higher in IBS patients than HC, but still in the normal laboratory range. This may reflect the low-grade gut inflammation believed to occur in IBS and support its existence.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^1145P7NQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Low-grade inflammation

IBS was regarded as an exclusively functional disorder, but recent studies have demonstrated evidence of low-grade mucosal inflammation in some IBS patients. Mechanisms associated with post-infectious alterations, dysfunctional epithelial permeability, abnormalities in gut microbiota, and elevated stress levels can enhance or stimulate abnormal immune responses. A combination of low-grade inflammation of the intestinal mucosa with impaired bowel motility and visceral sensitivity could explain the underlying etiology and pathology of IBS.

The hypothesis of the importance of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of IBS was initially based on the observation that IBS symptoms developed following episodes of infectious gastroenteritis elicited by bacteria, viruses or parasites. This syndrome was defined as post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS). Several studies verified the association of infectious enteritis and the risk of developing IBS, and a meta-analysis reported an estimated sevenfold increase compared with the controls groups. Researchers reported that female sex and young age, anxiety, depression and a protracted period of the initial infection with fever, are risk factors for the development of PI-IBS. Moreover, dysbiotic microbiota caused by an infectious gastroenteritis could promote inflammation and alter the innate immune reaction in PI-IBS patients. Intestinal mucosal biopsies from patients with PI-IBS revealed elevated numbers of immunity cells, such as lymphocytes and MC. Notably, patients with PI-IBS also have increased cytokine production compared with healthy controls or compared with patients who have fully recovered from infectious enteritis.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^111JSZRp]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease — A diagnostic algorithm begins with suspicion of functional gastrointestinal symptoms followed by clinical assessment with laboratory assessment for inflammatory markers such as CRP and calprotectin, then branches to unequivocal or borderline inflammation versus no evidence of active inflammation; positive inflammation leads to endoscopic/histopathologic and/or imaging assessment with optimization of anti-inflammatory therapy, whereas lack of active inflammation is classified as non-inflammatory (functional) symptoms prompting identification of pathophysiologic contributors and specific, targeted therapy; cut-off values for inflammatory markers such as calprotectin will vary according to the clinical scenario.

### Use of surrogate markers of inflammation and Rome criteria to distinguish organic from nonorganic intestinal disease [^111vqCs1]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Differentiating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) from those of organic intestinal disease is a familiar problem for physicians. The aim of this study was to assess the sensitivity, specificity, and odds ratios (ORs) of fecal calprotectin, small intestinal permeability, Rome I criteria, and laboratory markers of inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP], blood count) in distinguishing organic from nonorganic intestinal disease.

Methods

A total of 602 new referrals to a gastroenterology clinic who had symptoms suggestive of IBS or organic intestinal disease were studied for these parameters. All patients underwent invasive imaging (barium/endoscopic examination) and other investigations as appropriate, with physicians blinded to the results of fecal calprotectin and intestinal permeability.

Results

A total of 263 patients were diagnosed with organic disease and 339 with IBS. At 10 mg/L, the sensitivity and specificity of calprotectin for organic disease were 89% and 79%, respectively, and that of intestinal permeability for small intestinal disease were 63% and 87%, respectively. Sensitivity of positive Rome criteria for IBS was 85% with a specificity of 71%. An abnormal calprotectin test had an OR for disease of 27.8 (95% confidence interval, 17.6–43.7; P < 0.0001) compared with ORs of 4.2 (95% CI, 2.9–6.1; P < 0.0001) and 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2–4.6; P < 0.0001) for elevated CRP and ESR values. An abnormal permeability test gave an OR of 8.9 (95% CI, 5.8–14.0; P < 0.0001) for small intestinal disease. The OR for IBS with positive Rome criteria was 13.3 (95% CI, 8.9–20.0).

Conclusions

Fecal calprotectin, intestinal permeability, and positive Rome I criteria provide a safe and noninvasive means of helping differentiate between patients with organic and nonorganic intestinal disease.

### Excluding inflammatory bowel disease in the irritable bowel syndrome patient: how far to go? [^113m1aJN]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is among the most commonly encountered conditions in primary care and gastroenterology. There is ample evidence that an IBS diagnosis based on symptom-based criteria and exclusion of alarm features that would otherwise support diagnostic testing is accurate and durable. For many clinicians, however, IBS remains a diagnosis of exclusion because of concern surrounding missed diagnoses of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or other organic gastrointestinal diseases. Using blood and/or fecal biomarker tests to shift the precolonoscopy probability of IBD in patients with symptoms mimicking IBS is becoming an increasingly reasonable practice with improvement in 'preliminary' tests.

Recent Findings

Fecal calprotectin (FCP) testing appears to be the most sensitive preliminary test for discriminating IBD from IBS. Although both fecal lactoferrin and FCP were superior to serum C-reactive peptide (CRP) in their diagnostic accuracy, FCP is superior to fecal lactoferrin based on available literature.

Summary

In patients with IBS with diarrhea who have not undergone previous extensive evaluation, the ability of screening tests to detect colonic inflammation is improving. FCP and fecal lactoferrin are reliable predictors of colonic inflammation and should be considered for standard testing in patients with IBS-D symptoms to help identify those who would benefit most from colonoscopy. Although predictive, there currently are no fecal or serum tests that can definitively identify or subtype IBD.

### Utility of faecal calprotectin in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): what cut-offs should we apply? [^115nzM2s]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are laboratory investigations which are often employed by clinicians in their determination of probability of patients having an underlying organic bowel disease as opposed to a functional disorder. Using a low CRP cut-off is reported to have improved sensitivity, but poorer specificity, which would lead clinicians to unnecessarily investigate, if used in isolation.ESR has been shown, in other studies, to offer little benefit to the evaluation process for those subjects fulfilling clinical criteria suggestive of IBS. Tibble et al reported that abnormal FC had a significantly greater OR using FC to identify IBD (p < 0.0001) compared with an elevation in CRP and ESR. Our findings support this earlier result by showing greater sensitivity and predictive ability with FC than with ESR and/or CRP to distinguish between functional and organic disorders. This in turn, aids in monitoring of active exacerbations and remission of IBD.

FC is more cost-effective than non-FC strategies in a diagnostic pathway based on a recent systematic evaluation by the Centre for Economic Based Practice 2010 data. Although any quality-adjusted life-year gains were likely to be small due to of the low prevalence of IBD and the high sensitivities of all of the tests, considerable savings could still accrue. Additionally, a recent study of 3639 patients has suggested that the estimated demand for colonoscopies is reduced by 50% with the 50 μg/g cut-off and by 67% with the 100 μg/g cut-off, equating to €1.57 million and €2.13 million, respectively.

Overall our data affirms that the use of FC is beneficial in distinguishing between functional GI conditions (IBS) and organic disease (IBD). In those with IBD, a 250 μg/g cut-off aids in determining clinical disease activity. FC testing like β natriuretic polypeptide used in the diagnosis of cardiac failure, is a useful, relatively economical test benefiting primary and secondary care. It helps to sift out those with organic pathology requiring further investigations, and in those with IBD, aids in disease monitoring, avoidance of invasive procedures and reduction of time off work. The study population was carefully chosen to allow us to validate symptoms and assess all subjects with endoscopy. Further studies are now needed to assess the use in a primary care population.

### Overlapping irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease: less to this than meets the eye? [^112TarHH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Though distinct in terms of pathology, natural history and therapeutic approach, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have some features in common. These include shared symptomatology and largely similar demographics. However, in most instances, clinical presentation, together with laboratory, imaging and endoscopic findings will readily permit the differentiation of active IBD from IBS. More problematic is the situation where a subject with IBD, in apparent remission, continues to complain of symptoms which, in aggregate, satisfy commonly employed criteria for the diagnosis of IBS. Access to methodologies, such the assay for levels of calprotectin in feces, now allows identification of ongoing inflammation in some such individuals and prompts appropriate therapy. More challenging is the IBD patient with persisting symptoms and no detectable evidence of inflammation; is this coincident IBS, IBS triggered by IBD or an even more subtle level of IBD activity unrecognized by available laboratory or imaging methods? Arguments can be advanced for each of these proposals; lacking definitive data, this issue remains unresolved. The occurrence of IBS-type symptoms in the IBD patient, together with some data suggesting a very subtle level of 'inflammation' or 'immune activation' in IBS, raises other questions: is IBS a prodromal form of IBD; and are IBS and IBD part of the spectrum of the same disease? All of the available evidence indicates that the answer to both these questions should be a resounding 'no'. Indeed, the whole issue of overlap between IBS and IBD should be declared moot given their differing pathophysiologies, contrasting natural histories and divergent treatment paths. The limited symptom repertoire of the gastrointestinal tract may well be fundamental to the apparent confusion that has, of late, bedeviled this area.

RESULTS

CBC, White Blood Cells, Histology, TSH, Vitamin D, and CRP

Subjects ranged in age from 30 to 65 years as per enrollment criteria. The average for each cohort was similar: Cohort A, 44.5 years; Cohort B, 46.9 years; and Cohort C, 46.5 years. The evaluation of peripheral blood for vitamin D levels and TSH showed no statistical difference between the cohorts. There were no abnormalities found in any cohort in the CBC, white blood cells, and differential. The CRP levels were statistically higher in Cohort A than in Cohorts B or C, but there was no difference between Cohorts B and C (Figure 1). The normal CRP range is below 8.0 mg/L; levels of 8 to 100 mg/L are mild to moderately elevated, and levels of 100 to 500 mg/L are elevated and signify inflammation of blood vessels, or major trauma. Cohort A CRP levels ranged from 0.20 to 28.41 mg/L, Cohort B from 0.35 to 15.98 mg/L, and Cohort C from 0.20 to 12.40 mg/L. Of the 9 patients in Cohort A with mild to moderately elevated CRP, 8 subjects had smooth implants and 1 had textured; 7 patients had saline implants and 2 had gel implants. In Cohort B, 3 subjects had mild to moderate elevations. Of these subjects, 1 had textured implants and 2 were smooth; 2 were gel implants and 1 saline. Seven of the 9 subjects in Cohort A self-reported connective tissue disease or autoimmune disease such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), hypothyroidism, Lyme's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, or lichen sclerosis. The subjects in this cohort also had documented significant confounding lifestyle choices and previous medical histories that can contribute to an elevated CRP such as smoking and obesity.

Meanwhile, other GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, number of days from COVID-19 diagnosis (positive PCR) to onset of symptoms, and laboratory parameters at the onset of initial GI symptoms were comparable between the groups; however, the number of days from COVID-19 diagnosis to onset of nausea was relatively longer in patients with IBS (10 [8–16] vs. 3 [1–10] days, standardized difference = 0.724). Moreover, the WBC count and CRP levels at the onset of initial GI symptoms were relatively higher in patients with IBS than in those without IBS.

### Abnormal immune regulation and low-grade inflammation in IBS: does one size fit all? [^1177sQdE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Evidences suggest that there is low-grade inflammation in the colonic mucosa and/or a state of immune activation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Results from available studies are inconsistent mainly because of differences in measures, methodologies and study populations. In this issue, Chang et al. evaluated a comprehensive set of cytokines, immune markers and immune-related cells in patients with non post infectious IBS (non PI-IBS) and controls. The main finding was a lower expression of the mRNA of the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine in the colonic mucosa of women with non PI-IBS without any differences in the cell counts. These results suggest that in non PI-IBS, there is altered immune regulation/activation without evidence of low-grade mucosal inflammation. Further, PI and non PI-IBS may be associated with different alterations in immune function/activation.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disease characterized by recurrent abdominal pain that is associated with defecation or an alteration in bowel habits. IBS can be classified into four subtypes based on the predominant stool pattern (IBS with diarrhea [IBS-D], IBS with constipation [IBS-C], IBS with mixed bowel habits [IBS-M], and unclassified IBS).

IBS is a very common diagnosis worldwide, with a calculated prevalence of 10–15%, although there are variations depending on the country and the criteria used to define IBS. There is a slight predominance of female patients and the onset of symptoms usually occurs at a young age. Over the last years, recognition of IBS has improved, together with the increasing credibility of the diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome consensus; however, clinical experience is still broadly exercised by physicians.

The socioeconomic impact of IBS is large across continents. Annual direct medical costs in the United States alone vary from 2–10 billion US dollars, while estimates of indirect medical costs, as patients are frequently absent from work, are even greater. Therapeutic interventions are still ineffective and unable to relieve the burden on patients' quality of life.

The pathophysiology of the syndrome is poorly understood, while a number of possible mechanisms, such as visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal gut motility, and irregular brain-gut interaction, are implicated in its development (Fig. 1). Chronic low-grade intestinal mucosal inflammation is another of these potential etiological factors. A number of studies have documented alterations in MC, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and cytokine concentrations in the colonic mucosa or the systemic circulation in IBS patients compared with healthy controls. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the role of immune activation in the pathogenesis and the development of IBS.

Patients

Male and female patients aged 18 to 55 years with moderate to severe IBS-D diagnosed according to Rome III criteria [recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort (an uncomfortable sensation not described as pain) at least three days a month in the past three months, associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation; onset associated with a change in frequency of stool; and onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool. The criteria should be fulfilled for the past three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis]. Patients classified as IBS-D (diarrhea predominant) had > 25% loose/wet motions (Bristol stool scale 6–7) and < 25% firm/hard motions (Bristol stool scale 1–2). The severity of IBS was determined by the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) as described below.

The following alarm features were required to be absent as part of screening to minimize the risk of missing important organic diseases; rectal bleeding, anemia, unexplained weight loss, nocturnal diarrhea, and a family history of organic GI diseases (e.g. colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease). All patients agreed not to start any other drug treatment unless clinically indicated. Exclusion criteria included: treatment with probiotics within last three months; concurrent severe illness (cancer, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hepatic, renal or cardiac dysfunction, and hyper- or hypothyroidism); previous GI surgery; chronic organic bowel disorders (e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, diverticular disease, etc); treatment with antibiotics in the two months prior to enrolment; pregnancy or lactation. To exclude other diagnoses, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for IBS were screened using the following tests: full blood count (FBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antibody testing for coeliac disease (endomysial antibodies or tissue transglutaminase).

### High-sensitive C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome [^113f99Qr]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Recent studies demonstrated low-grade inflammation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, these studies have been relatively small and do not enable examination of this factor in different subtypes of IBS and the possibility of confounding effects of comorbidities that may be associated with inflammatory responses.

Goals

To investigate the association between high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and the diagnosis of IBS, IBS subtypes, symptoms' severity, and IBS-associated comorbidities.

Study

This cross-sectional study uses data from a large matched case-control study of IBS subjects and healthy controls (HC). hs-CRP levels were measured in all subjects. IBS diagnosis was determined by Rome III criteria, negative screening blood tests, and normal colonoscopy. Subjects were evaluated for IBS severity and associated pain and psychological comorbidities.

Results

A total of 242 IBS patients and 244 HC were studied. Median hs-CRP levels in the IBS group were significantly higher than in HC (1.80; interquartile range, 0.7 to 4.04 mg/L vs. 1.20, interquartile range, 0.5 to 2.97 mg/L respectively, P < 0.006). Levels were highest in IBS-D patients with greater disease severity. Hs-CRP levels mildly correlated with symptoms severity (r = 0.169, P = 0.009); this correlation was stronger for the IBS-D patients (r = 0.27, P = 0.006). IBS was a significant independent predictor (P = 0.025) for higher hs-CRP levels, whereas other pain and psychological comorbidities were not.

Conclusions

Given these observations of cross-sectional differences in hs-CRP between IBS subtypes and severity, independent of pain and comorbidities, more research is needed to explore a possible role of low-grade inflammation in the pathogenesis and/or clinical presentation of IBS.

### Predictors of irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms in quiescent inflammatory bowel disease [^117FGVdX]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2024). Medium credibility.

2.3 | Outcomes

The primary outcome was to identify predictors for developing IBS-like symptoms in quiescent IBD. IBS-like symptoms was defined either by Rome IV criteria(i.e. new onset abdominal pain associated with change in bowel frequency/form and/or related to defecation for at least 3 months) and/or if the patient was given a new diagnosis of IBS by their medical provider. Quiescent inflammation was defined by fecal calprotectin less than 250 μg/g of feces and/or absence of mucosal ulceration on colonoscopy. As the presence of IBD technically excludes patients from meeting Rome criteria for IBS, we therefore have defined patients with IBD that meet Rome criteria as "IBS-like". The secondary outcome was the cumulative incidence of IBS-like symptoms in quiescent IBD in our patient population. Patient charts were reviewed through the gastroenterology clinical notes to assess for development of IBS-like symptoms. Patients were censored if they were lost to follow-up, had an acute IBD flare with elevated fecal calprotectin and/or evidence of mucosal ulceration on colonoscopy, underwent total colectomy, or if there were alternative causes for symptoms (e.g. infectious diarrhea).

2.4 | Covariates

Covariates of interest included demographic variables, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI). In addition, covariates related to structural/anatomic IBD-related issues included diagnosis of IBD (CD or UC), duration of IBD, extent of UC, CD location and behavior, extraintestinal manifestations, celiac disease status, prior IBD surgery, current IBD therapy, presence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and method of establishing quiescence (fecal calprotectin vs. endoscopy). Laboratory values, including C-reactive protein, white blood count, hemoglobin, platelets, AST, ALT, bilirubin, albumin, vitamin D level, vitamin B12 level, iron level, iron saturation, ferritin, and fecal calprotectin, were also extracted +/− 30 days of the index date. Finally, covariates related to potential disturbances in brain–gut interactions included tobacco use, tobacco pack-year history, alcohol use, marijuana use, opioid use, history of mood disorder, current use of psychotropic medication, antibiotic use in the last 3 months, and probiotic use within the past month.

### "Irritable bowel symptoms" in inflammatory bowel disease: diagnostic uncertainty meets pathological reality [^112PRKVq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are common, chronic, relapsing, and potentially disabling disorders in the West which are increasing in prevalence in the rest of the world. They typically afflict young adults in the prime of their lives and, consequently, may inflict a considerable emotional, personal, and socioeconomic toll. Not surprisingly, therefore, their management requires considerable clinical acumen and a fundamental commitment to the many dimensions of the patient-doctor relationship. There the similarities end. Despite a considerable body of recent data reporting a number of abnormalities (both upregulation and downregulation) in various components of the mucosal and systemic immune response in IBS, none of these findings come even close to the inflammatory processes that typify IBD. Furthermore, there is little evidence that those with an established diagnosis of IBS (in contrast to those with IBS-type symptoms in which IBD may have been missed (1)) can evolve into IBD; IBS, regardless of immunological or microbiological findings, should not be considered as a part of the spectrum of IBD. If IBS and IBD are distinct entities, then can they co-exist and lead to diagnostic confusion for the clinician?

Whereas the presence of chronic abdominal pain, the defining symptom of IBS, distinguishes these patients from those with functional diarrhea, there is significant overlap between the two; indeed, patients may oscillate between the diagnoses. Patients with IBS, especially those with frequent pain, have been shown to experience increased psychological distress and somatic comorbidities compared with patients with functional diarrhea, and they should therefore be evaluated accordingly. Early treatment of these overlapping conditions may be beneficial.

Results

Q.1: In patients with suspected complicated IBD, which are the appropriate biochemical investigations that should be performed?

Statement 1.1

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of CD and UC is based on a set of modalities including clinical, biochemical, endoscopic, radiological, and histological diagnostics rather than a single reference standard (QoE low C).

Statement 1.2

In assessing an acute abdomen in patients with IBD, laboratory tests including full blood count, electrolytes, liver enzymes, inflammatory biomarkers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum albumin and pre-albumin (to assess nutritional status and degree of inflammation) are mandatory (QoE moderate B).

Statement 1.3

In case of a suspected IBD flare, infectious causes should be ruled out, especially Clostridium difficile and Cytomegalovirus (QoE low C).

Recommendation

We recommend assessing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis disease activity in the urgent clinical situation by performing the following laboratory tests: a full blood count, including hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count; serum C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; serum electrolytes; liver enzymes level; serum albumin; renal function; and fecal calprotectin level, when it is possible. It is mandatory to exclude any infectious diseases by performing blood-, stool cultures, and toxin test for Clostridium difficile (strong recommendation based on a moderate level of evidence 1B).

Summary of evidence and discussion

In assessing a patient with acute abdominal pain in the emergency room, the main laboratory tests requested are full blood count (20.1%), electrolytes (19.1%), cardiac enzymes (19.0%), and liver function tests (11.5%).

In differentiating the cause underlying acute abdominal pain, the diagnostic accuracy values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell count (WBC) can be elevated.

IBD disease activity will usually impact laboratory tests results with anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated liver enzymes, hypoalbuminemia, and increased inflammatory markers. In addition, therapies may cause abnormalities in liver enzymes, leukocytes, and kidney function. Consequently, for patients with IBD admitted to the emergency room for evaluation, laboratory tests should always include full blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver enzymes, and lipase.

The panel suggests against the use of blood tests ESR or CRP to screen for IBD. Our evidence profiles also strongly recommend testing for celiac disease with IgA-tTG and a second test to detect celiac disease in the setting of IgA deficiency. In addition, testing for bile acid diarrhea is suggested. The AGA makes no recommendation for the use of currently available serologic tests for the diagnosis of IBS. A clinical decision support tool is included to guide the evaluation of patients with chronic watery diarrhea (> 4 weeks).

### A meta-analysis of the utility of C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to exclude inflammatory bowel disease in adults with IBS [^115vQZeL]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is viewed as a diagnosis of exclusion by most providers. The aim of our study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the utility of C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin to distinguish between patients with IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls (HCs).

Methods

A systematic online database search was performed. Included studies were prospective, adult, diagnostic cohort studies with any of the four tests. The means and s.d. values of biomarker logarithms were estimated based on studies that gave medians and either confidence intervals for the median, interquartile ranges, or ranges. We used a Naive Bayes approach to estimate the probability of being a HC, having IBS, or having IBD based on the biomarker values.

Results

Systematic review identified 1,252 citations. After cross-referencing medical subject headings, detailed evaluation identified 140 potentially relevant journal articles/abstracts for CRP, ESR, calprotectin, and lactoferrin of which 4, 4, 8, and 2 fulfilled our inclusion criteria, respectively. None of the biomarkers reliably distinguished between IBS and healthy controls. At a CRP level of ≤ 0.5 or calprotectin level of ≤ 40μg/g, there was a ≤ 1% probability of having IBD. Individual analysis of ESR and lactoferrin had little clinical utility.

Conclusion

CRP and calprotectin of ≤ 0.5 or 40, respectively, essentially excludes IBD in patients with IBS symptoms. The addition of CRP and calprotectin to symptom-based criteria may improve the confident diagnosis of IBS.

### Is irritable bowel syndrome a low-grade inflammatory bowel disease? [^1147QkQi]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is multifactorial in its etiology and heterogeneous in its clinical presentation and pathogenesis. It is recognized that inflammation plays an important role in symptom generation, at least in a subset of patients with IBS. Previous gastroenteritis has been identified as the most important risk factor for IBS, and several studies reported that a substantial proportion of patients with gastrointestinal infection develops IBS symptoms, which can persist for several years. Recent studies have demonstrated that a proportion of IBS patients without any history of enteritis has signs of immune activation in the gut. There is clinical overlap between IBS and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with IBS-like symptoms frequently reported in patients before the diagnosis of IBD, and a higher than expected percentage reports of IBS symptoms in patients in remission from established IBD. Thus, these conditions may coexist with a higher than expected frequency, or may exist on a continuum, with IBS and IBD at different ends of the same spectrum. This article examines these relation-ships using immune activation and inflammation as a common pathogenic process to IBD and a subset of IBS patients.

Adjusted analysis was conducted using the multivariate logistic regression model to identify the risk factors for development of IBS following COVID-19; WBC count on admission, requirement of ICU admission (severe COVID-19), nausea, and diarrhea were entered. As the number of covariates in the logistic model needed to be limited because of the small sample size, they were selected using the backward stepwise method. Nausea and diarrhea were selected in the final model and determined as risk factors for the development of IBS (odds ratio [OR], 4.00; 95% CI, 1.01–15.84; p = 0.049 and OR, 5.64; 95% CI, 1.21–26.31; p = 0.028, respectively; Table 4). Sensitivity analysis with bootstrapping similarly revealed an association between diarrhea and development of IBS following COVID-19, but not for the relationship between nausea and consecutive IBS diagnoses (Table 4).

In the subgroup analyses (Table S 3), nausea was associated with the development of IBS in patients with severe COVID-19 (3 [75.0%] vs. 10 [15.9%], p = 0.021) but not in those with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Conversely, the association between diarrhea and the development of IBS following COVID-19 was not significant in patients with severe or non-severe COVID-19.

### AGA clinical practice update on functional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: expert review [^113G9CtT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal symptoms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — Clinical assessment should begin with a detailed symptom history including a review of bowel patterns, and clinicians should query for associated pain, incontinence episodes, urgency or tenesmus; alarm features (eg, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, bleeding, high-volume or high-frequency diarrhea, fevers); recent antibiotic use; and symptom duration to identify features that may point away from a functional etiology. Presence of alarm features or acute symptom onset in previously well-controlled disease should prompt the clinician to maintain a high index of suspicion for underlying inflammatory activity. Physical examination should assess for objective findings suggesting organic pathology or active IBD such as abdominal distension or masses, and careful rectal examination should inspect for perianal or anorectal disease. In those without obvious perianal pathology to explain symptoms, a digital rectal exam to palpate for mass lesions and to screen for a rectal evacuation disorder should be completed. Objective evidence of inflammatory activity may be sought with laboratory testing such as serum CRP and fecal.

### Diagnosis and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: a review [^111A8KTd]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

The prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in the United States is between 7% and 16%, most common in women and young people, with annual direct costs estimated at more than $1 billion dollars in the United States. Traditionally, the diagnosis of IBS has been based on the positive identification of symptoms that correlate with several different syndromes associated with disorders such as IBS diarrhea, IBS constipation, functional diarrhea, functional constipation, chronic functional abdominal pain, or bloating. Several peripheral and central mechanisms initiate gastrointestinal motor and sensory dysfunctions leading to IBS symptoms. Those dysfunctions may require evaluation in patients whose symptoms do not respond to first-line treatments.

Observations

Validation studies of consensus symptom-based criteria have identified deficiencies that favor a simpler identification of the predominant symptoms of abdominal pain, bowel dysfunction, and bloating and exclusion of alarm symptoms such as unintentional weight loss, rectal bleeding, or recent change in bowel function. Symptom-based diagnosis of IBS is enhanced with additional history for symptoms of somatoform and psychological disorders and alarm symptoms, physical examination including digital rectal examination, and screening tests to exclude organic disease (by measuring hemoglobin and C-reactive protein concentrations). The initial treatment plan should include patient education, reassurance, and first-line treatments such as fiber and osmotic laxatives for constipation, opioids for diarrhea, antispasmodics for pain and for management of associated psychological disorders. For patients who do not respond to those IBS treatments, testing for specific functional disorders may be required in a minority of patients with IBS. These disorders include rectal evacuation disorder, abnormal colonic transit, and bile acid diarrhea. Their identification is followed by individualized treatment, such as pelvic floor retraining for rectal evacuation disorders, sequestrants for bile acid diarrhea, and secretory agents for constipation, although there is only limited evidence that this individualized management approach is effective.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances in the identification of specific dysfunctions as causes of individual symptoms in the "IBS spectrum" leads to the potential to enhance the diagnosis and management of symptoms for the majority of patients for whom first-line therapies of IBS and management of comorbid psychological disorders are insufficient.

### Faecal biomarker patterns in patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome [^1142Cva5]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Implications of abnormal biomarkers in an IBS population

Changes in our understanding of IBS have led to the recognition that the syndrome is unlikely to have a single, identifiable cause, but also that it ought no longer to be considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Rather, the notion that IBS is an 'umbrella' diagnosis of a phenotype defined by symptoms that are common to a number of discrete disease processes has gained currency.

In the present study, we have taken initial steps to characterise a group of biomarkers capable of suggesting alternative, treatable conditions or underlying causes producing the IBS phenotype as defined by Rome III criteria. The intention is to improve outcomes of patients classified as meeting IBS criteria by identifying and treating reversible disorders. Ultimately, it is to be hoped that faecal biomarker testing will have the effect of shrinking the number of patients in whom the diagnosis of IBS, without further specification, is the end point of the diagnostic evaluation.

Our analysis suggests that parallel assessment of multiple biomarkers may have significant clinical utility in differentiating specific underlying aetiologies of IBS presentations. For example, FC and EPX (assessing neutrophilic inflammation and eosinophilic inflammation, respectively) appear to be independent biomarkers. This finding is consistent with other published studies demonstrating that EPX may be a marker of treatment response in collagenous colitis, which is thought to have more eosinophilic involvement than inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Consistent with our previous work in a non-Rome III-confirmed IBS population, we identified a high overall rate of abnormal findings on selected faecal biomarkers. The two microbiota-related biomarkers, bacterial potential pathogens and abnormal growth of the beneficial commensals Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus, accounted for a large proportion of abnormal results. These are non-standard biomarkers, and accurate values for their rates in healthy populations are not known, so it is possible that these findings have relatively little significance.

On the other hand, there is increasing evidence from other studies that community-level dysbiosis is a highly prevalent, important and potentially contributory factor to IBS, particularly in the diarrhoea-predominant subtype.

Others have shown, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing by PCR, that significant phylotype-level alterations exist in the intestinal microbiota of patients with IBS in comparison with control subjects, that such differences persist between certain IBS subtypes, and that patients with IBS carry microbiota of significantly less biodiversity than do healthy control subjects.

These studies appear to suggest that our culture-based result may indeed be a rough indicator of shifted microbial patterns in IBS, and make a case for further study using our faecal biomarkers in combination with advanced microbiome genomic sequencing.

### IBS and IBD-separate entities or on a spectrum? [^114qG6HH]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Medium credibility.

The acute phase of IBD with inflamed gut and often ulcerated mucosa is clearly different from the apparently normal mucosa characteristic of IBS. However, more detailed assessment has detected immune activation, increased gut permeability, increased mucosal serotonin availability, abnormalities of enteric nerve structure and function, and dysbiosis in gut microbiota in IBS - all features seen in IBD. Furthermore, as treatments for inflammation in IBD have become more effective it is now apparent that ∼1 in 3 patients with IBD in remission from inflammation still have persistent abnormalities of sensation, motility and gut microbiota, which might cause IBS-like symptoms. This Perspective explores the overlap between IBS and IBD and their treatments, proposing future directions for research in this stimulating area.

### Factors affecting clinical decision-making in inflammatory bowel disease and the role of point-of-care calprotectin [^112mkH9X]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, collectively known as the inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The combined prevalence of these conditions in Western populations is 450 per 100,000. To date, their aetiology is uncertain, but it is thought that they occur as a consequence of a combination of host genetic and environment factors, including dysregulation of the enteric immune system and alterations in the intestinal microbiome.

The natural history of IBD is that of quiescence, interspersed with episodic flares of disease activity. Maintenance of glucocorticosteroid-free remission and the avoidance of surgical intervention are the principal aims of medical management. Evaluation of longitudinal disease activity, traditionally centred on patient-reported symptoms, forms the mainstay of outpatient disease activity assessment, with those with symptoms suggestive of clinically active disease likely to undergo endoscopic and radiological investigations to confirm this. Despite this, the correlation between symptom reporting and the presence of mucosal inflammation is poor, particularly in CD.

GI symptoms arising in the absence of inflammation, which are reported to affect up to 40% of patients with IBD, may lead to uncertainty in disease activity assessment when based on patient-reported symptoms alone. Moreover, the presence of somatoform behaviour, which is independently associated with the reporting of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)-type symptoms, may complicate this situation. Therefore reliance on symptom reporting alone could result in overinvestigation and overtreatment of patients, leading to significant financial implications, a potential for adverse events, and diminishing beneficial returns in terms of disease outcome, while neglecting asymptomatic patients with ongoing occult inflammatory activity.

Faecal biomarkers of intestinal inflammation, including faecal calprotectin (FC), provide a quantifiable, noninvasive and relatively inexpensive measure of mucosal inflammation. Their use is advocated in the differentiation of organic and functional diseaseand, more recently, has been recommended for the monitoring of disease activity in IBD. – When compared with endoscopic disease activity assessment in IBD, FC outperforms both clinical disease activity assessment and serum markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), and has a sensitivity and specificity for the identification of active inflammation at endoscopy of 93.5% and 79.2%, respectively.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of irritable bowel syndrome [^113T3Wtr]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome — exclusion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in suspected IBS with diarrhea uses serologic and fecal inflammatory markers. We suggest that either fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin and C-reactive protein be checked in patients without alarm features and with suspected IBS and diarrhea symptoms to rule out inflammatory bowel disease. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are most commonly used to exclude IBD in IBS-D but are nonspecific; a comprehensive meta-analysis of serologic markers in 2,145 subjects found that a CRP ≤ 0.5 mg/dL yielded a low probability of IBD with good accuracy. At all cutoffs for fecal calprotectin (fCal), the negative predictive value as a screening tool is superior to CRP and ESR; a meta-analysis comparing fCal with endoscopy showed sensitivity 93% (CI 85%–97%) and specificity 96% (79%–99%). Fecal lactoferrin (FL) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay shows sensitivity 67%–86%, specificity 96%–100%, positive predictive value 92%–100%, and negative predictive value 80%–87% for active IBD vs IBS. The pretest probability of IBD is reported to be 0.5%–1.2%, and in the absence of alarm symptoms the prevalence of IBD in IBS is low; however, after 5 years of symptoms, the incidence is 2.6–5 times higher than in controls.

### Discriminating IBD from IBS: comparison of the test performance of fecal markers, blood leukocytes, CRP, and IBD antibodies [^112rgZot]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can overlap. We aimed to determine the accuracy of fecal markers, C-reactive protein (CRP), blood leukocytes, and antibody panels for discriminating IBD from IBS and to define a "best test".

Methods

We prospectively included 64 patients with IBD (36 Crohn's disease [CD], 28 ulcerative colitis [UC]), 30 with IBS, and 42 healthy controls. Besides CRP and blood leukocytes, blinded fecal samples were measured for calprotectin (PhiCal Test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]), lactoferrin (IBD-SCAN, ELISA), Hexagon-OBTI (immunochromatographic test for detection of human hemoglobin), and LEUKO-TEST (lactoferrin latex-agglutination test). Blinded serum samples were measured for the antibodies ASCA (ELISA) and pANCA (immunofluorescence).

Results

Overall accuracy of tests for discriminating IBD from IBS: IBD-SCAN 90%, PhiCal Test 89%, LEUKO-TEST 78%, Hexagon-OBTI 74%, CRP 73%, blood leukocytes 63%, CD antibodies (ASCA+/pANCA- or ASCA+/pANCA+) 55%, UC antibodies (pANCA+/ASCA-) 49%. ASCA and pANCA had an accuracy of 78% for detecting CD and 75% for detecting UC, respectively. The overall accuracy of IBD-SCAN and PhiCal Test combined with ASCA/pANCA for discriminating IBD from IBS was 92% and 91%, respectively.

Conclusions

The PhiCal Test and IBD-SCAN are highly accurate for discriminating IBD from IBS. There is only marginal additional diagnostic accuracy when the PhiCal Test and IBD-SCAN are combined with ASCA and pANCA. ASCA and pANCA have a high specificity for IBD.

### Faecal markers of gastrointestinal inflammation [^114jLUxo]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2012). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain, bloating and diarrhoea are a relatively common reason for consulting a physician. They may be due to inflammatory bowel disease (inflammatory bowel disease; Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate colitis), malignancy (colorectal cancer), infectious colitis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Differentiation between these involves the use of clinical, radiological, endoscopic and serological techniques, which are invasive or involve exposure to radiation. Serological markers include C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and antibodies (perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody and anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibody). Faecal markers that can aid in distinguishing inflammatory disorders from non-inflammatory conditions are non-invasive and generally acceptable to the patient. As IBS accounts for up to 50% of cases presenting to the GI clinic and is a diagnosis of exclusion (Rome III criteria), any test that can reliably distinguish IBS from organic disease could speed diagnosis and reduce endoscopy waiting times. Faecal calprotectin, lactoferrin, M2-PK and S100A12 will be reviewed.

### Genome-wide DNA methylation identifies potential disease-specific biomarkers and pathophysiologic mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease [^112tXVzU]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

There is currently no reliable diagnostic test for either IBS bowel habit subtypes with acceptable test characteristics that are needed for widespread clinical use. Available commercial blood tests (for IBS‐D) lack the diagnostic accuracy needed to discriminate IBS from organic GI disorders, including IBD. A noninvasive blood test to diagnose IBS, IBD, and CeD would be of significant value in clinical practice. When validated and refined using additional studies, our blood‐based DNA methylation test's diagnostic potential could be improved by developing algorithms utilizing other noninvasive tests that aid in distinguishing gut inflammation and CeD (e.g. fecal calprotectin, C‐reactive protein [CRP], and celiac serologies).

This study has limitations. Although machine learning is a powerful tool that learns latent patterns in the data to make predictions, it is susceptible to overfitting by learning patterns that arise from known or unknown confounding variables. To avoid overfitting, we nested the hyperparameter optimization using double cross‐validation or nested cross‐validation (Figure S2). Since this method involves testing on a dataset that was independent of the training dataset, it provides almost unbiased estimates of the true errors. Only one suitable external genome‐wide methylation dataset comparing blood samples in patients with IBD and HC was found. Although the performance accuracy of our model was slightly better on the internal dataset compared to the external data, it is known that external validations generally do not perform as well as the development model. In addition, there were several methodological differences between the external IBD and our IBD datasets which may have affected the performance. For example, we used EPIC array versus the 450K used in the external data, which contains only about half the number of probes compared to the EPIC array. While the external data were on whole blood samples which include all white blood cells, and platelets, we analyzed PBMCs that include only a subset of white blood cells, that is, lymphocytes and monocytes.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^116shaUm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Concluding remarks

A large number of studies have explored the role of innate immune response dysfunction in the pathophysiology of IBS and the potential implication of low-grade inflammation in both systemic circulation and intestinal mucosa. There is some evidence to support a predominantly inflammatory process occurring locally, in the intestinal mucosa, and perhaps systemically. However, many of the studies, which have focused on certain cell types, cytokines or pathogen recognition receptors, have yielded conflicting results. Hence, the underlining mechanisms are still unclear and the specific role of immune cells and mediators is elusive. To better understand the complex IBS pathogenesis, specific immune response pathways should be investigated and understood in depth in well-designed experimental or translational studies. Interactions between gut microbiota, immune activation and dysfunction of the enteric nervous system need to be more clearly delineated, to reach a convincing hypothesis regarding the pathophysiologic mechanism of IBS. Further comprehension of these factors could broaden therapeutic possibilities and ameliorate the burden of the disease.

### Clinical utility of fecal calprotectin: potential applications beyond inflammatory bowel disease for the primary care physician [^111J4tUH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an inflammatory marker released mainly from gastrointestinal granulocytes measured in stool samples. FC is noninvasive, economical, simple, and acceptable for patients. Levels of FC have proven reliable for intestinal inflammation, with good clinical sensitivity, and are useful in screening and monitoring inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as in the differential diagnosis between IBD and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Given its advantages, FC represents an attractive biomarker that could be utilized in various gastrointestinal (GI) diseases apart from IBD, and is currently being studied extensively by many research groups with significant amounts of data emerging. In this current review we aim to provide an outline of the utility of FC in distinguishing between IBS and IBD, as well as an up-to-date summary of the available clinical experience concerning FC in various common conditions of the GI tract commonly encountered by gastroenterology practitioners, such as IBS, microscopic colitis, acute gastroenteritis, Clostridium difficile infection, colorectal cancer, diverticular disease, coeliac disease, and other GI conditions.

### Clinical performance of a novel LIAISON fecal calprotectin assay for differentiation of inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome [^115M3W1W]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fecal calprotectin provides a noninvasive approach for objectively measuring intestinal inflammation, and is increasingly utilized in clinical practice to differentiate organic from functional gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The calprotectin protein is a heterocomplex composed of the calcium and zinc-binding proteins S100A8 and S100A9. It constitutes > 60% of total protein in the cytosol of neutrophils, which infiltrate the intestinal mucosa as part of the inflammatory response in intestinal inflammation, such as in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As a consequence of inflamed, hyperpermeable gut mucosal leakage of activated neutrophils into the feces, measurement of stool samples for calprotectin has shown promise for discriminating patients with IBD from those with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).–

Although the currently used serological markers C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are reasonable indicators of the presence and severity of systemic inflammation, they are not specific for intestinal inflammatory disease and in many instances do not reflect intestinal mucosal inflammation. Other methods for assessing inflammation, such as radiology and endoscopy, are invasive, expensive and time-intensive. Clinical disease (activity) scores are hindered as a result of compiling a number of subjective component inaccuracies and do not discriminate between symptoms of IBS. Thus, noninvasive assessments, such as fecal calprotectin, are needed to evaluate for bowel inflammation. S100 proteins are remarkably resistant to degradation by fecal bacteria, making them suitable markers for gut wall inflammation.

The main forms of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Both are chronic inflammatory disorders characterized by a relapsing-remitting clinical behavior, and they are grouped based on the location of the inflammation: in CD, the inflammation can be in any part of the intestine, while in UC, the inflammation is limited to the colon. The course of IBD is unpredictable and is associated with decreased quality of life, especially during relapses when treatment must be intensified. However, IBS is common in IBD, and the chronic nature of the disease requires a continuous reassessment of symptom activity to distinguish noninflammatory symptoms from true disease to adapt a therapeutic strategy enabling the maintenance of remission. Noninvasive, reliable tools are needed to support this important, yet erstwhile onerous, evaluation of disease activity.

### Serotonin, inflammation, and IBS: fitting the jigsaw together? [^1149QZEy]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Unexplained diarrhoea is a frequent indication for gastroenterologic referral, and after full investigation the most common final diagnosis is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Some patients with IBS describe an acute onset of symptoms following infective gastroenteritis. Postinfective IBS affects 7% to 31% of individuals infected, and appears to be a nonspecific response to injury which has been reported following Salmonella-, Campylobacter-, and Shigella-related IBS. The strongest risk factor for developing postinfective IBS is severity of the initial diarrhoea illness, but toxigenicity of the infected bacteria, age < 60 years, and female sex also are important risk factors. Adverse life events, hypochondriasis, and depression are also important, as is increased enteroendocrine cell and lymphocyte numbers in rectal biopsies. Postinfective IBS and IBS with diarrhoea without an infectious onset both show increased postprandial release of serotonin, whilst constipated patients show a depressed release. Several studies suggest impairment of the serotonin transporter in IBS, which in animal studies has been shown to occur following a range of inflammatory insults. Clinical conditions with an inflammatory basis, such as coeliac and Crohn disease, also are characterised by excess postprandial serotonin release. Several studies report evidence of low-grade inflammation in IBS with diarrhoea. However, reliable markers of low-grade inflammation that may predict response to serotonin antagonists or other anti-inflammatory agents remain a goal for future research.

Fecal inflammatory markers — diagnostic thresholds and accuracy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Use of a higher fecal calprotectin threshold value "(100–164 μg/g) is associated with a markedly decreased sensitivity without a marked increase in specificity". For fecal lactoferrin, "using a threshold value from 7.25 μg/g, the pooled sensitivity for IBD was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73–0.84) and the pooled specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63–0.99)". The evidence base for lactoferrin was judged low quality due to "risk of bias, significant heterogeneity, and statistical imprecision", and concerns are "compounded by the small likelihood that a positive test would initiate further confirmatory evaluation… compared to the 10% likelihood that persons without IBD might be needlessly exposed to further confirmatory testing".

### A role for inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome? [^116GpjLN]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Attention has been directed to the putative role of low grade mucosal inflammation in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) on the basis of evidence showing that some patients with IBS have an increased number of inflammatory cells in the colonic and ileal mucosa. Previous episodes of infectious enteritis, genetic factors, undiagnosed food allergies, and changes in bacterial microflora may all play a role in promoting and perpetuating this low grade inflammatory process. Human and animal studies support the concept that inflammation may perturb gastrointestinal reflexes and activate the visceral sensory system even when the inflammatory response is minimal and confined to the mucosa. Thus abnormal neuroimmune interactions may contribute to the altered gastrointestinal physiology and hypersensitivity that underlies IBS. A brief review of the human and animal studies that have focused on the putative role of intestinal inflammation and infections in the pathogenesis of IBS is given.

### Pathogenesis of IBS: role of inflammation, immunity and neuroimmune interactions [^1118ZF6A]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Medium credibility.

IBS is one of the most common functional gastrointestinal disorders worldwide and is thought to be the result of disturbed neural function along the brain-gut axis. The mechanisms behind this disturbance are not clear, but important roles for low-grade inflammation and immunological alterations in the development of symptoms compatible with IBS have become evident. The development of long-standing gastrointestinal symptoms after infectious gastroenteritis and patients with IBD in remission frequently having functional gastrointestinal symptoms support this hypothesis. An increased innate immune activity in the intestinal mucosa and in blood is found in subpopulations of patients with IBS. Mast cells and monocytes seem to be particularly important. In addition, studies have demonstrated that IBS may be associated with an activated adaptive immune response. Increased epithelial barrier permeability and an abnormal gut flora might lead to increased activation of the intestinal immune system. Functional and anatomical evidence for abnormal neuroimmune interactions has been found in patients with IBS. The link between immune alterations and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms and the positive effect of anti-inflammatory treatments in IBS further highlight the relevance of neuroimmune interactions in this condition.

5.4.7 Summary of recommendations for operative optimisation

In elective surgery IBD patients should have their physical condition assessed and optimised prior to surgery. This should include assessment of comorbidities; imaging or endoscopy to document disease extent; drainage of abscesses and treatment of sepsis; assessment and correction of nutritional deficiencies; and stopping corticosteroids and biologics where possible. All IBD patients undergoing surgery should follow an enhanced recovery (ERAS) protocol. A checklist is shown in box 10.

5.5 Faecal calprotectin

5.5.1 Faecal calprotectin in the differential diagnosis of IBD versus IBS

Statement 111. We recommend that, for patients aged 16–40 presenting in primary care with chronic diarrhoea and symptoms that may be consistent with either IBD or IBS, faecal calprotectin is a useful screening tool with a high negative predictive value. If significantly elevated, patients should have an infective cause excluded and be referred for further investigation (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.9%).

Faecal calprotectin is a sensitive and specific marker of intestinal inflammation and is a useful non-invasive method to investigate patients with chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in low-risk groups for malignancy, when infection and coeliac disease have been excluded as the cause and symptoms are suspected to be either due to IBD or IBS (figure 6). A normal level has a very high negative predictive value for IBD. By contrast, the positive predictive value of levels above the assay reference level (normal defined as < 50 µg/g stool) is low, and it is recommended that a higher threshold is used to trigger colonoscopy, which improves the positive predictive value with little reduction in the negative predictive value. Due to the variety of calprotectin assays in commercial use, the exact cut-off prompting colonoscopy should be determined locally, but it is generally between 100 and 250 µg/g stool and should be monitored to ensure appropriate specificity and sensitivity. Used in this way, faecal calprotectin can be used as a cost-effective measureto prevent unnecessary colonoscopy in those where IBD is extremely unlikely.

### Postinfectious functional gastrointestinal disorders [^115S7EwM]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Functional gastrointestinal disorders are associated with low health-related quality of life and high resource utilization. Postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder defined as the acute onset of new IBS symptoms in an individual who has not previously met the Rome criteria for IBS, immediately after an acute illness characterized by 2 or more of the following: fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or a positive bacterial stool culture. Although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in PI-IBS are currently unknown, it is believed that a transitory inflammation leads to subtle but permanent changes in the structure and function of the digestive system that induce symptoms. This review considers recent evidence surrounding the role of inflammatory mediators in the development of hypersensitivity, along with the mediators and mechanisms of abdominal pain and discomfort once the acute inflammation has cleared. Recent data suggest that anatomic changes to mast cells-nerve fibers are necessary, but not sufficient to induce symptoms. It is now possible to estimate the risk of developing PI-FGID based on the presence and relative severity of different risk factors, including prolonged duration of initial illness, toxicity of infecting bacterial strain, smoking, mucosal markers of inflammation, female sex, depression, hypochondriasis, and adverse life events in the preceding 3 months.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) — diagnostic accuracy and pretest probability impact: Across 15 studies evaluating serum CRP for detecting moderate to severe endoscopic inflammation, reported single-cutoff performance spanned 1.2–73 mg/L with summary sensitivity 63% (95% CI, 50%–75%) and specificity 77% (95% CI, 67%–84%). In a low pretest probability setting (rectal bleeding score 0 and stool frequency score 0 or 1, 15% prevalence), using elevated CRP (generally > 5 mg/L) yields approximately 5.5% false negatives with normal CRP (< 5 mg/L) and false positives of 19.5%. In an intermediate pretest probability setting (e.g., stool frequency score 2 or 3, 50% prevalence), elevated CRP (> 5 mg/L) has false positives of 11.5%.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^116KnDnR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder associated with abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. The presence of IBS greatly impairs patients' quality of life and imposes a high economic burden on the community; thus, there is intense pressure to reveal its elusive pathogenesis. Many etiological mechanisms have been implicated, but the pathophysiology of the syndrome remains unclear. As a result, novel drug development has been slow and no pharmacological intervention is universally accepted. A growing evidence implicates the role of low-grade inflammation and innate immune system dysfunction, although contradictory results have frequently been presented. Mast cells (MC), eosinophils and other key immune cells together with their mediators seem to play an important role, at least in subgroups of IBS patients. Cytokine imbalance in the systematic circulation and in the intestinal mucosa may also characterize IBS presentation. Toll-like receptors and their emerging role in pathogen recognition have also been highlighted recently, as dysregulation has been reported to occur in patients with IBS. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the involvement of any immunological alteration in the development of IBS. There is substantial evidence to support innate immune system dysfunction in several IBS phenotypes, but additional studies are required to better clarify the underlying pathogenetic pathways. IBS heterogeneity could potentially be attributed to multiple causes that lead to different disease phenotypes, thus explaining the variability found between study results.

### Epidemiology of irritable bowel syndrome in hospitalized patients with inflammatory bowel disease: nationwide inpatient sample analysis from 2007–2016 [^113Q36Hm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), is characterized by inflammation or ulceration in the intestinal tract from the activation of the mucosal immune system. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), on the other hand, is a functional gut disorder with an altered gut-brain axis causing recurrent abdominal pain and changing bowel habits. Despite the fact that they are separate disease entities, there is evidence that these 2 conditions frequently overlap. From 25–46% of IBD patients in remission suffer from IBS-like symptoms, a higher prevalence compared to the general population without IBD.

The association between IBS and IBD has been extensively investigated for decades, but the etiology of IBS-type symptoms in patients with IBD is a source of ongoing research. Some have suggested that IBS and IBD represent a spectrum of disease, and that IBS could represent subclinical inflammation and a prodrome of IBD; evidence to support this includes inflammation with elevated colonic mucosal inflammatory cell infiltrate, and mucosal tumor necrosis factor-a mRNA protein expression in patients with IBS symptoms. Others have argued that chronic inflammation from IBD may progress to IBS-like symptoms by changing the enteric nervous system and intestinal wall, which consequently leads to alteration of motility and visceral hypersensitivity. Yet another argument considers IBS and IBD to be unrelated entities, given the poor correlation between IBD disease activity and IBS-like symptoms.

### Fecal lactoferrin in discriminating inflammatory bowel disease from irritable bowel syndrome: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^111GwXuH]. BMC Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

FL assays may detect mucosal inflammatory activity at a level insufficient to cause increases in erythrocyte sendimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). FL levels are apparently unaffected by a variety of non-intestinal conditions that elevate markers of systemic inflammation. Lactoferrin is highly stable in feces for up to 7 days at room temperature, enabling patients to conveniently collect samples at home and transport them to distant hospitals or laboratories. Moreover, quantitative FL levels can be easily and reliably measured by commercially available enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay kits that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. FL concentrations have been found to correlate well with endoscopic and histological activity. Moreover, FL measurements can be used to evaluate responses to anti TNF-α treatment or to predict relapse in IBD patients. Studies have sought to evaluate the accuracy of FL in the diagnosis of organic (versus functional) intestinal diseases, mainly to discriminate IBD from non inflammatory conditions, especially IBS. Few studies to date have directly compared the diagnostic performance of fecal lactoferrin and Cal tests, with some reporting that both are similar in their ability to detect intestinal inflammation, while others found that Cal or FL is more accurate diagnostically. LF seems to be more stable at room temperature and therefore may be preferred if long delays are expected before analysis. Age-related variability seems to be less pronounced with lactoferrin and therefore may be preferable in pediatric patients. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of FL in differentiating between IBD and IBS.

### Elevated fecal biomarkers of colo-rectal epithelial cell activity in irritable bowel syndrome [^111oQNee]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

The measurement in feces of a panel of biomarkers reflecting inflammatory and epithelial cell activities is important for understanding the underlying pathophysiology of IBS.
The absence of signs of involvement of neutrophils and eosinophils in IBS suggests that increased activity of intestinal epithelial cells rather than inflammation is a major determinant of the disease.
The negative correlation between the novel biomarker human phospholipase BII‐precursor (HPLBII‐P) and bloating and the presence of this biomarker in intestinal epithelial cells suggest a physiological role of HPLBII‐P in intestinal activities.

### Measurement of faecal calprotectin and lactoferrin in inflammatory bowel disease [^1153AAfx]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

What cautions and limitations are there of using faecal biomarkers?

It is important to remember that despite all of this promising data, faecal biomarker quantification as a screening test for IBD cannot fully replace conventional endoscopy and radiology. IBD remains a histological diagnosis requiring intestinal biopsies, so a positive calprotectin or lactoferrin will require further tests not only to confirm or refute a diagnosis of IBD, but also to exclude other causes of raised biomarkers including malignancy, polyps, viral or bacterial gastroenteritis, NSAID enteropathy, untreated coeliac disease or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Therefore the use of faecal biomarkers should be restricted to situations where the result along with clinical judgement informs a decision about treatment, allows avoidance of invasive tests, or where invasive tests have not provided a satisfactory conclusion — for example, a normal colonoscopy but clinical suspicion of small bowel inflammation.

It is also necessary to appreciate that inflammation is only one component of IBD and it is only with regard to this that faecal biomarkers are of clinical use. Symptomatic patients with IBD who have normal biomarkers should not simply be labelled as having IBS without further consideration. Patients may have symptoms due to non-inflammatory mechanical disease such as bile salt malabsorption, fibrotic strictures or adhesions and these are likely to be best treated by identifying the correct problem and giving specific treatment.

Furthermore, symptoms remain the most powerful mediators of patient behaviour and decision making. As such the greatest challenge to incorporating faecal biomarkers into management pathways may be when there is disparity between how a patient feels and what faecal biomarkers inform us regarding their current inflammatory activity. For instance, it may be very difficult trying to encourage a patient with no symptoms and a positive faecal biomarker that they should begin powerful immunosuppressant treatment that poses risk of side effect.

### Faecal biomarker patterns in patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome [^113X5B69]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Abdominal symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are highly prevalent and impose substantial burdens on sufferers and the healthcare system in general. A positive diagnosis can be made using Rome Foundation criteria for IBS, but such clinical criteria do not offer guidance on management of any individual patient's condition, leading to continued use of invasive and costly diagnostic imaging techniques that produce meaningful results in only a small fraction of cases.

Current evidence indicates that symptoms associated with IBS, including those contributing to a positive diagnosis by Rome III and other clinical criteria, frequently arise from a number of independent, and often treatable, conditions. The actual frequency of the presence of such underlying causes of IBS symptoms, however, remains unknown.

In the present study, therefore, we attempted to characterise the frequency and distribution of results for seven faecal biomarkers capable of suggesting underlying conditions that could be responsible for producing symptoms in accordance with those diagnostic criteria, in a group of subjects with chronic abdominal pain meeting current Rome III IBS criteria.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^117F5SEM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disorder associated with abdominal pain and alterations in bowel habits. The presence of IBS greatly impairs patients' quality of life and imposes a high economic burden on the community; thus, there is intense pressure to reveal its elusive pathogenesis. Many etiological mechanisms have been implicated, but the pathophysiology of the syndrome remains unclear. As a result, novel drug development has been slow and no pharmacological intervention is universally accepted. A growing evidence implicates the role of low-grade inflammation and innate immune system dysfunction, although contradictory results have frequently been presented. Mast cells (MC), eosinophils and other key immune cells together with their mediators seem to play an important role, at least in subgroups of IBS patients. Cytokine imbalance in the systematic circulation and in the intestinal mucosa may also characterize IBS presentation. Toll-like receptors and their emerging role in pathogen recognition have also been highlighted recently, as dysregulation has been reported to occur in patients with IBS. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the involvement of any immunological alteration in the development of IBS. There is substantial evidence to support innate immune system dysfunction in several IBS phenotypes, but additional studies are required to better clarify the underlying pathogenetic pathways. IBS heterogeneity could potentially be attributed to multiple causes that lead to different disease phenotypes, thus explaining the variability found between study results.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation in adults: a scoping review [^1118ZhBh]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Laboratory tests and imaging tests

There were 51.9% CPGs recommend basic laboratory tests for IBS-C/FC patients. But the recommended tests were varied between CPGs. A FC CPG suggested only a complete blood cell count is necessary in patients who do not have other symptoms and signs, while a IBS CPG suggested a limited number of tests (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, coeliac disease serology, fecal calprotectin and fecal hemoglobin, fasting glucose, thyroid stimulating hormone, calcium levels and ionogram) can be considered in IBS-C patients to rule out metabolic and endocrinologic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hypercalcemia and hypokalemia. But there were 14.3% IBS-C CPGs and 11.1% FC CPGs recommend against routine laboratory tests for the diagnosis of IBS-C/FC. Only one IBS-C CPG recommended ultrasonography to assess intestinal and gallbladder motility patterns and measure segmental contraction frequency in the sigmoid colon. Additionally, one FC CPG recommended imaging tests to rule out organic disorders. 28.6% IBS-C CPGs and one FC CPGs recommended against the routine use of imaging tests.

Assessments for motility

84.6% FC/IBS-C & FC CPGs and 14.3% IBS CPGs recommended colonic transit time tests to diagnose normal transit constipation (NTC) or slow transit constipation (STC). One CPG recommended colonic manometry and gastro-jejunal manometry in STC patients to aid in diagnosing underlying myopathy or neuropathy and guiding decisions on conservative versus surgical treatment. Assessments for the colonic transit time included radiographic studies with radiopaque makers, colonic scintigraphy, indium-marked capsule or wireless motility capsule.

Assessment for anorectal function

Anorectal tests were recommended by 42.9% IBS-C CPGs and 76.9% FC/IBS-C & FC CPGs to diagnose the defecatory disorder (DD). The tests included digital anorectal examination, defecography, anorectal manometry and balloon expulsion tests.

Assessment for small intestinal bacteria overgrowth (SIBO)

Three IBS-C CPGs recommended against the hydrogen/methane breath tests to exclude SIBO because of limited supportive evidence, one IBS-C CPG from India recommended using methane breath tests to exclude SIBO in IBS-C patients. None of FC CPG mentioned the methane breath test.

### Irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders [^111TCdph]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome is one of several highly prevalent functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) displaying symptoms of gastrointestinal dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity. Substantial overlap of symptoms and comorbidities occur not only between irritable bowel syndrome and other FGID but also with gastrointestinal disorders that are not related to motility (eg, celiac disease and lactose intolerance) and to somatic conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome). Pathogenic mechanisms common among FGIDs may include alternations in intestinal and colonic microflora. Evidence is also emerging of an interplay between gut immune cells/activity and alternations in motility, secretion, and sensation. The role of cytokine activity and inflammation is important in this regard. As recommended by Rome III, diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. The high prevalence of coexisting conditions suggests the need to routinely assess patients for related disorders. Treatment should be based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance.

### Elevated fecal biomarkers of colo-rectal epithelial cell activity in irritable bowel syndrome [^113AG3LP]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

Fecal concentrations of calprotectin and MPO did not differ between IBS patients and healthy subjects. These proteins reflect neutrophil granulocyte activity, and the results therefore further strengthens that neutrophils are not involved in the pathophysiology of IBS thus being compatible with most other reports. Further, the lack of neutrophil involvement in IBS was supported by the low concentrations of the neutrophil specific dimeric variant of HNL, and the western blotting of the fecal extracts showed mainly HNL in the form of the monomeric protein. Normal turnover or increased activity of neutrophils is characterized by the presence of dimeric HNL as demonstrated by its predominant presence in plasma from healthy subjects and from those with bacterial infections. An additional finding was the absence of the heterodimeric form of HNL. This form has been shown to be the result of the complex formation between HNL and MMP9, an enzyme originating from inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and monocytes. Thus, the lack of this complex is a further support of the absence of neutrophil activity in the colorectal part of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with IBS.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^117RbC6F]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Innate immune activation

Low-grade inflammation in IBS patients can be assessed by alterations in the immune cell populations and mediators. The role of MC, monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer (NK) cells and eosinophils has been evaluated. Cytokine production and activity has been investigated in numerous studies, along with other proinflammatory mediators. Earlier studies mainly focused on systemic immune activation through the role of immune cells and their mediators in serum and plasma of IBS patients. More recent studies have also examined mucosal samples as a more accurate indicator of immune activity and have identified mucosal infiltration of immunocytes and elevated proinflammatory cytokines levels in IBS patients. Results from biopsy samples might provide a better understanding of the relevant mechanisms in IBS pathophysiology and help identify potential disease indicators.

The potential relationship between innate immune dysregulation in IBS patients and perceived symptoms has also been explored. In a recent study, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-17 serum levels were correlated with discomfort and severity of symptoms in IBS patients. Nevertheless, measurement of cytokine levels in the serum and intestinal mucosa in another study with 144 IBS patients and 42 healthy controls provided no correlation between the overall symptom severity and the cytokine expression, although IL-6 and IL-8 levels were slightly increased in the IBS group. Several studies imply this imperceptible link between low-grade immune activity and IBS symptoms, raising the hope of future therapeutic possibilities for IBS patients. So far, anti-inflammatory therapies have proven unsuccessful in IBS patients, but better selected subgroups might indeed benefit from these type of treatments.

### Enhancing diagnostic performance of symptom-based criteria for irritable bowel syndrome by additional history and limited diagnostic evaluation [^115qEgwD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Symptom-based criteria to diagnose irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) positively perform only modestly. Our aim was to assess whether including other items from the clinical history and limited diagnostic evaluation improves their performance.

Methods

We collected complete symptom, colonoscopy, and histology data from 318 consecutive, unselected adult patients with lower gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in secondary care. All participants underwent colonoscopy, with relevant organic findings recorded. The reference standard used to define the presence of true IBS was patient-reported lower abdominal pain or discomfort associated with a change in bowel habit, in the absence of organic GI disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs), with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated for Rome III criteria, as well as for modifications, incorporating nocturnal stools, results of simple blood tests (hemoglobin and C-reactive protein (CRP)), measures of somatization, and/or affective disorders (hospital anxiety or depression scale (HADS) score).

Results

The sensitivity and specificity of the Rome III criteria for identifying IBS was 69.6%, and 82.0%, respectively, with positive and negative LRs of 3.87 and 0.37, respectively. Clinically useful enhancements in positive LRs were provided by combining Rome III criteria with: (a) high level of somatization (7.27); (b) normal hemoglobin and CRP with HADS score of ≥ 8 (5.04); (c) normal hemoglobin and CRP with a high level of somatization (7.56); or (d) no nocturnal passage of stool with a high level of somatization (17.3). Specificity was ≥ 95% with each of these modifications.

Conclusions

Incorporating nocturnal stools, somatization, and affective disorders from the clinical history, and hemoglobin and CRP measurements, enhances the positive LR and specificity of symptom-based Rome III criteria for IBS.

### Intestinal infection and irritable bowel syndrome [^113c3mxc]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The observation that the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in some patients might follow an episode of acute gastroenteritis came from epidemiological studies. Both retrospective and prospective studies suggest that between 4% and 26% of patients develop IBS for the first time after gastroenteritis. The diagnosis of post-infectious IBS is typically made from the history. In addition, as with the diagnosis of IBS more generally, it is important to exclude other clinical causes for persistent bowel dysfunction. There is little, if any, evidence to support the widely-held view that patients with post-infectious IBS carry a better prognosis than IBS patients more generally. The management of patients with post-infectious IBS is the standard approach that might be applied to all patients with IBS. Post-infectious IBS patients may differ from IBS patients in general in having a low-level of intestinal inflammation. Work in animal models, and detection of low-grade inflammation in intestinal biopsies combined with markers of intestinal inflammation such as faecal calprotectin all indicate a strong possibility that persisting inflammation after the acute infection may be important in the pathogenesis of post-infectious IBS.

### Elevated fecal biomarkers of colo-rectal epithelial cell activity in irritable bowel syndrome [^112dLq2S]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Medium credibility.

In a previous trial, we found that IBS was characterized by signs of low grade rectal inflammation expressed by increased levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and human neutrophil lipocalin (HNL) when measured by the Mucosal Patch Technology (MPT), a technology considered to be a promising method to define IBS patients with an immune activation as a central pathogenetic mechanism. A drawback when using the MPT, a measure based on mucosal fluids absorbed from the rectum, can be that it mainly reflects immune activity in a very limited part of the gut. This was exemplified by another of our studies that indicated that the MPT test does not reflect what is going on in more proximal parts of the intestine. In analogy with current practice in inflammatory bowel disease, biomarkers of immune activity measured in feces comes with a better chance to define biomarkers representing a larger part of the intestine.

Thus, the hypothesis that motivated us to perform a post hoc analysis in a subset of IBS patients that participated in our intervention trial with mesalazine and placebo, was that fecal analysis of proteins will reflect more widespread colorectal immune activity and epithelial cell activity with differences comparing patients with IBS and healthy subjects. The aims of the current study were to compare a selected number of fecal markers in IBS and healthy subjects, compare the same fecal markers before and after treatment with mesalazine and placebo in IBS patients, assess their relevance for IBS symptoms, and finally correlate levels of fecal markers with each other to assess associations and possible common origins.

Clinical trials and decision-making — because the Crohn's Disease Activity Index may be as high in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as in IBD and the SONIC trial showed no difference between treatment arms when inclusion was based on Crohn's Disease Activity Index alone without objective inflammation, objective activity assessment is required for trials and therapeutic choices should not rely solely on symptoms: measurement of increased clinical and objective activity "is a prerequisite for inclusion in clinical trials", and "no therapeutic decision should be taken based on clinical consideration alone".

### Irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a real association or reflection of occult inflammation? [^111NQVCv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

Do gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in apparent remission reflect the coexistence of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or subclinical inflammation? The aims of this study were as follows: (i) to prospectively determine the prevalence of IBS symptoms in IBD patients in remission; and (ii) to determine whether IBS symptoms correlate with levels of fecal calprotectin.

Methods

Remission was defined by physician assessment: Crohn's disease (CD) activity index ≤ 150 and ulcerative colitis disease activity index ≤ 3, and serum C-reactive protein < 10, while off corticosteroids or biologics. Quality of life (QOL) (by inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire), the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HAD), and fecal calprotectin were measured.

Results

Rome II criteria for IBS were fulfilled in 37/62 (59.7%) of CD patients and by 17/44 (38.6%) of those with ulcerative colitis (UC). However, fecal calprotectin was significantly elevated above the upper limit of normal in both IBD patient groups, indicating the presence of occult inflammation. Furthermore, calprotectin levels were significantly higher in CD and UC patients with criteria for IBS than in those without IBS-type symptoms. QOL scores were lower and HAD scores higher among UC patients with IBS symptoms in comparison to those who did not have IBS symptoms.

Conclusions

IBS-like symptoms are common in patients with IBD who are thought to be in clinical remission, but abnormal calprotectin levels suggest that the mechanism in most cases is likely to be occult inflammation rather than coexistent IBS.

Fecal calprotectin and fecal lactoferrin — screening for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in adults with chronic diarrhea is addressed as follows: In patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests the use of either fecal calprotectin or fecal lactoferrin to screen for IBD (Conditional recommendation; low-quality evidence). A threshold value of 50 μg/g for fecal calprotectin is recommended to optimize sensitivity for IBD, and threshold values in the range of 4.0–7.25 μg/g for fecal lactoferrin are recommended to optimize sensitivity. For fecal calprotectin using a threshold of 50 μg/g, the pooled sensitivity for IBD was 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.75–0.86) and the pooled specificity was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78–0.92).

### Rational investigations in irritable bowel syndrome [^112Xe64P]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder which accounts for a substantial proportion of a gastroenterologist's time in the outpatient clinic. However, there is variability in approaches to diagnosis and investigation between physicians, dependent on expertise. Many patients express disappointment over the lack of a patient-centred approach. Consequently, there have been calls for the care of patients with IBS to be standardised, a process which aims to promote high-quality and high-value care. Making an early diagnosis, based on a clinical assessment of symptoms, while limiting use of investigations, are key tenets of this process. Exhaustive investigation to exclude all organic pathology is unnecessary, and may be counterproductive. Routine blood tests in suspected IBS have low yield, but are an acceptable part of routine practice. All patients should have coeliac serology tested, regardless of their predominant stool form. Patients with diarrhoea should have a faecal calprotectin measured, and should proceed to colonoscopy to exclude inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) if this is positive. Beyond this, the need for investigations should be made on a case-by-case basis, contingent on the reporting of known risk factors for organic pathology. Colonoscopy should be considered in any patient with alarm features for colorectal cancer, and in those whose clinical features are suggestive of microscopic colitis. A 23-seleno-25-homotaurocholic acid (SeHCAT) scan should be considered in patients with IBS-D, a third of whom may actually have bile acid diarrhoea. There is no role for routine hydrogen breath tests for lactose malabsorption or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

4 Cancer or inflammation

4.1 Stool tests

The Bristol stool chart (see online s upplementary material), which is validated, is a good tool to determine stool consistency and guide subsequent investigations. Stool weights are no longer used or recommended due their limited clinical value.

4.1.1 Faecal calprotectin

The inflammatory marker faecal calprotectin has recently been shown to be of value and the subject of a NICE Diagnostic Guideline (DG11). Calprotectin is released when inflammatory processes occur due to the degranulation of neutrophil granulocytes. When the inflammation is within the intestinal tract, calprotectin is released into the intestinal lumen and is stable enough to be measured in faeces. NICE recommends the use of faecal calprotectin as an option in the differential diagnosis of IBS and IBD in adults with recent onset lower GI symptoms in whom cancer is not suspected. Thus patients with low calprotectin levels are unlikely to have any active inflammatory processes at the time of sample collection, making a diagnosis of IBD less likely.NICE uses the commonly quoted 50 μg/g faeces as the decision level above which IBD is more likely, although other causes of raised calprotectin include colorectal cancer, infectious gastroenteritis and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This strategy should lead to a reduced level of secondary care referrals with associated lower cost and morbidity. There is some evidence that calprotectin levels > 250 μg/g faeces suggest active inflammation correlating quite well with endoscopic inflammation. The issue of indeterminate levels still remains elusive, although one study that looked at the 12-month outcome of indeterminate faecal calprotectin levels (50–249 μg/g faeces) noted an 8% chance of developing IBD compared with 1% in those with levels < 50 μg/g faeces. For further details see online s upplementary material.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^114uthv3]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Neutrophils

Neutrophils are phagocytic cells of the immune system and migrate to the gastrointestinal mucosa when activated during inflammation. In rectal biopsies of children with IBS, no difference in neutrophil numbers was evident compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, in a study of 49 IBS-D patients from Sri Lanka, neutrophil counts were similar to those of controls in biopsies from the ileum, cecum, colon, and rectum. Similar results were derived from multiple cecum, colon and rectum biopsies of IBS Rome I & II patients in two other studies. Conversely, in another study a subgroup of IBS patients reported elevated numbers of neutrophils in mucosal biopsies of the colon. Inflammatory mediators of neutrophils, such as myeloperoxidase, human neutrophil lipocalin and lactoferrin, have been measured in stool but results are inconclusive as only one study showed increased myeloperoxidase levels. Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin was measured in blood and urine samples with no significant difference between 41 Rome III IBS patients and 82 controls. Finally, fecal lactoferrin, calprotectin and human β-defensin-2 (HBD-2) were measured in stool specimens of 46 IBS patients and 24 controls. While no difference was evident for lactoferrin and calprotectin, HBD-2 was elevated in the IBS group. HBD-2 has antimicrobial potential and is usually elevated in patients with IBD; it thus provides a further indication of the presence of intestinal inflammation in IBS.

Dendritic cells (DCs)

Another cell type that has not been thoroughly investigated for its potential involvement in inflammation is DC. Like neutrophils, DCs are phagocytic cells with a key role in both innate and adaptive immunity and promote inflammatory responses to pathogens. Animal studies have highlighted the role of DCs in IBS pathogenesis through induced visceral hypersensitivity and MC activation and prolonged intestinal activation. In addition, DCs may secrete corticotropin-releasing factor that can induce alterations in intestinal motility and visceral hypersensitivity. Two studies with mouse DCs and human peripheral blood monocyte-derived DCs presented increased levels of corticotropin-releasing factor after stimulation by some commensal bacterial strains. In a Scandinavian study, 10 patients with self-reported food hypersensitivity were recruited and 9 of them tested positive for IBS according to the Rome II criteria. Although DC blood counts were not significantly different from those of the 10 healthy controls, when monocyte-derived DCs from patients were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), they produced more IL-10 compared with controls.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effect of a probiotic mixture on symptoms and inflammatory markers in women with diarrhea-predominant IBS [^117FsqQp]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Micro-inflammation is considered an element in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). High-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) was previously shown to be higher in IBS compared to healthy controls, albeit within the normal range. Since probiotics may suppress micro-inflammation in the gut, we tested if they reduce symptoms and inflammatory markers (hs-CRP and fecal calprotectin (FC) in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and laboratory effects of BIO-25, a multispecies probiotic, in women with IBS-D.

Methods

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a 2-week run-in, eligible women were assigned at random to a probiotic capsule or an indistinguishable placebo, twice daily for 8 weeks. IBS symptoms and stool consistency were rated daily by Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) and the Bristol Stool Scale (BSS). High-sensitivity C reactive protein was tested at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. FC was tested at baseline and 8 weeks.

Key Results

One hundred and seventy-two IBS-D patients were recruited and 107 eligible patients were allocated to the intervention (n = 54) or placebo (n = 53) group. All symptoms improved in both groups with no significant difference between them in symptom improvement, hs-CRP or FC levels.

Conclusions & Inferences

An 8-week treatment with BIO-25 improved symptoms in women with IBS-D, but was not superior to placebo. This rigorously designed and executed study supports the findings of other studies that did not demonstrate superiority of probiotics over placebo in IBS. High quality clinical studies are necessary to examine the efficacy of other specific probiotics in IBS-D patients since data are still conflicting.

### Current insights into the innate immune system dysfunction in irritable bowel syndrome [^1161gdhb]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

MC and their mediators

MC are long-lived granulated cells that circulate in the blood and are also found in tissues; they can release tryptase, histamine and chymase as a result of their activation. The involvement of MC in the pathogenesis of IBS is attributed to their mediators, which can alter enteric nerve and motor function. MC counts and density vary among different studies and among different segments of the intestine, though the majority of studies report greater numbers and volume in IBS patients compared with healthy controls (Table 1).

Table 1
Mast cell counts in studies with at least 50 participants (IBS and controls)

Indications for the role of MC in IBS pathogenesis were firstly considered when elevated number of MC were reported in mucosal biopsies of the terminal ileum and then confirmed in several studies, mainly in patients with IBS-D or PI-IBS. Interestingly, one study with 50 predominantly female IBS patients (Rome III criteria) reported no differences in MC numbers between controls and all IBS patients, independently of bowel habit subtype. Furthermore, a recent assessment of 66 Rome II IBS patients and 20 controls found that the former group had lower numbers of MC in biopsies of the descending colon. In addition, a Spanish group found similar MC numbers in jejunal biopsies in 49 Rome III IBS-D patients compared with controls. Nevertheless, the MC density was higher in IBS patients and the proximity of MC to plasma cells was significantly lower in the jejunal mucosa.

### Gastrointestinal hypoalgesia in inflammatory bowel disease [^114w8Spm]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Additionally, when comparing active and inactive IBD cohorts reporting little to no pain, we found that several inflammatory markers (including WBC, platelet count, ESR and CRP) may be elevated in hypoalgesic IBD, supporting the findings of previous studies. However, a quarter or more of these patients will demonstrate normal inflammatory markers, demonstrating the potential limitation of this type of testing. Interestingly, when we compared the presence of EIMs between these cohorts, we found a potential trend but no significant difference in their incidence, suggesting that these clinical features may not be particularly sensitive for screening hypoalgesic IBD. Finally, when comparing the presence of other major gastrointestinal symptoms between these cohorts, there were no significant differences. Clearly endoscopy, radiological testing, laboratory testing and patient symptom history are critically important aspects of monitoring IBD disease activity. They all have limitations, however, in regard to cost, time, and/or efficacy. Our study highlights some of these potential deficiencies and reinforces the need to develop alternative approaches for identifying individuals at risk for this condition. To this end, our group has identified a genetic marker that could help risk-stratify patients for hypoalgesic IBD. However, further investigation is required in this regard to clarify the potential utility of this approach for screening out hypoalgesic IBD patients.

### Comparison of laboratory characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms and nongastrointestinal symptoms in patients infected with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ruhUc]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Facing the huge threat of COVID-19 to human health, more attention should be paid to laboratory evaluation and early prediction of patient's conditions. As the studies of COVID-19 with GI symptoms gradually increases, the characteristics of laboratory examination results of COVID-19 with GI symptoms were reported, but the discrepancies were observed between these reports in different countries. In this study, we systematically compare the differences in laboratory tests between COVID-19 patients with GI symptoms and non-GI symptoms. We found that ALT was increased in patients in the GI group. ALT and AST are used to monitor liver function. ALT is mainly distributed in the liver and monitors hepatocellular status; AST is mainly present in hepatocytes' mitochondria and reflects mitochondrial problems. In our meta-analysis of 14 studies, the ALT was increased in patients with GI symptoms. It showed that the liver was injured by SARS-CoV2. Besides, while there was a trend toward an increase in TBil, statistical significance was not achieved. Currently, the mechanism between liver injury and COVID-19 infection was mostly speculative. As in SARS and MERS, the primary functional receptor in coronavirus is ACE2. Studies indicated that ACE2 was expressed in multiple tissues or organs, such as the type 2 alveolar cells of the lungs, cholangiocytes of the liver, intestinal enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract. So these tissues and organs can be damaged, which may cause changes in the corresponding laboratory indices. Also, patients with GI symptoms tended to have decreased WBC, lymphocytes, and elevated CRP, although this was not statistically significant. Interestingly, the laboratory indicators of WBC, lymphocytes count, and CRP were inconsistent between patient from China and United States. The patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms show decreased WBC, lymphocytes count, and CRP in the United States. However, the patients with COVID-19 with GI symptoms show increased WBC and CRP, decreased lymphocyte counts in China. This discordance in findings may be due to differences in different races and the small size of prior studies.

### Intestinal microbiota and diet in IBS: causes, consequences, or epiphenomena? [^112RnXfR]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Dysregulated intestinal immune function, chronic low-grade mucosal inflammation, and increased mucosal permeability and barrier dysfunction have all been suggested as putative pathogenic mechanisms in IBS, in which the intestinal microbiota might have a role (reviewed in). Moreover, the bidirectional interactions between the intestines and the central nervous system, which have an important role in the pathogenesis of IBS, have suggested to be modulated by the microbiota (reviewed in). Yet, there is a lack of data on the exact mechanisms through which the host-microbiota interactions underlie pathophysiology and generate symptoms. Identifying these mechanisms is further complicated by the fact that the majority of GI microbes remain uncharacterized. Indeed, most putative microbial markers of IBS are among uncultured bacteria. For example, uncultured bacteria related to Ruminococcus torques are significantly enriched in IBS patients in several cohorts, and their abundance positively correlates with bowel symptoms. It is intriguing that this bacterial group has been shown to be suppressed following a multispecies probiotic treatment that alleviated IBS symptoms. Similarly, uncultured bacteria within the Clostridiales order are reproducibly detected in significantly depleted abundance in IBS but also in ulcerative colitis. Focus on the function of these uncultured bacteria should be of major interest for future studies.

### Randomised controlled trial of mesalazine in IBS [^115MF9YC]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

IBS is the most common functional GI disorder in which abdominal pain and/or discomfort is associated with changes in bowel habit, and with features of disordered defecation. IBS affects 10–20% of the population and causes a marked reduction of quality of life in affected individuals. IBS is a heterogeneous disorder involving a combination of negative life experiences and trauma, particularly early in life, genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Patients with IBS show dysfunction in the brain–gut axis, including anxiety, depression, gut dysmotility and visceral hypersensitivity. The relative importance of central versus peripheral mechanism in the IBS pathophysiology remains poorly defined. Mounting evidence is showing microscopic and molecular abnormalities in large subsets of patients with IBS. The most compelling evidence linking inflammation to IBS is the demonstration of the development of IBS in 3.7–36.8% of subjects following acute infectious gastroenteritis. Mucosal and systemic immune activation have also been widely documented in patients with IBS in the absence of a previous major gastroenteritis event. Mucosal inflammation is linked to increased mucosal permeability, enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia and higher tissue availability of serotonin, a key factor involved in the control of gut sensorimotor functions. Another key finding linking inflammation to IBS pathophysiology and symptom generation is the observation that adoptive transfer of mucosal biopsy supernatants evoked activation of sensory pain pathwaysand abnormal enteric nervous system responses in recipient rodents. Interestingly, these responses were reduced to a large extent by antagonism of immune-related factors including proteases and histamine. The origin of low-grade inflammation in patients with IBS remains undetermined, but it is likely to be multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, stress, atopy, abnormal intestinal microbiotaand higher mucosal permeability increasing antigenic exposure of the mucosa to luminal antigens.

RESULTS

Patients and HCs

The material included 13 patients with inactive UC, 15 patients with IBS-M, and 15 HCs (Table 1). All UC patients were in clinical and endoscopic remission (Full Mayo score ≤ 2). At the day of endoscopy, UC patients graded the presence of abdominal pain for the previous day, (none, mild, moderate, or severe). Four patients reported mild abdominal pain, and 1 reported moderate abdominal pain. All IBS patients were classified in the IBS-M subgroup and had moderate-severe symptoms with median symptom severity score (SSS)of 343 (range 167–462), and none of the patients related the onset of their symptoms to infectious gastroenteritis. Measurements of plasma-C-reactive protein (p-CRP) showed that all UC patients had p-CRP < 10 mg/mL (median 2.1, range 0.2–7.1) when biopsies were achieved. Analyses showed that biopsy location (rectum/rectosigmoidal junction/sigmoideum) had no significant impact on any of the results.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for irritable bowel syndrome, more specifically with respect to dietary modifications, AGA 2022 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support the use of biomarkers to predict response to diet interventions in patients with IBS.

### Faecal biomarker patterns in patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome [^115WwB3q]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine rates of faecal biomarker results capable of suggesting potentially treatable causes of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptomatology in a population of patients with symptoms of IBS who meet Rome III criteria for that condition.

Design

Descriptive, retrospective study in which faecal biomarker results (dichotomised into 'normal' and 'abnormal' values) were related to data from patient-completed questionnaire data identifying demographics, Rome III criteria for IBS and IBS phenotype (IBS-D, IBS-C, IBS-M and IBS-U).

Setting

Commercial reference laboratory.

Patients

Individuals whose physicians ordered faecal biomarker testing for evaluation of chronic abdominal symptoms consistent with IBS.

Interventions

None.

Main outcome measures

Rates of occurrence of abnormal results on any of seven faecal biomarkers suggesting a treatable cause for IBS symptoms.

Results

Abdominal symptoms meeting Rome III criteria for IBS were present in 3553 records (the population), which were subjected to further analysis. Abnormal biomarker results (the outcomes) occurred in 94% of cases; 73% and 65% of records indicated growth of a bacterial potential pathogen and low growth of beneficial organisms, respectively. Abnormal results for all other faecal biomarkers occurred with frequencies from 5% to 13%. Frequency of abnormal results for elastase, calprotectin, eosinophil protein X, and beneficial organisms rose significantly with age, and differed significantly across IBS phenotypes.

Conclusions

A large proportion of patients manifesting symptoms meeting Rome III IBS diagnostic criteria have faecal biomarker results indicating potential underlying, treatable causes of their symptoms. Faecal biomarker testing is an appropriate means of identifying potentially treatable causes of IBS symptoms.

### Management… [^113JR1bd]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS While no specific dietary advice has been shown in trials to be efficacious, many authors advocate having patients limit alcohol, caffeine, sorbitol, and fat intake. 6 Lactose should be eliminated only in those with proven lactase deficiency. If a patient believes a particular dietary substance is exacerbating the symptoms, then a trial of eliminating that substance is warranted. However, in general, there is no association between IBS and food intolerance. PAIN-PREDOMINANT IBS Jailwala and colleagues 18 recently published a systematic review of randomized controlled trials of pharmacotherapy for IBS, in which 28 high-quality trials reporting outcomes of global improvement or IBS-specific symptom improvement were identified. Trials using bulking agents, smooth-muscle relaxants, pro-kinetic agents, loperamide, and psychotropic agents were included. 15, 22 Pain in IBS may also be mediated by opioid receptors such as mu, kappa, and delta. Several drugs that act at these receptors are under investigation. Psychologic treatments also may be of benefit in the management of IBS, particularly in those who have associated psychiatric diagnoses or difficulty coping. A recent study comparing the addition of multicomponent behavior therapy with medical treatment alone showed that the combination was significantly better at reducing IBS symptoms based on data recorded in daily symptom diaries. 25 The combination group also had improved overall well-being. A partial description of the components of the multicomponent behavior therapy treatment is outlined in Table 5.

25 While these components or a method of incorporating them may not be completely available to the primary care physician, the techniques employed may help the patient manage this illness. 15 As such, the bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, may be a useful second-line agent for diarrhea-predominant IBS. 26 In patients in whom a preceding or lingering infection is thought to be partly responsible for diarrhea-predominant symptoms, a course of empiric antibiotics or anti-giardial therapy may be warranted.

### Evidence-and consensus-based practice guidelines for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome… [^11281igk]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Using the 4 significant symptoms, subjects having less than 2 symptoms had a positive predictive value for IBS of 12%. If 2 or more symptoms were present, the positive predictive value was 74%. Finally, if 2 or more symptoms were present with all 6 symptoms included, the positive predictive value was 63%. Groups have continued to determine sensitivity and specificity data for 2 of 4 and 2 or 3 of 6 symptoms. The diagnostic ability of the Manning criteria also depended on the control group used. All but 1 study compared the ability to distinguish IBS from organic gastrointestinal disease. 15 However, interpretation of the validation studies is problematic since many of the control group patients experienced or had upper GI symptoms rather than the organic lower GI disorders from which IBS more generally needs to be distinguished.

The Manning criteria fared better when used to distinguish patients with IBS from healthy controls 15, 19 than when used to distinguish IBS from organic GI disease. 7, 15–17, 19, 20. Kruis and colleagues10 used a point system whereby functional symptoms received positive values and "red flag" symptoms received negative values. Based on this point system, using a score of 44 or greater, to identify IBS, the sensitivity was reported as 64% and the specificity as 99%.
10. The Manning and Rome criteria have gained much attention. However, the Kruis score10 has not been as widely adopted, possibly because of the inclusion of red flag symptoms as part of the scoring algorithm.

Red flag symptoms are quite common in subjects with IBS, and, based on the present review, blood in the stool may be seen in up to 31% of IBS subjects, with no objective cause identified on subsequent evaluation. 15 Blood in the stool alone could represent hemorrhoidal bleeding in IBS patients, yet, in the Kruis score, this would incur a penalty of 98 points — enough to fail to meet the criteria for IBS. This may explain the relatively low sensitivity and high specificity of the Kruis score. Frigerio and colleagues22 adjusted the score to exclude a diagnosis of organic digestive disease in patients with 44 or more points. Still, their modification was unable to significantly improve the sensitivity of the criteria.
