## Question

By what mechanism does plasmaphoresis help in hypertriglyceridemia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how therapeutic plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) lowers triglyceride levels in hypertriglyceridemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of hypertriglyceridemia and why it precipitates pancreatitis. Then, I should verify what plasmapheresis does mechanistically to lipoproteins. Next, I'll quantify the acute triglyceride-lowering effect and its time course. After that, I need to consider the clinical consequences and why the benefit is transient. Finally, I should review guideline positions and comparative data to clarify when, if at all, plasmapheresis changes outcomes or serves as a bridge to definitive therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and mechanism of injury. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is commonly defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL, with pancreatitis risk rising substantially at levels ≥ 1000 mg/dL as chylomicrons and VLDL accumulate; pancreatic lipase then hydrolyzes these triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, generating unbound free fatty acids that are directly cytotoxic to acinar cells and amplify local and systemic inflammation [^116TRXB8] [^1157skLv].

> Now, I need to check exactly what therapeutic plasma exchange does. TPE removes a large volume of a patient's plasma (often 1.5–2.0 plasma volumes) and replaces it with albumin, saline, or donor plasma, thereby physically discarding the circulating pool of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins along with other plasma constituents; this is a mechanical, extracorporeal debulking of chylomicrons and VLDL rather than a metabolic modulation per se [^1146zDYB] [^114QpzEP].

> I will now examine the magnitude of lipid removal to ensure we're quantifying the effect correctly. In an intensive exchange series, each procedure removed approximately 83 g of lipid and lowered serum triglycerides by about 60–85% per session, with the percent drop tracking closely with the pre-exchange level; this gives us a realistic expectation of the acute biochemical impact in practice [^1146zDYB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical impact without linking mechanism to symptoms. By rapidly clearing chylomicrons and VLDL, TPE reduces the substrate available for pancreatic lipase, curtailing further generation of toxic free fatty acids and blunting pancreatic injury; in case series, cutaneous xanthomata and hepatomegaly regressed within one or two exchanges and extremely high triglyceride levels fell toward safer ranges within hours, consistent with the expected pathophysiology [^1146zDYB] [^1157skLv].

> But wait, I should verify how durable this effect is. Because the underlying overproduction of VLDL or impaired lipolysis persists, triglycerides typically rebound toward baseline within roughly a week after a single exchange — sometimes faster after larger volume exchanges — so repeated TPE or, more commonly, rapid initiation of chronic therapies (very low–fat diet, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, glycemic control/insulin where indicated) is necessary to maintain triglyceride reduction and mitigate recurrence risk [^1146zDYB] [^113F3W92] [^113ND9fZ].

> Next, I should review potential additional benefits beyond triglyceride removal. Let me consider whether relevant mediators are cleared. Although apoC-II did not significantly fall in the intensive series, TPE can remove other soluble factors that regulate triglyceride synthesis/clearance as well as inflammatory mediators and cytokines, which may contribute to short-term clinical improvement even if it is not disease-modifying in the long term [^1146zDYB] [^113F3W92].

> Hmm, wait a minute — does rapid biochemical improvement translate into better outcomes, or am I overattributing benefit? At first glance, one might expect faster triglyceride decline to improve mortality or organ failure, but guideline panels advise against routine plasmapheresis as first-line therapy in triglyceride-induced pancreatitis because available data show quicker triglyceride normalization without clear improvement in hard outcomes; TPE is generally reserved for severe, refractory, or complicated presentations where rapid debulking is prioritized despite the lack of proven outcome benefit [^1135mzbs] [^112E3WQh] [^113F3W92].

> I should double-check comparative strategies so I don't overstate TPE's role. Meta-analyses and comparative cohorts suggest insulin-based approaches and TPE achieve broadly similar triglyceride reductions with no consistent safety or outcome advantage for TPE, while conservative care alone (NPO and fluids, with insulin for hyperglycemia) often produces a 24–48 hour triglyceride decline on the order of 45–70%; importantly, the Endocrine Society advises against routine insulin infusion for triglyceride-induced pancreatitis in patients who do not have diabetes, so glycemic context matters when selecting therapy [^113T4DiD] [^1146zDYB] [^114iYFPt] [^116oHKwx].

> Let me reconsider where this leaves us clinically. The primary, evidence-aligned role for plasmapheresis in hypertriglyceridemia is as a temporizing, mechanical debulking strategy to rapidly lower triglycerides and remove proinflammatory plasma constituents when disease is severe or refractory and immediate triglyceride reduction is prioritized, while definitive risk reduction depends on addressing secondary causes, instituting strict dietary fat restriction, and initiating pharmacologic therapy such as fibrates and prescription omega-3 fatty acids to sustain triglyceride control and prevent recurrence [^113F3W92] [^113Ef1s8] [^113ND9fZ].

> In summary, and I need to ensure this synthesis is precise: plasmapheresis helps by physically eliminating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the circulation, producing a rapid (roughly 60–85% per session) but transient drop in serum triglycerides that reduces the substrate for pancreatic lipase, lowers the generation of cytotoxic free fatty acids, and may remove inflammatory mediators; because the metabolic defect persists, triglycerides rebound within days, so TPE functions as a short-term bridge while durable, guideline-directed therapies and lifestyle measures take effect [^1146zDYB] [^113F3W92] [^1157skLv] [^113ND9fZ].

Plasmapheresis rapidly lowers triglycerides by **removing chylomicrons** [^114qEuhx] and VLDL [^1146zDYB] from plasma, achieving a **60–80% reduction** within hours [^1146zDYB]. This rapid clearance can reduce pancreatitis risk and hyperviscosity symptoms [^112YvTeo], but **clinical outcomes are uncertain** [^113F3W92] and rebound is common without ongoing therapy [^1146zDYB] [^1146zDYB]. Per guidelines, plasmapheresis is **not first-line** [^112E3WQh] and is reserved for severe hypertriglyceridemia with pancreatitis or hyperviscosity when standard care fails.

---

## Mechanism of action

Plasmapheresis **removes chylomicrons** [^114qEuhx] and VLDL — the main triglyceride carriers — from plasma [^1146zDYB]. This extracorporeal clearance produces a rapid, large reduction in triglycerides, typically 60–80% after one session [^11347sFB].

---

## Clinical indications

Plasmapheresis is considered for severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly when complications are present [^112E3WQh]. Indications include **acute pancreatitis**, in which rapid triglyceride lowering may reduce pancreatic injury and complications; hyperviscosity syndrome, in which reducing triglyceride–induced viscosity provides immediate symptom relief [^112YvTeo]; and refractory hypertriglyceridemia when standard therapies fail or are contraindicated.

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Plasmapheresis achieves rapid triglyceride lowering, but **clinical outcomes are uncertain**:

- **Triglyceride reduction**: 60–80% within hours [^11182Ppa] [^114qEuhx] [^1146zDYB].
- **Pancreatitis outcomes**: No consistent reduction in mortality or complications versus conservative care [^113F3W92] [^114iYFPt] [^116XfkKf].
- **Rebound**: Triglycerides often rise within days without ongoing therapy [^1146zDYB] [^117Nz4Mo].

---

## Risks and limitations

Plasmapheresis has important **limitations**:

- **Invasiveness**: Requires central venous access and specialized equipment [^117Nz4Mo].
- **Complications**: Risk of bleeding, infection, hypotension, and allergic reactions [^112iaJDP] [^117LjWto].
- **Cost and availability**: High cost and limited access to specialized centers [^114tUGRa].
- **Rebound**: Triglycerides often rise quickly without maintenance therapy [^1146zDYB] [^117Nz4Mo].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Plasmapheresis is not first-line; **guidelines recommend** starting with lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy [^112E3WQh]:

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, weight loss, and alcohol avoidance are foundational [^116TRXB8] [^115yBtXB].
- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Fibrates [^113Ef1s8], omega-3 fatty acids [^113ND9fZ], and statins [^1178237d] are first-line.
- **Insulin therapy**: Used in hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis, especially with diabetes [^116oHKwx] [^112iaJDP].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines advise against routine plasmapheresis as first-line therapy. The **Endocrine Society 2020** [^112E3WQh] recommends against using acute plasmapheresis as first-line in triglyceride-induced pancreatitis [^1135mzbs], and the **AACE 2025** emphasizes lifestyle and pharmacologic therapy, reserving plasmapheresis for refractory cases.

### Intensive, long-term plasma exchange therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia in acquired generalized lipoatrophy [^1146zDYB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2002). Low credibility.

We report dramatic improvement in clinical and laboratory parameters after intensive plasma exchange therapy in a 15-year-old girl with acquired generalized lipoatrophy and refractory hypertriglyceridemia. One hundred and twenty-five procedures were performed over 720 days. Two or three plasma volumes were exchanged per procedure, using peripheral venous access and albumin as the replacement solution. Regression of painful cutaneous xanthomata and reduction in massive hepatomegaly were noted within the first two procedures. Triglyceride levels started at 109 mmol/liter (9670 mg/dl) and decreased acutely by 60–85% per procedure. Lipid removal averaged 83 g per procedure and was highly correlated with pre-exchange lipid levels. Lipid levels rebounded to baseline values within 7 days after exchange and appeared to rebound more rapidly after larger exchanges. Maximum benefit was achieved with weekly 1.5- to 2.0-volume exchanges. No significant decrease in apolipoprotein CII levels was detected after plasma exchange regardless of the volume of exchange; however, other plasma factors regulating triglyceride synthesis or clearance may have been removed during the procedures. Plasma exchange was well tolerated, without clinical, immunological, or hormonal deterioration. These data indicate that intensive plasma exchange therapy over a protracted time may produce sustained benefit in patients with severe, symptomatic hypertriglyceridemia refractory to standard medical therapy.

### Therapeutic plasmapheresis for hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis: Case series and review of the literature [^114qEuhx]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is the third leading cause of acute pancreatitis (AP) in the United States. The standard of care includes the management of HTG using pharmacological therapy. More recently, plasmapheresis has been proposed as a therapeutic tool for decreasing triglyceride (TG) levels, especially in critically ill patients. Few studies are available to ascertain the overall benefits of plasmapheresis over traditional management.

To analyze the outcomes of patients treated with plasmapheresis for severe HTG-associated pancreatitis, we conducted a retrospective chart review of three patients with severe HTG-associated (TGs greater than 1000 mg/dl; 11.29 mmol/l) AP at the Methodist University Hospital. All the patients underwent plasmapheresis as part of their treatment.

The average TG level before plasmapheresis was 3532 mg/dl (range: 2524–4562 mg/dl; 39.9 mmol/l; range: 28.5–51.6 mmol/l). All patients made a full recovery, with a significant improvement in TG levels after plasmapheresis. The mean number of sessions was 1.3 (range 1–2), and mean TG level after plasmapheresis was 1051 mg/dl (range: 509–1771 mg/dl; 11.9 mmol/l; range: 5.8–20 mmol/l). After the first session, the average reduction of TG levels was 2481 mg/dl (range 753–3750 mg/dl; 28 mmol/l; range: 8.5–42.4 mmol/l), or approximately 70%. None of the patients developed complications related to plasmapheresis.

Plasmapheresis can be an effective and rapid treatment option in patients with severe HTG and complications. However, further research is needed to substantiate these findings.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange decreases serum triglyceride level rapidly and reduces early recurrence rate but no advantages in improving outcomes for patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis: a retrospective propensity score matching analysis based on twenty year's experience [^113F3W92]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

- **Outcomes in different groups when use of lipid lowering agent was included as covariate**: Considering the use of a lipid-lowering agent as concomitant treatment may impact outcomes, we conducted a propensity score matching with more covariates. TG level, age, sex, BMI, Atlanta severity, and use of fenofibrate within 5 days of onset were set as covariates. Only with the caliper set to 0.004 could we generate 72 cases in pairs with 33 in the n-TPE and 39 in the TPE groups. We found a higher percentage of TG reaching the target level in the TPE group in 2 days (0.09% vs. 68.75%, p = 0.046). When comparing those treated concomitantly with or without fenofibrate, patients in the TPE group had a higher percentage reach the target TG level, indicating that the higher TG decline rate mainly resulted from the effect of TPE rather than from the use of fenofibrates. Besides, we found no difference in CTSI improvement or local complications in the matched cohort between groups, inferring there is no advantage of TPE in improving outcomes even when the use of fenofibrate is included as a covariate in the propensity score matching.

### Systematic review of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia [^114tUGRa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment intervals were not stratified by FH type and were generally consistent between countries. The majority of studies (n = 13, 68.4%) reported intervals of ≤ 2 weeks: four articles reported weekly LDL‐C apheresis, four articles reported treatment every 1 to 2 weeks, and five articles reported a 2‐week interval. Of the studies that reported an interval > 2 weeks, the majority reported a 3‐ to 4‐week interval, and one observational study reported a treatment interval of 8 weeks.

Background lipid‐reducing therapy reported to be administered concomitantly with apheresis included statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin), fibrates (gemfibrozil, bezafibrate, and fenofibrate), ezetimibe, and probucol. Background therapies were not stratified by FH type.

The literature suggests that certain treatment barriers may exist, including the invasiveness and duration of the procedure (ranging from 2 to > 3 hours), patient burden and quality of life, and cost/resource utilization. Three articles emphasized the disparity between the presumed number of patients who may benefit from LDL‐C apheresis and the number of apheresis centers, suggesting that apheresis may be unavailable for patients in need.

- **Apheresis LDL‐C reduction efficacy**: Acute LDL‐C reduction percentages are presented. Reductions were consistent across studies: nine (64%) reported reductions between 60% and 79%, four (29%) reported reductions between 50% and 59%, and one (7%)…

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the management of hypertriglyceridemia: A science advisory from the American Heart Association [^113ND9fZ]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides 200–499 mg/dL) is relatively common in the United States, whereas more severe triglyceride elevations (very high triglycerides, ≥ 500 mg/dL) are far less frequently observed. Both conditions are becoming increasingly prevalent in the United States and elsewhere, likely driven in large part by growing rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus.

In a 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement, the omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs) eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were recommended at a dose of 2–4 g/d for reducing triglycerides in patients with elevated triglycerides. Since 2002, prescription agents containing EPA+DHA or EPA alone have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating very high triglycerides; these agents are also widely used for hypertriglyceridemia.

The purpose of this advisory is to summarize the lipid and lipoprotein effects resulting from pharmacological doses of n-3 FAs (> 3 g/d total EPA+DHA) based on new scientific data and availability of n-3 FA agents. In treatment of very high triglycerides with 4 g/d, EPA+DHA agents reduce triglycerides by ≥ 30% with concurrent increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas EPA-only did not raise low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in very high triglycerides.

When used to treat hypertriglyceridemia, n-3 FAs with EPA+DHA or with EPA-only appear roughly comparable for triglyceride lowering and do not increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin.

### Severe acute hypertriglyceridemia during acute lymphoblastic leukemia induction successfully treated with plasmapheresis [^112qJ37c]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) treated with asparaginase and corticosteroids are at risk of developing severe lipid abnormalities. The authors report the case of a 10-year-old male with extremely high plasma triglyceride concentrations (4,000 mg/dl) during the induction phase of ALL, associated with mild pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia was successfully managed with plasmapheresis, resulting in a decrease in triglyceride levels to 590 mg/dl. Apheresis appears to be safe and effective in reducing hypertriglyceridemia and preventing related complications.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112iaJDP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

The data used for this analysis came from Araz et al. (2022), Gubensek et al. (2022), and Jin et al. (2018). In assessing hypotension events, the total number of people included was 132, with 74 in the insulin ± heparin group and 58 in the plasmapheresis group. The number of hypotension events was 18 in the insulin ± heparin group versus 12 in the plasmapheresis group.

Figure 3 presents a forest plot comparing the risk of hypotension in the insulin and plasmapheresis groups. Blue squares and their corresponding lines represent the point estimates (PE) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study. Black diamonds indicate the pooled effect estimate.

- **Abbreviations**: SE, standard error; IV, inverse variance; CI, confidence interval; DF, degree of freedom; PE, point estimates.

A random-effects model was used, and the calculated relative risk (RR) was 1.13 (95% CI 0.46–2.81), with a P-value of 0.79. The included studies had low heterogeneity (P = 0.33, I² = 11%). The overall results indicated that plasmapheresis therapy is associated with fewer hypotension events in patients with hypertriglyceridemia compared to insulin ± heparin therapy.

For hypoglycemia, the data used in this analysis came from Gubensek et al. (2022) and Yu et al. (2020). In assessing this outcome, the total number of people included was 108, with 54 in the insulin ± heparin group and 54 in the plasmapheresis group. The number of hypoglycemia complications was 3 in the insulin ± heparin group versus 0 in the plasmapheresis group.

Figure 4 presents a forest plot comparing the risk of hypoglycemia in the insulin and plasmapheresis groups. Blue squares and their corresponding lines are the PE and 95% CIs for each study.

### Lipid apheresis in the management of severe hypertriglyceridaemia in an adolescent girl with global developmental delay [^114Us5zj]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

As paediatricians, we are often put in the position of adapting adult protocols for the care of children. We use our knowledge of paediatric physiology and the inherent constraints, then alter life-saving treatments accordingly. This is likely why four rounds of plasmapheresis were used in this case; underestimating the number of rounds at first, then repeating if successful but not detrimental, with the goal of lowering the triglyceride (TG) levels slowly and safely. In the absence of a clear paediatric guideline, this case is an illustrative example of this adaptive process. It also serves as the starting point for developing a paediatric standard of care as we face more lipid disorders. These problems, once only present in adult medicine, are now potentially catastrophic in the paediatric landscape. Future research on when to use plasmapheresis and appropriate dosing is needed as paediatricians encounter severe lipid disorders in children. This is a seismic shift in our world; thus, we need to be prepared as paediatric healthcare providers.

- **Learning points**: This case presents the rarely described triad of hyperglycaemia with ketosis, severe hypertriglyceridaemia, and severe acute pancreatitis. Aggressive therapy is required to save lives in severe cases. In the paediatric population, lipid apheresis is shown to be a safe and effective method to rapidly lower triglycerides in severe life-threatening hypertriglyceridaemia-induced acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) as an initial therapeutic manoeuvre, followed by the application of long-term lipid-lowering medications.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange decreases serum triglyceride level rapidly and reduces early recurrence rate but no advantages in improving outcomes for patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis: A retrospective propensity score matching analysis based on twenty year's experience [^11182Ppa]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The main purpose of our study is to investigate the TG decline rates. It has been reported that the 24-hour decline rate is about 71% if treated with TPE. Based on our observation, for those treated with conventional therapy, the 24-hour decline rate is about 65%. Assuming the power of 80%, SD = 20%, and α = 0.05, the minimum sample size is calculated to be 102 (using G-power). We included 230 cases in our study.

### Association between triglyceride lowering and reduction of cardiovascular risk across multiple lipid-lowering therapeutic classes: A systematic review and meta-regression analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112Ca6v9]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Randomized trials of therapies that primarily lowered triglycerides have not consistently shown reductions in cardiovascular events.

- **Methods**: We performed a systematic review and trial-level meta-regression analysis of three classes of lipid-lowering therapies that reduce triglycerides to a greater extent than they do low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C): fibrates, niacin, and marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids. Key inclusion criteria were a randomized controlled trial that reported major vascular events. We also incorporated data from a previous meta-regression of 25 statin trials. The main outcome measure was the risk ratio (RR) for major vascular events associated with absolute reductions in lipid parameters.

- **Results**: A total of 197,270 participants from 24 trials of nonstatin therapy with 25,218 major vascular events and 177,088 participants from 25 trials of statin therapy with 20,962 major vascular events were included, for a total of 374,358 patients and 46,180 major cardiovascular events. Starting with non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a surrogate for very-low-density lipoproteins and low-density lipoproteins, the RR per 1-mmol/L reduction in non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76–0.82; P < 0.0001; 0.78 per 40 mg/dL). In a multivariable meta-regression model that included terms for both LDL-C and triglyceride (surrogates for low-density lipoproteins and very-low-density lipoproteins, respectively), the RR was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85; P < 0.0001) per 1-mmol/L (0.79 per 40 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.75–0.94;

### Update about the management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hypertriglyceridemia in lower extremity peripheral artery disease patients: Consensus of the French Society of Vascular Medicine and the French Society for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery [^116Lp7hP]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). High credibility.

A French intersociety consensus on behalf of the Société Française de Médecine Vasculaire and the Société de Chirurgie Vasculaire et Endovasculaire was proposed in 2021 for the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (LEAD). Recent studies have been published, necessitating an update of this consensus regarding the management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Methods**: A steering committee of 12 vascular physicians and surgeons defined questions of interest about LDLc and hypertriglyceridemia management. A French expert panel voted on the proposals. Consensus was considered to have been achieved if more than 80% of the responses corresponded to either "Agreement" or "Disagreement".

- **Results**: Among the 56 experts who were asked to participate, 46 (82%) accepted. After the first round of the Delphi procedure, the four proposals reached consensus. The following suggestions and recommendations were approved:
	1. For LEAD patients treated with the highest tolerated statin dose ± ezetimibe who have an LDLc ≥ 0.70 g/L, it is recommended to add a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor.
	2. For LEAD patients treated with statins who have elevated triglyceride levels between ≥ 150 mg/dL and ≤ 500 mg/dL, it is suggested to add Icosapent Ethyl.
	3. Before adding Icosapent Ethyl in LEAD patients treated with statins, it is suggested to look for symptoms that may indicate atrial fibrillation.
	4. For LEAD patients treated with Icosapent Ethyl who have symptoms suggesting atrial fibrillation, it is recommended to perform further evaluation.

This structured consensus can guide the effective management of lipids in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date approach to treatment strategies.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1151WHhz]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Quality assessments were performed on the studies that satisfied the requirements for inclusion. The quality of every study was evaluated using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment instrument. The EPHPP has been recommended for the assessment of the quality of public health interventions, particularly those that use specific experimental designs. When compared to the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias, it has been noted that the EPHPP has greater inter-rater reliability.

- **Assessment criteria**: Selection bias, confounders, study design, participant blinding, data collection methods, and withdrawals and dropouts were the six assessment criteria of a study's methodological quality. These were scored as either weak, moderate, or strong to reach an overall quality rating, also graded as strong, moderate, or weak. We assigned an overall score of "weak" when there were two or more "weak" ratings, "moderate" for a single "weak" rating, and "strong" when no "weak" ratings were present.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses typically involve publications that are already available on the internet and contain de-identified patient data. Consequently, Institutional Review Board approval has been waived in accordance with international publication standards.

- **Data extraction**: Data from the studies that met the inclusion criteria were entered into a prepared Excel spreadsheet. The data extracted included the author's name, year of publication, and study region.

### Juxtapid [^113qKDVY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Juxtapid is a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor indicated as an adjunct to a low-fat diet and other lipid-lowering treatments, including LDL apheresis where available, to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), apolipoprotein B (apo B), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH).

- **Limitations of use**: The safety and effectiveness of Juxtapid have not been established in patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not have HoFH, including those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH). The effect of Juxtapid on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

Regarding the medical management of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly concerning the use of fibrates, the 2019 guidelines by AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend the consideration of initiating fibrates if necessary to prevent acute pancreatitis in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL; ≥ 5.7 mmol/L). This is especially pertinent when fasting triglycerides reach levels ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (≥ 11.3 mmol/L) if triglycerides remain persistently elevated or show an increasing trend after addressing other causes of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Management of hypertriglyceridemia [^115yBtXB]. BMJ (2020). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the most common lipid abnormalities encountered in clinical practice. Many monogenic disorders causing severe hypertriglyceridemia have been identified, but in most patients, triglyceride elevations result from a combination of multiple genetic variations with small effects and environmental factors. Common secondary causes include obesity, uncontrolled diabetes, alcohol misuse, and various commonly used drugs. Correcting these factors and optimizing lifestyle choices, including dietary modification, is important before starting drug treatment. The goal of drug treatment is to reduce the risk of pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease in those with moderate hypertriglyceridemia.

This review discusses the various genetic and acquired causes of hypertriglyceridemia, as well as management strategies. Evidence supporting the different drug and non-drug approaches to treating hypertriglyceridemia is examined, and an easy-to-adopt step-by-step management strategy is presented.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114QpzEP]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe disease that presents a significant challenge for physicians, especially gastroenterologists and surgeons. It has an incidence of 4.6 to 100 per 100,000 persons in Europe. In the United States, the hospitalization rate for AP increased from 65.4 to 81.9 per 100,000 persons between 2001 and 2014. AP has been shown to have a high incidence and was the fifth-ranked cause of in-hospital fatalities, as well as a significant contributor to hospitalization expenses. Hypertriglyceridemia ranks third among all known causes of AP, following excessive alcohol consumption and gallstone disease. Patients with noticeably elevated chylomicron levels often seek emergency care due to symptoms resembling AP, including persistent abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting. Those with triglyceride concentrations exceeding 500–1000 mg/dL face a significant risk of developing AP, while individuals experiencing hyperchylomicronemia syndrome exhibit triglyceride levels exceeding 2000 mg/dL.

Currently, the initial conservative approach for management involves pain control with opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. Insulin therapy has traditionally been the cornerstone of inpatient care and has been extensively studied. However, over the past few decades, plasmapheresis has emerged as an increasingly common therapeutic option for hyperlipidemic pancreatitis.

In AP patients with hypertriglyceridemia, insulin therapy — alone or with heparin — and plasmapheresis have been proposed and employed as potential treatment strategies in selected cases.

### Plasma exchange in the management of a case of hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis triggered by venlafaxine [^116W4FCe]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

The authors present a case of a young, non-diabetic Caucasian male patient with long-standing depression who had recently been started on venlafaxine. He presented to the emergency department with central abdominal pain, drowsiness, and vomiting, accompanied by a raised serum amylase. He was diagnosed with acute pancreatitis (AP), which was confirmed following an abdominal ultrasound and CT. His initial biochemistry was immeasurable in the first 12 hours of admission due to macroscopically visible hyperlipidaemia. In the absence of any other causes of AP, hyperlipidaemia was identified as the most likely aetiology.

He was transferred to the intensive care unit, where he underwent lipidic restriction, fluid resuscitation, and three consecutive days of plasma exchange. Plasma triglyceride levels were reduced from 42.9 to 2.4 mmol/l following plasma exchange. He made a full recovery and, at discharge, was investigated for familial hypertriglyceridaemia and referred to a multi-disciplinary team for follow-up. His venlafaxine was stopped on admission.

### Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^114CWiLv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

The aim was to develop clinical practice guidelines on hypertriglyceridemia.

- **Participants**: The Task Force included a chair selected by The Endocrine Society Clinical Guidelines Subcommittee (CGS), five additional experts in the field, and a methodologist. The authors received no corporate funding or remuneration.

- **Consensus process**: Consensus was guided by systematic reviews of evidence, email discussion, conference calls, and one in-person meeting. The guidelines were reviewed and approved sequentially by The Endocrine Society's CGS and Clinical Affairs Core Committee, members responding to a web posting, and The Endocrine Society Council. At each stage, the Task Force incorporated changes in response to written comments.

- **Conclusions**: The Task Force recommends that the diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia be based on fasting levels. Mild and moderate hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of 150–999 mg/dl) should be diagnosed to aid in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, while severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides of > 1000 mg/dl) should be considered a risk for pancreatitis. The Task Force also recommends that patients with hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia and that subjects with primary hypertriglyceridemia be evaluated for family history of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease. The treatment goal in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia should be a non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level in agreement with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

### Hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis: Perspectives from China [^1157skLv]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Controversy of blood purification therapy in hypertriglyceridemic acute pancreatitis**: Blood purification therapies, such as plasma exchange, are employed for severe hypertriglyceridemia (triglycerides > 20 to 50 mmol/l) to rapidly remove pathogenic substances like chylomicrons and FFAs. However, their efficacy remains contentious in both Chinese and international contexts. A multicenter prospective cohort study in China found no significant improvement in organ failure outcomes with plasma exchange, alongside a higher ICU admission rate, suggesting limited clinical benefit and increased resource demands that strain healthcare systems. In contrast, a study from Soochow University reported that combining LMWH, insulin, and plasma exchange enhanced triglyceride reduction and improved clinical scores, advocating for its use in select patients with extremely high triglyceride levels. Wang et al. found plasma exchange reduced triglycerides by 65% within 24 h but failed to shorten organ failure duration, aligning with US studies reporting a modest 20% triglyceride reduction without broader clinical impact, raising questions about its utility beyond triglyceride lowering.

This discrepancy fuels global debates over plasma exchange's cost-effectiveness, optimal timing, and patient selection, with China's mixed results calling for refined criteria, such as targeting patients with triglycerides higher than 50 mmol/l and early SIRS, to maximize benefits. International meta-analyses similarly question plasma exchange's routine application, urging further randomized controlled trials.

### Triglyceride-lowering therapies in hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis in China: a multicentre prospective cohort study [^111AZiTg]. BMC Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory process of the pancreas caused by various aetiologies, among which gallstones and alcohol abuse are the leading causes globally. Hypertriglyceridemia was reported as another common cause, accounting for 5.9% of cases in North America, according to a recent international cohort study. Of note, hypertriglyceridemia is often under-recognised as an aetiology in patients with acute pancreatitis when there are other etiological risk factors. In China, recent studies showed that hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis (HTG-AP) accounted for 14.3% to 23.9% of AP cases. Rapidly changing lifestyles and genetic variants might explain this phenomenon.

Previous studies showed that compared with other causes, patients with HTG-AP are more likely to have severe disease courses and to have an incidence of organ failure as high as more than 40%. However, in a recent study using data from an international registry, the results showed that HTG-AP patients had similar outcomes compared to other aetiologies, with 42% of the HTG-AP patients having moderately severe/severe AP. The severity of organ failure seems to depend partly on the intensity of the inflammatory response and partly on the injury caused by toxic fatty acids, a lipase-mediated decomposition product of triglycerides. In this regard, efforts have been made to reduce the triglyceride level to prevent or improve organ failure.

The optimal therapeutic target for plasma triglyceride level is unclear, although previous studies have suggested lowering plasma triglycerid.

### Approach to the patient with moderate hypertriglyceridemia [^117BhF6u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia is a common lipid disorder encountered in clinical practice. Plasma triglycerides serve as a marker for the concentration of triglycerides carried in chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein particles. A fasting triglyceride level of 1000 mg/dL indicates increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, highlighting the importance of determining the underlying etiology to guide appropriate and timely management.

This article provides stepwise recommendations on the diagnosis and management of moderate hypertriglyceridemia, focusing on three common scenarios in clinical practice. Initial management steps include evaluating secondary contributors, particularly diabetes mellitus. Based on patient characteristics, appropriate management decisions encompass lifestyle adjustments aimed at weight loss and decreasing alcohol consumption, as well as the use of statin and non-statin therapies.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange decreases serum triglyceride level rapidly and reduces early recurrence rate but no advantages in improving outcomes for patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis: a retrospective propensity score matching analysis based on twenty year's experience [^115CVdYm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is the inflammation of the pancreas, with an incidence ranging from 30 to 40 per 100,000. Clinically, there are many causes of AP. Gallstone is the primary cause globally, whereas in China, the incidence of hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis (HLAP) has been reported to be increasing and has become the most common cause not due to gallstones or alcohol. A previous study published in 2016 revealed that HLAP accounted for 2–5% of AP cases in the US.

HLAP is defined as having fasting serum triglyceride (TG) levels greater than 11.3 mmol/L or serum TG levels ranging from 5.65 to 11.3 mmol/L along with visible chylomicrons in the blood. Compared with biliary pancreatitis and alcoholic pancreatitis, HLAP is reported to be more serious and has a higher possibility of developing complications with a poor prognosis. The pathogenesis of HLAP is still unclear, although the hydrolysis of TGs and the release of free fatty acids have been reported to be correlated factors.

- **Management of HLAP**: The management of HLAP is mainly supportive, with an emphasis on lipid-lowering treatment. Since first described by Betteridge et al, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has become one of the modalities in the treatment of HLAP. TPE is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with new plasma. However, TPE is expensive and involves the use of blood products, thus presenting a potential risk. We have published a review analyzing the efficacy and controversy of TPE.

In this study, we retrospectively collected data from HLAP patients admitted to our unit from January 2003 to July 2023 to compare the efficacy of TPE with conventional therapy.

### Conservative management in hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^114iYFPt]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia (serum triglyceride > 10 mmol L⁻¹) is implicated in approximately 9% of acute pancreatitis cases. Certain guidelines list severe hypertriglyceridemia as an indication for plasmapheresis.

We assembled the natural trajectory of triglyceride levels in patients with acute pancreatitis due to severe hypertriglyceridemia who were managed conservatively without plasmapheresis to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on 22 hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis episodes considered to be caused by severe hypertriglyceridemia. Patients were managed supportively, with cessation of oral intake (NPO) and intravenous hydration. Insulin infusion was used in 12 patients to manage concurrent hyperglycemia.

- **Results**: Triglyceride levels for the group were evaluated using a mixed-effects model. The average triglyceride level fell from 45.4 mmol L⁻¹ on presentation to 13.3 mmol L⁻¹ within 48 hours, corresponding to a mean 69.8% decrease. Regression analysis showed a triglyceride half-life of 30.6 hours. Findings were similar for NPO-only and insulin infusion subgroups.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia and acute pancreatitis can be conservatively managed safely and effectively without plasmapheresis.

### Severe acquired hypertriglyceridemia following COVID-19 [^111NMsWy]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

In our case, conservative treatment using a fibrate and extreme dietary fat restriction led to an uncomplicated recovery within a few weeks. In cases of severe complications such as pancreatitis, plasmapheresis may be considered, potentially in combination with B-cell reducing interventions.

- **Patient's perspective**: I was presumably infected with COVID-19 by a colleague, and the diagnosis was made 5 days later. I had a mild disease course with just flu-like symptoms and a maximum temperature of 38.3°C. About a week later, I recovered.

After another few weeks, nausea and excessive saliva production appeared, which was remarkably viscous — almost custard-like! Additionally, an increasing aversion to fatty foods, especially meat products, accompanied by nocturnal vomiting, which almost always started between 3 and 5 AM, arose. After consuming a lavish meal on my daughter's birthday, the nausea was so strong that I decided to visit the doctor. A blood test was arranged, and owing to my aversion to fatty food, I requested a lipid profile from the doctor. The results revealed strikingly high triglyceride levels of 44 mmol/L.

I was referred to the university hospital, where an acquired LPL deficiency was detected using an LPL mixing test. An abdominal CT scan showed the absence of pancreatitis. My symptoms decreased quickly after starting a fat-free/very low-fat diet and ciprofibrate. The triglyceride levels slowly reduced to an acceptable level. After 4 months, all complaints had disappeared, and the blood results normalized after another month.

### The controversy continues: Whether to perform plasma exchange, and with what dose of steroids, in the PEXIVAS trial [^112gYnsB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

The data from this trial provide a compelling argument to two critical controversies regarding the management of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV). Should plasmapheresis not be offered to all patients with DAH with AAV? The American College of Rheumatology guidelines in 2021 conditionally recommended against the routine use of plasma exchange (PLEX) in remission induction therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA)/microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with DAH and supported conditional recommendations for lower steroid dosing.

Given that severe DAH in AAV carries a high risk for mortality, PLEX and standard steroid dosing therapy options should still be considered on a case-by-case basis. There remains a concern that the PEXIVAS trial was underpowered and could not detect the potential benefits of PLEX. Participants with nonsevere DAH can likely be considered similar to the AAV group without DAH and receive no PLEX therapy and reduced glucocorticoids (GCs).

Future directions should focus on enrolling only participants with severe DAH, evaluating differences in mechanical ventilation, and further evaluating steroid dosing. The PEXIVAS trial underscores the benefit of early detection as new treatments are developed and fuels research into the most efficacious therapeutic regimens associated with the least side effects for severe DAH-associated AAV.

### Hypertriglyceridemia in statin-treated US adults: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [^1153mx68]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hypertriglyceridemia:

- **Definition**: Hypertriglyceridemia is defined as fasting triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, which is associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease.

- **Pathophysiology**: Underlying pathophysiology occurs through abnormalities in hepatic VLDL production and intestinal chylomicron synthesis, as well as dysfunctional LPL-mediated lipolysis or impaired remnant clearance. Primary etiology includes genetic mutations in the LPL, APOC3, and APOA5 genes, while secondary etiologies may consist of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, alcohol use, renal disease, pregnancy, and MASLD.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia in the US is estimated at 29% in men and 21% in women.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include eruptive cutaneous xanthomata, lipemia retinalis, tuberous xanthoma, palmar crease xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, focal neurologic symptoms like irritability, and epigastric pain with an increased risk of pancreatitis seen mostly with both familial chylomicronemia and primary mixed hyperlipidemia. Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and acute pancreatitis, leading to a reduction in health-related quality of life.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Hypertriglyceridemia with high (150–500 mg/dL) and very high levels (> 500 mg/dL) is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, with a hazard ratio of 1.49 (95% CI 1.36–1.63, p < 0.001) and 3.08 (95% CI 1.46–6.50, p < 0.01), respectively.

### Lipid apheresis in the management of severe hypertriglyceridaemia in an adolescent girl with global developmental delay [^114SmgEZ]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Severe hypertriglyceridaemia (SHTG) is a well-known and reported cause of acute pancreatitis in adults and children that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. However, evidence-based guidelines for the management of SHTG-induced acute pancreatitis (SHTG-AP) are scarce, institutionalised, and primarily based on adult guidelines. There is no clear evidence in the paediatric population regarding which cases can be safely treated with conservative measures, such as diet, lifestyle changes, and hypolipidemic medications, and which cases require more invasive measures.

### Consensus statement by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American College of Endocrinology on the management of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease algorithm - 2020 executive summary [^111g27S2]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of lipid disorders begins with lifestyle therapy to improve nutrition, physical activity, weight, and other factors that affect lipids. Secondary causes of lipid disorders should be addressed, and pharmacologic therapy initiated based on a patient's risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Patients at extreme ASCVD risk should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of < 55 mg/dL, and those at very high ASCVD risk should be treated to achieve LDL-C < 70 mg/dL.

- **Moderate and high ASCVD risk patients**: Treatment may begin with a moderate-intensity statin to achieve an LDL-C < 100 mg/dL, while the LDL-C goal is < 130 mg/dL for those at low risk.
- **Intensified treatment**: In all cases, treatment should be intensified, including the addition of other LDL-C-lowering agents (e.g. proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, colesevelam, or bempedoic acid) as needed to achieve treatment goals.
- **Triglyceride levels**: When targeting triglyceride levels, the desirable goal is < 150 mg/dL. Statin therapy should be combined with a fibrate, prescription-grade omega-3 fatty acid, and/or niacin to reduce triglycerides in all patients with triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL.
- **Additional recommendations**: Icosapent ethyl should be added to a statin in any patient with established ASCVD or diabetes with ≥ 2 ASCVD risk factors and triglycerides between 135 and 499 mg/dL to prevent ASCVD events. Management of additional risk factors such as elevated lipoprotein(a) and statin intolerance is also described.

### Plasmapheresis to treat hypertriglyceridemia in a child with diabetic ketoacidosis and pancreatitis [^113BjthP]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented with diabetic ketoacidosis, shock, and severe abdominal pain. She was found to have acute pancreatitis and acute kidney injury after shock resuscitation and severe persistent hypertriglyceridemia. The severe hypertriglyceridemia was treated with one course of plasmapheresis, which corrected the triglyceride level and was temporally associated with improvement of the abdominal pain and renal dysfunction. Diabetes is known to contribute to an elevated triglyceride level, especially in the setting of an underlying lipid disorder. However, no such disorders were found in this patient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a pediatric patient presenting with the triad of severe hypertriglyceridemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pancreatitis treated successfully with plasmapheresis.

### Systematic review of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia [^116cKQpY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Despite findings that apheresis is effective in reducing LDL-C levels, methodological issues make drawing conclusions from study results difficult. One issue is that patients with HoFH and HeFH are often aggregated in analyses. Only 63% of the studies included in this review assessed LDL-C reductions in patients with HoFH and HeFH separately. This lack of stratification by FH type limits the usefulness of study findings and may lead to increased variability in LDL-C apheresis efficacy results.

The results presenting the efficacy of apheresis in reducing LDL-C in patients with FH may also be misleading. The studies indicate that while percentage LDL-C reductions for patients with HoFH or HeFH are similar, actual LDL-C levels remain higher in patients with HoFH compared to those with HeFH. Furthermore, when considering interval LDL-C reduction and reductions over an extended follow-up, the LDL-C reduction of apheresis becomes more modest. This is likely related to the rebound of LDL-C levels after apheresis treatment.

Studies demonstrate that apheresis decreases the rate of CVE, but the duration of follow-up reported may not be sufficient to fully capture downstream CVE, with periods ranging from 1 to 5 years. This may introduce substantial bias and result in lower rates of CVE than would be observed with longer follow-up periods. Additionally, reduction in CVE is not reported using a standard comparison or standard patient population, with 50% of studies determining CVE reduction through comparisons lacking standardization.

### Continuous insulin therapy versus apheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated pancreatitis [^111BKy5t]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

The optimal treatment modality for lowering the triglyceride level in patients with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-associated acute pancreatitis is unknown. We evaluated the efficacy of continuous insulin infusion and apheresis procedures as triglyceride-lowering therapy.

- **Materials and methods**: Clinical, demographic, and laboratory data were retrospectively evaluated for patients with HTG-associated pancreatitis who received continuous insulin infusion or apheresis in a single tertiary center. The endpoints were modality effectiveness and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: The study included 48 patients (mean age, 40.4 ± 9.9 years). Apheresis and insulin infusion were performed in 19 and 29 patients, respectively, in the first 24 hours of hospital admission. Apheresis procedures included therapeutic plasma exchange in 10 patients and double filtration plasmapheresis in nine patients. Baseline mean triglyceride level was higher in the apheresis group. The two groups were similar in terms of other baseline clinical and demographic characteristics. Seventeen patients (58.6%) in the insulin group and nine patients (47.4%) in the apheresis group exhibited Balthazar grades D-E. There was a rapid reduction (78.5%) in triglyceride level after the first session of apheresis. Insulin infusion resulted in a 44.4% reduction in mean triglyceride level in the first 24 hours. The durations of fasting and hospital stay, and the rates of respiratory failure and hypotension, were similar between groups. More patients in the apheresis group experienced acute renal failure or altered mental status.

Regarding the medical management of hypertriglyceridemia, particularly in terms of general principles, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend identifying and addressing other causes of hypertriglyceridemia in adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. This is especially important for patients with fasting triglycerides of 500 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) or greater, and particularly for those with fasting triglycerides of 1,000 mg/dL (11.3 mmol/L) or higher.

### Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease: Evidence and guidance for management [^111mvxjf]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In summary, statins firmly remain the first-line treatment of choice for the attainment of LDL-C goals in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). After reaching the LDL-C goal, if triglyceride levels remain elevated (≥ 1.7 mmol/L or 150 mg/dL, as defined by recent European guidelines) and HDL-C is low (< 1.0 mmol/L), further interventions are recommended. Fibrate therapy may be added if triglyceride levels are very high (> 5.0 mmol/L) to prevent pancreatitis.

If the patient still has elevated triglycerides (≥ 1.7 mmol/L, as recommended by the most recent European guidelines) and/or low HDL-C (< 1.0 mmol/L) despite intensive lifestyle intervention and addressing compliance with pharmacotherapy and secondary causes of dyslipidaemia, additional lipid-modifying therapy may be considered. Based on clinical outcome data and safety considerations for combination statin–fibrate therapy, fenofibrate is the preferred fibrate. This fibrate may have particular value in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and mild-to-moderate retinopathy. Greater LDL-C lowering may be achieved by the addition of ezetimibe to a statin. Ezetimibe has a dose-sparing advantage in patients intolerant of higher doses.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Vk3ZU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure is another complication that was investigated in this study and compared between the two treatment groups. From the study analysis, patients from the plasma exchange therapy group had a high chance of developing acute renal failure compared to patients managed by insulin ± heparin therapy; however, the difference was statistically insignificant and contradictory between the two studies. Therefore, a conclusive comparison cannot yet be established.

Taking into consideration cost-effectiveness, convenience of administration, and resource stewardship, insulin ± heparin therapy may be more favorable in the actual clinical context. Easier affordability with insulin ± heparin may further improve treatment rates for self-paying patients, leading to better follow-up rates. In addition, insulin ± heparin therapy involves a simpler setup than plasmapheresis, which requires costly equipment and greater operating and maintenance costs. Clinical decisions may also be influenced by the healthcare setting and the availability of resources until clearer research on the superiority of a specific therapy is established. Given the limited availability of plasmapheresis in rural areas, insulin ± heparin therapy will invariably be favored over plasmapheresis for the treatment of such patients. To gain a deeper understanding of this illness, more randomized trials are required to establish concrete evidence.

There were numerous findings in this review that pointed in opposite directions. The analytical results did not show any significant difference in favor of either therapy.

### Unmet need for adjunctive dyslipidemia therapy in hypertriglyceridemia management [^115X4MUZ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the important role of high-intensity statins in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events in secondary and primary prevention, substantial residual risk persists, particularly among high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and obesity. Considerable attention is currently directed to the role that elevated triglycerides (TGs) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels play as important mediators of residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, which is further strongly supported by genetic linkage studies.

Previous trials with fibrates, niacin, and most cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors that targeted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol raising, and/or TG lowering, have failed to show conclusive evidence of incremental event reduction after low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were "optimally controlled" with statins. Although omega-3 fatty acids are efficacious in lowering TG levels and may have pleiotropic effects, such as reducing plaque instability and proinflammatory mediators of atherogenesis, clinical outcomes data are currently lacking. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials of TG-lowering strategies with an optimal dosage of omega-3 fatty acids are nearing completion.

### Systematic review of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia [^117Nz4Mo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The rebound of LDL‐C after apheresis treatments may require weekly or biweekly sessions to maintain reduced levels of LDL‐C. The frequency of LDL‐C apheresis required for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) presents a significant barrier given the invasiveness and cost of the treatment. This may impact patient quality of life, reduce access to LDL‐C apheresis, and thus compound the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in these patients. LDL‐C apheresis is an invasive procedure that lasts for two or more hours, which may be undesirable or inconvenient for patients with FH. Patients may also have difficulty accessing LDL‐C apheresis treatment, as its availability is restricted to specialized centers in many countries. The equipment, disposable supplies, and the requirement for intensive medical staff contribute to the often prohibitive cost of LDL‐C apheresis. Due to low availability and high cost, LDL‐C apheresis is often restricted to patients with the most severe FH, typically those with homozygous FH (HoFH) or severe heterozygous FH (HeFH) who are treatment refractory.

Consequently, it may be unethical to withhold LDL‐C apheresis treatment from patients with FH who are at high risk of CVD and may benefit from LDL‐C apheresis but are ineligible for, or cannot gain access to the treatment. Given the necessity for lipid‐lowering treatments beyond conventional statins in patients with FH, it is crucial to address these areas of unmet need to appropriately treat patients with FH. There is a need for conducting more economic analyses, such as cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness studies, to better understand and mitigate these barriers.

### Systematic review of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol apheresis for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia [^1134oAxZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines on LDL‐C apheresis offer varying recommendations for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) across different countries. The literature search identified 11 clinical guidelines relevant to this topic. Six guidelines from Japan, Australia, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK, Spain, and the US outlined treatment recommendations for FH. Five guidelines from Germany, the UK, and the US specifically described LDL‐C apheresis treatment for hypercholesterolemia.

While it is widely accepted that patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) usually require apheresis to reduce LDL‐C to target levels, guidelines differ on the criteria for initiating this treatment. Japanese guidelines were the most aggressive, recommending LDL‐C apheresis as a first-line treatment for all patients with HoFH. Other guidelines stipulate that patients with HoFH must exceed a specific LDL‐C threshold or be treatment refractory before considering apheresis. All guidelines emphasize the importance of concomitant lipid‐lowering therapy along with apheresis to effectively manage LDL‐C levels.

For patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who are treatment refractory and have cardiovascular disease, all guidelines recommend LDL‐C apheresis in combination with lipid‐lowering therapies.

There is inconsistency in the reporting and criteria across guidelines concerning LDL‐C apheresis treatment eligibility, LDL‐C thresholds, target acute LDL‐C reduction (LDL‐C reduction immediately after an apheresis session), interval LDL‐C level (LDL‐C level between apheresis sessions), and time‐average LDL‐C reduction (average LDL‐C levels between two time points to account for LDL‐C rebound after apheresis treatment), and such criteria vary by country.

### The role of plasma exchange in hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis [^116XfkKf]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG)-induced acute pancreatitis (AP) leads to higher morbidity and mortality compared with other etiologies. The role of plasma exchange (PE) in this context is still not well established. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes of patients with HTG-induced AP who underwent PE and compare it with those who did not.

- **Patients and methods**: We retrospectively evaluated the data of patients who were admitted with HTG-induced AP between January 2013 and May 2018. The endpoint of the study was to assess the clinical outcomes, which included complication rates, mortality, and pancreatitis recurrence rate.

- **Results**: Overall, 41 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 12 (29.2%) underwent PE. Patients undergoing PE had more severe pancreatitis on the basis of the Japanese Severity Score [10 (83.3%) vs. 14 (48.3%), P = 0.03]. Although mortality was higher in patients who underwent PE [three (25.0%) vs. zero, P < 0.01], there was no difference in terms of complications and recurrence rates. Over a median 21 months of follow-up, 11 (26.8%) patients experienced recurrent acute pancreatitis (reAP).

- **Conclusion**: Although PE effectively reduced plasma triglyceride levels, there was no decrease in mortality or recurrences.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for hypertriglyceridemia, particularly with respect to lifestyle modification, the 2019 guidelines from the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend advising the implementation of a very low-fat diet. Patients should avoid refined carbohydrates and alcohol, especially adult patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia (fasting triglycerides ≥ 500 mg/dL; ≥ 5.7 mmol/L). This is particularly crucial if fasting triglycerides reach levels of ≥ 1,000 mg/dL (≥ 11.3 mmol/L) or if triglycerides are persistently elevated or increasing after addressing other causes of hypertriglyceridemia.

### Prevention and management of hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis during pregnancy: A systematic review [^115dVw4G]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Severe gestational hypertriglyceridemia can lead to acute pancreatitis, with a maternal mortality rate of approximately 20%. The recent National Lipid Association part 2 expert panel recommendations provide guidance on monitoring pregnant women at high risk for hyperlipidemia. It is suggested that high-risk women have their triglyceride levels checked once every trimester.

- **Monitoring and treatment**:
	- Fasting triglycerides > 250 mg/dL should prompt monthly triglyceride levels, screening for gestational diabetes, and implementing a strict low-carbohydrate, low-fat diet and exercise regimen.
	- Fasting triglycerides > 500 mg/dL, despite strict dietary and lifestyle modifications, should prompt treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and continuation of a fat-restricted diet.
	- In pregnant women with clinical signs and symptoms of pancreatitis and triglyceride levels > 500 mg/dL, despite maximal lifestyle changes and pharmacologic therapy, further interventions may be needed.

These measures are critical in managing and preventing severe outcomes in pregnancy-related hypertriglyceridemia.

### Role of therapeutic plasma exchange in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia: an experience [^116gsMgw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Hypertriglyceridemia associated with obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes mellitus is highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a rare but well-known cause of acute pancreatitis. The treatment typically involves pancreatic rest, lifestyle changes, and lipid-lowering medications, although the response time to these interventions can be slow. Recently, the role of therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) has been emphasized for achieving fast and effective management, alongside insulin and heparin infusion. TPE for hypertriglyceridemic pancreatitis has resulted in significant improvements in clinical and laboratory findings and patient outcomes, as demonstrated in our cases. However, this procedure is limited due to its high cost and restricted availability in specialized hospitals.

### Therapeutic plasma exchange decreases serum triglyceride level rapidly and reduces early recurrence rate but no advantages in improving outcomes for patients with hyperlipidemic acute pancreatitis: a retrospective propensity score matching analysis based on twenty year's experience [^11347sFB]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

The study demonstrates a more rapid decline of TG level on the second day after TPE was initiated when compared with n-TPE, but our data finds no difference in the consecutive days. This is consistent with other reports. In most patients, TG levels decrease by 65% to 85% after one or two TPE sessions, respectively. Unfortunately, since our study comprises patients within 20 years, some data might not be convincingly analyzed to determine whether the timing of TPE initiation influences the results.

HLAP has more complications, a longer hospital course, and a higher possibility of recurrence. HLAP has been reported to have recurrence rates of approximately 16.0%–49.2%. ReAP (RAP) infers two or more AP attacks in a period of at least 3 months, during which patients have recovered or nearly recovered. The factors affecting the recurrence of HLAP were not included in our study design, but we accidentally found that the early recurrence rate (recurrence within an interval of 3 months) is higher in n-TPE groups. Previous studies have shown that smoking, high levels of TG, and substandard control of TGs are risk factors for recurrence of HLAP. Since early recurrence poses a small number of cases, we do not focus on the reason why; however, these results warrant further investigation.

When comparing the early CTSI changes and local complications, we find no difference between groups. Many factors may impact the severity and outcome of AP. To date, which patients can benefit from TPE has not been conclusively shown. In the study, the in-hospital mortality rates were…

### Management of non-high-density lipoprotein abnormalities [^115yLgpn]. Atherosclerosis (2009). Low credibility.

Epidemiological evidence supports the use of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB), and low-density lipoprotein particles as markers of atherogenic risk. Treatment guidelines also identify these as additional targets of lipid-modifying intervention in patients with elevated triglycerides (TG). Even when TG are only moderately elevated, many patients on statin monotherapy who have achieved targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) fail to reach non-HDL-C treatment goals, and even fewer reach apoB goals.

Combination lipid-modifying therapy is therefore indicated for comprehensive lipid management, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome in whom LDL-C levels are often considered 'optimal' Of the available options, adding either a niacin, fibrate, or omega-3 fatty acids provides greater opportunity to achieve non-HDL-C and apoB targets, given complementary profiles of lipid-modifying activity and supported by evidence from clinical studies. Improvement in lipid control and reduction in atherogenic risk could be anticipated to translate to benefits in clinical outcomes.

### Investigation and management of hypertriglyceridaemia [^1139s6tz]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2008). Low credibility.

While the precise definition of hypertriglyceridaemia remains contentious, the condition is becoming more common in Western populations as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes mellitus rise. Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that hypertriglyceridaemia is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, it has been difficult to demonstrate this through drug intervention studies, as drugs that reduce triglycerides also raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Precise target values have also been difficult to agree upon, although several of the new guidelines for coronary risk management now include triglycerides.

The causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are numerous. The more severe forms have a genetic basis and may lead to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Several types of hypertriglyceridaemia are familial and are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Secondary causes of hypertriglyceridaemia are also numerous, and it is important to exclude these before starting treatment with specific triglyceride-lowering agents. Lifestyle management is also very effective and includes weight reduction, restricted alcohol and fat intake, and exercise.

### Management of hypertriglyceridaemic pancreatitis in the acute setting and review of literature [^111DK2KE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a potentially life-threatening complication of severe hypertriglyceridemia, which is the third most common cause of AP after gallstone disease and alcohol excess. Standard therapy involves the use of lipid-lowering agents, low-molecular-weight heparin, and insulin infusion. In some cases, when standard medical therapies fail, non-pharmacological methods based on the removal of triglycerides with therapeutic plasma exchange can provide positive results in the acute phase. There are currently no guidelines covering management in the acute phase; however, these approaches should be considered in severe or very severe hypertriglyceridemia. Here, we report the case of a 37-year-old man with recurrent AP due to hypertriglyceridemia and review the literature.

### Efficacy and adverse effects of insulin versus plasmapheresis in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-3-induced acute pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113T4DiD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

All the studies included in the systematic review and meta-analysis compared the efficacy of insulin ± heparin vs. plasma exchange in the reduction of triglyceride levels among patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis (AP). From the analysis of this study, there was no statistical difference between insulin ± heparin and plasma exchange in reducing triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia-induced AP. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of safety between the two treatment options, indicating non-inferiority in terms of safety profile as well as the reduction in triglyceride levels. More studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm these findings.

- **What is already known**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a significant medical challenge with a rising incidence and substantial healthcare costs. Hypertriglyceridemia is a leading cause of AP, but optimal treatment strategies remain debatable. Insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis have been proposed as potential treatments, but limited literature exists on their comparative effectiveness and safety.

- **What the new findings are**: This systematic review and meta-analysis found insulin ± heparin therapy and plasmapheresis to be equally effective in reducing triglyceride levels in AP patients. Considering cost-effectiveness, convenience, and resource availability, insulin ± heparin therapy may be preferred in clinical practice, especially in resource-limited settings for AP.
