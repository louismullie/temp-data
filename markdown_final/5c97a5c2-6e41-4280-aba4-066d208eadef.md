## Question

Valacyclovir to cure giant cell arteritis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether valacyclovir can cure giant cell arteritis (GCA) and if antivirals have a therapeutic role in GCA management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic rationale linking varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to GCA. Then, I should verify whether any clinical trials support antiviral therapy in GCA. Next, I will compare this with evidence-based standard treatments and guideline recommendations. Finally, I need to synthesize what "cure" means in GCA and clarify appropriate clinical actions and when antivirals are actually indicated.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care so I don't jump to conclusions based on a hypothetical viral trigger. GCA is an immune-mediated large-vessel vasculitis in older adults that requires urgent high-dose glucocorticoids for induction, with biologic or conventional steroid-sparing agents for relapse prevention and toxicity mitigation; neither ACR/Vasculitis Foundation (2021) nor EULAR (2020) guidelines include antivirals as a treatment for GCA [^112w6dCE] [^1161347i] [^112mZKSV].

> Wait, let me verify the VZV hypothesis before dismissing it. Some neuropathology and infectious disease reports have detected VZV antigen or DNA in temporal arteries of patients with suspected or confirmed GCA and have speculated that VZV could trigger GCA immunopathology, even proposing antivirals as adjuncts; however, these data are observational, often methodologically limited, and do not establish causation or therapeutic efficacy in GCA itself [^115PtdLF] [^112SMx9s].

> I should double-check clinical evidence for antivirals actually treating GCA. Hold on, I need to be precise: there are no randomized trials or controlled cohort studies showing valacyclovir or acyclovir improve remission, reduce relapse, or spare steroids in GCA; published mentions of valacyclovir are in the context of treating concomitant disseminated VZV infection in a patient with GCA, not GCA remission itself, and FDA materials only address acyclovir/valacyclovir contraindication cross-reactivity, not vasculitis efficacy [^112en6ui] [^115eaAgQ] [^112w6dCE].

> Next, I will examine proven therapies to anchor the recommendation. High-dose oral prednisone (typically 40–60 mg/day) is first-line for new-onset GCA, with IV methylprednisolone considered for acute visual compromise; tocilizumab significantly increases sustained remission and reduces cumulative glucocorticoid exposure in RCTs (GiACTA), and methotrexate offers modest relapse reduction and steroid sparing in older trials; upadacitinib 15 mg has recently demonstrated superiority over placebo for sustained remission at 52 weeks in a phase 3 trial and now carries FDA labeling for GCA [^112mZKSV] [^111wvMvx] [^117MNgZB] [^117YG7ry] [^111dYpqd] [^113ri5U6].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any major guidelines even mention antivirals for GCA. They do not: ACR/VF 2021, EULAR 2020, and BSR 2020 recommend corticosteroids with consideration of tocilizumab or methotrexate (and now JAK inhibition per emerging evidence) and are silent on valacyclovir or other antivirals for GCA treatment, which strongly implies a lack of recognized benefit in this disease [^112w6dCE] [^116LgqsF] [^112mZKSV] [^111wvMvx].

> I need to ensure I'm precise about the concept of "cure". GCA behaves as a chronic, relapsing immune-mediated vasculitis; even with optimal therapy, relapse occurs in about half of patients on steroid monotherapy and in a substantial minority on tocilizumab, indicating that current treatments induce remission rather than eradicate disease predisposition, so no therapy — including antivirals — can presently be described as curative [^111pp9SV] [^11166LZB] [^112nnBrM].

> Hmm, wait a minute — what about aspirin or IV pulse steroids; could I be overlooking something analogous to antivirals? I initially thought IV methylprednisolone universally improves visual outcomes, but population data suggest higher diabetes risk without clear visual benefit compared with oral therapy alone, while BSR still advises IV methylprednisolone for acute or intermittent visual loss; likewise, earlier enthusiasm for routine aspirin has been tempered, with ACR/VF recommending aspirin only in select flow-limiting vertebral or carotid involvement, underscoring that adjuncts must be evidence-driven and tailored, unlike antivirals in GCA where evidence is absent [^111ywLbe] [^111wvMvx] [^114oktpf].

> Let me now synthesize and answer the user's question directly. No, valacyclovir is neither a proven nor a recommended treatment for GCA and it cannot cure the disease; if VZV infection is concurrently present (e.g., shingles or disseminated VZV), then antiviral therapy is indicated for that infection, but GCA itself should be managed with guideline-directed immunosuppression, including immediate high-dose corticosteroids and consideration of tocilizumab, methotrexate, or upadacitinib depending on disease course and patient factors [^112en6ui] [^112w6dCE] [^117MNgZB] [^111dYpqd].

> I should confirm the immediate clinical action when GCA is suspected, especially with visual symptoms. Initiate high-dose corticosteroids urgently — IV methylprednisolone for acute visual loss per BSR guidance or rapid high-dose oral regimens otherwise — while arranging confirmatory testing (e.g., temporal artery ultrasound/biopsy) to protect the contralateral eye and prevent ischemic complications; antivirals have no role here unless treating a documented VZV infection in parallel [^111wvMvx] [^113edRx5] [^1135ke1J].

Valacyclovir **does not cure** giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an **autoimmune large-vessel vasculitis** driven by immune-mediated inflammation, not by herpesviruses [^112nnBrM]. Valacyclovir is an antiviral for herpesviruses and has **no proven effect** on GCA pathogenesis or outcomes. The standard of care remains immediate **high-dose corticosteroids** [^112mZKSV], with tocilizumab [^117MNgZB] [^116DJKEh] or methotrexate [^114LYj2i] as steroid-sparing options. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** [^116LgqsF] [^115RBwzu] for valacyclovir in GCA, and it should not be used for this purpose.

---

## Pathophysiology of giant cell arteritis

GCA is characterized by **granulomatous inflammation** of large- and medium-sized arteries, especially the temporal arteries and branches of the aorta [^112nnBrM]. The disease is driven by immune-mediated mechanisms, including:

- **Activation of vascular dendritic cells**: Initiates recruitment of CD4+ T cells and macrophages, leading to granulomatous inflammation [^112nnBrM].

- **Cytokine production**: Excessive production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) drives systemic inflammation and vascular injury [^113Waz8t].

- **Intimal hyperplasia and luminal occlusion**: Immune injury leads to hyperplasia of the intima, causing luminal occlusion and ischemic complications [^113Waz8t].

No **established evidence** supports a causal role for herpesviruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV), in GCA pathogenesis. Although some studies have detected VZV antigen in temporal artery biopsies, these findings are controversial and not universally accepted [^112SMx9s] [^112nnBrM].

---

## Mechanism of action of valacyclovir

Valacyclovir is an antiviral that **inhibits viral DNA polymerase**, preventing viral replication. It is used primarily for herpesvirus infections, including HSV and VZV. Valacyclovir has no meaningful immunomodulatory effects or direct anti-inflammatory properties relevant to autoimmune diseases such as GCA.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding valacyclovir in GCA

The medical literature contains **no clinical trials**, case reports, or observational studies demonstrating valacyclovir's efficacy in treating GCA [^112mZKSV] [^116LgqsF]. The only related evidence consists of isolated case reports of herpes zoster-associated temporal artery vasculitis, a distinct entity from GCA [^1127saWr]. In these cases, antivirals were used to treat the underlying viral infection rather than the autoimmune vasculitis characteristic of GCA [^112SMx9s].

---

## Current standard of care for GCA

The standard of care for GCA is **immediate initiation** of high-dose corticosteroids to prevent irreversible complications, such as vision loss [^112w6dCE]. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy, with adjunctive immunosuppressive agents considered in specific scenarios:

- **Corticosteroids**: High-dose prednisone (40–60 mg/day) is recommended for induction of remission [^112mZKSV] [^1161347i].

- **Tocilizumab**: An IL-6 receptor antagonist, recommended as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory or relapsing disease, or those at high risk of corticosteroid-related adverse effects [^116LgqsF] [^117MNgZB].

- **Methotrexate**: Considered as an alternative immunosuppressive agent in patients with active extracranial large vessel involvement [^114LYj2i] [^117YG7ry].

Current clinical guidelines **do not include antiviral therapy**, including valacyclovir, for the management of GCA [^112mZKSV] [^116LgqsF].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of valacyclovir in GCA patients

Valacyclovir is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. In immunocompromised patients, including those receiving corticosteroids for GCA, antiviral therapy may increase the **risk of renal impairment** and other complications. However, these risks are not specifically documented in GCA because valacyclovir is not a standard treatment for this condition.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Valacyclovir **does not cure** giant cell arteritis. There is **no scientific or guideline support** [^116LgqsF] for using valacyclovir to treat GCA. GCA is primarily immune-mediated; antiviral therapy targeting herpesviruses is not relevant to its disease mechanisms. The **standard of care remains corticosteroids**, with adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy as indicated [^112mZKSV].

### Large-vessel involvement in giant cell arteritis [^1172yAHn]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Large-vessel involvement in giant cell arteritis occurs in over a quarter of patients with this disease. Stenosis of the primary and secondary branches of the aorta may cause claudication and tissue gangrene, whereas aortitis may lead to aneurysm formation and dissection, often many years after the initial diagnosis.

- **Recent findings**: Subsets of giant cell arteritis are probably caused by variations in the pathobiology of the disease. Radiographic imaging with some form of angiography is essential to reach a proper diagnosis. Although survival in giant cell arteritis is generally good, subsets of patients with aneurysm formation have a markedly diminished life expectancy. Glucocorticosteroids continue to be the mainstay of treatment for giant cell arteritis and its complications.

- **Summary**: Advances in diagnostic techniques including proteomic and genomic approaches should improve our understanding of the pathogenesis as well as the assessment of disease activity and extent. We provide a suggested algorithm for the evaluation of patients with large-vessel disease in giant cell arteritis.

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^113PeGuq]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

We did not identify a study testing a T2T strategy in PMR and/or GCA. An obstacle to conducting such a trial might be the absence of internationally recognized remission criteria, which have been defined as the most relevant target for these diseases. Optimally, PMR and GCA trials adopting a T2T approach may be important for individualizing treatment, reducing side effects, and enhancing quality of life. Frequent monitoring aids in early detection of flares, enabling timely intervention to prevent severe exacerbations. Moreover, this approach would foster standardized care, gather valuable research data, and support evidence-based decision-making, ultimately leading to improved long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the utilization of a T2T strategy calls for the introduction of new therapeutic interventions targeting individuals who exhibit limited responsiveness to the initial treatment regimen. We anticipate that this SLR and the T2T recommendations will stimulate further research in this regard.

We did not include studies without a control group in our SLR, which might be seen as a limitation; however, our objective was to identify targets and outcomes that might be valuable for a T2T strategy. Studies without an intervention were therefore considered less relevant for our purpose. Titles and abstract screening were performed by different fellows than data extraction and quality assessment; this is certainly not the standard approach and was a consequence of changed duties and personal developments during the COVID-19 crisis. However, every step was conducted under supervision.

### New-onset versus relapsing giant cell arteritis treated with tocilizumab: 3-year results from a randomized controlled trial and extension [^111pp9SV]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory disorder associated with vascular and inflammatory symptoms, including headache, jaw claudication, fever, weight loss, and visual disturbances that can lead to irreversible blindness. To minimize these consequences, patients with GCA are commonly treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. These are initially effective for symptom management but may not be sufficient to prevent disease flares at lower doses. Up to 80% of patients experience disease flares over the course of one year if glucocorticoids are tapered completely, and the flare rate is between 35% and 75% even if patients continue on some dose of prednisone while in remission. Many patients require additional prednisone to treat flares or refractory symptoms; however, prolonged glucocorticoid use is associated with significant toxicity. Given that GCA occurs almost exclusively in older adults, with peak incidence between 71 and 80 years, the potential for glucocorticoid toxicity is especially concerning.

The IL-6 receptor alpha inhibitor, tocilizumab, was approved for the treatment of patients with GCA based on positive results from the Giant-Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial. GiACTA was a two-part, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study of patients with either new-onset or relapsing GCA. Part 1 consisted of a 52-week double-blind period, followed by a 104-week open-label phase (part 2). In part 1, tocilizumab administered weekly or every other week in combination with prednisone taper was superior to placebo plus prednisone taper at inducing remission.

### Giant-cell arteritis: Do we treat patients with large-vessel involvement differently [^112dqz5H]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to describe the initial treatment used in a common hospital-based practice for patients with giant-cell arteritis, both with and without large-vessel involvement at diagnosis, as well as the outcomes in both groups.

- **Methods**: This retrospective multicenter cohort included patients with giant-cell arteritis diagnosed between 2005 and 2015. All patients had fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) performed at diagnosis and were followed up for ≥ 12 months. We compared the features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with large-vessel involvement, as demonstrated on FDG-PET/CT, with those of patients with a negative PET/CT.

- **Results**: Eighty patients (50 women, median age: 71 [53–87] years) were included; 40 had large-vessel involvement demonstrated on FDG-PET/CT, while 40 did not. After a median 56-month follow-up, 42 (53%) patients had discontinued glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Patients with and without large-vessel involvement were indistinguishable in the initial median dose of prednisone (0.74 mg/kg vs. 0.75 mg/kg, P = 0.56), overall GC duration (P = 0.77), GC discontinuation rate (P = 0.65), relapse rate (P = 0.50), frequency of GC-dependent disease requiring GC-sparing treatments (P = 0.62), and fatality rate (P = 0.06).

- **Conclusion**: In the setting of tertiary hospital recruitment, large-vessel involvement at giant-cell arteritis diagnosis using a PET/CT study had no influence on the choice of initial GC dose and had no impact on outcomes. Prospective studies are required to further investigate these findings.

### Widespread arterial infection by varicella-zoster virus explains refractory giant cell arteritis [^115PtdLF]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The pathological diagnosis of VZV arteritis comes nearly 20 years after this patient's death. Reexamination of this case was prompted by the recognition that VZV is commonly found in the temporal arteries of patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA). VZV and extensive granulomatous arteritis in multiple large arteries were most likely due to the reactivation of VZV in an elderly woman, followed by potentiation of virus infection by several months of high-dose corticosteroids. Widespread vasculopathy occurs in patients with GCA treated with long-term corticosteroids.

Recently, virologic studies in a man with thoracic-distribution zoster and a history of corticosteroid abuse, who died suddenly, revealed extensive VZV infection in multiple organs and arteries, particularly the coronary arteries and aorta, along with subclinical VZV vasculopathy. Large artery involvement in GCA has been increasingly documented. Our findings confirm the detection of VZV antigen and VZV DNA in GCA-positive temporal arteries, indicating that productive VZV infection in these arteries parallels infection in the intracerebral arteries of patients with VZV vasculopathy. In fact, GCA is likely a form of VZV vasculopathy that predominantly, but not exclusively, affects the temporal artery.

Since VZV triggers the immunopathology of GCA, treatment of GCA patients with antiviral agents is likely to not only shorten the course of corticosteroids needed to reduce the disease-causing immunopathology but also prevent the spread of VZV and the development of disseminated granulomatous arteritis.

### Steroid management in giant cell arteritis [^112aJENG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Ocular involvement in giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an ophthalmic emergency which, if untreated, can progress to permanent blindness. There is little evidence in the literature to support protocols for the acute treatment of GCA with steroids. This study reviews the effects of intravenous and oral steroids in GCA.

This retrospective study reviewed the records of 100 consecutive patients with biopsy-proved giant cell arteritis. Seventy-three patients with visual loss treated at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH) and St Vincent's Hospital were included in the final series. The study analyzed the management of these patients in the first week after presentation, focusing on types of treatment, dose, effect on visual acuity, and complications.

All patients except one had visual loss due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Seventeen patients (23%) had bilateral eye involvement. Visual acuity improved in 21 of 73 patients (29%) by a mean of two Snellen chart lines after commencement of steroids. There was an increased likelihood of improved vision in the group who received intravenous steroids (40%) compared with those who received oral steroids (13%). In all except four patients (95%), vision remained stable at the 1-month review.

Prompt treatment of GCA with steroids leads to improvement of visual acuity in a significant number of cases. Intravenous steroids may offer a greater prospect of improvement compared with oral steroids. A prospective trial comparing intravenous with oral steroids is needed to validate these findings.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: A genome-wide association study [^113bNkaC]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we explored the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis through the largest GWAS conducted for this type of vasculitis at the time of writing. Our findings substantially increase the understanding of the genetic components contributing to the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis. We identified three novel genetic risk factors and, through an extensive functional analysis, elucidated their potential biological consequences in giant cell arteritis pathogenesis. Furthermore, our results have clarified the association between HLA and this form of vasculitis, and substantiated the role of another established giant cell arteritis-associated locus, the PLG gene.

To overcome the challenge of identifying the mechanisms underlying loci associated with giant cell arteritis, we conducted a comprehensive functional analysis of the results from the GWAS. This approach led to a considerable reduction in the number of variants that could reliably explain these associations, thus improving our ability to interpret their biological involvement. In the case of the HLA region, we have defined a set of five variants that adequately encompass the observed association within this highly complex region. For non-HLA loci, we identified the most credible causal variants with biological relevance, facilitating a focused analysis of the potential causal genes of these signals.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: A genome-wide association study [^113BjzTf]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis represents the most common form of vasculitis in Europe and North America, mainly affecting individuals aged 50 years and older. This type of large-vessel vasculitis primarily impacts the aorta and its branches, resulting in ischaemic complications if not promptly treated. Giant cell arteritis not only reduces the quality of life for affected individuals but also imposes a considerable socioeconomic burden on healthcare systems, given the high healthcare costs associated with disease complications, such as blindness, cerebrovascular accidents, and aortic aneurysms, as well as glucocorticoid toxicity.

The cause of giant cell arteritis is complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Previous attempts to uncover the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis through large-scale genetic approaches led to the identification of two loci associated with the disease, P4HA2 and PLG, substantiating the crucial involvement of the HLA region in disease susceptibility. The identified signals indicated a genetic contribution of the angiogenesis process in disease pathogenesis, further supporting the proposed role of this mechanism in giant cell arteritis.

- **Research in context**:

- **Evidence before this study**: Giant cell arteritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a strong genetic component that remains poorly understood. Our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of this chronic large-vessel vasculitis limits our ability to identify new therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and preventive strategies. Previous research has shown that genome-wide…

### Giant cell arteritis: The experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^1145v2LZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). High credibility.

With the aim of targeting the immune abnormalities underlying both the extravascular and vasculogenic components of giant cell arteritis (GCA), many different therapeutic agents have been proposed. These include immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, and mycophenolate mofetil, as well as TNF-α inhibitors like infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, abatacept, and rituximab. A survey of the results achieved with their administration, mostly in patients with difficult-to-treat GCA and in small series, can be found in recent reviews.

While, overall, the results of treatment have been disappointing, an encouraging exception is biologic therapy using tocilizumab (TCZ). This has been shown in a trial setting to be effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in GCA patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial (GiACTA trial), TCZ combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was shown to be significantly superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo, in terms of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission. Furthermore, when TCZ was included as add-on therapy to glucocorticoids during the first 3 months of treatment, at week 26 the primary endpoint of remaining in remission with ≤ 0.1 mg prednisone/kg/day was met by 75% of the patients, although half experienced relapse during the 9 months following TCZ discontinuation.

Finally, in an observational, retrospective, multicenter study carried out on patients with GCA refractory to conventional therapy, 94% achieved prompt and persistent clinical improvement one month after TCZ introduction. Infections were the most common adverse event.

### Giant cell arteritis: Epidemiological clues to its pathogenesis and an update on its treatment [^1112neLV]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a chronic systemic vasculitis with a marked female predominance, restricted to older age. The disease primarily targets large and medium-sized arteries, with a preference for the aorta and its extracranial branches. Morphological observations have shown that the age and sex distribution of GCA is related to degenerative changes in the arterial wall. GCA is not truly infectious vasculitis; however, infections may act as triggering factors.

Different centers have reported an increase in GCA incidence, though annual fluctuations have not been statistically significant. Nonetheless, several groups have observed significant seasonal variations. While mortality is not increased in adequately treated patients, corticosteroids remain the first line of treatment, despite proposals for alternative steroid-sparing agents.

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^1171oKoR]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: In polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) studies, glucocorticoid tapering and discontinuation were the most commonly used outcomes. In giant cell arteritis (GCA) trials, disease activity parameters were prioritized as endpoints. No randomized controlled trial has yet investigated a treat to target strategy in PMR and GCA.

### Neurologic manifestations of giant cell arteritis [^113vJTDg]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis, the most frequent form of vasculitis in persons over 50 years of age, is a granulomatous chronic vasculitis involving large and medium-sized vessels, most commonly the temporal and other cranial arteries. This common, treatable condition is associated with various clinical symptoms, including neurological ones, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this review, we discuss the cranial and extracranial neurological complications of giant cell arteritis to help avoid the many pitfalls in the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis.

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^111hyAeC]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: In studies on polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), glucocorticoid (GC)-related outcomes such as cumulative GC dose, GC discontinuation, GC duration, or a specific GC target dose were the most common treatment targets (90.9%); remission and relapse were addressed in only half of the studies. In contrast, prevention of relapses, achievement of remission, and cumulative GC dosage were the most frequent targets in trials of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

	- The preference for GC-related outcomes in PMR and outcomes related to disease activity in GCA remains subject to speculation. One explanation could be that disease activity in PMR is difficult to assess due to the presence of comorbidities affecting or mimicking PMR symptoms. Another reason could be the observation that PMR does not independently cause long-term organ damage, while it significantly impacts quality of life when active; however, the majority of patients experience adverse events related to long-term GC therapy. Therefore, reducing glucocorticoids is an important therapeutic goal in PMR. In GCA, disease activity can potentially lead to vascular and organ damage if not adequately treated.

### Combined treatment of giant-cell arteritis with methotrexate and prednisone. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117YG7ry]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). High credibility.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy for giant-cell arteritis, but relapse during dose tapering and corticosteroid-related adverse events often complicate management of this condition. Although several approaches, including combined therapy with cytotoxic agents, have been suggested to overcome these problems, no study has clearly shown the benefits of alternate treatments.

- **Objective**: To analyze the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with corticosteroids and methotrexate in giant-cell arteritis.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: University-based clinic.

- **Patients**: 42 patients with new-onset giant-cell arteritis according to biopsy.

- **Intervention**: High initial doses of corticosteroid were administered; the dose was then tapered quickly until therapy was completely withdrawn. Methotrexate or placebo was given weekly from the start of corticosteroid therapy for 24 months.

- **Measurements**: Number of relapses, cumulative dose of corticosteroid, and number of adverse events were assessed on completion of follow-up.

- **Results**: Compared with combined prednisone and placebo therapy, treatment with prednisone and methotrexate reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one relapse (45% vs. 84.2%; P = 0.02) and the proportion of patients who experienced multiple relapses (P = 0.004). The mean cumulative dose of prednisone was 4187 ± 1529 mg in the methotrexate group and 5489.5 ± 1396 mg in the placebo group (mean difference, 1302 mg [95% CI, 350 to 2253 mg]; P = 0.009). Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events…

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^111AS2VW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can result in a wide range of symptoms due to the extensive distribution of the external carotid artery. Face and neck swelling, as well as trismus, are under-recognized features of giant cell arteritis and can present as the initial symptoms prior to the development of classical temporal tenderness and jaw claudication. The lack of awareness of these less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss. In this paper, we present a case of neck swelling and airway narrowing as the initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis.

The genetic basis of giant cell arteritis is not fully understood but may play a role in treatment resistance and increased risk of ischaemic complications, including permanent vision loss. We present two of five cases of familial giant cell arteritis (2.5%) among 198 temporal artery biopsy-positive patients seen at a single institution over a 20-year period between 2003 and 2023. This highlights the importance of further genetic studies in this group of patients to improve timely diagnosis, management, and detection of patients at greatest risk for ischaemic sequelae.

### Management of relapses in giant cell arteritis [^11166LZB]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a relapsing large vessel vasculitis with the risk of serious ischemic manifestations, including vision loss and vascular damage in the form of large artery stenosis, aneurysms, and dissections. Approximately 50% of patients treated with glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy and 30% of patients receiving adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab experience disease relapses, often during the first 2 years after diagnosis.

Although most relapses in GCA do not involve life- or organ-threatening presentations and can be controlled successfully, frequent relapses may lead to increased prescription of GC and consequent treatment-related morbidity, in addition to the risk of further vascular damage. Emerging data suggest that persistent disease activity may lead to increased vascular morbidity. Additionally, although tocilizumab decreases the frequency of relapses, more than 50% of patients relapse after discontinuation of therapy. Therefore, although interleukin-6 blockade suppresses disease activity, it does not restore tolerance.

In this article, we discuss the practical diagnosis and management of GCA relapses from an expert perspective. Treatment options for GCA relapses, including those recommended by international guidelines, and novel potential therapies are reviewed.

### Inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling suppresses pathogenic immune responses in medium and large vessel vasculitis [^111eqYHP]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis, a chronic autoimmune disease of the aorta and its large branches, is complicated by aneurysm formation, dissection, and arterial occlusions. Arterial wall dendritic cells attract CD4+ T cells and macrophages to form prototypic granulomatous infiltrates. Vasculitic lesions contain a diverse array of effector T cells that persist despite corticosteroid therapy and sustain chronic, smoldering vasculitis. Transmural inflammation induces microvascular neoangiogenesis and results in lumen-occlusive intimal hyperplasia. We have examined whether persistent vessel wall inflammation is maintained by lesional T cells, including the newly identified tissue-resident memory T cells, and whether such T cells are sensitive to the cytokine-signaling inhibitor tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor targeting JAK3 and JAK1.

- **Methods**: Vascular inflammation was induced in human arteries engrafted into immunodeficient mice that were reconstituted with T cells and monocytes from patients with giant cell arteritis. Mice carrying inflamed human arteries were treated with tofacitinib or vehicle. Vasculitic arteries were examined for gene expression (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), protein expression (immunohistochemistry), and infiltrating cell populations (flow cytometry).

- **Results**: Tofacitinib effectively suppressed innate and adaptive immunity in the vessel wall. Lesional T cells responded to tofacitinib with reduced proliferation rates (< 10%) and minimal production of the effector molecules interferon-γ, interleukin-17, and interleukin-21.

### New-onset versus relapsing giant cell arteritis treated with tocilizumab: 3-year results from a randomized controlled trial and extension [^116LMNXK]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Subgroup analysis of the GiACTA part 1 suggested potential differences in tocilizumab efficacy between new-onset and relapsing disease. Specifically, data from part 1 indicated that tocilizumab dosed weekly (TCZ QW) or every other week (TCZ Q2W) was similarly effective at preventing flares and reducing glucocorticoid exposure at the week 52 time point in patients with new-onset disease. In contrast, TCZ QW was more effective than TCZ Q2W for these outcomes in patients with relapsing disease at baseline.

One consequence of these findings has been a reluctance among some clinicians to reserve the use of tocilizumab for patients with relapsing disease and instead treat patients with newly diagnosed giant cell arteritis (GCA) with prednisone monotherapy. Therefore, in the analysis, we investigated the maintenance of clinical remission, time to first flare, and cumulative glucocorticoid exposure separately for patients with new-onset and relapsing GCA at baseline over the 3-year period of the GiACTA clinical trial.

Additionally, data are limited regarding the effectiveness of different tocilizumab doses after one year of treatment in patients with new-onset and relapsing disease. Therefore, we also examined the effectiveness of TCZ QW compared with TCZ Q2W in both patient groups.

### Current management of giant cell arteritis and its complications [^111JEoyb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

This review provides an update on management strategies for giant cell arteritis (GCA), emphasizing the need for alternative therapies to reduce disease relapses and mitigate glucocorticoid (GC)-related morbidity.

Recent studies have explored faster GC tapering regimens to reduce adverse effects while maintaining disease control. Randomized clinical trials have highlighted the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in reducing disease flares and sparing GCs. However, the optimal treatment duration with TCZ is unknown, and patients remain at risk of relapse after treatment discontinuation. An unmet therapeutic need persists for patients who are not candidates for TCZ or have an inadequate response to this biologic.

- **Alternative therapies**: Investigations into therapies such as targeting interleukin-17A, blocking T-cell activation, or inhibiting the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway showcase potential avenues for tailored treatments.

While GCs remain the cornerstone of therapy, TCZ emerges as a promising GC-sparing agent. Ongoing research targeting different pathways implicated in GCA pathogenesis has led to encouraging results. However, the preliminary nature of these findings necessitates larger randomized controlled trials to establish their efficacy conclusively.

### Large vessel giant cell arteritis [^112hS23Q]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is the principal form of systemic vasculitis affecting people over 50. Large-vessel involvement, termed large vessel giant cell arteritis, mainly affects the aorta and its branches and often occurs alongside cranial giant cell arteritis, though it can also occur without it. Patients mostly present with constitutional symptoms, and symptoms specific to large vessel giant cell arteritis are present in only a minority of patients.

Large vessel giant cell arteritis is usually overlooked until clinicians seek to exclude it with imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT. Although the role of imaging in treatment monitoring remains uncertain, imaging by MRA or CTA is crucial for identifying aortic aneurysm formation during patient follow-up.

In this series paper, we define the large vessel subset of giant cell arteritis and summarize its clinical challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research regarding the management of large vessel giant cell arteritis.

### Ocular ischaemic syndrome due to giant cell arteritis [^111w51fv]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis. It is classified as a large vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta and its branches. It has a reported prevalence of 19–25 cases per 100,000 people over the age of 50, with a preponderance for Caucasian women. GCA typically affects the second to fifth-order branches of the arteries arising from the arch of the aorta, especially those supplying the head and neck. It is of autoimmune etiology with an association with HLA-DR4 alleles.

The pathophysiology is thought to be driven by the recruitment of Th1 CD4+ T-lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages in a granulomatous process. This results in both systemic and local responses. Systemic response arises through the release of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 by activated monocytes. Local effects may be seen histologically, where GCA presents with skip lesions causing fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, presence of multinucleated giant cells, and inflammatory involvement of all layers of the arterial wall.

Clinically, systemic effects result in malaise, myalgia, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Local effects are dependent on the distribution of affected arteries. These may include new onset headache with or without scalp tenderness due to superficial temporal artery involvement, jaw claudication with internal maxillary involvement, and vision loss with ophthalmic artery involvement and their branches. Additionally, GCA may affect the aorta, posing risks of aneurysm formation, aortitis, stenosis, and dissection.

### Varicella zoster virus and giant cell arteritis [^112SMx9s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a serious disease and the most common cause of vasculitis in the elderly. This review examines studies describing the recent discovery of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the temporal arteries of patients with GCA.

- **Recent findings**: GCA is characterized by severe headache, scalp tenderness, and other symptoms such as vision loss, jaw claudication, polymyalgia rheumatica, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Diagnostic markers include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels. Diagnosis is confirmed via temporal artery biopsy, which shows vessel wall damage and inflammation, often with multinucleated giant cells and/or epithelioid macrophages. Skip lesions are common, but temporal artery biopsies may be pathologically negative in many clinically suspect cases. Recent virological analysis reveals that VZV is present in most GCA-positive and GCA-negative temporal artery biopsies, especially in skip areas that correlate with adjacent GCA disease.

- **Summary**: The presence of VZV in both GCA-positive and GCA-negative temporal arteries suggests a possible role of VZV in triggering the immunopathology of GCA. This indicates that both groups of patients should be treated with antivirals in addition to corticosteroids.

### Development of a diagnostic prediction model for giant cell arteritis by sequential application of Southend Giant Cell Arteritis Probability Score and ultrasonography: a prospective multicentre study [^112R8GxU]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a critically ischemic disease with diverse manifestations that require urgent diagnosis and treatment. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommends ultrasonography as the first investigation for suspected giant cell arteritis. We developed a prediction tool that sequentially combines clinical assessment, as determined by the Southend Giant Cell Arteritis Probability Score (SGCAPS), with results of quantitative ultrasonography.

- **Methods**: This prospective, multicentre, inception cohort study included consecutive patients with suspected new onset giant cell arteritis who were referred to fast-track clinics across seven centers in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. The final clinical diagnosis was established at 6 months. At diagnosis, SGCAPS and quantitative ultrasonography of temporal and axillary arteries with three scores (i.e. halo count, halo score, and OMERACT GCA Score [OGUS]) were performed. We developed prediction models for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis using multivariable logistic regression analysis with SGCAPS and each of the three ultrasonographic scores as predicting variables. We obtained the intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-rater and intra-rater reliability in a separate patient-based reliability exercise involving five patients and five observers.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 1, 2019, and June 30, 2022, we recruited and followed up with 229 patients, comprising 150 (66%) women and 79 (34%) men, with a mean age of 71 years (SD 10). Of these patients, 84 were diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and 145 with conditions mimicking giant cell arteritis.

### Infliximab for maintenance of glucocorticosteroid-induced remission of giant cell arteritis: a randomized trial [^113Z3gjx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is present in arteries in giant cell arteritis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agent, in giant cell arteritis.

- **Design**: Randomized, controlled trial.
- **Setting**: 22 sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and Spain.
- **Patients**: 44 patients with newly diagnosed giant cell arteritis that was in glucocorticosteroid-induced remission.
- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive infliximab (5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo. Sixteen patients were assigned to glucocorticosteroid plus placebo, and 28 patients to glucocorticosteroid plus infliximab.
- **Measurements**: End points were measured through week 22, when an interim analysis resulted in early stopping of the planned 54-week trial. Primary endpoints were the number of patients who remained free of relapse through week 22 and adverse events. Secondary endpoints were time to first relapse, biomarkers, cumulative glucocorticosteroid dose, and the number of patients who remained relapse-free while the glucocorticosteroid dosage was tapered to 10 mg/d.

Results show infliximab therapy did not increase the proportion of patients without relapse at week 22 compared with placebo (43% vs. 50%, respectively; difference, -7 percentage points [95% CI, -38 to 23 percentage points; P = 0.65]), nor did it increase the proportion of patients whose glucocorticosteroid dosages were tapered to 10 mg/d without relapse (61% vs. 75%, respectively; difference, -14 percentage points [CI, -42 to 14 percent]).

### Long-term effect of tocilizumab in patients with giant cell arteritis: Open-label extension phase of the Giant Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial [^115joWrk]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The combination of tocilizumab plus a glucocorticoid taper is effective in maintaining clinical remission without requiring additional glucocorticoid therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis, as shown in part one of the Giant Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial. However, the duration of the tocilizumab effect after discontinuation is unknown. Here, we explored the maintenance of efficacy 1 year after discontinuation of tocilizumab treatment, the effectiveness of retreatment with tocilizumab after relapse, and the long-term glucocorticoid-sparing effect of tocilizumab.

- **Methods**: In part one of the GiACTA trial, 251 patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (162 mg) once a week or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. Patients in clinical remission stopped masked injections at 1 year (the conclusion of part one). In part two, treatment was at the investigators' discretion and could consist of no treatment, tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, or combinations of these, for two years. Maintenance of efficacy as assessed by clinical remission (defined as absence of relapse determined by the investigator), cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and long-term safety were exploratory objectives in part two of the trial. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01791153.

- **Findings**: 215 patients participated in part two of the trial; 81 patients who were randomly assigned to tocilizumab once a week in part one.

### Giant cell arteritis following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1133UvHy]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis characterized by arterial inflammation, with permanent vision loss being a feared complication. The association between GCA and viral infections is well-known, but there is limited data regarding its relationship to COVID-19. A man in his 80s with a recent history of COVID-19 developed sudden vision loss, persistent headaches, and jaw claudication. Ophthalmological findings raised the suspicion of a GCA diagnosis, which was confirmed by temporal artery biopsy. Treatment with prednisone stabilized vision and resolved systemic symptoms. Reports suggest a potential temporal correlation between GCA onset and COVID-19 infection, warranting further investigation into potential mechanisms and clinical implications. This case supports an infectious trigger for GCA, which is a leading theory regarding its pathogenesis.

### Aspirin as adjunctive treatment for giant cell arteritis [^114N7cMb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common inflammatory condition that affects medium and large-sized arteries and can cause sudden, permanent blindness. At present, there is no alternative to early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids as the recommended standard management. Corticosteroid-induced side effects can develop, and further disease-related ischemic complications can still occur. Therefore, alternative and adjunctive therapies are being sought. Aspirin has been shown to affect the immune-mediated inflammation in GCA; hence, it may reduce damage caused in the arterial wall.

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and effectiveness of low-dose aspirin, as an adjunctive, in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2013, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (www.fda.gov). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 24 January 2014.

### A phase 3 trial of upadacitinib for giant-cell arteritis [^111dYpqd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Giant-cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis with limited treatment options. The efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, a selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks the signaling of several cytokines, including interleukin-6 and interferon-γ, are unknown in patients with giant-cell arteritis.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with new-onset or relapsing giant-cell arteritis, in a 2:1:1 ratio, to receive upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg or 7.5 mg orally once daily plus a 26-week glucocorticoid taper or placebo plus a 52-week glucocorticoid taper. The primary end point was sustained remission at week 52, defined by the absence of signs or symptoms of giant-cell arteritis from week 12 through week 52 and adherence to the protocol-specified glucocorticoid taper.

- **Results**: A total of 209 patients received upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg, 107 received upadacitinib at a dose of 7.5 mg, and 112 received placebo. Seventy percent of the patients had new-onset giant-cell arteritis. Upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg showed superiority over placebo with respect to the primary end point (46.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 39.6 to 53.2] vs. 29.0% [95% CI, 20.6 to 37.5]; P = 0.002). Upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg was superior to placebo in the analysis of the hierarchically prespecified and multiplicity-controlled key secondary end points of sustained complete remission, time to a disease flare, cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, and patient-reported outcomes. Upadacitinib at a dose of 7.5 mg was not superior to placebo with respect to the primary end point.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^114Aq73E]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis that affects large-sized and medium-sized vessels, including the aorta and branches of the external carotid arteries. Histologically, it is characterized by a granulomatous process with infiltration of multinucleated cells, causing elastic lamina destruction and adventitial fibrosis. The inflammatory process is reflected in blood tests as a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is based on the American College of Rheumatology's 1990 guideline, with the presence of three or more criteria out of five.

Giant cell arteritis is common in the elderly population, with an estimated incidence rate of 15–30 cases per 100,000 individuals. Due to the numerous structures supplied by the aorta and the external carotid arteries, giant cell arteritis can produce a broad range of symptoms. The most common symptoms include fatigue, fever, headache, mastication pain, and visual changes.

Facial and neck swelling is a subtle change that may feature early and insidiously in giant cell arteritis, although it is seldom reported. Other otolaryngologic symptoms include cough, trismus, sore throat, voice changes, dysphagia, hearing loss, and tongue claudication. Aortic involvement can produce thoracic pain, limb swelling, and thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection.

The lack of awareness of the less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss.

### Identification of herpes zoster-associated temporal arteritis among cases of giant cell arteritis [^1127saWr]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most informative case in our series was Case #3, involving a 78-year-old patient with an unusual and informative history (Figure 2). The patient first developed left trigeminal neuralgia in early June. She also experienced scalp tenderness and headaches. She was seen in the general ophthalmology clinic, and a left temporal artery biopsy was obtained on June 30. Examination of the H&E-stained temporal artery biopsy was negative for giant cell arteritis (GCA). Although she was not given systemic corticosteroid treatment, her headaches and neuralgia lessened.

During the first two days of December, she noticed vesicular lesions in her left hairline. She was seen in the dermatology clinic on December 3, where herpes zoster of cranial nerve V1 was diagnosed, without any ocular involvement. She received a prescription for seven days of valacyclovir. The zoster rash abated with antiviral treatment, without the development of postherpetic neuralgia.

On December 16, she was seen in the rheumatology clinic due to worsening jaw pain. The rheumatologist noted her history concerning a negative temporal artery biopsy in June and ordered a right temporal artery biopsy, which was performed on December 19. The second biopsy was read as positive for GCA, and the patient was placed on prednisone therapy. The slides adjacent to the H&E slides from June 30 and December 19 were retrieved and immunolabeled for herpes zoster antigen detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The slide from June 30 was negative, but the slide from December 19 was positive for zoster antigen (Figure 2, Top row).

### Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of giant cell arteritis [^115RBwzu]. The Lancet. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Considerable variability exists in the way that health-care providers treat patients with giant cell arteritis in Latin America, with patients commonly exposed to excessive amounts of glucocorticoids. In addition, large health disparities prevail in this region due to socioeconomic factors, which influence access to care, including biological treatments. For these reasons, the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology developed the first evidence-based giant cell arteritis treatment guidelines tailored for Latin America.

A panel of vasculitis experts from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina generated clinically meaningful questions related to the treatment of giant cell arteritis in the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) format. Following the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation methodology, a team of methodologists conducted a systematic literature search, extracted and summarized the effects of the interventions, and graded the quality of the evidence. The panel of vasculitis experts voted on each PICO question and made recommendations, which required at least 70% agreement among the voting members to be included in the guidelines.

Nine recommendations and one expert opinion statement for the treatment of giant cell arteritis were developed considering the most up-to-date evidence and the socioeconomic characteristics of Latin America. These recommendations include guidance for the use of glucocorticoids, tocilizumab, methotrexate, and aspirin for patients with giant cell arteritis.

### Giant cell arteritis: The experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^116Zszvm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of GCA and PMR must take into account the disease course and the associated comorbidities. As noted above, MTX is frequently prescribed in conjunction with GCs, not only as a steroid-sparing therapy but also because of its demonstrated ability to reduce the risk of relapses. It seems, therefore, safe to state that the association of MTX with GCs is justified in both GCA and PMR patients with early relapse while tapering GCs, in those requiring long-term or more than 7.5–10 mg/day of maintenance prednisone equivalents after at least 3 months of sustained GC therapy, and in those experiencing unbearable GC-related side effects.

As mentioned before, the IL-6/IL-17 axis, which is mainly responsible for the extravascular inflammatory syndrome of GCA, is readily responsive to GCs. Conversely, the IL-12/IFN-γ axis is largely involved in vascular damage and is poorly responsive to these drugs. To overcome this discrepancy, adjunctive therapies such as aspirin/anticoagulants, hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (also known as statins), and angiotensin II receptor blockers (commonly defined as sartans) have been proposed. However, in the absence of randomized clinical trials, the evidence supporting their usefulness is circumstantial and overall disappointing.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: A genome-wide association study [^113K3dET]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

In this GWAS and meta-analysis of the largest cohort of patients with giant cell arteritis studied at the time of writing, we identified three novel loci associated with giant cell arteritis susceptibility. Through a comprehensive functional analysis, we identified relevant cell types and potential causal variants and prioritized genes involved in angiogenesis and neutrophil extracellular traps. Notably, we pinpointed several potentially repositionable drugs for giant cell arteritis treatment and developed a genetic risk model capable of identifying individuals at high risk of developing giant cell arteritis.

Enhancing our understanding of giant cell arteritis opens up opportunities for uncovering underlying disease mechanisms, thereby potentially advancing the clinical management of individuals with this type of vasculitis. Despite the research efforts invested in the past decade to elucidate the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis, the cause of the condition remains largely unknown, with fewer identified loci associated with disease risk compared with other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases with low prevalence, such as systemic sclerosis, Sjögren's disease, or even other vasculitides. The low prevalence of giant cell arteritis and the high statistical power necessary for genomic studies have imposed limitations on previous research, hindering substantial discoveries. Furthermore, the functional consequences of risk alleles associated with giant cell arteritis, as well as the potential causal genes and cell types, remain to be fully elucidated.

### Giant cell arteritis: strategies in diagnosis and treatment [^112799E3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

This review summarizes diagnostic assessments and therapeutic strategies in giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis, or temporal arteritis, is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-sized vessels. Symptoms of proximal muscular ache and morning stiffness, associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, are commonly observed. Recent investigations support the notion that polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are two different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder.

- **Recent findings**: The symptomatology of giant cell arteritis is quite variable. Recent studies have demonstrated a frequent occurrence of audiovestibular manifestations, which should be actively sought during clinical investigations. Although color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission tomography have shown the widespread nature of giant cell arteritis, none of these techniques currently replaces temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is a safe and straightforward procedure, remaining the gold standard for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. The importance of obtaining long biopsies and conducting meticulous histologic examination using sub-serial sectioning is emphasized. Numerous recent publications confirm the low diagnostic yield of a second, contralateral biopsy.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone in the treatment of giant cell arteritis. Although steroid treatment promptly alleviates symptoms of systemic inflammation, its effect on inflammatory morphology is delayed. Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies.

### Rinvoq [^113ri5U6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy and safety of Rinvoq 15 mg once daily were assessed in Trial GCA (NCT03725202), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in patients 50 years of age and older (81.8% were 65 years of age and older, 73.1% were female, 93.7% were white) with new-onset or relapsing giant cell arteritis. Trial GCA was a 52-week trial in which 428 patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio and dosed once daily with Rinvoq 15 mg, upadacitinib 7.5 mg, or placebo. All patients received background corticosteroid therapy. The Rinvoq and upadacitinib-treated groups followed a pre-specified corticosteroid taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified corticosteroid taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks.

The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at Week 52, as defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52 and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen. A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained complete remission at Week 52, as defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hsCRP from Week 12 through Week 52, and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen. The study included a 52-week extension for a total study duration of up to 2 years.

Clinical response and follow-up reports showed that Rinvoq 15 mg, with a 26-week corticosteroid taper regimen, was effective in maintaining patient health throughout the trial period.

### Assessment of giant cell arteritis-associated visual outcomes at a tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada [^111nAEyG]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

There are limited data concerning outcomes in those with giant cell arteritis-associated vision changes (GCA, GCAVCs). We estimated the association of intravenous, compared to oral, glucocorticoids with outcomes in GCAVCs.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary healthcare facility in Ontario, Canada. Individuals aged 50 years or older with an International Classification of Disease version 10 (ICD-10) diagnostic code for GCA, associated with a healthcare visit between November 2017 and December 2023, were identified for inclusion. Diagnoses of GCA were verified as the final diagnosis of the treating clinician and were required to be supported by histologic, radiographic, and/or biochemical evidence of inflammatory vasculopathy. GCAVCs were identified by clinical assessments. Treatment exposures were defined based on whether the individual was first exposed to intravenous or oral glucocorticoids. The primary outcome was reported visual improvement after treatment. We used logistic regression to estimate treatment effects, adjusting for demographic and disease factors.

In 289 individuals with GCA, 77 (26.6%) had GCAVCs. 70.1% of GCAVCs led to permanent vision loss, and visual recovery was seen in 16.0% of participants. We found no difference in outcomes for those first treated with intravenous versus oral glucocorticoids (adjusted odds ratios 0.43–1.72, 95% confidence interval range 0.02–123.68).

GCAVCs are common and frequently associated with permanent vision loss. While the precision of our results was limited by sample size.

### A randomized, double-blind trial of abatacept (CTLA-4Ig) for the treatment of giant cell arteritis [^115bkQYT]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of abatacept to that of placebo for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

- **Methods**: In this multicenter trial, patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA were treated with abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 15, 29, and week 8, along with daily prednisone. At week 12, patients in remission underwent double-blinded randomization to continue abatacept monthly or switch to placebo. Patients in both study arms received a standardized prednisone taper, with discontinuation at week 28. All patients remained on their assigned treatment until meeting criteria for early termination or until 12 months after the last patient's enrollment. The primary endpoint was the duration of remission (relapse-free survival rate).

- **Results**: Forty-nine eligible patients with GCA were enrolled and treated with prednisone and abatacept; 41 of these reached week 12 randomization and underwent blinded randomization to receive abatacept or placebo. Prednisone was tapered using a standardized schedule, reaching a daily dosage of 20 mg at week 12 with discontinuation in all patients at week 28. The relapse-free survival rate at 12 months was 48% for those receiving abatacept and 31% for those receiving placebo (P = 0.049). A longer median duration of remission was observed in the abatacept group compared to the placebo group (median duration 9.9 months versus 3.9 months; P = 0.023). No difference in the frequency or severity of adverse events, including infection, was found between the treatments.

### Giant-cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica [^113Waz8t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Giant-cell arteritis is an immune-mediated disease characterized by granulomatous infiltrates in the walls of medium-sized and large arteries. The immunopathology consists of two components: excessive cytokine production (e.g. interleukin-1 and interleukin-6) induces systemic inflammation with an exuberant acute-phase response; and interferon-gamma, released by T cells captured in the arterial wall, activates tissue-injurious macrophages. In response to the immune injury, the artery generates hyperplasia of the intima that leads to luminal occlusion and subsequent tissue ischemia.

Despite the systemic character of the disease, distinct vascular territories are preferentially affected. Based on this predominant involvement, clinical subtypes can be distinguished: cranial giant-cell arteritis with ischemic complications in the eye, face, and central nervous system; large-vessel giant-cell arteritis with occlusions in the subclavian or axillary vessels; aortic giant-cell arteritis; giant-cell arteritis presenting as an intense systemic inflammatory syndrome with nonstenosing vasculitis; and "isolated" polymyalgia rheumatica with myalgias, systemic inflammation, and subclinical vasculitis.

Temporal artery biopsy remains the diagnostic procedure of choice to detect arteritis in cranial vessels. In other vascular territories, giant-cell arteritis is most commonly diagnosed by vascular imaging. Laboratory studies characteristically document marked elevations of nonspecific acute-phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^1138z4vQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can result in a wide range of symptoms due to the extensive distribution of the external carotid artery. Face and neck swelling and trismus are under-recognized features of giant cell arteritis and can present as the initial symptom prior to the development of classical temporal tenderness and jaw claudication. The lack of awareness of the less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss. In this paper, we present a case of neck swelling and airway narrowing as the initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis.

### 2022 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR classification criteria for giant cell arteritis [^115TC6yp]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria for giant cell arteritis is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this condition. The criteria incorporate a combination of clinical, laboratory, imaging, and biopsy findings to provide a comprehensive assessment of the likelihood of giant cell arteritis.

- **Primary components**: The ACR/EULAR criteria include evidence of medium- or large-vessel vasculitis on imaging, exclusion of alternative diagnoses mimicking vasculitis, and age of 50 years or older at the time of diagnosis.
- **Clinical criteria**: These encompass morning stiffness in the shoulders or neck, sudden visual loss, jaw or tongue claudication, new temporal headache, scalp tenderness, and abnormal examination of the temporal artery.
- **Laboratory, imaging, and biopsy criteria**: These include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein levels, positive temporal artery biopsy or halo sign on temporal artery ultrasound, bilateral axillary involvement, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography activity throughout the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta.

The ACR/EULAR criteria are designed to provide a structured approach to the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, facilitating early recognition and treatment of this potentially sight-threatening condition.

### Giant cell arteritis: Is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing [^112oE7ns]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment. Some adjuvant therapies, such as methotrexate, have been used as glucocorticoid-sparing agents to minimize adverse effects, with conflicting results in terms of safety and clinical benefit. It is also recommended to use low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of associated cardiovascular events. More recently, open-label studies and clinical trials have shown that the use of tocilizumab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6, yields significant efficacy in achieving sustained, corticosteroid-independent remissions.

The aim of this report is to help physicians early recognize symptoms of GCA, with special emphasis on patients with atypical or extra-cranial manifestations ("occult" GCA), to perform an appropriate diagnosis. This is crucial to prevent severe complications.

### Trial of tocilizumab in giant-cell arteritis [^117MNgZB]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Giant-cell arteritis commonly relapses when glucocorticoids are tapered, and the prolonged use of glucocorticoids is associated with side effects. The effect of the interleukin-6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab on the rates of relapse during glucocorticoid tapering was studied in patients with giant-cell arteritis.

- **Methods**: In this 1-year trial, we randomly assigned 251 patients, in a 2:1:1:1 ratio, to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (at a dose of 162 mg) weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of sustained glucocorticoid-free remission at week 52 in each tocilizumab group as compared with the rate in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper. The key secondary outcome was the rate of remission in each tocilizumab group as compared with the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper. Dosing of prednisone and safety were also assessed.

- **Results**: Sustained remission at week 52 occurred in 56% of the patients treated with tocilizumab weekly and in 53% of those treated with tocilizumab every other week, as compared with 14% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 26-week prednisone taper and 18% of those in the placebo group that underwent the 52-week prednisone taper (P < 0.001 for the comparisons of either active treatment with placebo). The cumulative median prednisone dose over the 52-week period was 1862 mg in each tocilizumab group, as compared with 3296 mg in the placebo group.

### Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infections following messenger RNA-based COVID-19 vaccination [^112en6ui]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old woman with a history of giant cell arteritis and resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 months prior presented with a diffuse erythematous vesicular rash. Eighteen days ago, she completed a 20-week low-dose methylprednisolone taper for giant cell arteritis, initiated at 10 mg daily. Eight days before presentation, she received the first dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine; five days later, a pruritic skin eruption with associated daily fevers developed in her.

The examination demonstrated thin erythematous papules and vesicles over the forehead, trunk, and extremities (Fig 1, C and D). No antecedent dermatomal eruption was noted. Of note, the patient had received a live zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck) 10 years ago. Dermatopathology demonstrated papillary and mid-dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with admixed neutrophils and foci of lymphocytic vasculitis; findings of VZV immunohistochemistry were negative; however, findings of polymerase chain reaction from a sampled vesicle were positive for VZV DNA. The patient was initiated on oral valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily; the following day, she was admitted to the hospital for intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, every eight hours for five days). One week after hospital discharge, she had a near-complete resolution of her infection with diffuse postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. One week after completing valacyclovir, and four weeks after her first dose, she received the second vaccine dose without complications.

### Diagnostic accuracy of vascular ultrasound in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis (EUREKA): a prospective, multicentre, non-interventional, cohort study [^1135ke1J]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Temporal artery biopsy is considered the diagnostic gold standard for giant cell arteritis, despite approximately 39% of patients who are negative for the condition by biopsy subsequently being given a clinical diagnosis of giant cell arteritis. We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound examination in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, multicentre, non-interventional, cohort study (Evaluation of Ultrasound's Role in Patients Suspected of Having Extracranial and Cranial Giant Cell Arteritis; EUREKA), we consecutively recruited patients aged 50 years or older, with clinically suspected giant cell arteritis from three Danish hospitals (South West Jutland Hospital in Esbjerg, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup). Participants had a bilateral ultrasound of the temporal, facial, common carotid, and axillary arteries. Ultrasounds were done by ultrasonographers who were systematically trained in vascular ultrasound using appropriate equipment and settings. Participants then had a temporal artery biopsy within 7 days of initiation of corticosteroid treatment. A blinded ultrasound expert assessed all ultrasound images. Ultrasound vasculitis was defined in cranial arteries as a homogeneous, hypoechoic, intima-media complex thickness and a positive compression sign and as a homogeneous intima-media complex of 1 mm in thickness or wider in the axillary arteries and of 1.5 mm thickness or wider in the common carotid artery. Participants were followed up at 6 months.

### Atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis: A systematic review [^112pkbBT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can present with atypical manifestations that delay treatment and risk severe complications. This systematic review aims to comprehensively describe all atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

In our study, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to October 2022. We included primary research articles featuring at least one participant with an atypical sign or symptom of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis. Both study screening and data extraction were conducted in duplicate. The primary outcome examined was the proportion of participants exhibiting atypical giant cell arteritis features. We compared the time to treatment between participants presenting only atypical giant cell arteritis features and those with both typical and atypical features.

Of the 21,828 records screened, 429 studies encompassing 746 individuals (median [IQR] age 72 [IQR, 66–78] years, 63% female) with at least one atypical feature of giant cell arteritis were included. Eighty-two percent of individuals had both atypical and at least one conventional giant cell arteritis feature, while only 18% exhibited atypical features exclusively. Patients presenting with atypical symptoms sought clinical attention earlier than those exhibiting typical features (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between the groups regarding elevated ESR and CRP levels (82.3% vs. 83.35%, p = 0.91) or mortality rates (8.2% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.42). However, those with only atypical features experienced greater delays in treatment initiation (p < 0.001).

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: a genome-wide association study [^116qvi1R]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is an age-related vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its branches in individuals aged 50 years and older. Options for diagnosis and treatment are scarce, highlighting the need to better understand its underlying pathogenesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms involved in complex diseases. This study aimed to characterize the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis by performing the largest GWAS of this vasculitis at the time of writing and to assess the functional consequences and clinical implications of identified risk loci.

We collected and meta-analyzed genomic data from patients with giant cell arteritis and healthy controls of European ancestry from ten cohorts across Europe and North America. Eligible patients required confirmation of giant cell arteritis diagnosis by positive temporal artery biopsy, positive temporal artery Doppler ultrasonography, or imaging techniques confirming large-vessel vasculitis. We assessed the functional consequences of loci associated with giant cell arteritis using cell enrichment analysis, fine-mapping, and causal gene prioritization. In addition, we performed a drug repurposing analysis and developed a polygenic risk score to explore the clinical implications of our findings.

We included a total of 3,498 patients with giant cell arteritis and 15,550 controls. We identified three novel loci associated with the risk of giant cell arteritis. Two loci, MFGE8 (rs8029053; p = 4.96 × 10⁻⁸; OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.12–1.26]) and…

### Clinical practice: Giant-cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica [^112nnBrM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on giant cell arteritis (GCA):

- **Definition**: GCA is an inflammatory vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries, with a predilection for the temporal arteries.

- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with GCA, the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors causes pathologic activation of vascular dendritic cells, CD4 T cells, and macrophages, leading to granulomatous inflammation of the adventitia and hyperplasia of the intima. These vascular changes cause ischemic complications in tissues fed by medium and large-sized vessels.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of GCA is estimated at 18.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the prevalence is estimated at 228 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Ophthalmoplegia, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, central vision loss, stroke, and aortic aneurysm and rupture may occur as direct complications of vascular involvement.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Permanent vision loss occurs in approximately 15–20% of patients with GCA.
