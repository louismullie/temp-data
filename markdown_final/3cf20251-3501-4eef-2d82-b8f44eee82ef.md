## Question

bronchiectasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bronchiectasis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining bronchiectasis and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and severity stratification. Next, I will review core management principles, including airway clearance, antibiotics, and anti-inflammatory strategies. After that, I need to examine special populations and comorbidities, and finally, I should appraise the evidence quality and highlight knowledge gaps and future directions, making sure I cite the most authoritative guidelines and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and pathophysiology so I don't gloss over fundamentals. Bronchiectasis is abnormal, often irreversible dilation of the bronchi with impaired mucociliary clearance, chronic bacterial infection, and neutrophilic inflammation that perpetuate a vicious cycle of infection, inflammation, and structural damage, leading to progressive symptoms and decline in lung function.

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before moving to management. The diagnosis requires both clinical features such as chronic productive cough and recurrent infections, and radiologic confirmation with high-resolution chest CT showing bronchial dilation, and I should remember that standardized definitions for clinically significant bronchiectasis have been proposed to harmonize trial entry and clinical practice, which helps address heterogeneity in definitions across studies [^c68fe483].

> I need to check severity assessment next, because it guides intensity of therapy. The Bronchiectasis Severity Index and FACED incorporate age, FEV1, chronic Pseudomonas colonization, radiologic extent, dyspnea, BMI, exacerbation frequency, and hospitalizations, stratifying patients into risk groups and predicting mortality, hospitalizations, and quality of life impairment; this helps identify who merits aggressive therapy versus conservative follow-up [^4c842b06].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should confirm that identifying the cause is essential. Up to half of cases may be idiopathic, but identifiable causes include immunodeficiency, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, primary ciliary dyskinesia, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, and connective tissue disease; recognizing these can change management and prognosis, so I need to ensure appropriate testing is pursued when indicated [^fa98478e].

> Next, I should review airway clearance, since this is foundational. Let me think about the strength of evidence: while randomized trials are small and heterogeneous, systematic reviews and expert panels suggest airway clearance techniques improve sputum expectoration, symptoms, and quality of life, and guidelines recommend teaching and individualizing airway clearance; I should emphasize that technique selection should be tailored and adherence supported, with frequency adjusted to disease severity and secretions burden [^92023f8f] [^1ea57145] [^16c7c609].

> I will now examine mucoactive therapies, and I should double-check guideline positions. Inhaled hypertonic saline and other mucoactive agents can be considered when symptoms persist despite optimized airway clearance, though evidence quality varies; importantly, dornase alfa is not recommended in non-CF bronchiectasis due to lack of benefit or potential harm, so I need to avoid extrapolating CF therapies indiscriminately [^2cbd3b4f] [^2df8fdd2].

> Let me consider antibiotics for acute exacerbations, and I should confirm duration and severity criteria. Standard treatment is 10–14 days of antibiotics guided by prior sputum microbiology and local resistance patterns, with longer courses for severe disease or Pseudomonas; severe exacerbations warrant IV therapy and hospitalization when indicated, and I need to ensure sputum cultures are obtained before starting antibiotics when feasible [^a6b48a00] [^ac0a92df].

> Now, for chronic infection and exacerbation prevention, I should verify macrolide indications and risks. Long-term macrolides reduce exacerbation frequency and may slow FEV1 decline in selected adults with frequent exacerbations, but macrolide resistance emerges and audiovestibular toxicity can occur; thus, I should reserve this for patients with three or more exacerbations per year despite standard care and monitor for adverse effects and resistance [^6d7277bc] [^ab4d73a7] [^5ecd14dd].

> For inhaled antibiotics, I need to ensure I'm aligning with high-quality evidence. In adults with chronic Pseudomonas and high exacerbation risk despite standard care, long-term inhaled antibiotics reduce exacerbations and improve symptoms and quality of life; consideration is also reasonable for other chronic pathogens in high-risk patients, though benefits may be smaller and patient selection is key [^7bc06656] [^4b500e7e] [^4f83601c].

> But wait, what about anti-inflammatory therapy outside of specific indications. I should confirm that routine inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended in bronchiectasis without coexisting asthma or COPD, given lack of benefit and potential harms; similarly, oral corticosteroids, PDE4 inhibitors, leukotriene modifiers, and statins should not be used routinely, reserving steroids for conditions like ABPA or IBD-associated bronchiectasis when indicated [^bb5289be] [^5ecd14dd].

> I should review bronchodilators and pulmonary rehabilitation, and I need to ensure I don't overstate indications. Bronchodilators may be trialed in patients with significant breathlessness or coexisting obstructive disease, but evidence in isolated bronchiectasis is limited; pulmonary rehabilitation is recommended for patients with breathlessness or impaired exercise capacity, and I should incorporate exercise testing to quantify benefit and tailor programs [^d9c874f8] [^a3ea22f9].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with children. Pediatric bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized, and early disease may be reversible with aggressive management; therefore, I should prioritize early diagnosis, treatable trait identification, and intensive airway clearance, while avoiding therapies with negative pediatric data such as dornase alfa in non-CF bronchiectasis [^c6d37552] [^2df8fdd2].

> For COPD overlap, I should confirm that bronchiectasis is common and associated with more symptoms and exacerbations; management should follow bronchiectasis principles while optimizing COPD care, but I need to be cautious with ICS in the setting of bacterial colonization or recurrent infections, aligning with GOLD guidance [^b8abbc1c] [^5f201cd3].

> In severe, refractory disease, I need to check surgical and transplant criteria. Highly selected patients with localized disease unresponsive to optimized medical therapy may benefit from lung resection, and early referral for lung transplantation should be considered in those with rapidly progressive disease, very low FEV1, or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure despite best care [^b3514a6e].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up, and I need to ensure I cover both disease progression and complications. Annual or more frequent review should include symptoms, exacerbations, lung function, oxygenation, and sputum microbiology, with CT reserved for clinical deterioration or suspected complications; I should also screen for and manage comorbidities such as rhinosinusitis, GERD, and cardiovascular disease that impact outcomes [^b3514a6e] [^365cad53].

> I should double-check the strength of the evidence base and acknowledge limitations. Many recommendations rely on low-certainty evidence from small trials, and disease heterogeneity has hampered definitive conclusions; nonetheless, contemporary guidelines converge on airway clearance, selective antibiotics for chronic infection, macrolides in frequent exacerbators, and avoidance of routine ICS, which provides a pragmatic, safety-conscious framework while we await larger, phenotype-targeted trials [^b3514a6e] [^2df8fdd2].

> Finally, I need to ensure I address future directions and precision medicine. Emphasis is shifting toward treatable traits, biomarker-driven phenotyping, and endotyping to match therapies to the right patients, and ongoing trials of anti-inflammatory, anti-infective, and mucoactive agents may refine care; I should also highlight the need for standardized endpoints, better patient-reported outcomes, and long-term safety data to close current evidence gaps [^c2ac9b96] [^dc9ce053] [^bafe6e47].

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by **irreversible bronchial dilation** with chronic cough, sputum production, and recurrent infections. Diagnosis relies on **high-resolution CT** [^c68fe483] to confirm airway dilation and exclude mimics. Management centers on **airway clearance** [^1ea57145], prompt treatment of exacerbations [^a6b48a00], and targeted antibiotics for chronic infection [^7bc06656]; long-term macrolides [^6d7277bc] or inhaled antibiotics [^4b500e7e] are considered for frequent exacerbations. Prognosis varies with severity and etiology [^fa98478e], and **early diagnosis with structured care** improves outcomes [^b3514a6e].

---

## Pathophysiology

Bronchiectasis arises from a **vicious cycle** of infection, inflammation, and structural injury [^a5f7d6ee]:

- **Infection**: Persistent bacterial colonization (commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae) drives neutrophilic inflammation and tissue damage [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Inflammation**: Chronic neutrophilic inflammation causes bronchial wall thickening, fibrosis, and dilation [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Impaired clearance**: Mucociliary dysfunction and viscous secretions perpetuate infection and inflammation [^a5f7d6ee].

---

## Etiology

Bronchiectasis is **heterogeneous**; identifying the cause guides management [^fa98478e]:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Infectious | - Post-infectious (tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia) [^fa98478e] <br/> - HIV/AIDS [^notfound] |
| Immunodeficiency | - Primary immunodeficiencies (CVID, IgG subclass deficiencies) [^fa98478e] <br/> - Secondary immunodeficiency (chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy) [^notfound] |
| Genetic/congenital | - Cystic fibrosis [^a5f7d6ee] <br/> - Primary ciliary dyskinesia [^c1ecc43d] <br/> - Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [^26b63776] |
| Autoimmune/inflammatory | - Rheumatoid arthritis [^365cad53] <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease [^365cad53] <br/> - Sjögren's syndrome [^notfound] |
| Obstructive | - Foreign body aspiration [^103c2c7f] <br/> - Tumors [^103c2c7f] <br/> - Congenital airway anomalies [^notfound] |
| Idiopathic | - No identifiable cause despite thorough evaluation [^fa98478e] |

---

## Clinical presentation

Typical features include:

- **Chronic productive cough**: Daily, copious sputum production [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Recurrent infections**: Frequent lower respiratory tract infections [^a5f7d6ee].
- **Hemoptysis**: Ranging from mild to life-threatening [^3c7f2f8f].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fatigue, weight loss, and dyspnea [^3c7f2f8f].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis and severity assessment require a **multimodal approach**:

- **High-resolution CT (HRCT)**: Gold standard for confirming bronchial dilation and excluding mimics [^c68fe483].
- **Pulmonary function tests**: Typically obstructive, but may be normal or restrictive [^fa98478e].
- **Microbiology**: Sputum cultures to identify pathogens and guide therapy [^ac0a92df].
- **Etiologic workup**: Immunoglobulin levels, CF testing, autoimmune screening, and imaging for obstruction [^fa98478e].

---

## Management

Management is **multidisciplinary** and individualized:

- **Airway clearance**: Cornerstone therapy; techniques include postural drainage, PEP devices, and oscillatory devices [^1ea57145] [^92023f8f].
- **Antibiotics**: Acute exacerbations require 10–14 days of antibiotics guided by prior cultures [^a6b48a00]; chronic macrolides or inhaled antibiotics reduce exacerbations in selected patients [^6d7277bc] [^7bc06656].
- **Treatable traits**: Address underlying causes (e.g. immunoglobulin replacement, CFTR modulators, anti-NTM therapy) [^fa98478e].
- **Vaccinations**: Influenza, pneumococcal, and pertussis vaccines recommended [^e630569a].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for localized disease refractory to medical therapy or massive hemoptysis [^b3514a6e].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with severity, etiology, and comorbidities [^4c842b06]. Mild disease may have a **near-normal life expectancy**, whereas severe disease carries increased risks of exacerbations, respiratory failure, and mortality [^87b1ea77]. Early diagnosis, structured care, and adherence to therapy improve outcomes [^b3514a6e].

---

Bronchiectasis is a chronic, heterogeneous disease with a **multifactorial etiology** and a progressive course [^a5f7d6ee]. Modern management emphasizes **early diagnosis**, airway clearance, targeted antibiotics, and a treatable-traits approach to improve symptoms, reduce exacerbations, and preserve lung function [^b3514a6e].

### Bronchiectasis: new therapies and new perspectives [^dc9ce053]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

European Respiratory Society guidelines for the management of adult bronchiectasis highlight the paucity of treatment options available for patients with this disorder. No treatments have been licensed by regulatory agencies worldwide, and most therapies used in clinical practice are based on very little evidence. Development of new treatments is needed urgently. We did a systematic review of scientific literature and clinical trial registries to identify agents in early-to-late clinical development for bronchiectasis in adults. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms and potential roles of emerging therapies, including drugs that target airway and systemic inflammation, mucociliary clearance, and epithelial dysfunction. To ensure these treatments achieve success in randomised clinical trials-and therefore reach patients-we propose a reassessment of the current approach to bronchiectasis. Although understanding of the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis is at an early stage, we argue that bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous disease with many different biological mechanisms that drive disease progression (endotypes), and therefore the so-called treatable traits approach used in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease could be applied to bronchiectasis, with future trials targeted at the specific disease subgroups most likely to benefit.

### European Respiratory Society clinical practice guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis [^b3514a6e]. The European Respiratory Journal (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following investigations and management in a deteriorating patient:

- obtain a comprehensive re-evaluation of patients and their treatment in cases of clinical deterioration, including increasing exacerbation frequency and/or severity, worsening of symptoms, and/or rapid decline in lung function

- evaluate adherence to both airway clearance techniques and/or pharmacological treatment

- review underlying diseases other than bronchiectasis to ensure they are being adequately treated

- consider obtaining investigation for specific conditions known to be associated with deterioration, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, or infection with a new pathogen

- recognize that early diagnosis of bronchiectasis, accurate identification and treatment of its underlying cause, adequate management of chronic airway infection, and interventions to prevent exacerbations and control disease may delay disease progression

- obtain repeat chest CT imaging to identify several potential causes of deterioration

- obtain repeat testing for nontuberculous mycobacterial infection when there are suggestive clinical or radiologic features, particularly in patients who deteriorate despite appropriate antibiotics

- refer deteriorating patients who are not already under the care of a bronchiectasis specialist to a respiratory clinic with expertise in bronchiectasis

- review and optimize current treatment using a "treatable traits" approach. This includes, but is not limited to, treatment directed at the underlying etiology of the patient's bronchiectasis, airway clearance and mucoactive treatments, vaccination status, long-term (inhaled or oral) antibiotic treatment, P. aeruginosa eradication treatment, long-term inhaled bronchodilator and corticosteroid treatment, pulmonary rehabilitation, oxygen therapy, and non-invasive ventilatory support where appropriate

- consider offering lung resection in highly selected patients with localized disease whose symptoms are not controlled by medical treatment optimized by a bronchiectasis specialist

- recognize that early referral for lung transplantation is essential in patients with progressive disease despite optimal medical management. This may include rapidly declining forced expiratory volume in one second or forced expiratory volume in one second ≤ 30% predicted, and/or arterial CO₂ pressure ≥ 50 mmHg. (conditional recommendation for the intervention, very low certainty of evidence).

### Bronchiectasis [^a5f7d6ee]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to abnormal dilatation of the bronchi. Airway dilatation can lead to failure of mucus clearance and increased risk of infection. Pathophysiological mechanisms of bronchiectasis include persistent bacterial infections, dysregulated immune responses, impaired mucociliary clearance and airway obstruction. These mechanisms can interact and self-perpetuate, leading over time to impaired lung function. Patients commonly present with productive cough and recurrent chest infections, and the diagnosis of bronchiectasis is based on clinical symptoms and radiological findings. Bronchiectasis can be the result of several different underlying disorders, and identifying the aetiology is crucial to guide management. Treatment is directed at reducing the frequency of exacerbations, improving quality of life and preventing disease progression. Although no therapy is licensed for bronchiectasis by regulatory agencies, evidence supports the effectiveness of airway clearance techniques, antibiotics and mucolytic agents, such as inhaled isotonic or hypertonic saline, in some patients. Bronchiectasis is a disabling disease with an increasing prevalence and can affect individuals of any age. A major challenge is the application of emerging phenotyping and endotyping techniques to identify the patient populations who would most benefit from a specific treatment, with the goal of better targeting existing and emerging treatments and achieving better outcomes.

### Bronchiectasis in children: diagnosis and treatment [^c6d37552]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Bronchiectasis is conventionally defined as irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. Bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis is an increasingly appreciated cause of chronic respiratory-related morbidity worldwide. Few randomised controlled trials provide high-level evidence for management strategies to treat the children affected by bronchiectasis. However, both decades-old and more recent studies using technological advances support the notion that prompt diagnosis and optimal management of paediatric bronchiectasis is particularly important in early childhood. Although considered to be of a non-reversible nature, mild bronchiectasis determined by radiography might be reversible at any age if treated early, and the lung function decline associated with disease progression could then be halted. Although some management strategies are extrapolated from cystic fibrosis or adult-based studies, or both, non-cystic fibrosis paediatric-specific data to help diagnose and manage these children still need to be generated. We present current knowledge and an updated definition of bronchiectasis, and review controversies relating to the management of children with bronchiectasis, including applying the concept of so-called treatable traits.

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^bc0be702]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease characterised by recurrent infection, inflammation, persistent cough and sputum production. The disease is increasing in prevalence, requiring a greater awareness of the disease across primary and secondary care. Mild and moderate cases of bronchiectasis in adults can often be managed by primary care clinicians. Initial assessments and long-term treatment plans that include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, however, should be undertaken in collaboration with a secondary care team that includes physiotherapists and specialists in respiratory medicine. Bronchiectasis is often identified in patients with other lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and in a lesser but not insignificant number of patients with other inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Overall goals of therapy are to prevent exacerbations, improve symptoms, improve quality of life and preserve lung function. Prompt treatment of exacerbations with antibiotic therapy is important to limit the impact of exacerbations on quality of life and lung function decline. Patient education and cooperation with health-care providers to implement treatment plans are key to successful disease management. It is important for the primary care provider to work with secondary care providers to develop an individualised treatment plan to optimise care with the goal to delay disease progression. Here, we review the diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis with a focus on practical considerations that will be useful to primary care.

### Erdosteine in children and adults with bronchiectasis (BETTER trial): study protocol for a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial [^b68542e7]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

As few RCTs target people with bronchiectasis, current pulmonary management is largely extrapolated from CF-based studies. Given the different pathobiological mechanisms between these conditions, there is a risk that some therapies beneficial for people with CF might have little benefit, or worse be detrimental to people with bronchiectasis, as shown by dornase-alfa in those with idiopathic bronchiectasis. Our RCT tests a therapeutic agent based on a sound scientific rationale and addresses some of these unmet needs by employing a novel mucoactive agent (erdosteine).

Our RCT focuses on children and young adults for several important reasons: (1) intervening in early disease may arrest disease progressionand (2) to limit the heterogeneity of bronchiectasis (by not including older adults who can have different underlying aetiologies and more comorbidities). Importantly, radiographic bronchiectasis in children (likely also in young adults) is reversible if treated early, thereby avoiding the later progressive decline in lung function. In contrast, adults with bronchiectasis symptoms from childhood have worse disease and poorer prognosis (c.f. adult-onset bronchiectasis). Thus, focusing on a younger age group will likely provide a greater impact on reducing future disease burden.

### Inhaled corticosteroids for bronchiectasis [^fbf0b32d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is being increasingly diagnosed and recognised as an important contributor to chronic lung disease in both adults and children in high- and low-income countries. It is characterised by irreversible dilatation of airways and is generally associated with airway inflammation and chronic bacterial infection. Medical management largely aims to reduce morbidity by controlling the symptoms, reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life and prevent the progression of bronchiectasis. This is an update of a review first published in 2000.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with stable state bronchiectasis, specifically to assess whether the use of ICS: (1) reduces the severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations; or (2) affects long-term pulmonary function decline.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, MEDLINE and Embase databases. We ran the latest literature search in June 2017.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICS with a placebo or no medication. We included children and adults with clinical or radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis, but excluded people with cystic fibrosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We reviewed search results against predetermined criteria for inclusion. In this update, two independent review authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro forma. We analysed treatment as 'treatment received' and performed sensitivity analyses.

Main Results

The review included seven studies, involving 380 adults. Of the 380 randomised participants, 348 completed the studies. Due to differences in outcomes reported among the seven studies, we could only perform limited meta-analysis for both the short-term ICS use (6 months or less) and the longer-term ICS use (> 6 months). During stable state in the short-term group (ICS for 6 months or less), based on the two studies from which data could be included, there were no significant differences from baseline values in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV₁) at the end of the study (mean difference (MD) -0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.09) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 0.01 L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.17) in adults on ICS (compared to no ICS). Similarly, we did not find any significant difference in the average exacerbation frequency (MD 0.09, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.79) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) total scores in adults on ICS when compared with no ICS, though data available were limited. Based on a single non-placebo controlled study from which we could not extract clinical data, there was marginal, though statistically significant improvement in sputum volume and dyspnoea scores on ICS. The single study on long-term outcomes (over 6 months) that examined lung function and other clinical outcomes, showed no significant effect of ICS on any of the outcomes. We could not draw any conclusion on adverse effects due to limited available data. Despite the authors of all seven studies stating they were double-blind, we judged one study (in the short duration ICS) as having a high risk of bias based on blinding, attrition and reporting of outcomes. The GRADE quality of evidence was low for all outcomes (due to non-placebo controlled trial, indirectness and imprecision with small numbers of participants and studies).

Authors' Conclusions

This updated review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ICS in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. Further, we cannot draw any conclusion for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state), as there were no studies.

### The precision medicine era of bronchiectasis [^c2ac9b96]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

A key lesson learned over the past 100-plus years is the challenge of the inherent heterogeneity clinical disease presents: there is no typical patient with bronchiectasis, and no two patients are the same. Underlying this is the multitude of different etiologies (where identifiable), with up to half of all cases considered idiopathic. A major clinical challenge remains: two patients with comparable symptoms may have contrasting severity, comorbidities, microbiology, inflammation, and radiological findings. Further complicating clinical management are the different impacts of quality of life (QOL), adherence, and social circumstances that affect disease course, disease trajectory, and progression. Compounding this is the increasing burden of disease on patients and healthcare systems, exacerbated by decades of neglect, orphan-disease status, underrecognition, and underdiagnosis. There remain no licensed treatments for bronchiectasis, and many interventions used lack evidence. Although matters are improving through clinical trials (Figure 1A), therapeutic development is undermined by disease heterogeneity, a lack of experimental models, and an urgent need for a better, more fundamental understanding of pathogenesis.

Many accept that bronchiectasis represents a final common outcome from several variable and discrete causes. Defining something on the basis of its final endpoint is deeply flawed and has contributed to the challenges the field has experienced. Defining a student's potential on the basis of a single examination fails to ignore the learning journey or effort, while looking at the success of a product solely on the basis of sales numbers ignores the research, development, and innovation that led to its creation. Similarly, we must consider the origins and processes that have led to bronchiectasis in individual cases, or at the very least small groups, to better understand pathogenesis and the potential for successful intervention. The exponential growth in epidemiological work, international registries, translational research, and clinical trials now allows us to appreciate its pathogenesis as a vicious "vortex" rather than a "cycle" in which key components of infection, inflammation, and epithelial and mucociliary dysfunction intersect with structural disease in varying ways concurrently rather than sequentially, to different extents and at variable degrees of complexity that differ by individual, time, and environment. This concept requires further refinement to elevate our understanding to the individual level: the era of precision medicine in bronchiectasis.

### Multidimensional severity assessment in bronchiectasis: an analysis of seven European cohorts [^4c842b06]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous, poorly understood, multidimensional disease with recent UK and German data demonstrating increasing prevalence and hospitalisation rates. Management is challenging as there are no licensed therapies. Given that the majority of available treatments are antibiotic-based, it is important for antimicrobial stewardship to target treatments to patients at severe risk of complications and avoid over-treatment of mild patients at low future risk.

Two composite disease-specific prognostic indices have been developed for bronchiectasis to aid clinical decision-making: the Bronchiectasis Severity Index (BSI) and the FACED score. Both attribute points according to age, value of FEV₁% predicted, presence of chronic colonisation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, radiological extension and type of bronchiectasis and degree of dyspnoea. The BSI also considers body mass index, exacerbation frequency, prior hospitalisation for severe exacerbation and chronic colonisation with bacteria other than P. aeruginosa. Both scores classify patients into low, moderate and high risk groups, using different thresholds. The BSI was derived from a large Edinburgh-based study in the UK and was subsequently validated in four international cohorts. The FACED score was derived from a retrospective Spanish study and was recently independently evaluated in a single centre UK cohort of 74 patients for long-term prediction of mortality.FACED was developed specifically to predict mortality, while the BSI was developed to predict mortality, severe exacerbations, frequency of exacerbations and quality of life (QoL).

The data currently available suggest that both scores can predict future mortality in bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is not, however, a disease whose impact is primarily measured in terms of mortality. Outcomes other than mortality are likely to be more important in terms of patients priorities, clinical decision-making, healthcare utilisation and socioeconomic costs. Clinicians face two major challenges in the management of bronchiectasis: (1) identifying patients with a high symptom burden or those at risk of frequent exacerbations or rapid lung function decline who may benefit from aggressive treatment and (2) identifying low-risk patients who could be suitable for non-specialist follow-up or simpler treatment regimes. No therapy has been developed that can reduce mortality in bronchiectasis, but existing and developing therapies are designed to improve QoL, reduce symptoms, reduce exacerbations and slow disease progression. Therefore for clinical trial design and subsequent 'real world' decision-making, these are the key outcomes to identify. The concept of 'severe' bronchiectasis should therefore reflect patients with impaired QoL, severe symptoms, frequent exacerbations and progressive disease.

### The economic burden of bronchiectasis-known and unknown: a systematic review [^5450d2ac]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis experience daily respiratory symptoms, such as chronic cough, sputum production, and exacerbations. These symptoms cause significant morbidity, reducing physical performance, and severely affecting a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Improving the quality of care for patients with bronchiectasis is paramount in limiting the impact of disease burden on daily functioning.

Management of bronchiectasis aims to control symptoms, reduce the incidence of exacerbations, and prevent disease progression. This is achieved through a multifaceted approach that includes airway clearance therapies, such as physiotherapy and/or exercise, antibiotic therapy, and anti-inflammatory treatment. In addition, hospitalization and antibiotic treatment may be required for the management of exacerbations. For these reasons, care is provided in both primary and secondary settings, and the provision of care may shift between these settings over the course of the disease. Indeed, the structure and intensity of healthcare resource use for the management of bronchiectasis may vary across different settings.

Although non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis has been a neglected disease, its apparent prevalence is increasing, possibly reflecting improved diagnosis through greater use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. With the rising number of patients requiring appropriate management, a better understanding of the current economic disease burden of bronchiectasis is needed to ensure efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Therefore, the aim of this systematic literature review was to identify literature reporting resource use and costs associated with the management of bronchiectasis in adults, and to identify knowledge gaps. Based on the findings, we present a conceptual framework to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the true burden of bronchiectasis for individuals, healthcare systems, and society.

### What changes in research focus Do we need to advance care for patients with bronchiectasis? [^9c65aff5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The relative attention from researchers to bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis compared with other causes (non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [NCFBE]) has always been very heavily weighted to the former. It has therefore been very gratifying to see the significant expansion of research (and funding) in NCFBE in the both public and private sectors over the past decade, particularly given that our therapeutic options remain limited and our preventive strategies minimal or absent.

Although there are areas for hope, we have yet to see any really significant advances for patients. Taking a balcony view, there are inherent limitations in current approaches that appear to be barriers to progress and lessons from other diseases for how to target research that can translate into new insights and therapies that NCFBE researchers need to take on board.

The lung has a limited number of ways it can respond to injury. Just because the end pathological and/or radiological findings look the same, this does not mean that the mechanisms of disease are the same or that interventions will be universally effective. This lesson has been learned in interstitial lung disease, for which it is now well appreciated that different disease processes resulting in lung fibrosis have different trajectories and do not respond to the same antifibrotic or antiinflammatory therapies. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, attention has progressively been focused in both stable disease and exacerbations on different robust phenotypes and/or "treatable traits" on the basis of clinical and laboratory features and/or responsiveness to therapy. These subgroupings are both relevant to clinical practice and also almost certainly underlaid by differences in pathological processes, with implications for future therapeutic advances.

### Towards development of evidence to inform recommendations for the evaluation and management of bronchiectasis [^e024f09e]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis (BE) is a chronic condition characterized by airway dilation as a consequence of a variety of pathogenic processes. It is often associated with persistent airway infection and an inflammatory response resulting in cough productive of purulent sputum, which has an adverse impact on quality of life. The prevalence of BE is increasing worldwide. Treatment guidelines exist for managing BE, but they are generally informed by a paucity of high-quality evidence. This review presents the findings of a scientific advisory board of experts held in the United States in November 2020. The main focus of the meeting was to identify unmet needs in BE and propose ways to identify research priorities for the management of BE, with a view to developing evidence-based treatment recommendations. Key issues identified include diagnosis, patient evaluation, promoting airway clearance and appropriate use of antimicrobials. Unmet needs include effective pharmacological agents to promote airway clearance and reduce inflammation, control of chronic infection, clinical endpoints to be used in the design of BE clinical trials, and more accurate classification of patients using phenotypes and endotypes to better guide treatment decisions and improve outcomes.

### Future therapies for cystic fibrosis [^7541668d]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Disease will progress, albeit more slowly, and will be more challenging to monitor

Effective CFTR modulators will likely slow or at best, halt disease progression, but will not reverse a disease that has already become fixed, examples being pancreatic destruction in the majority, bronchiectasis and absence of the vas deferens. Pulmonary exacerbations still recur albeit less frequently, chronic infections are not fully cleared and there is persistent airway inflammation. It is essential that we do not become complacent about disease progression in this population and yet monitoring will likely become more challenging. Effective surveillance for infection is critical in asymptomatic patients and underpins the management of young healthy children with CF who demonstrate disease progression despite a lack of symptoms –. Many patients previously able to expectorate sputum become non-productive on CFTR modulators, so pathogen surveillance will increasingly rely on alternative samples. Oropharyngeal sampling lacks sensitivityand bronchoalveolar lavage is invasive and time-consuming. Recently, interest has focussed on sputum-induction, which has been shown in several studies to outperform oropharyngeal sampling –. It is well tolerated, quick and relatively repeatable, even in young children. Similarly, spirometry may become less useful than more sensitive, but more time-consuming, tests such as lung clearance index or imaging.

Responses to treatments, including CFTR modulators, vary

There is considerable variability in patient response to modulators, much of which remains poorly understood, examples being FEV₁ and sweat chloride responses. For lung disease, this may not be surprising: at least 50 candidate modifier genes have been proposed, as well as several non-genetic influences on lung disease such as exposure to tobacco smoke and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. Both of these may reduce modulator efficacy. It seems likely that there will also be genetic influences on the absorption and metabolism of the drugs, an area ripe for further research.

Adherence to CFTR modulators (and other treatments) may be challenging

Adherence to CF medications is often suboptimal with some studies suggesting that modulators may not be an exception in this regard. For subjects experiencing great benefit, continuing to adhere to their symptom-directed therapies may be challenging; modulator trials to date have been 'on top of' such drugs and impact could be lessened if they are dropped. Advances are being made in supporting patients with adherence in other areas, such as mobile health applications, smart inhalers and chipped pill containers.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^365cad53]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Should treatment of bronchiectasis be altered in the presence of comorbidities?

Recommendations

Consider a trial of inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids in patients with bronchiectasis and inflammatory bowel disease (D)
Ensure optimal control of asthma and allergies in patients with both bronchiectasis and asthma (Grade D).
Monitor patients with comorbid COPD and bronchiectasis as they are at higher risk of death (D).
Patients with bronchiectasis and autoimmune conditions should be carefully assessed for autoimmune-related lung disease and often require long-term follow-up in a secondary care setting (D).
Patients with bronchiectasis who require disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or biologics for rheumatoid arthritis should be referred to a chest physician for further assessment before treatment is started (D).

How should we monitor bronchiectasis?

Recommendation

All patients with bronchiectasis should undergo routine monitoring in order to identify disease progression, pathogen emergence and modify treatment where necessary (D).

Good practice points

Tailor the frequency of routine monitoring to the patient's disease severity (see table 7).
Assess patients annually and more frequently in more severe disease.
Perform pulse oximetry to screen for patients who may need blood gas analysis to detect respiratory failure.
A baseline CXR may provide a useful comparator in the event of clinical deterioration.

Is there a role for microbiological sensitivity testing?

Good practice points

Antibiotic sensitivity testing can be used to determine if resistance develops to either acute or long-term antibiotic treatment.
Where possible, treatment should be guided by antibiotic sensitivity results but is often empirical based on previous sputum bacteriology.
Some patients with an infective exacerbation may respond to antibiotic treatment despite resistance to that drug in vitro. Antibiotics should only be changed if there is no clinical response.
For those on long-term antibiotic treatment, there should be repeat sensitivity testing where there is a clinical concern regarding loss of efficacy with therapy.

### Bronchiectasis: an emerging global epidemic [^64c4d196]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis has an increasing profile within respiratory medicine. This chronic and irreversible airways disease is common but suffers from a lack of evidenced based therapy for patients and, a lack of understanding of its inherent heterogeneity. Research focused on bronchiectasis must therefore be prioritized if we are to adequately address this evolving clinical problem. This special issue on bronchiectasis focuses on its clinical, microbiological and therapeutic aspects. By bringing together a unique collection of original research and review articles, we hope this issue will showcase international research efforts, encourage future research collaborations and stimulate debate. In doing so, we hope to bring greater attention to the urgent need for sustained investment into focused, dedicated and collaborative research platforms in bronchiectasis, an emerging "global epidemic".

### Raising awareness of bronchiectasis in primary care: overview of diagnosis and management strategies in adults [^0882cb35]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Bronchiectasis is a complex chronic disease, often resulting in disability and impaired quality of life. Patient education and compliance with care providers' recommendations are key to successful disease management. Progress in determining best practices and treatments will be aided by patient recruitment into recently developed patient registries in the United States and Europe. These registries will encompass the experiences of many more and varied patients than can be included in individual clinical trials. They encourage international collaborations and can help drive research with the overall goal of improving clinical care.

Although mild and moderate bronchiectasis usually can be managed in the primary care setting, collaboration with specialists to develop an individualised patient management plan would provide advanced planning should the patient's condition worsen. Those with more advanced disease who require long-term antibiotic therapy should be referred to secondary care.

### Managing and preventing exacerbation of bronchiectasis [^1bee204c]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pulmonary exacerbations are key events in the natural history of bronchiectasis given their impact on quality of life, prognosis, and their contribution to healthcare costs. Preventing and managing exacerbations is a priority for clinicians and in this review, we discuss measures that should be utilized to achieve this aim.

Recent Findings

Experts have proposed a focus on phenotyping and endotyping the bronchiectasis population to overcome the heterogeneity of this condition. Recent large studies of inhaled antibiotics and smaller studies of macrolides, which included exacerbation measures as their primary outcomes, have drawn further attention to this issue.

Summary

Exacerbations are currently treated with prolonged antibiotic treatment (10–14 days). Prevention of exacerbations requires a multidisciplinary approach which includes optimising airway clearance and treating underlying conditions. Patients who continue to experience exacerbations despite these measures may be offered chronic macrolide therapy or additional therapies based on identified treatable traits.

### Development and initial validation of the bronchiectasis exacerbation and symptom tool (BEST) [^c1d78067]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease defined by abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the bronchi. The disease can be caused by many different aetiologies and it is clinically characterised by a variety of symptoms, including cough, sputum production and airway infection, and can often present with recurrent exacerbations. According to a recent international consensus of experts, exacerbations are defined by an impairment of at least 3 or more baseline symptoms including cough, sputum volume and/or consistency, sputum purulence, dyspnoea and/or exercise tolerance, fatigue and/or malaise, haemoptysis for at least 48 h requiring a change in treatment. Recurrent exacerbations are related to elevated systemic and airway inflammation, deterioration of lung function and progression of the disease. As a consequence, exacerbations represent one of the main causes of healthcare costs in bronchiectasis. Some patients experience very frequent exacerbations and these have been described a phenotype with a higher morbidity and mortality. Reduction of exacerbations is therefore, the key goal of most therapeutic interventions.

Exacerbations have been the primary endpoints in the majority of therapeutic phase 3 clinical trials in bronchiectasis. Unfortunately the results of recent trials investigating inhaled antibiotics and inhaled mucoactive drugs have given inconsistent results. The RESPIRE trials for example, recruited patients with a history of at least 2 exacerbations in the previous year, with the expectation they would experience a similar rate of exacerbations during follow-up. The rates in the four RESPIRE studies in the placebo groups of 0.8, 1, 0.7 and 0.7 exacerbations per patient per year made it extremely difficult to demonstrate a meaningful treatment effect. Under-reporting and under-detection of exacerbations may play a role in this phenomenon.

Improved reporting and detection of exacerbations, as well as greater understanding of the natural history of exacerbations has been achieved in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through the use of patient completed diaries. These tools may enhance exacerbation reporting and thereby identification, leading to more efficient treatment when indicated. It has been suggested that 2/3 of COPD exacerbations are not reported to health care professionals. These are important events to recognize using diaries because unreported exacerbations have been linked to a greater risk of hospitalization, lung function deterioration, particularly forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁), and worse St George's respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ) scores than treated exacerbations.

### Bronchiectasis update [^2495c504]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bronchiectasis, once thought to be an orphan disease, is being diagnosed with increased frequency in the United States and around the world. The present review aims to provide an update on recent publications on the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis.

Recent Findings

Two large bronchiectasis patient registries have published initial reports regarding demographics and other patient data in 2017. Updates on the microbiology, microbiome, and inflammation in patients with bronchiectasis are clarifying the complexities of airway infection in this disease. A consensus definition of 'exacerbation' in bronchiectasis has been agreed upon this year. Reports on novel treatments, including the repurposing of older therapies, have also been published in 2016–2017. A new European guideline for the management of adult bronchiectasis is also now available.

Summary

Bronchiectasis, a resurgent disease, is now being better defined with a rapidly expanding portfolio of demographic, clinical, and therapeutic research and publications.

In the primary care setting, management should focus on monitoring the disease and implementing techniques and procedures to minimise disease progression and maximise equality of life. Regular clinic visits will allow the primary care provider to coordinate care with specialists and refer the patient to the appropriate specialist, as needed. Key considerations for the primary care provider to assess at each visit are outlined in Table 3. Regular tracking of exacerbations and symptoms allows the patient to learn more about managing his or her disease and helps to keep the care plan up-to-date. Regular monitoring of sputum(ideally twice per year) will identify the emergence of new pathogens or the development of antibiotic resistance. The previous sputum results can be used to guide future antibiotic use for exacerbations.

Table 3
Key questions to ask at each visit

a Key symptoms are cough, sputum production and breathlessness

Spirometry is a key pulmonary function test used to assess lung function and should be performed at least annually, and preferably at each clinic visit in patients with severe bronchiectasis. Significant worsening over time in pulmonary function indicates worsening disease and should drive an intensification in treatment.

The discussion between the primary care provider and patient during these routine visits provides an opportunity for ongoing patient education, a key component of disease management. Educating the patient regarding the disease will ensure that he or she understands the clinical approach and management plan, including the importance of sputum analysis. It is crucial that patients are able to recognise an exacerbation and how best to access the medical care team when necessary. Knowledge of airway physiotherapy/airway clearance techniques will help reduce the impact of exacerbations and improve quality of life. In a study to determine compliance with a bronchiectasis treatment program in 75 patients, only 53% were found to be compliant with medical treatment and only 41% were compliant with airway clearance techniques. Improving compliance with all aspects of recommended therapy is, therefore, a key goal of enhanced patient education. Indeed, the benefits of patient education have been demonstrated by expert patient self-management programs that promote action planning, role modelling, problem solving, reinterpretation of symptoms and decision making.

### Self-management for bronchiectasis [^81f9cc09]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a long term respiratory condition with an increasing rate of diagnosis. It is associated with persistent symptoms, repeated infective exacerbations, and reduced quality of life, imposing a burden on individuals and healthcare systems. The main aims of therapeutic management are to reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life. Self-management interventions are potentially important for empowering people with bronchiectasis to manage their condition more effectively and to seek care in a timely manner. Self-management interventions are beneficial in the management of other airways diseases such as asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and have been identified as a research priority for bronchiectasis.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy, cost-effectiveness and adverse effects of self-management interventions for adults and children with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Specialised Register of trials, clinical trials registers, reference lists of included studies and review articles, and relevant manufacturers' websites up to 13 December 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials of any duration that included adults or children with a diagnosis of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis assessing self-management interventions delivered in any form. Self-management interventions included at least two of the following elements: patient education, airway clearance techniques, adherence to medication, exercise (including pulmonary rehabilitation) and action plans.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened searches, extracted study characteristics and outcome data and assessed risk of bias for each included study. Primary outcomes were, health-related quality of life, exacerbation frequency and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were the number of participants admitted to hospital on at least one occasion, lung function, symptoms, self-efficacy and economic costs. We used a random effects model for analyses and standard Cochrane methods throughout.

Main Results

Two studies with a total of 84 participants were included: a 12-month RCT of early rehabilitation in adults of mean age 72 years conducted in two centres in England (UK) and a six-month proof-of-concept RCT of an expert patient programme (EPP) in adults of mean age 60 years in a single regional respiratory centre in Northern Ireland (UK). The EPP was delivered in group format once a week for eight weeks using standardised EPP materials plus disease-specific education including airway clearance techniques, dealing with symptoms, exacerbations, health promotion and available support. We did not find any studies that included children. Data aggregation was not possible and findings are reported narratively in the review. For the primary outcomes, both studies reported health-related quality of life, as measured by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), but there was no clear evidence of benefit. In one study, the mean SGRQ total scores were not significantly different at 6 weeks', 3 months' and 12 months' follow-up (12 months mean difference (MD) -10.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -45.15 to 24.61). In the second study there were no significant differences in SGRQ. Total scores were not significantly different between groups (six months, MD 3.20, 95% CI -6.64 to 13.04). We judged the evidence for this outcome as low or very low. Neither of the included studies reported data on exacerbations requiring antibiotics. For serious adverse events, one study reported more deaths in the intervention group compared to the control group, (intervention: 4 of 8, control: 2 of 12), though interpretation is limited by the low event rate and the small number of participants in each group. For our secondary outcomes, there was no evidence of benefit in terms of frequency of hospital admissions or FEV₁ L, based on very low-quality evidence. One study reported self-efficacy using the Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy scale, which comprises 10 components. All scales showed significant benefit from the intervention but effects were only sustained to study endpoint on the Managing Depression scale. Further details are reported in the main review. Based on overall study quality, we judged this evidence as low quality. Neither study reported data on respiratory symptoms, economic costs or adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to determine whether self-management interventions benefit people with bronchiectasis. In the absence of high-quality evidence it is advisable that practitioners adhere to current international guidelines that advocate self-management for people with bronchiectasis. Future studies should aim to clearly define and justify the specific nature of self-management, measure clinically important outcomes and include children as well as adults.

### Macrolides for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults: who should receive this treatment? [^b3908ae4]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Long-term macrolide therapy offers an evidence-based treatment to reduce frequent exacerbations in stable adult patients with bronchiectasis. There is limited evidence that these agents also attenuate the decline in lung function and improve health-related quality of life. The benefits and risks of long-term macrolide use need to be clearly explored for individual patients. Further work is needed to understand the optimal drug, dose, and regimen, the mechanisms behind these benefits, appropriate patient selection, sustainability of efficacy, potential long-term risk for the lung microbiome; and their use with or without inhaled antibiotic treatment. We reviewed the current evidence on long-term macrolides in adults with bronchiectasis.

### What changes in research focus Do we need to advance care for patients with bronchiectasis? [^ed2d7a1c]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

NCFBE is no different from interstitial lung disease or asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in that there are many different pathways to a similar radiological and pathological endpoint, with almost certainly different implications for the pathobiology and ultimately the efficacy of treatments. NCFBE is a syndrome, not a disease, and ultimately we will recognize many different deficits of innate and adaptive immune response and healing pathways that produce the wide spectrum of presentations seen. Clinicians who manage NCFBE are very cognizant of the fact that patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial disease are very different from those who have chronic Pseudomonas infection. Patients with postinfective bronchiectasis are very different from those with sinopulmonary syndromes (with or without proven mucociliary disorders). Although worse radiological disease generally equates to worse clinical disease, the correlation is only weak, and there are patients with similar radiological findings but very different spectrums of chronic symptoms (including cough and sputum production) and frequency of exacerbations. A major failing of much research to date is pooling all these different clinical phenotypes together and expecting to find clear signals.

A second problem for NCFBE researchers is that it is a syndrome that is often insidious in onset and, except in the case of postinfective bronchiectasis, evolves over many decades. By their nature research centers tend to attract patients at the more severe end of the spectrum, and cross-sectional studies always have the same limitation in being unable to determine if an observation is a cause of, or caused by, bronchiectasis. Patients at the low end of the symptom spectrum need to be studied if we are to understand the hows and whys in NCFBE. Other common cofactors such as advancing age, comorbidities, significant weight loss, frequent infections, and antibiotics equally confound immunological and microbiological research.

An additional problem is that diagnosis has been based on radiological findings in a patient with appropriate clinical features, but the increased use of computed tomography scans for lung cancer screening and coronary artery imaging is now detecting large numbers of patients who meet the radiological criteria for bronchiectasis but are completely asymptomatic. Do these patients really have a disease, especially if there is no deterioration or symptoms over time? The extent to which some mild changes of bronchiectasis may be within the normal range of aging is particularly unclear. Again, longitudinal studies are clearly needed to resolve these issues, as there are major implications for our understanding of NCFBE.

### Bronchiectasis… [^103c2c7f]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease with distinctive radiographic findings characterized by irreversible dilatation of small- and medium-sized bronchi from recurrent and prolonged infections or inflammation. The most common complaint is a chronic wet cough from impaired mucus clearance and subsequent airway plugging, but symptoms can also include hemoptysis, weight loss, wheezing, and difficulty breathing. Patients may also have concurrent moderate or severe persistent asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or snoring secondary to sleep apnea. Broadly, the underlying etiology of bronchiectasis is cystic fibrosis or a non-CF process such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, immunodeficiencies, airway obstruction secondary to tumor or foreign body, neuromuscular disorders with poor cough and airway clearance, or genetic diseases such as primary ciliary dyskinesia or alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

### Noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis management: opportunities and challenges [^cafa0054]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Noncystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a challenging disease which carries a heavy healthcare burden and significant mortality and morbidity. This review highlights the challenges in the diagnosis of bronchiectasis and discusses the management strategies and research opportunities in this field.

Recent Findings

The challenges in the management of bronchiectasis appear to be multifactorial, arising from both etiological heterogeneity and disease-specific management. Frequent inflammation and infections not only lead to progressive respiratory failure but also increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. No therapies are approved specifically for adult bronchiectasis, but new guidelines and recent studies outline strategies for control of infection and inflammation and for prevention of frequent exacerbations to improve overall prognosis.

Summary

Recent studies in the management of bronchiectasis are encouraging. Advances have been made in understanding both disease heterogeneity and best practices for care; interventions such as daily mucociliary clearance, eradication of colonized microbial organisms, and control of inflammation may result in favorable outcomes.

A Decade of Advances in Bronchiectasis Education, Research, and Clinical Care

We have observed exponential growth in the quantity and quality of bronchiectasis education, research, and clinical care. Central to this are clinical trials, resulting in a strong drug development pipeline addressing various aspects of the "vicious vortex" (Figures 1A and 1B). Despite the advances and promise, many clinical trials have failed to reach their primary endpoints. The lack of available "evidence-based" treatments and the failure of bronchiectasis clinical trials are intimately linked to disease heterogeneity, whether clinical, radiological, microbiological, or immunological. Selection of the right patients for the right intervention at the right time is central to appropriately addressing this challenge, one that necessitates fresh approaches to understanding, stratifying, and classifying bronchiectasis to optimally measure "treatment response". Several important issues differentiate bronchiectasis from other respiratory diseases.

First, trialists (and regulators) must concur on optimal "endpoints", with QOL, exacerbations, and lung function used frequently. QOL in bronchiectasis is measured using various tools, each examining varying domains and requiring distinct analyses; exacerbations can have variable definitions and durations of follow-up, while lung function (as FEV₁) is nonresponsive to most interventions. Even microbiology-related endpoints, significant in phase II studies, have uncertain relationships with concurrent clinical assessment. Clinical measures among "responders" further vary, and therefore biomarkers, each assessing different endpoints, to advance precision in bronchiectasis are required.

Second, no single variable encompasses the severity of bronchiectasis in individual cases, and therefore multidimensional approaches have been established, including the bronchiectasis severity index, and the FACED (including FEV₁, age, the presence of chronic colonization by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, radiological extension [number of pulmonary lobes affected], and dyspnea) and E-FACED (also including the number or severity of exacerbations) scores, which incorporate clinical, radiological, microbiological, and functional assessment. This poses challenges when interpreting translation to treatment efficacy.

Third, significant placebo responses are observed in bronchiectasis trials, especially for QOL measures, posing difficulties in optimizing trial design and power.

Fourth, identifying responders to specific interventions (i.e. mucoactive, antibiotic, or antiinflammatory) remains challenging, as those experiencing symptomatic amelioration may show no change in exacerbation frequency or severity or vice versa. Those with smoking histories are less likely to demonstrate "responsiveness", exposing the relevance of coexisting smoking related lung diseases such as COPD.

### Airway clearance techniques for bronchiectasis [^92023f8f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

People with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis commonly experience chronic cough and sputum production, features that may be associated with progressive decline in clinical and functional status. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are often prescribed to facilitate expectoration of sputum from the lungs, but the efficacy of these techniques in a stable clinical state or during an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unclear.

Objectives

Primary: to determine effects of ACTs on rates of acute exacerbation, incidence of hospitalisation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis. Secondary: to determine whether:• ACTs are safe for individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis; and• ACTs have beneficial effects on physiology and symptoms in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials from inception to November 2015 and PEDro in March 2015, and we handsearched relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled parallel and cross-over trials that compared an ACT versus no treatment, sham ACT or directed coughing in participants with bronchiectasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Seven studies involving 105 participants met the inclusion criteria of this review, six of which were cross-over in design. Six studies included adults with stable bronchiectasis; the other study examined clinically stable children with bronchiectasis. Three studies provided single treatment sessions, two lasted 15 to 21 days and two were longer-term studies. Interventions varied; some control groups received a sham intervention and others were inactive. The methodological quality of these studies was variable, with most studies failing to use concealed allocation for group assignment and with absence of blinding of participants and personnel for outcome measure assessment. Heterogeneity between studies precluded inclusion of these data in the meta-analysis; the review is therefore narrative. One study including 20 adults that compared an airway oscillatory device versus no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low-quality evidence). Data were not available for assessment of the impact of ACTs on time to exacerbation, duration or incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in HRQoL on both disease-specific and cough-related measures. The median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 7.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon)). Treatment consisting of high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) or a mix of ACTs prescribed for 15 days significantly improved HRQoL when compared with no treatment (low-quality evidence). Two studies reported mean increases in sputum expectoration with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.4 to 13.4 mL) and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02). HFCWO improved forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 156 mL and forced vital capacity (FVC) by 229.1 mL when applied for 15 days, but other types of ACTs showed no effect on dynamic lung volumes. Two studies reported a reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation among adults with non-positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05; difference in total lung capacity (TLC) of 703 mL, P value = 0.02) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared with no ACTs. Low-quality evidence suggests that ACTs (HFCWO, airway oscillatory devices or a mix of ACTs) reduce symptoms of breathlessness and cough and improve ease of sputum expectoration compared with no treatment (P value < 0.05). ACTs had no effect on gas exchange, and no studies reported effects of antibiotic usage. Among studies exploring airway oscillating devices, investigators reported no adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

ACTs appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis and may account for improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function, symptoms and HRQoL. The role of these techniques in acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. In view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, additional data are needed to establish the short-term and long-term clinical value of ACTs for patient-important outcomes and for long-term clinical parameters that impact disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis, allowing further guidance on prescription of specific ACTs for people with bronchiectasis.

Overall goals of treatment

The main goals of treatment are to reduce exacerbations, preserve lung function and improve the patient's quality of life. A disease management schematic is shown in Fig. 3. Patients with bronchiectasis should be instructed in how to improve airway clearance using physiotherapy techniques at home or at a physiotherapy clinic. Treatments, both pharmacological and non-pharmacological, should focus on reducing inflammation and preventing exacerbations. Because bronchiectasis involves a permanent change in lung structure, the condition is chronic and the patient's quality of life may be severely impacted. Care is best managed by a stepwise multidisciplinary team approach, including respiratory/chest physiotherapy.

Bronchiectasis disease management. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

Primary care management

Some management principles are common to all patients with bronchiectasis and include the requirement for good education about the disease, annual vaccination against influenza and vaccination against S. pneumoniae. Patients that are breathless will benefit from pulmonary rehabilitation as is the case with other respiratory disorders, and patients should be encouraged to exercise. Smoking cessation should be strongly advocated for the minority of patients that continue to smoke (up to 18% of patients with bronchiectasis are reported to be current smokers).

Specific management strategies for bronchiectasis depend on the underlying severity and cause of disease. Patients with mild or moderate bronchiectasis are often managed and monitored in the primary care setting. Patients with mild bronchiectasis usually will not require prophylactic antibiotic therapy, but those with sputum production should perform daily physiotherapy between and during exacerbations. Patients with moderate bronchiectasis patients will typically have persistent symptoms in spite of standard care and may require prophylactic long-term antibiotic therapy as well as adjunctive treatments and strategies to promote mucus clearance (see sections below on Secondary care management and Chest physiotherapy/respiratory therapy).

Clinical disease

In this special issue, the clinical aspects of bronchiectasis are covered from both the physician and patient perspective. The authoritative review by Schäfer and colleagues reviews bronchiectasis pathogenesis, its imaging and clinical characteristics from both a cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF perspective across a diverse range of aetiologies. In a patient focused article, Hester et al. address the issue of adherence to the multi-modal treatment options used in the care of bronchiectasis patients by reviewing the provision of and requirement for patient education. Minimal work to date has been performed in bronchiectasis focused in this area especially when compared to other chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The information deficits uncovered in this qualitative approach clearly represent one of the key barriers to the implementation of bronchiectasis self-management. Further original qualitative work is provided by Dudgeon et al. whose study focused on the patient's perspective of health-related quality of life (QOL). Semi-structured interviews elucidated that bronchiectasis-related symptoms are highly individual and variable, a feature that current available treatment and QOL tools do not adequately capture.

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering the following interventions during exacerbations:

- prescribe antibiotics for an exacerbation, guided by previous microbiology results, local susceptibility patterns, and clinical severity

- include guidance on recognizing exacerbations in an adult bronchiectasis self-management plan. Consider providing selected patients the ability to self-administer antibiotics at home with appropriate instruction and education to allow more prompt treatment

- review patients not responding promptly to oral antibiotics or showing signs of a severe exacerbation to determine if there is a need for a change in treatment, intravenous antibiotic treatment, and/or hospitalization

- adapt airway clearance regimens in frequency, intensity, and technique during an exacerbation

- recognize that a 14-day antibiotic course is considered standard, especially in severe exacerbations or in patients with P. aeruginosa infection. Consider shorter courses in patients with mild bronchiectasis, those with infection due to pathogens more sensitive to antibiotics (such as S. pneumoniae), or patients with a rapid return to baseline symptoms during treatment.

Background

This guideline refers to the investigation and management of patients with symptoms of persistent or recurrent bronchial sepsis related to irreversibly damaged and dilated bronchi, namely clinical bronchiectasis. It does not cover the management of cystic fibrosis (CF), and for the purposes of the guideline, 'bronchiectasis' is synonymous with the term 'non-CF bronchiectasis'. Likewise, it does not focus on traction bronchiectasis secondary to other lung pathologies, particularly the interstitial lung diseases, as the bronchiectasis is commonly asymptomatic.

### Management of bronchiectasis [^00d7ee79]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Around 1 in 1,000 adults in the UK has bronchiectasis, a potential outcome of various underlying lung diseases. It results from a 'vicious circle' of recurrent infection, inflammation, excessive mucus production, reduced mucociliary clearance, and dilatation and destruction of bronchi. Associated damage to blood vessels can lead to haemoptysis, which is usually slight, but may be severe. Bronchiectasis may be limited to one area (localised) or be more widespread (generalised). It can reduce lung function and quality of life, and may lead to respiratory failure and premature death. Here we review the management of patients with bronchiectasis.

### Patient information, education and self-management in bronchiectasis: facilitating improvements to optimise health outcomes [^cd7d8629]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung condition that leads to a significant symptom and treatment burden for those affected, and significant costs to healthcare services such as the National Health Service. Worldwide prevalence is increasing, yet the evidence base for the management of bronchiectasis remains poor. Historically, there has been relatively little research conducted in this field and it is only recently that more attention has been paid to this previously somewhat neglected disease. Improvements in disease management interventions in bronchiectasis are required.

Interventions in bronchiectasis are likely to include better medical therapies, yet it is also apparent that bronchiectasis is a 'model' chronic disease in terms of its potential for improvements in self-management. If patients and their carers know how to recognise symptoms of deterioration or exacerbation, and know how and when to take action, this could facilitate improvements in self-management. This in turn has the potential to promote disease stability, reductions in unscheduled presentations to acute health care services and improvements in longer-term health.

Whilst clearly desirable, expecting patients to understand their condition, the treatments used and the implications of not using them appropriately, is potentially challenging. Prior work has demonstrated that patients with bronchiectasis feel more confident with their treatments when they have received information about them in a specialist clinic. Not every patient with bronchiectasis, however, has access to such information or specialist expertise. Despite recommendations for education and personalised management plans for patients with bronchiectasis, there remains a lack of information material openly available to patients when compared to other chronic medical and respiratory conditions. For example, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have a number of available resources. In order to facilitate self-care, patients need to have accurate and accessible information about their condition, enabling them to recognise and respond to triggers appropriately and understand how their use of self-management could potentially alter their prognosis. Suitable education could lead to a level of self-management that results in clinically and biologically important endpoints in bronchiectasis. In this article we review the need for education and information in bronchiectasis and its current provision. We discuss options for future improvements in resource development to facilitate much needed improvements in health outcomes.

### New therapies for the prevention and treatment of exacerbations of bronchiectasis [^8e908812]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Exacerbations of bronchiectasis have a major impact on quality of life, healthcare costs, and long-term risk of complications. Preventing exacerbations is one of the major goals of treatment. Bronchiectasis is increasingly recognized and the impact of bronchiectasis exacerbations on daily clinical practice is also increasing.

Recent Findings

Preventing bronchiectasis exacerbations are dependent on appropriate risk assessment, identifying the patients at highest risk to rationally target preventive therapies. Inhaled and oral antibiotic treatments can target chronic bacterial infection which is one of the major risk factors for exacerbation. Although the data is weak, airway clearance is an important part of long-term management including in patients with frequent exacerbations. Anti-inflammatory therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids do not currently have a major role outside comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, but further studies are required.

Summary

Treatment of acute exacerbations involves prompt administration of antibiotic therapy with usually 14 days of oral, or for severe exacerbations, intravenous antibiotics. The role of corticosteroids is not established and there is little data on the optimal management approach for acute exacerbations. Home intravenous therapy can reduce healthcare costs and improve patient satisfaction with care. A number of large randomized controlled trials are currently enrolling or have recently completed raising the possibility that the treatment paradigm may change in the near future.

Additional clinical features may include fever, wheezing, general discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, pleuritic chest pain, and changes on chest examination. Recognize features of a severe exacerbation, defined as requiring hospitalization or intravenous antibiotic treatment, which may include tachypnea, acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure, a significant decline in oxygen saturation or respiratory function, hypercapnia, hemoptysis, new onset of cyanosis, new signs of cor pulmonale, hemodynamic instability, and/or impaired cognitive function.

### Airway clearance techniques for bronchiectasis [^f06be561]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

People with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis commonly experience chronic cough and sputum production and these features may be associated with progressive decline in clinical status. Airway clearance techniques (ACTs) are often prescribed to facilitate expectoration of sputum from the lungs, but the efficacy of these techniques in a stable clinical state or during an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unclear.

Objectives

Primary: to determine the effects of ACTs on the rate of acute exacerbations, incidence of hospitalisation and health-related quality of life in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis. Secondary: to determine whether a) ACTs are safe for individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis and b) ACTs have beneficial effects on physiology and symptoms in individuals with acute and stable bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials from inception to October 2012, PEDro in October 2012 and handsearched relevant journals.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled parallel and cross-over trials that compared an ACT to no treatment, sham ACT or directed coughing in participants with bronchiectasis.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Five studies involving 51 participants met the inclusion criteria of the review, all of which were cross-over design. Four studies were on adults with stable bronchiectasis, and the other study was on clinically stable children with bronchiectasis. Three studies were single treatment sessions, two were longer-term studies. The interventions varied and some control groups received a sham intervention while others were inactive. The methodological quality of the studies was variable and the studies were not able to blind participants and personal. Heterogeneity between studies precluded these data from meta-analysis and the review was therefore narrative. One study on 20 adults comparing an airway oscillatory device with no treatment found no significant difference in the number of exacerbations at 12 weeks (low-quality evidence). No data were available to assess the impact of ACTs on the time to exacerbation, duration of, incidence of hospitalisation or total number of hospitalised days. The same study reported clinically significant improvements in health-related quality of life in both disease-specific and cough-related measures. While based on a small number of participants and the data were skewed, the median difference in the change in total St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score over three months in this study was 8.5 units (P value = 0.005 (Wilcoxon), low-quality evidence). Two studies reported mean increases in volume of sputum expectorated with airway oscillatory devices in the short term of 8.4 mL (95% CI 3.4 to 13.4 mL) and in the long term of 3 mL (P value = 0.02), with no significant effect on lung function. One study reported an immediate reduction in pulmonary hyperinflation in adults with non-positive expiratory pressure (PEP) ACTs (difference in functional residual capacity (FRC) of 19%, P value < 0.05) and with airway oscillatory devices (difference in FRC of 30%, P value < 0.05) compared to no ACTs. A similar decrease in pulmonary hyperinflation (difference in FRC of 6%) was found in children using an airway oscillatory device for 3 months compared to sham therapy. No studies reported on the effects of gas exchange, people's symptoms or antibiotic usage.

Authors' Conclusions

ACTs appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis, where there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health-related quality of life. The role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. In view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, more data are needed to establish the clinical value of ACTs over the short and long term on patient-important outcomes, including symptoms, on physiological outcomes which may clarify the rationale for each technique and on long-term parameters that impact on disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis. This is necessary in order to provide further guidance of specific ACT prescription for people with bronchiectasis. It may also be important to establish the comparative effect of different types of ACTs in people with bronchiectasis.

### Criteria and definitions for the radiological and clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis in adults for use in clinical trials: international consensus recommendations [^c68fe483]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Bronchiectasis refers to both a clinical disease and a radiological appearance that has multiple causes and can be associated with a range of conditions. Disease heterogeneity and the absence of standardised definitions have hampered clinical trials of treatments for bronchiectasis and are important challenges in clinical practice. In view of the need for new therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis to reduce the disease burden, we established an international taskforce of experts to develop recommendations and definitions for clinically significant bronchiectasis in adults to facilitate the standardisation of terminology for clinical trials. Systematic reviews were used to inform discussions, and Delphi processes were used to achieve expert consensus. We prioritised criteria for the radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis and suggest recommendations on the use and central reading of chest CT scans to confirm the presence of bronchiectasis for clinical trials. Furthermore, we developed a set of consensus statements concerning the definitions of clinical bronchiectasis and its specific signs and symptoms, as well as definitions for chronic bacterial infection and sustained culture conversion. The diagnosis of clinically significant bronchiectasis requires both clinical and radiological criteria, and these expert recommendations and proposals should help to optimise patient recruitment into clinical trials and allow reliable comparisons of treatment effects among different interventions for bronchiectasis. Our consensus proposals should also provide a framework for future research to further refine definitions and establish definitive guidance on the diagnosis of bronchiectasis.

Walter KL. What Is Bronchiectasis. JAMA. Published online August 07, 2025. doi: 10.1001/jama.2025.11485 Patients with bronchiectasis have permanently inflamed and dilated airways. Bronchiectasis may be caused by the genetic disease cystic fibrosis or can occur in patients without CF. Approximately 500 000 people in the US have non-CF bronchiectasis.

1. The most common symptom of bronchiectasis is daily cough lasting longer than 8 to 12 weeks with clear or colored phlegm. Patients with bronchiectasis may also have shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, and fatigue, and less commonly, may cough up phlegm with blood. Bronchiectasis is diagnosed based on chest computed tomography findings of dilated airways. Chest CT may also reveal airway thickening and mucus in the airways.

To evaluate the cause and severity of bronchiectasis, patients should have blood testing, sputum cultures, and pulmonary function testing with spirometry. Exacerbations of bronchiectasis are episodes of worsened disease that typically present with increased cough, dark colored sputum, and increased fatigue. Exacerbations are associated with a decline in lung function and decreased quality of life and should be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics. Patients with bronchiectasis who have asthma or COPD should be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to decrease airway inflammation and help open the airways. Individuals with 3 or more exacerbations of bronchiectasis per year may benefit from use of inhaled antibiotics or daily oral antibiotics.

Surgery to remove part of the lung may be considered for some patients whose disease worsens despite medical therapy or who have resistant infections, have bronchiectasis in a single lobe of the lung, or cough up substantial amounts of blood. Bleeding may also be treated with a minimally invasive procedure that blocks bleeding in bronchial arteries. Lung transplant may be considered for patients with non-CF bronchiectasis who have severely reduced pulmonary function and/or frequent exacerbations.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^0b9849f3]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guidelines for Bronchiectasis in adults were published in January 2019, and comprise recommendations for treatment from primary to tertiary care. Here, we outline the practical implications of these guidelines for primary care practitioners. A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be considered when a patient presents with a recurrent or persistent (> 8 weeks) productive cough. A definitive diagnosis is made by using thin-section chest computed tomography (CT). Once diagnosed, patients should be initially assessed by a specialist respiratory team and a shared management plan formulated with the patient, the specialist and primary care teams. The cornerstone of primary care management is physiotherapy to improve airway sputum clearance and maximise exercise capacity, with prompt treatment of acute exacerbations with antibiotics.

Bronchiectasis in COPD — With increasing use of computed tomography in the assessment of people with COPD, the presence of previously unrecognized bronchiectasis is being identified. The prevalence of bronchiectasis in COPD patients has been analyzed in several studies with conflicting results ranging from 20% to 69% (mean prevalence was 54.3%). Whether this diagnosis based on radiological criteria has the same impact as a clinical diagnosis of bronchiectasis remains unknown at present, and two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have compared the characteristics of COPD patients with and without bronchiectasis, reporting greater daily sputum production, more frequent exacerbations, poorer lung function, and higher level of inflammatory biomarkers.

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^1d3a0d3e]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis (CF) and other causes, airway clearance is one of the mainstays of management. We conducted a systematic review on airway clearance by using non-pharmacological methods as recommended by international guidelines to develop recommendations or suggestions to update the 2006 CHEST guideline on cough.

Methods

The systematic search for evidence examined the question, "Is there evidence of clinically important treatment effects for non-pharmacological therapies in cough treatment for patients with bronchiectasis?" Populations selected were all patients with bronchiectasis due to CF or non-CF bronchiectasis. The interventions explored were the non-pharmacological airway clearance therapies. The comparison populations included those receiving standard therapy and/or placebo. Clinically important outcomes that were explored were exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, and mortality.

Results

In both CF and non-CF bronchiectasis, there were systematic reviews and overviews of systematic reviews identified. Despite these findings, there were no large randomized controlled trials that explored the impact of airway clearance on exacerbation rates, quality of life, hospitalizations, or mortality.

Conclusions

Although the cough panel was not able to make recommendations, they have made consensus-based suggestions and provided direction for future studies to fill the gaps in knowledge.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^26b63776]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical characteristics and management of bronchiectasis

Bronchietasis patients are clinically characterized by sputum production (upon exercise or spontaneously) leading to productive coughing with mucopurulent masses of yellowish, greenish or brown sputum in the morning or over the day. However, bronchiectasis are mainly detected at time points when irreversible structural damage has already been done to the airway architecture. Bronchiectasis initially may be reversible in children, later probably not. Major genetic diseases associated with bronchiectasis include CF, primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD, Kartagener syndrome), alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary immunodeficiencies or other rare disorders like Williams-Campbell syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Major acquired causes are severe bacterial infections (Tuberculosis, Staphylococcus, Klebsiella and others) or postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans. Notably, also fungal infections can lead to bronchiectasis, particularly ABPA, as a chronic Th2-driven Aspergillus fumigatus -caused pulmonary condition. Based on this, it is essential in the clinical work-up of patients featuring bronchiectasis to screen for these congenital and acquired conditions in order to tailor appropriate treatments and to attenuate disease progression. In a preventive manner, it is key in the above mentioned conditions to diagnose and monitor for pulmonary symptoms and structural changes (using pulmonary function testing and high-resolution computed tomography, HRCT) to avoid established bronchiectasis-related disease. To this end, it is helpful to follow a concept that has been introduced previously to classify forms of bronchitis in children. An acute bronchitis, usually triggered by a viral infection, resolves within days or one to two weeks. Sometimes – for many reasons of which most are unknown – symptoms do not resolve spontaneously, but persist. This state is called protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB). While PBB has been initially established for pediatrics, current publications have discussed and transferred this concept to adults {Birring, 2015 #16382; Gibson, 2010 #16381; Martin, 2015 #16380}. PBB is further differentiated into various forms, depending on the tools used to diagnose it. PBB can be further characterized based on different stratifiers:
PBB-microbiologic ("PBB-micro"): (1) presence of chronic wet cough (> 4 weeks), (2) respiratory bacterial pathogens growing in sputum or BAL at density of a single bacterial specifies > 10⁴ colony-forming units/ml, and (3) cough resolves following a 2-week course of an appropriate oral antibiotic (usually amoxicillin-clavulanate)
PBB-clinical: (1) presence of chronic wet cough (> 4 weeks), (2) absence of symptoms or signs of other causes of wet or productive cough, (3) cough resolves following a 2-week course of an appropriate oral antibiotic (usually amoxicillin-clavulanate)
PBB-extended: as above, but cough resolves only after 4 weeks of antibiotics
PBB-recurrent: > 3 episodes of PBB per year

### Clinical significance and potential pathogenesis of VCAN in adult non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: a retrospective study [^d8e4fea8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is a chronic clinical syndrome that is characterised by cough and sputum production in the abnormal thickening and dilation of the bronchial wall. The clinical course of patients with bronchiectasis is characterised by intermittent exacerbations. Cystic fibrosis (CF) and non–CF are two causes of bronchiectasis. In China, approximately 1.5% of women and 1.1% of men have physician-diagnosed bronchiectasis. In recent years, the prevalence of bronchiectasis is increasing worldwide, and the increasing socioeconomic burden has also become a global health problem. Bronchiectasis is associate with inflammation and eosinophils, which refers to a lack of effective therapeutic strategy. Common therapeutic strategies for bronchiectasis include managing symptoms, reducing exacerbation, and slowing its progression. Moreover, antibiotic misuse, opportunistic infection, and antibiotic resistance should increase economic burden and decrease the quality of life of patients. Accordingly, the attention given to bronchiectasis therapeutic strategy is increasing. Recently, outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) has become a potential treatment for bronchiectasis exacerbations management. However, the pathogenesis of bronchiectasis remains ambiguous.

Versican (VCAN) belongs to the lectican protein family, which is a large chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan. Protein is a major component of the extracellular matrix. The role of VCAN in cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation has been extensively investigated. VCAN is often considered an anti-adhesion molecule, whose role is increased in the changing tissue extracellular matrix of inflammatory lung disorders. Thomas N. Wight et al. found that VCAN causes inflammation by interacting with a variety of growth factors and cytokines involved in regulating inflammation, thereby promoting inflammation cytokines such as TNFα, IL-8, and NFκB. Therefore, the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels of VCAN is closely associated with the progression and prognosis of inflammation.

Overexpression of MUC5AC and MUC5B, which was observed in patients with bronchiectasis, was related to an increase in mucin concentrations, osmotic pressure, and elastic and viscous moduli. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation is a method of host defence in multiple inflammatory diseases, which play a key marker of disease severity and treatment response in bronchiectasis. However, the function between versican and neutrophil remains ambiguous. VCAN contributes to disease pathophysiology and may be a target for bronchiectasis treatment. Therefore, we explore the expression of VCAN in bronchiectasis and reveal its molecular mechanism and biological characteristics (Fig. 1).

### Paediatric bronchiectasis in Europe: what now and where next? [^b1abd4ec]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis has been defined as the abnormal and permanent dilation of bronchi. It has a variety of causes and has traditionally been viewed as a condition that is irreversible, often progressive and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In the past, patients had relatively advanced disease by the time the diagnosis was established. By using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning of the chest, the potential now exists for the much earlier detection and treatment of children with lesser degrees of bronchial dilation and bronchial wall thickening than was previously possible. In some, the HRCT changes have been seen to improve or completely resolve. This calls into question exactly what now should be termed bronchiectasis and how the parents of children with such HRCT findings should be counselled about the likely prognosis and the necessary or desirable treatment options.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: its diagnosis and management [^c936e237]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

An increase in the frequency of diagnosing non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis in children is due to heightened awareness of the disease and the wider availability of high-resolution computed tomography. The most common underlying conditions leading to bronchiectasis include infections, immunodeficiency, aspiration and primary ciliary dyskinesia. Treatment centres on airway clearance with aggressive antibiotic regimens and physiotherapy; more specific approaches are available for some of the underlying conditions. A high index of suspicion that a child may have underlying bronchiectasis must be maintained in the presence of prolonged or recurrent "wet/productive" cough. The classic definition of bronchiectasis is of irreversible bronchial dilatation; however, at the milder end of the spectrum it appears that radiographic changes may be reversible. Untreated, in its severest form bronchiectasis can progress to end stage pulmonary failure in adult life. In this article, we review its pathogenesis and diagnosis and the evidence base for available treatments.

### An integrative review of systematic reviews related to the management of breathlessness in respiratory illnesses [^709dce95]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis (non-pharmacological treatments)

Searches identified three systematic reviews. One of these was excluded because it focussed on surgical intervention only. The remaining reviews (both from the Cochrane Database) featured nurse specialist care (1 trial) and physical training (2 trials). Bradley et al included data on breathlessness. Both reviews were based on aggregated samples of less than 80 participants. French et al reviewed one trial of nurse-led care (no significant changes in outcome measures or significant difference compared to doctor-led care). Bradley et al included two trials of physical therapy, concluding that inspiratory muscle training improved endurance exercise capacity.

Bronchiectasis (pharmacological treatments)

Searches identified four systematic reviews from the Cochrane database (2 trials; 2 trials; 3 trials; 9 trials) that found evidence of effectiveness. Two reviews were based on samples of more than 54; in a third review it was not possible to determine the size of the aggregated sample. One review included data on breathlessness. Wills & Greenstone concluded that dry powder mannitol was shown to improve tracheobronchial clearance in bronchiectasis. Ram et al found that ICS may improve lung function in bronchiectasis, but that larger trials were required to guide practice. Evans et al found a small benefit from prolonged antibiotic use to interrupt the cycle of bacterial colonisation, inflammatory change and progressive lung damage, but also advocated further, more powerful trials. Crockett et al concluded that there was insufficient evidence to evaluate mucolytics for bronchiectasis. There were also seven systematic reviews that found no evidence of effectiveness of pharmacological treatments in the management of bronchiectasis: for oral methylxanthines; LABAs; SABAs; anticholinergic therapy; leukotriene receptor antagonists; oral steroids; and pneumococcal vaccines.

### Long-acting β-2-agonists for bronchiectasis [^4533f9d6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Symptoms of bronchiectasis include chronic productive cough, wheeze, breathlessness and recurrent infections of the lower respiratory tract. Long-acting bronchodilators are being used more frequently in the management of people with this condition.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of long-acting bronchodilators in the management of bronchiectasis that is not due to cystic fibrosis.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Bronchiectasis Database made up of trials identified from searching the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and hand-searches of leading respiratory journals. The latest searches were performed in May 2001.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials, with or without masking.

Data Collection and Analysis

The results of searches were reviewed against pre-specified criteria.

Main Results

We were unable to identify any randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of long-acting bronchodilator therapy in the management of bronchiectasis.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Further research is needed to establish if long-acting bronchodilators have a role in the management of people with bronchiectasis.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^5ecd14dd]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

What is the evidence for long-term anti-inflammatory therapies in bronchiectasis?

Recommendations

Do not routinely offer inhaled corticosteroids to patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD and inflammatory bowel disease) (B).
Do not offer long-term oral corticosteroids for patients with bronchiectasis without other indications (such as ABPA, chronic asthma, COPD, inflammatory bowel disease) (D).
Do not routinely offer PDE4 inhibitors, methylxanthines or leukotriene receptor antagonists for bronchiectasis treatment (D).
Do not routinely offer CXCR2 antagonists, neutrophil elastase inhibitors or statins for bronchiectasis treatment (B).

Good practice point

Inhaled corticosteroids have an established role in the management of asthma and a proportion of patients with COPD, which are common comorbid conditions in bronchiectasis.

Research recommendation

Randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the long-term impact of anti-inflammatory therapies.

What treatments improve outcomes for patients with stable bronchiectasis?

Recommendations

Consider long -term antibiotics in patients with bronchiectasis who experience three or more exacerbations per year (A). (see figure 2 and full guideline appendix 2 and 3)
In these patients, the following are recommended

P. aeruginosa colonised patients

Use inhaled colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider inhaled gentamicin as a second line alternative to colistin for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider azithromycin or erythromycin as an alternative (eg if a patient does not tolerate inhaled antibiotics) to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection. (B)
Consider azithromycin or erythromycin as an additive treatment to an inhaled antibiotic for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic P. aeruginosa infection who have a high exacerbation frequency. (D)

Regarding medical management for bronchiectasis, more specifically with respect to management of acute exacerbations, ERS 2025 guidelines recommend to obtain the following diagnostic tests during exacerbations:

- sputum sample for microbiology at the onset of an exacerbation before initiating antibiotic treatment

- repeat sputum culture, where possible, if there is no response to the initial antibiotic treatment.

### Dual antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^24a2a597]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal and irreversible dilatation of the smaller airways and associated with a mortality rate greater than twice that of the general population. Antibiotics serve as front-line therapy for managing bacterial load, but their use is weighed against the development of antibiotic resistance. Dual antibiotic therapy has the potential to suppress infection from multiple strains of bacteria, leading to more successful treatment of exacerbations, reduced symptoms, and improved quality of life. Further evidence is required on the efficacy of dual antibiotics in terms of management of exacerbations and extent of antibiotic resistance.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of dual antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis.

Search Methods

We identified studies from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), which includes the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), and PsycINFO, as well as studies obtained by handsearching of journals/abstracts. We also searched the following trial registries: US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We imposed no restriction on language of publication. We conducted our search in October 2017.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials comparing dual antibiotics versus a single antibiotic for short-term (< 4 weeks) or long-term management of bronchiectasis diagnosed in adults and/or children by bronchography, plain film chest radiography, or high-resolution computed tomography. Primary outcomes included exacerbations, length of hospitalisation, and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were response rates, emergence of resistance to antibiotics, systemic markers of infection, sputum volume and purulence, measures of lung function, adverse events/effects, deaths, exercise capacity, and health-related quality of life. We did not apply outcome measures as selection criteria.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of 287 records, along with the full text of seven reports. Two studies met review inclusion criteria. Two review authors independently extracted outcome data and assessed risk of bias. We extracted data from only one study and conducted GRADE assessments for the following outcomes: successful treatment of exacerbation; response rates; and serious adverse events.

Main Results

Two randomised trials assessed the effectiveness of oral plus inhaled dual therapy versus oral monotherapy in a total of 118 adults with a mean age of 62.8 years. One multi-centre trial compared inhaled tobramycin plus oral ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin alone, and one single-centre trial compared nebulised gentamicin plus systemic antibiotics versus a systemic antibiotic alone. Published papers did not report study funding sources. Effect estimates from one small study with 53 adults showed no evidence of treatment benefit with oral plus inhaled dual therapy for the following primary outcomes at the end of the study: successful management of exacerbation - cure at day 42 (odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.01; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); number of participants with Pseudomonas aeruginosa eradication at day 21 (OR 2.33, 95% CI 0.66 to 8.24; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); and serious adverse events (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.08 to 2.87; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence). Similarly, researchers provided no evidence of treatment benefit for the following secondary outcomes: clinical response rates - relapse at day 42 (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.12 to 2.69; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); microbiological response rate at day 21 - eradicated (OR 2.40, 95% CI 0.67 to 8.65; 53 participants; one study; very low-quality evidence); and adverse events - incidence of wheeze (OR 5.75, 95% CI 1.55 to 21.33). Data show no evidence of benefit in terms of sputum volume, lung function, or antibiotic resistance. Outcomes from a second small study with 65 adults, available only as an abstract, were not included in the quantitative data synthesis. The included studies did not report our other primary outcomes: duration; frequency; and time to next exacerbation; nor our secondary outcomes: systemic markers of infection; exercise capacity; and quality of life. We did not identify any trials that included children.

Authors' Conclusions

A small number of studies in adults have generated high-quality evidence that is insufficient to inform robust conclusions, and studies in children have provided no evidence. We identified only one dual-therapy combination of oral and inhaled antibiotics. Results from this single trial of 53 adults that we were able to include in the quantitative synthesis showed no evidence of treatment benefit with oral plus inhaled dual therapy in terms of successful treatment of exacerbations, serious adverse events, sputum volume, lung function, and antibiotic resistance. Further high-quality research is required to determine the efficacy and safety of other combinations of dual antibiotics for both adults and children with bronchiectasis, particularly in terms of antibiotic resistance.

### Effect of long-term, low-dose erythromycin on pulmonary exacerbations among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: the BLESS randomized controlled trial… [^ab4d73a7]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

The pathophysiology of non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is generally considered to be characterized by an airway inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens, and recent data provide further evidence to support this "vicious cycle" hypothesis. 1 However, studies of maintenance therapies designed to interrupt this cycle at differing points have failed to demonstrate convincing evidence of clinical efficacy, including prolonged oral antibiotics, 2 inhaled tobramycin, 3 inhaled corticosteroids, 4 and mucolytics. 5 Until recently, 6 there have arguably been no therapies with proven clinical benefit in non-CF bronchiectasis. The Bronchiectasis and Low-dose Erythromycin Study tested the hypothesis that low-dose erythromycin would reduce pulmonary exacerbations in non-CF bronchiectasis patients with a history of frequent exacerbations.

Additionally, the bacterial resistance caused by this therapy, arguably the primary risk associated with long-term macrolide therapy, was precisely quantified in commensal bacterial flora. The primary end point was the mean rate of PDPEs per patient per year, analyzed by intention to treat. A PDPE was considered to have occurred when the participant required antibiotic administration for a sustained increase in sputum volume or purulence accompanied by new deteriorations in at least 2 additional symptoms: sputum volume, sputum purulence, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Additionally, the significant lowering of sputum production by erythromycin is likely to have been a key contributor to reduced airways obstruction, and perhaps azithromycin did not demonstrate this same effect, for example, if participants in EMBRACE had lower baseline sputum production.

Preservation of lung function is a particularly important finding as it suggests the potential for erythromycin to influence the natural history of this condition, in addition to improving morbidity. Despite the clinical benefits seen with erythromycin, the increases in resistance in commensal oropharyngeal streptococci must curb enthusiasm for its widespread application. In conclusion, long-term low-dose erythromycin significantly reduced exacerbations, protected against lung function decline, reduced sputum production, and significantly increased macrolide resistance in oropharyngeal streptococci. The bacterial resistance caused by macrolide therapy mandates a cautious application of this therapy in clinical practice. Further studies are needed to evaluate the possibility that P aeruginosa–infected individuals with frequent exacerbations may represent an appropriate subgroup for limitation of this therapy.

### Effect of azithromycin maintenance treatment on infectious exacerbations among patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis: the BAT randomized controlled trial… [^fb250cd1]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Bronchiectasis is radiographically characterized by pathologic dilation and mucosal thickening of the small and medium-sized bronchi. Structural abnormality of the bronchial wall causes impaired clearance of the lower airways, leading to chronic bacterial infection and inflammation, a process that has been referred to as a "vicious circle". 1 If progressive, this process may lead to respiratory failure and the need for lung transplantation or to death. The course of the disease is highly variable. Nearly symptom-free periods intersperse with infectious exacerbations, characterized by worsening of symptoms of productive cough, hemoptysis, and dyspnea. Frequent exacerbations have a major influence on quality of life.
2. An exacerbation was considered a PDE when at least 4 of the following 9 symptoms, signs, or findings were present: change in sputum production; increased dyspnea treated with antibiotics were reported during 1 year of treatment, 78 of which occurred in the placebo group. During the treatment period, the median number of exacerbations in the azithromycin group was 0, compared with 2 in the placebo group. Analysis of our secondary end points demonstrated a modest but statistically significant improvement of FEV₁ in the azithromycin group compared with the placebo group. Apart from the study by Tsang et al, 13 which found improvement in FEV1 in children, no other study showed functional improvement with macrolide therapy.

High-resolution computed tomography scans in patients with bronchiectasis do not exclusively show dilated bronchi but also signs of infection, such as mucus plugging, consolidation, and tree-in-bud sign, potentially resulting in airflow limitation and air trapping. Improvement in pulmonary function may eventually affect survival, because impaired lung function has been identified as an independent risk factor for mortality in patients with bronchiectasis. 27.

### The precision medicine era of bronchiectasis [^fa98478e]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical and Etiological Precision

Bronchiectasis is a clinically heterogeneous disease. The first step in managing a patient with bronchiectasis is asking the question "Why did this patient develop bronchiectasis?". In many cases, we do not know. Idiopathic disease accounts for up to 70% of cases in studies and was reported in 38.1% of cases in the recent report from EMBARC (European Multicentre Bronchiectasis Audit and Research Collaboration). Postinfection-related bronchiectasis (i.e. tuberculosis or pneumonia) is likely different from other forms, developing over a longer time period and potentially attributable to yet unidentified underlying functional immune defects. It is essential for precision medicine, however, to identify underlying causes with therapeutic implications, causes with specific treatments. These "causes" include primary and secondary immunodeficiencies, which may benefit from immunoglobulin replacement; ABPA, which may benefit from corticosteroids and/or antifungal treatments; and NTM infection, which may benefit from long-term combination antibiotic treatment. Inflammatory bowel disease–associated bronchiectasis is also reported to be highly corticosteroid responsive. Knowledge that certain underlying causes are associated with worse outcomes should also inform more aggressive therapeutic strategies. COPD and connective tissue diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are associated with significantly increased mortality and hospitalization rates. Although rarely identified in adults with bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with onset of symptoms during childhood and features such as infertility, pancreatic insufficiency, or other extrapulmonary features. P. aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus infection are also more common in this patient group. The availability of highly effective modulator therapy makes the identification of atypical presentations of cystic fibrosis essential as treatment can be life changing. PCD has both therapeutic and prognostic implications. The lack of effective mucociliary clearance in these patients requires a more intensive approach to airway clearance and the use of mucoactive therapies, as well as management of the upper airway disease, associated cardiac disease, and genetic counseling. Patients with PCD had a higher frequency of infection with pathogens including P. aeruginosa and worse clinical outcomes necessitating more intensive treatment and follow-up. Importantly, we do not find what we do not look for, and there is globally a lack of appropriate testing for underlying causes of bronchiectasis. Among 2,195 patients enrolled in the EMBARC India cohort, fewer than 5% underwent the European Respiratory Society–recommended etiological testing consisting of immunoglobulin testing and testing for ABPA, for example. The extent of underdiagnosis of specific causes is an important question for future research but has recently been addressed for PCD. In two studies from the United Kingdom, first in patients with severe bronchiectasis, whole-genome sequencing identified PCD in 12% of patients tested, while genetic testing revealed the disease in 7% of a second cohort of patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis not suspected to have PCD. Therefore, the etiology of bronchiectasis contributes substantially to precision, but clinical heterogeneity goes far beyond underlying cause. At the level of symptomatology, although the majority of patients experience the characteristic symptoms of cough and sputum production, the clinical phenotype of dry bronchiectasis is well recognized, and the extent and severity of mucus symptoms are highly variable from intermittent sputum production to several hundred milliliters of sputum production per day. Breathlessness was reported as difficult or very difficult by approximately 70% of patients in a European survey of > 700 patients, and additional common symptoms include fatigue, hemoptysis, anxiety and depression, and difficulty sleeping. The complexity of the disease is compounded by the frequency of comorbidities in these patients. A European multicenter study showed that patients had a median of four other diseases together with bronchiectasis. Many of these conditions, such as rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps or gastroesophageal reflux disease, are associated with clinical outcomes and are considered important treatable traits. Pulmonary function is also highly diverse. Bronchiectasis is often cited in textbooks as an obstructive disorder, but like many textbook descriptions of disease, this is true in only a proportion of patients. In a recent report from EMBARC of 16,963 patients from 28 countries, obstructive spirometry was the most common pattern, but nearly one-third of individuals had normal spirometry. Exacerbation frequency is also heterogeneous among individuals, and the observation that patients at high risk of exacerbation tend to exacerbate frequently year on year has been described as the frequent exacerbator phenotype. Frequent exacerbators, usually defined by three or more exacerbations per year, are at higher risk of future hospitalization and mortality. Clinical management is therefore heavily influenced by clinical phenotype in terms of etiology, exacerbations, symptoms, comorbidities, and physiology and must be considered to achieve precision.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^810af859]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) follow-up assessment — smoking status, measurements, imaging, and comorbidities — includes the following: At each visit, the current smoking status and smoke exposure should be determined followed by appropriate action. Decline in FEV₁ can be tracked by spirometry performed at regular intervals (e.g., yearly) and a timed walking test (6-minute walking distance or shuttle-walking test) provides additional information regarding prognosis. Measurement of oxygenation at rest in an arterial blood gas sample may help identify patients who will benefit from supplemental oxygen to improve both symptoms and survival in those with severe resting hypoxemia. If there is a clear worsening of symptoms, imaging may be indicated, and when exacerbations are repeatedly characterized by purulent sputum, patients should be investigated for bronchiectasis. Symptoms that may indicate the development or worsening of a comorbid condition should be recorded and, if present, an appropriate diagnostic work-up should follow.

### British thoracic society guideline for bronchiectasis in adults [^d9c874f8]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Research recommendations

Long-term randomised controlled trials of oral and inhaled antibiotics are needed to assess their efficacy and safety in patients with bronchiectasis who have frequent respiratory tract infections with recurrent P. aeruginosa infection or other potential pathogenic micro-organisms.

Does long-term bronchodilator treatment improve outcomes for patients with bronchiectasis?

Recommendations

Use of bronchodilators in patients with bronchiectasis and coexisting COPD or asthma should follow the guideline recommendations for COPD or asthma (D).
Offer a trial of long-acting bronchodilator therapy in patients with symptoms of significant breathlessness (D).
Reversibility testing to beta-2 agonist or anticholinergic bronchodilators may help to identify patients with coexisting asthma, but there is no evidence to suggest that a response is required in order to benefit from bronchodilators (D).

Pulmonary rehabilitation

Recommendations

Offer pulmonary rehabilitation to individuals who are functionally limited by shortness of breath (Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale ≥ 1) (B).
Consider the use of inspiratory muscle training in conjunction with conventional pulmonary rehabilitation to enhance the maintenance of the training effect (B).

Good practice points

Educate all individuals with bronchiectasis on the importance of an exercise training programme.
Consider the 6 minute walk test (6MWT) and/or the incremental shuttle walking test (ISWT) when evaluating exercise capacity before/after pulmonary rehabilitation in bronchiectasis. Prior to this, practice tests should be carried out to eliminate any learning effect.
Pulmonary rehabilitation providers should offer education sessions tailored to the needs of individuals with bronchiectasis (eg, airway clearance techniques, the pathophysiology of bronchiectasis and relevant inhaled therapy).
Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise and education sessions should be provided by appropriately qualified healthcare practitioners.

Further information on pulmonary rehabilitation is provided in the BTS Quality Standards for Pulmonary rehabilitation.

Research recommendation

The role of education, self-management plans and who delivers the pulmonary rehabilitation needs to be explored.

The role of pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbations requiring hospital admission needs to be explored.

The incidence of cross-infection of respiratory pathogens in the group exercise setting should be investigated in the bronchiectasis population.

### Bronchiectasis [^809963c5]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis, which was once thought to be an orphan disease, is now being recognized with increasing frequency around the world. Patients with bronchiectasis have chronic cough and sputum production, and bacterial infections develop in them that result in the loss of lung function. Bronchiectasis occurs in patients across the spectrum of age and gender, but the highest prevalence is in older women. The diagnosis of bronchiectasis is made by high-resolution CT scans. Bronchiectasis, which can be focal or diffuse, may occur without antecedent disease but is often a complication of previous lung infection or injury or is due to underlying systemic illnesses. Patients with bronchiectasis may have predisposing congenital disease, immune disorders, or inflammatory disease. The treatment of bronchiectasis is multimodality, and includes therapy with antibiotics, antiinflammatory agents, and airway clearance. Resectional surgery and lung transplantation are rarely required. The prognosis for patients with bronchiectasis is variable given the heterogeneous nature of the disease. A tailored, patient-focused approach is needed to optimally evaluate and treat individuals with bronchiectasis.

### Diagnosis and management of primary ciliary dyskinesia [^c1ecc43d]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Respiratory management

Following diagnosis, the goals of respiratory management are the initial improvement of any lung function deficit and subsequent limiting of disease progression. Treatment of lung disease is based upon airway clearance therapy and aggressive antibiotic.

Age-appropriate daily ACT should be prescribed for every patient and regularly reviewed. No individual technique has been shown to be superior and a patient's physiotherapy plan should be individualised, with adjuncts incorporated if appropriate.

ACT can be augmented with bronchodilators, exercise, mucolytics or mechanical cough assist, although there is paucity of evidence for their use. Regular salbutamol inhalation pre-physiotherapy is of unproven benefit. Physical exercise encourages secretion clearance as well as providing obvious general health benefits. Nebulised mucolytics remain unproven as a treatment and can be expensive and time-consuming. There are anecdotal reports that rhDNase is beneficial in some patients, but a study of adults with non-CF bronchiectasis showed it to be ineffective and potentially detrimen t al. Oral N-acetylcysteine has been shown to have no benefit in patients with PCD. Based on evidence from bronchiectasis of other aetiologies, hypertonic saline may be helpful.

Respiratory tract infections should be treated promptly and aggressively. A prolonged course of high-dose oral antibiotics can be prescribed in the settings of worsening respiratory symptoms, a deterioration in lung function or a positive culture. Culture-independent analysis of PCD respiratory samples has shown the bacteria present in PCD patient's airways to be plentiful and varied. The most commonly cultured pathogens are Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumonia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and non-tuberculous mycobacteria have also been reported, although predominantly in adults. Intravenous antibiotics can be used if there is no response to oral antibiotics. Patients with more severe lung disease may require three monthly intravenous antibiotics to limit disease progression. Isolates of P aeruginosa are treated with eradication protocols based on those used in CF, and chronic infection is often treated with long-term nebulised suppressive antibiotics. There is no evidence for or against the use of antibiotic prophylaxis; however, in children requiring frequent courses of antibiotics, they can be considered.

### Practical tips in bronchiectasis for primary care [^5e30c2cc]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Bronchiectasis is the third most common chronic inflammatory airway disease, after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma with a prevalence clearly underestimated probably because of its clinical similitudes with other chronic airway diseases. Bronchiectasis can be caused by a dozen of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary diseases and a variable number and severity of exacerbations can appear throughout its natural history, usually with an infectious profile. The dilation of the airway and the inflammation/infection is their radiological and pathophysiological hallmarks. Primary Care should play an important play in many aspects of the bronchiectasis assessment. In this article, we will try to offer a series of important concepts and practical tips on some key aspects of the diagnosis and management of bronchiectasis in Primary Care: clinical suspicion, diagnostic methods, severity assessment, overlap with asthma and COPD and microbiological and therapeutic aspects.

### Primary care implications of the British thoracic society guidelines for bronchiectasis in adults 2019 [^d7d414b2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

A diagnosis of bronchiectasis should be suspected when a patient presents with a persistent or recurrent productive cough. Definitive diagnosis is made by thin-section CT scan of the chest. Assessment of bronchiectasis should be carried out in secondary/tertiary care, where a shared management plan should be formulated with the patient and the community/primary care team.

Many patients can be routinely managed in primary care, where the cornerstone of management is physiotherapy to improve sputum clearance and maximise exercise capacity and prompt treatment of exacerbations with antibiotics.

The British Thoracic Society Bronchiectasis Guidelines provide advice for diagnosis and management of primary care in the United Kingdom. Although some of the advice, such as the type of antibiotics to be used, is specific to the United Kingdom, many of the recommendations are in line with those of the European Respiratory Society Guidelines 2017, and provide a sound basis for primary care management of this increasingly prevalent disease throughout the world.

### Bronchiectasis [^76b48022]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bronchiectasis is usually a complication of previous lower respiratory infection and/or inflammation. It causes chronic cough, copious production of sputum (often purulent), and recurrent infections, and may cause airway obstruction bearing some similarities with that seen in COPD. It may complicate respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD. It can be associated with primary ciliary dyskinesia, primary immunodeficiencies, certain systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and foreign body inhalation. Bronchiectasis can be due to cystic fibrosis but this is excluded from this review.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments in people with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Results

We found 23 studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: airway clearance techniques, corticosteroids (inhaled), exercise or physical training, hyperosmolar agents (inhaled), mucolytics, prolonged-use antibiotics, and surgery.

Diagnosis — In patients with chronic respiratory symptoms, diagnosis involves a stepwise approach beginning with whether the patient is likely to have chronic airways disease, then syndromic categorization as having typical asthma, typical COPD, features of both, and/or with other conditions such as bronchiectasis; lung function testing is essential to confirm persistent airflow limitation, and variable airflow obstruction can be detected with serial peak flow measurements and/or measurements before and after bronchodilator.

### Pathogenesis, imaging and clinical characteristics of CF and non-CF bronchiectasis [^b31859b8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Bronchiectasis is a common feature of severe inherited and acquired pulmonary disease conditions. Among inherited diseases, cystic fibrosis (CF) is the major disorder associated with bronchiectasis, while acquired conditions frequently featuring bronchiectasis include post-infective bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mechanistically, bronchiectasis is driven by a complex interplay of inflammation and infection with neutrophilic inflammation playing a predominant role. The clinical characterization and management of bronchiectasis should involve a precise diagnostic workup, tailored therapeutic strategies and pulmonary imaging that has become an essential tool for the diagnosis and follow-up of bronchiectasis. Prospective future studies are required to optimize the diagnostic and therapeutic management of bronchiectasis, particularly in heterogeneous non-CF bronchiectasis populations.

### The efficacy and safety of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of bronchiectasis in adults: updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa0bc17c]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

A key novel finding of our analysis is that inhaled antibiotics significantly improve symptoms and quality of life, contradicting the results of the previous meta-analysis and some of the large phase 3 trials. We observed small but significant improvements in both the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire scores. The consistency in these results between two tools applied in different trials makes it more likely that these estimates are true reflections of the underlying treatment effect. Although neither difference is greater than the minimum clinically important difference on average, it is likely that some patients will experience a clinically meaningful change in symptoms. A post hoc analysis of the ORBIT trials identified a significantly higher number of patients experiencing an 8-point improvement in the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis in the treatment vs the placebo group. A recent study found that patients experiencing a symptom improvement are not necessarily the same patients who experience a reduction in exacerbations. A high degree of heterogeneity in symptoms responses was found between studies, and further research is needed to understand why some populations experience a large symptom improvement and many do not. Patients are more likely to experience a symptom improvement if they show symptoms including cough and sputum production, because antibiotics primarily improve these symptoms. In support of this, we found that inhaled antibiotics reduce sputum volume. The magnitude of the differences observed in our analysis suggest that inhaled antibiotics will not be used primarily to reduce symptoms, but that patients being prescribed inhaled antibiotics to reduce exacerbations can be told that some patients also will experience a significant improvement in symptoms.

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^98653661]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Areas of future research — Airway clearance research in bronchiectasis due to CF or non-CF bronchiectasis has been underwhelming due to the lack of adequately powered randomized controlled trials, and future studies assessing the optimum method, duration, and frequency for long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance with clinical important outcomes are needed. Priorities include targeting primary outcomes such as exacerbation rate, hospitalization rate, quality of life using an instrument validated in CF and/or bronchiectasis, or mortality; testing whether regular daily airway clearance improves outcomes; defining the optimum method for long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance; and defining the optimum duration and frequency for daily long-term (> 28 days) airway clearance.

CHEST Expert Panel methods — PICO question, quality assessment, and peer review: "The identified systematic reviews were assessed for quality and risk of bias using the Documentation and Appraisal Tool for Systematic Reviews", and screening used "dual review", with "four panelists independently reviewed the titles and abstracts" and "In each step, dual review and dual extraction were performed". Initially, the key question was phrased as "Is there evidence of clinically relevant treatment effects for non-pharmacological therapies in cough treatment for patients with diseases that affect airway clearance and ineffective cough?" and "During the review process, the panel decided to substitute the word 'important' for 'relevant', eliminate the phrase 'ineffective cough', and to focus on bronchiectasis". The manuscript "went through 2 rounds of review".

### Interventions for bronchiectasis: an overview of cochrane systematic reviews [^2df8fdd2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic respiratory disease characterised by abnormal dilatation of the bronchi, and presents typically with a chronic productive cough (or chronic wet cough in children) and recurrent infective exacerbations. It significantly impacts daily activities and quality of life, and can lead to recurrent hospitalisations, severe lung function impairment, respiratory failure and even death.

Objectives

To provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of interventions for adults and children with bronchiectasis from Cochrane reviews. To identify gaps in the evidence base that will inform recommendations for new research and reviews, and to summarise information on reported outcomes and make recommendations for the reporting of standard outcomes in future trials and reviews.

Methods

We included Cochrane reviews of non-cystic fibrosis (CF) bronchiectasis. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The search is current to 11 February 2015. We also identified trials that were potentially eligible for, but not currently included in, published reviews to make recommendations for new Cochrane reviews. We assessed the quality of included reviews using the AMSTAR criteria. We presented an evidence synthesis of data from reviews alongside an evidence map of clinical trials and guideline data. The primary outcomes were exacerbations, lung function and quality of life.

Main Results

We included 21 reviews but extracted data from, and rated the quality of, only nine reviews that reported results for people with bronchiectasis alone. Of the reviews with no usable data, two reviews included studies with mixed clinical populations where data were not reported separately for people with bronchiectasis and 10 reviews did not contain any trials. Of the 40 studies included across the nine reviews, three (number of participants nine to 34) included children. The studies ranged from single session to year-long studies. Each review included from one to 11 trials and 28 (70%) trials in the overview included 40 or fewer participants. The total number of participants included in reviews ranged from 40 to 1040. The age range of adult participants was from 36 to 73 years and children ranged from six to 16 years. The proportion of male participants ranged from 21% to 72%. Where reported, mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 1.17 L to 1.66 L and from 47% to 88% predicted. Most of the reviews had search dates older than two years. We have summarised the published evidence as outlined in Cochrane reviews, but it was not possible to draw definitive conclusions. There was inconclusive evidence on the use of long-term antibiotics and nebulised hypertonic saline for reducing exacerbation frequency and evidence that human deoxyribonuclease (RhDNase) increases exacerbation frequency. Improvements in lung function were reported for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) though this was small and not clinically relevant. Evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents and mucolytics was inconclusive. There was limited evidence of improvements in quality of life with airway clearance techniques and physical therapy but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Secondary outcomes were not clearly reported in all trials in the included reviews. Improvements in dyspnoea, wheeze and cough-free days were reported for small trials of ICS and LABA (long-acting beta2-agonsts)/ICS and cough reduction was also reported for a small bromhexine trial. Reduction in sputum production was reported for long-term antibiotics and airway clearance techniques but evidence of benefit for hyperosmolar agents was inconclusive. Adverse events were included as outcomes in seven reviews. The review of long-term (four weeks to one year) prophylactic courses of antibiotics reported significantly more cases of wheeze (Peto odd ratio (OR) 8.56, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.63 to 44.93), dyspnoea (12 versus three, P value = 0.01) and chest pain (seven versus zero, P value = 0.01) from the same trial (74 participants) but no differences in occurrence of diarrhoea, rash or number of withdrawals. In the review of mucolytics versus placebo, relevant outcomes were not reported for erdosteine comparisons and no significant adverse effects were reported for bromhexine, though adverse events were associated with RhDNase (OR 28.19, 95% CI 3.77 to 210.85, 1 study). Of the remaining five reviews, adverse events were not reported in the single trials included in the ICS review or the physical therapy review and the impact of adverse events in the single trial included in the inhaled LABA/ICS combination versus ICS review were unclear. The reviews of short-term courses of antibiotics and inhaled hyperosmolar agents reported no significant differences in occurrence of adverse events. Fewer admissions to hospital were reported for long-term antibiotics, but this outcome was not reported in all reviews. No reviews reported differences in mortality, but again this outcome was not included in all reviews. We did not explicitly include antibiotic resistance as an outcome in the review, but this was unclear in the Cochrane reviews and evidence from other trials should be considered. We rated all reviews as high quality (AMSTAR), though opportunities for improved reporting (e.g. summary of findings and GRADE evaluation of the evidence) were identified for inclusion in future updates of the reviews. However, the majority of trials were not high quality and confidence in the effects of treatments, therefore, requires additional evidence from larger and more methodologically robust trials. We evaluated the overall coverage of important topics in bronchiectasis by mapping the quality of the current evidence base against published guidelines and identifying high priority areas for new research on; use of short-course and long-term antibiotics, ICS and oral corticosteroids, inhaled hyperosmolars, mucolytics, and use of airway clearance techniques.

Authors' Conclusions

This overview clearly points to significant opportunities for further research aimed at improving outcomes for people with bronchiectasis. We have highlighted important endpoints for studies (particularly exacerbations, quality of life and lung function), and areas of clinical practice that are in most urgent need of evidence-based support (including long-term antibiotics, ICSs and mucolytics). As the evidence is confined to small trials of short duration, it is not currently possible to assess the balance between the benefits and potential harms of treatments for bronchiectasis.

### Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis [^157fd812]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

There is renewed interest in non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, which is a cause of significant morbidity in adults and can be diagnosed by high-resolution chest computed tomography scan. No longer mainly a complication after pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, diverse disease processes and mechanisms have been demonstrated to result in the chronic cough, purulent sputum production, and airway dilation that characterize this disease. Improved understanding of the role of mucus stasis in causing bacterial colonization has led to increased emphasis on the use of therapies that enhance airway clearance. Inhalational antibiotics reduce the bacterial burden associated with a worse outcome. Low-dose, chronic macrolide therapy has been shown to decrease exacerbation frequency and airway inflammation. For the first time, a number of therapies for non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis are undergoing testing in clinical research trials designed specifically for this population. This concise clinical review focuses on the major etiologies, diagnostic testing, microbiology, and management of patients with adult non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis. Systematic evaluation identifies a specific cause in the majority of patients and may affect subsequent treatment. We outline current therapies and review the data that support their use.

### Treating cough due to non-CF and CF bronchiectasis with nonpharmacological airway clearance: CHEST expert panel report [^7c84aedd]. Chest (2018). Medium credibility.

Nonpharmacological airway clearance in cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis — conclusions: The effect of non-pharmacological airway clearance techniques on meaningful clinical outcomes in non-CF and CF bronchiectasis is still not known, and the systematic review identified gaps and areas for future research; a plea is made that clinically important outcomes should be targeted as primary outcomes in future studies to determine the meaningful role of these modalities. The report also poses the question of which target group(s) among children and adults with CF and non-CF bronchiectasis will benefit in meaningful clinical outcomes from airway clearance considering severity of bronchiectasis, frequency of exacerbations, and comorbidities.
