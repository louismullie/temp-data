## Question

Left foot recurent swelling painful gout

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing recurrent, painful left foot swelling consistent with gout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should assess disease severity and triggers. Next, I will outline acute flare management, followed by indications and initiation of urate-lowering therapy with prophylaxis. After that, I need to detail treat-to-target titration and monitoring. Finally, I will address special populations, patient education, and follow-up, while continuously verifying each step against current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based solely on history and exam. Recurrent monoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint with rapid onset of severe pain, erythema, warmth, and swelling strongly suggests gout, but I should verify with synovial fluid analysis when feasible because it remains the gold standard to identify monosodium urate crystals and to exclude septic arthritis or CPPD, especially if atypical features or infection risk are present [^113X9swV] [^111NWXYW]. Hold on, I should also check for red flags such as fever, immunocompromise, or skin breakdown that would lower my threshold to aspirate and send cultures, given the risk of superinfected tophus or septic arthritis in those scenarios [^112iYRcF].

> Wait, let me verify the role of serum urate here. Hyperuricemia supports the diagnosis but is neither necessary nor sufficient at the time of an acute flare, so I should not overinterpret a normal serum urate to exclude gout, nor assume a high value alone confirms it [^116XCZDk] [^113X9swV]. I should also consider validated clinical criteria and imaging when aspiration is not performed, integrating features like monoarticular foot involvement, rapid onset, erythema, and prior similar episodes to estimate probability, while remembering that ultrasound or dual-energy CT can demonstrate crystal deposition and help in equivocal cases [^1152rKQM] [^1135oGx4].

> Next, I should review disease severity and triggers to guide urgency and intensity of therapy. Let me think about frequency of flares, presence of tophi, radiographic damage, and comorbidities such as CKD, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and metabolic syndrome, as these factors influence both the indication for urate-lowering therapy and the choice of agents and dosing strategies [^115C6rnR] [^1172bSbo]. I need to ensure I screen for precipitating factors like alcohol, purine-rich diet, dehydration, acute illness, or surgery, and I should confirm medication contributors such as diuretics that can raise uric acid and worsen flares [^111wMtrC] [^112iYRcF].

> For acute flare management, I should act quickly and tailor therapy to comorbidities and contraindications. NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids are all first-line options with similar efficacy; NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors reduce pain and swelling comparably, while glucocorticoids are a reasonable alternative when NSAIDs or colchicine are contraindicated or poorly tolerated [^111ZX6nR] [^116qMxjN]. Hold on, I should verify dosing nuances: low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose with fewer GI adverse effects, and intra-articular steroids are particularly useful for a single hot joint when infection is excluded, while oral or intramuscular steroids can be used for polyarticular or injection-infeasible cases [^112n3eb2] [^116eZv8m]. If standard anti-inflammatories are contraindicated or ineffective, IL-1 blockade with agents like canakinumab can be considered, recognizing superior short-term outcomes but higher adverse event rates and cost compared with intramuscular triamcinolone in trials [^116TNCvZ] [^114gt9LN].

> I should confirm indications for urate-lowering therapy and the timing of initiation. Strong indications include tophaceous gout, radiographic damage attributable to gout, or frequent flares defined as two or more per year, and ULT should be initiated in these patients regardless of current serum urate level [^115C6rnR]. But wait, what if the patient is having a flare right now? The ACR conditionally recommends starting ULT during an acute flare as long as concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis is provided, whereas EULAR and BSR historically advised waiting until inflammation settles; shared decision-making is key here, and I should document the rationale if I choose to start during a flare [^11329roc] [^112nYRP4]. For patients with infrequent flares, conditional recommendations support ULT, particularly with high serum urate, CKD, or urolithiasis, and asymptomatic hyperuricemia alone is not an indication to start ULT [^112AQChh] [^115PSvuV].

> Let me first confirm the preferred first-line ULT and dosing strategy. Allopurinol is strongly recommended as first-line ULT, including in moderate-to-severe CKD, with a low starting dose of 100 mg daily or lower in CKD and dose titration every 2–5 weeks to achieve a serum urate target, which reduces the risk of early flares and hypersensitivity reactions [^115sedX8] [^112LeKpG]. I should double-check that the treat-to-target approach is emphasized over fixed dosing, with serial serum urate measurements guiding titration to maintain urate below 6 mg/dL, and in severe disease some experts aim lower, though evidence for thresholds below 6 mg/dL is limited outside of severe phenotypes [^1155wEsg] [^114YzRfQ].

> Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis against flares during ULT initiation. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis with low-dose colchicine or NSAIDs is strongly recommended for at least 3–6 months after starting ULT to mitigate the increased flare risk during urate mobilization, with the choice tailored to comorbidities and tolerability [^113ZunYn] [^113mx3QG]. I need to ensure patient education about early flare recognition and access to acute therapy during this period to prevent rebound flares and maintain adherence [^116V858N].

> Next, I should review treat-to-target monitoring and when to escalate therapy. I will check serum urate every 2–5 weeks during titration until the target is achieved, then monitor every 3–6 months long term, adjusting the dose to maintain urate below 6 mg/dL and documenting crystal dissolution and symptom control as outcomes of success [^1155wEsg] [^116z9DFQ]. If the serum urate remains above target despite a maximally tolerated XOI dose, I should consider switching to the other XOI or adding a uricosuric such as probenecid, noting that uricosurics are generally avoided in moderate-to-severe CKD and in patients with uric acid stones, and that alkalinization is not routinely recommended by ACR due to lack of efficacy data [^115sedX8] [^112M1odJ]. Let me reconsider imaging follow-up: ultrasound or dual-energy CT can be used selectively to document crystal burden reduction, especially in tophaceous disease or when clinical response is discordant with serum urate [^113VckzR].

> I will now examine special populations and scenarios. In CKD, allopurinol remains first-line with lower starting doses and slower titration, and febuxostat is an alternative when allopurinol is not tolerated, with careful monitoring and attention to cardiovascular risk discussions in shared decision-making [^115sedX8]. For patients of Southeast Asian or African descent, I should confirm HLA-B✱5801 status when feasible to mitigate allopurinol hypersensitivity risk, and if testing is not available, start very low and titrate cautiously with close monitoring [^112n3eb2]. In refractory disease or when XOIs are contraindicated, IL-1 inhibitors can be considered for flares and, in selected cases, for prophylaxis, balancing efficacy with infection risk and cost [^1158f87p] [^116TNCvZ].

> But wait, what about nonpharmacologic measures and education that sustain long-term control. I need to ensure counseling on weight loss, limiting alcohol especially beer, reducing purine-rich foods, maintaining hydration, and reviewing medications that raise uric acid such as thiazide diuretics, aligning these with pharmacologic therapy to improve adherence and outcomes [^111wMtrC] [^115uANby]. Let me verify that structured programs and nonphysician provider support can enhance treat-to-target implementation and persistence with ULT, which is emphasized in contemporary guidance [^114Nm3Rq].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up cadence and what to reassess. Early follow-up within 2–4 weeks after ULT initiation allows review of adherence, adverse effects, and early flares, with subsequent visits every 3–6 months to monitor serum urate, renal function, and clinical response, and to reinforce education and prophylaxis until flares cease and tophi regress if present [^116z9DFQ] [^113ZunYn]. I need to ensure the patient understands that ULT is generally lifelong to maintain crystal dissolution and prevent recurrence, and I should document shared decisions about ongoing therapy and any adjustments over time [^11452vHk].

Recurrent painful swelling of the left foot from gout is best managed with **early anti-inflammatory therapy** (NSAIDs, colchicine, or glucocorticoids) [^111ZX6nR] for acute flares and **urate-lowering therapy (ULT)** (allopurinol or febuxostat) to maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL and prevent future attacks [^1155wEsg]. If NSAIDs/colchicine are contraindicated, consider IL-1 inhibitors [^116TNCvZ]; for refractory cases, use combination therapy or pegloticase [^115sedX8]. Address modifiable risks (weight, alcohol, diet, hydration) and monitor serum urate every 3–6 months to guide ULT titration [^116MtxWn]; persistent swelling despite optimal therapy warrants evaluation for alternate diagnoses or joint damage [^1152rKQM].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical features**: Rapid onset of severe pain, swelling, erythema, and warmth, often at the first MTP joint (podagra); may involve midfoot, ankle, or tendons [^116XCZDk].

- **Laboratory tests**: Serum uric acid (may be normal during flares), CBC, ESR, CRP, and renal function tests [^113X9swV].

- **Imaging**: Ultrasound (double contour sign, tophi) or dual-energy CT (DECT) can detect urate crystals and guide management [^1135oGx4].

- **Differential diagnosis**: Septic arthritis, cellulitis, pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, Charcot arthropathy, and soft tissue tumors [^112iYRcF].

### Non-pharmacologic therapy

Non-pharmacologic therapy includes **rest, elevation, and ice** to reduce inflammation and pain, along with **hydration** to maintain adequate fluid intake and help prevent urate crystal formation.

---

## Long-term management and prevention of recurrent flares

### Urate-lowering therapy (ULT)

- **Indications**: ≥ 2 flares/year, tophi, radiographic damage, or CKD stage ≥ 3 [^112n3eb2].

- **First-line agents**: Allopurinol (start 100 mg/day, titrate to serum urate < 6 mg/dL) or febuxostat (start 40 mg/day) [^115sedX8].

- **Second-line agents**: Probenecid or benzbromarone if XOIs contraindicated or ineffective [^1132QA8x].

- **Pegloticase**: For refractory, chronic tophaceous gout [^notfound].

---

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications include **weight loss** to achieve a BMI < 25 kg/m², dietary changes to limit purines, alcohol (especially beer), and sugary drinks, and maintaining **adequate hydration** with > 2 L/day of water. Smoking cessation is also recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk and improve overall health.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **serum urate** checks every 3–6 months until the target is stable, then annually, with renal and liver function monitored periodically. Imaging with ultrasound or DECT can assess crystal burden and joint damage [^113VckzR]. Patient education should emphasize adherence, trigger avoidance, and recognition of early flares.

---

## Complications of untreated or poorly managed gout

- **Tophi**: Subcutaneous urate deposits causing deformity and functional impairment [^112iYRcF].

- **Joint damage**: Erosions, deformity, and chronic arthritis [^117Cd29C].

- **Renal disease**: Uric acid nephrolithiasis and chronic kidney disease [^117Cd29C].

- **Increased mortality**: Cardiovascular disease and infections [^111ixVmD].

---

## When to consider specialist referral

Specialist referral is indicated for **diagnostic uncertainty** requiring rheumatology or infectious disease input, refractory disease with persistent flares despite optimal therapy, complex comorbidities such as significant renal, hepatic, or cardiovascular disease, or when surgical evaluation is needed for tophi excision or joint repair [^111UkFwJ].

---

Recurrent painful swelling of the left foot from gout requires a **comprehensive approach**: prompt acute therapy, ULT to reach and maintain serum urate < 6 mg/dL, lifestyle changes, and regular monitoring. Persistent swelling despite optimal therapy should prompt reassessment for alternate diagnoses or joint damage [^116UvF9f].

Diagnosis

Clinical

An acute gout flare presents as a painful, swollen joint. Patients may complain of severe throbbing pain at night waking them from sleep and pain with ambulation if the foot and ankle are affected. They may note having had similar symptoms during previous gout flares if the condition is long standing. There may be a recent trigger, such as dehydration, alcohol/purine ingestion, illness, or surgical procedure. On examination, patients may have fever, pain with active and passive range of motion of the affected joint, tenderness to palpation, warmth, and erythema. Chronic tophaceous gout appears as subcutaneous nodules that are normally painless but become painful during a flare. The skin overlying the nodules may erode, revealing chalky tophaceous material. Ulceration over a gouty tophus is a risk factor for superinfection. Gout flares can occur in any joint but occur most commonly in the foot and ankle, specifically the first metatarsophalangeal joint.

If a patient with a painful, swollen joint has a history of gout and similar symptoms from previous flares, a gout flare is likely. In the case of no known previous gout history, atypical symptoms, or other risk factors for infection such as immunocompromise or overlying skin ulceration, gout diagnosis must be confirmed with aspiration to rule out septic arthritis, superinfected gout, or a different crystalline arthropathy such as pseudogout/calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for gout, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, EULAR 2020 guidelines recommend to establish a clinical diagnosis of gout, if synovial fluid analysis is not feasible, by the following highly suggestive (but not specific) features:

- male gender

- monoarticular involvement of a foot (especially the first metatarsophalangeal) or ankle joint

- previous similar acute arthritis episodes

- rapid onset of severe pain and swelling (at its worst in < 24 hours)

- erythema

- hyperuricemia

- associated CVDs.

The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is a condition that commonly affects the foot and ankle, and practitioners who treat these structures should be aware of the methods to diagnose and treat this form of arthritis. Practitioners also need to recognize extra-articular manifestations of the disease. Although the acutely red, hot, swollen joint is a common presentation, chronic tophaceous gout can be associated with pain, nodule formation, and cutaneous compromise. Since the underlying causes that lead to excessive monosodium urate deposition may be treatable, early and accurate diagnosis can be very beneficial and may even prevent articular degeneration.

### Foot pain, impairment, and disability in patients with acute gout flares: a prospective observational study [^113tPJMc]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of acute gout on foot pain, impairment, and disability.

Methods

This prospective observational study recruited 20 patients with acute gout flares. Patients were recruited from emergency departments, hospital wards, and rheumatology outpatient clinics throughout Auckland, New Zealand. Patients were recruited at the time of the flare (baseline visit) and then reassessed at a followup visit once the acute flare had resolved 6–8 weeks after the initial assessment. Swollen and tender joint counts, C-reactive protein levels, and serum urate levels were recorded at both visits. General and foot-specific outcome measures were also recorded at each visit, including pain visual analog scale, Health Assessment Questionnaire II, Lower Limb Tasks Questionnaire, and Leeds Foot Impact Scale.

Results

The foot was affected by acute gout in 17 patients (85%). Objective measures of joint inflammation, including swollen and tender joint counts and C-reactive protein levels, significantly improved at the followup visit compared with the baseline visit. At baseline, high levels of foot pain, impairment, and disability were reported. All patient-reported outcome measures of general and foot-specific musculoskeletal function improved at the followup visit compared with the baseline visit. However, pain, impairment, and disability scores did not entirely normalize after resolution of the acute gout flare.

Conclusion

Patients with acute gout flares experience severe foot pain, impairment, and disability. These data provide further support for improved management of gout to prevent the consequences of poorly controlled disease.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^116ZEH7Y]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of joint pain and swelling, which can necessitate hospital admission when severe. Highly effective, low-cost medications are available for the treatment of gout flares: colchicine, NSAIDs and corticosteroids. Flares can be prevented by urate-lowering therapies (ULTs), of which allopurinol is the most widely used. British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) and EULAR guidelines recommend offering ULT to all patients with gout, with up-titration to achieve serum urate (SU) levels of 300–360 micromol/l (5–6 mg/dl), to facilitate crystal dissolution. The ACR gout management guideline was recently updated to conditionally recommend initiation of ULT during flares, rather than delayed initiation of ULT after flare resolution.

Despite effective treatments, hospitalizations for gout flares have increased dramatically: doubling in the United States between 1993 and 2011, from 4.4 to 8.8 admissions per 100 000 adults, respectively; doubling in Canada between 2000 and 2011, from 3.8 to 7.6 admissions per 100 000 adults; and increasing by 58.4% in England between 2006 and 2017, from 7.9 to 12.5 admissions per 100 000 adults. This contrasts with the decline in hospitalizations from RA. There are multiple contributing factors to the epidemic of gout hospitalizations: the prevalence of gout has increased in Western countries in recent years on a background of an ageing population with rising prevalences of obesity and metabolic syndrome; the management of gout is frequently suboptimal in primary care, rheumatology clinics and inpatient settings, and only a minority of patients achieve the SU levels required to prevent flares.

Hospital admissions provide a unique opportunity to engage patients in shared decision-making and begin the process of establishing optimal ULT. What is not known is how best to implement evidence-based treatments during hospitalizations for gout. Such strategies are essential if the rising number of gout admissions is to be countered. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of interventions in patients hospitalized with gout.

### Managing gout in the primary care setting: what you and your patients need to know [^114wkUDZ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The US prevalence of gout, a rapidly progressive inflammatory arthritic condition linked to serum uric acid levels, has grown in recent years, in part due to the increasing prevalence and incidence of predisposing factors in the population, such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and the use of diuretics. Left untreated, gout can be debilitating and cause deformity. Although a definitive diagnosis requires joint aspiration, only approximately 11% of patients with suspected gout undergo this procedure, and a presumptive diagnosis based on patient medical history and presentation with characteristic symptoms and comorbidities is a reasonable guidelines-based approach that has utility in the primary care setting, where approximately 70% of all cases and nearly 3,000,000 visits occur. The therapeutic standard for patients with recurrent gout flares is urate-lowering therapy (ULT), including allopurinol and the recently introduced febuxostat, the first new treatment for gout in 40 years. Although ULT must be taken consistently to sustain benefits, inadequate dosing and patient nonadherence or intolerance to therapy often lead to treatment failure. It is important that primary care clinicians understand gout diagnosis and therapeutic approaches and can communicate effectively with patients to improve treatment adherence.

### Can gout mimic a soft tissue tumour? [^112ga4yQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout is a disease where an abnormal collection of uric crystals (gouty tophi) can often be found in the foot and ankle. Occasionally such tophies are found at unusual sites and this can pose a challenge to the clinician where diagnosis and treatment is concerned. We describe a patient who presented to our oncology department with a swelling on his right thigh which was clinically diagnosed to be a soft tissue sarcoma, but after further investigations it turned out to be a gouty tophi. The purpose of this case report is to emphasise the variable presentation of gout and the challenges that can be faced by clinicians in diagnosing a soft tissue swelling.

### One year in review 2018: gout [^111ixVmD]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthropathy, and is associated with excruciating pain, major impairment of quality of life, and increased risk of comorbidities and mortality. Although gout has somehow been neglected by researchers and clinicians in the past, in more recent times there has been a renewed interest in this disease, which has led to major improvements in its management. This article reviews the new clinical and experimental evidence about gout that emerged in 2017 and in the first half of 2018.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^112Pn9MC]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical case

The patient, a 60‐year‐old man, presents with a six‐hour history of right big toe pain and swelling. He awoke overnight with a throbbing sensation in the toe and, over one hour, developed intense pain, redness, heat, and swelling of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever experienced (9 of 10 in severity). He is unable to move the joint, take weight on his foot, or put on a shoe. The day before, he celebrated his 60th birthday with a round of golf and a large meal. He had an episode of joint pain and swelling in the left ankle six months ago, which was treated with naproxen and resolved after one week. He usually has no joint pain. He has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.

Examination shows that he is distressed with the pain. There is exquisite tenderness, swelling, warmth, and erythema of the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. He is unable to bear weight on the right foot. The other joints examine normally. There is a small white nodule (tophus) on the helix of the left ear.

Laboratory test findings show a C‐reactive protein level of 68 mg/L (reference range < 5 mg/L) and a neutrophil count of 12.3 × 10/L (reference range 1.9–7.5 × 10/L). The serum urate level measures 8.0 mg/dL (reference range 3.3–7.0 mg/dL).

Point‐of‐care ultrasound shows a double contour sign, together with grade 3 synovial hypertrophy and color Doppler signal at the right first metatarsophalangeal joint. At the left first metatarsophalangeal joint, a double contour sign is also present, together with a tophus and adjacent bone erosion at the medial metatarsal head.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^116UvF9f]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, there are numerous causes of joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. Many can be attributed to minor activity or overuse-related injury, especially in the overweight and obese populations, but in the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, other diagnoses must be considered. These typically fall into two categories in children and adolescents: bony or structural causes, or rheumatologic conditions. Careful history and physical examination, along with use of imaging and laboratory studies, can often distinguish between the two; however, when a complete work-up is performed and no clear answer emerges, the differential must be expanded. In the rare case in which a firm primary diagnosis has been made, it is more difficult still to consider additional, secondary, causes of joint pain.

The following case describes an adolescent young man with severe ankle pain, as well as multiple other joint complaints, who was correctly diagnosed and treated for polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. While the majority of his joints improved, his ankle continued to be extremely tender and swollen. After two years of aggressive medical treatment, surgical procedures, and multiple imaging studies, it was careful probing into his history and classic physical examination findings that ultimately led to the additional diagnosis of gout.

Epidemiology, diagnosis and optimal management of gout.

Second is the challenge of correctly diagnosing gout. Gout manifests as intermittent monarticular acute arthritis in the early years/phase of the disease and as chronic polyarthritis with intermittent flares in the later years. Tophi and renal stones may accompany arthritis. The rates of joint fluid aspirate-proven diagnosis of gout are low. Given the common involvement of great toe and other lower extremity joints in two other common conditions, osteoarthritis and pseudogout, a presumptive diagnosis of gout based on a history of big toe pain and a borderline high or higher than normal range serum urate level is problematic (Figure 8). Documentation of additional clinical features of acute synovitis, radiographic signs of overhanging margin and punched-out erosions typical of gout, and close attention to looking for features of other differential diagnoses (osteoarthritis, pseudogout and rheumatoid arthritis), will often help in a correct diagnosis of gout. The 1977 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria for classification of acute gouty arthritis are also commonly used for a clinical diagnosis of gout, but are inadequate for in-office diagnosis in about 21% of cases. Attempts should always be made to aspirate joint/bursa/tophus and confirm the diagnosis, since documentation of urate crystals in synovial fluid confirms gout as a single test and the treatment for gout is often life-long.

### An update on the management of gout [^114tvpxq]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and its incidence in the UK has steadily increased from 1.5% in 1997 to 2.5% in 2012. 1,2 It is characterised by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues and usually presents with intermittent painful attacks followed by long periods of remission. 3 It has been suggested that the management of gout in the UK remains suboptimal. 1 In 2004, we concluded that there was a woeful lack of evidence to guide treatment or prophylaxis for gout, particularly with regard to choice of drug or doses. 4 The introduction of new drugs and new evidence on the efficacy and safety of treatment options has led the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the British Society of Rheumatology (BSR) to update their guidelines on the management of gout. 2,5 Nevertheless, there are differing views on target serum uric acid (SUA) levels and the role of urate lowering treatment (ULT). 2,5–7 Here, we review the latest guidance on the management of gout and consider the role of long-term ULT.

Case 1

The first case was a 32-year-old man with intermittent joint swelling and pain over 6 years, which aggravated 2 months ago. The patient had also experienced left gluteal pain for 2 weeks. The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) of the left foot was affected at the onset, and the pain gradually involved all MTPJs, both ankles and knees, left elbow and tarsal joints of both feet. The patient had a high purine diet history before joint swelling and pain in the early period of this disease, each episode involving one to two joints, and intermission gradually reduced from 6 months to 1 week. His serum urate levels were elevated, but he did not accept regular treatment. Approximately 2 years ago, the patient took dexamethasone for joint swelling and pain, although the specific dosage was unknown. He had experienced right knee joint swelling and pain without any significant predisposing factor 2 months earlier, and the symptoms were relieved after intra-articular betamethasone injection. But, joint swelling and pain involving both ankles, tarsal joints and MTPJs reappeared 1 week after discontinuing treatment. The pain in the left gluteal region occurred 2 weeks before the current admission, and was sharp when changing position, but was unclear at rest and night. There was no infection of urinary and intestinal tracts before hip pain. The patient had no history of psoriasis and iritis. Lumbar disk herniation was diagnosed 7 years earlier because of low back pain with left lower limb radiating pain. Physical examination showed the following: obesity, a grain size of tophi visible on the edge of the right ear, right knee joint tenderness without swelling, double ankle joint tenderness with slight swelling and tenderness of all MTPJs of the left foot and tarsal joints of both feet, but no tenderness of the SIJ. Laboratory tests showed the following: serum uric acid (UA) 564.2 µmol/L, triglycerides (TGs) 2.12 mmol/L, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 32 mm/h, negative human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 and rheumatoid factor. CT of the SIJ showed bone erosion of the left SIJ (Figure 1). MRI of the SIJ showed the unilateral SIJs of the left articular surface with patchy hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 signals. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) showed the hyperintense signal of the left SIJ with edge blurring, mainly indicating the sacroiliitis (Figure 2). He underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of the left SIJ, and monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were shown by polarized microscopy (Figure 3A), although histopathology of the puncture objects did not indicate tophus formation (Figure 3B). Therefore, the clinical diagnosis of gouty arthritis was correct. Loxoprofen sodium tablets were given to the patient at the onset without satisfactory results, so prednisone was then prescribed and the symptoms were relieved soon after. After the symptoms of acute gout subsided, the patient took allopurinol.

### Crystal-induced arthritides in the elderly: an update [^113GDZSA]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence of gout increases with age. After the serum concentration of urate exceeds the saturation or solubility point, it deposits in and around the joints. Presentation in the elderly is often atypical and challenging to diagnose. Treatment depends on disease stage, health status, and comorbidities. Elderly patients often have several confounding issues; treatment decisions can be complicated and therapeutic options limited. To prevent recurrence, serum concentration of urate should be maintained well below the saturation threshold of 6.8 mg/dL, leading to dissolution of urate deposits and preventing recurrence.

### Up-to-date management of gout [^113K62i4]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is a true crystal deposition disease, extremely painful and bone and tissue damaging if untreated. It is the only curable form of arthritis. Although we have many treatments to cure gout, it is a disease that is consistently undertreated/mismanaged and perceived by clinicians and the lay public as a 'laughable condition' with the patients' lifestyle often held erroneously to account. This article would give you a good understanding of modern and established pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments used in the management of acute and chronic gout and how to 'treat to target' to cure the disease.

Recent Findings

Many of the drugs we use to manage patients with gouty arthritis have been in existence since the 1970s and 1980s. In the past few years, because of the improved physiological understanding of gout, new innovative treatments such as anti-IL inhibitors, a nonxanthine oxidase inhibitor and the uricase enzymes have been developed adding to our armamentarium of drugs.

Summary

With the introduction of new research, we have been able to explore how to also use established treatments more effectively, raising the profile of gout and its best management and introducing the principle of treating the patient to urate target.

### Diagnosis of acute gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111NWXYW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis of gout.

Methods

This guideline is based on a systematic review of published studies on gout diagnosis, identified using several databases, from database inception to February 2016. Evaluated outcomes included the accuracy of the test results; intermediate outcomes (results of laboratory and radiographic tests, such as serum urate and synovial fluid crystal analysis and radiographic or ultrasonography changes); clinical decision making (additional testing and pharmacologic or dietary management); short-term clinical (patient-centered) outcomes, such as pain and joint swelling and tenderness; and adverse effects of the tests. This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations by using the ACP grading system, which is based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) method.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with joint inflammation suspected to be gout.

Recommendation

ACP recommends that clinicians use synovial fluid analysis when clinical judgment indicates that diagnostic testing is necessary in patients with possible acute gout. (Grade: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

A 14-year-old girl was admitted to our institute with a history of intermittent bilateral ankle swelling, and moderate but progressively worsening pain which has lasted for 2years. The patient's history was unremarkable. She did not take medications and was not involved in any sports activity. She reported no fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, weight loss, travels abroad or previous infections. She reported moderate pain at night, associated with a sense of heaviness, tightness and general discomfort, and with no response to ibuprofen. Physical examination was remarkable only for bilateral ankle non-pitting oedema, more evident on the left leg, with a thickened skinfold at the base of the second toe, and without redness, swelling or skin warming. The patient had been previously examined, and her foot and ankle X-rays, ultrasound (US) and MRI were all negative. Blood tests (white cell count, C reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin, antinuclear antibodies, creatinine, transaminase, creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, thyroid function and glucose) and urinalysis were in the normal range. Her ocular assessment and echocardiogram were also normal.

We report the case of a 60-year-old Caucasian man with poorly controlled polyarticular tophaceous gout with multiple comorbidities (including renal failure) who presented with tophaceous ulcers of the upper extremity. These ulcers caused extreme pain, requiring chronic opiate medications, and were associated with decreased sensation and reduced ability to move the extremity. His hospital course was complicated by acute kidney injury, haemolytic anaemia and Clostridium difficile infection. He required 1 month of antibiotics and intensive wound care for his ulcers. This case highlights the diagnosis, natural history and management of an unusual complication of hyperuricemia.

### Charcot foot: the diagnostic dilemma [^111NcNz9]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians involved in the management of patients with diabetes are likely to encounter the diagnostic and treatment challenges of pedal neuropathic joint disease, also known as Charcot foot. The acute Charcot foot is characterized by erythema, edema and elevated temperature of the foot that can clinically mimic cellulitis or gout. Plain film radiographic findings can be normal in the acute phase of Charcot foot. A diagnosis of Charcot syndrome should be considered in any neuropathic patient, even those with a minor increase of heat and swelling of the foot or ankle, especially after any injury. Early recognition of Charcot syndrome and immobilization (often with a total contact cast), even in the presence of normal radiographs, can minimize potential foot deformity, ulceration and loss of function. Orthopedic or podiatric foot and ankle specialists should be consulted when the disease process does not respond to treatment.

Clinical case follow‐up

The diagnosis of a gout flare is made, and the patient is prescribed prednisone 40 mg daily for one week. This treatment results in clinical improvement and full resolution of symptoms over 10 days. In view of his recurrent gout flares and clinical evidence of tophus, urate‐lowering therapy is recommended, and allopurinol is started at 100 mg daily and gradually increased to 400 mg daily, which reduces the serum urate level to 5.2 mg/dL. Low‐dose colchicine (0.6 mg daily) is also prescribed in the first six months of allopurinol treatment to prevent recurrent gout flares.

The patient continues to experience mild gout flares over the first year of allopurinol treatment, which are rapidly treated by a home supply of prednisone. After three years of allopurinol treatment, he has been free of gout flares for more than a year, and the nodule on his ear has disappeared. He can exercise regularly and enjoys his 63rd birthday without pain!

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^1158f87p]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^113ZunYn]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^116qMxjN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Orthopaedic management of gout [^111UkFwJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Finally, there has been some research to suggest that arthroscopic irrigation and débridement of the first MTPJ in recalcitrant cases of gout can result in clinical improvement with reduced frequency of attacks; however, more work in this area is needed to determine which patients benefit from this approach.

Sesamoids

Several case reports have described gout as a potential cause of sesamoid pain, with all reported cases in younger adults aged 17 to 41 years. In these cases, gout was a diagnosis of exclusion and ultimately confirmed with histologic examination at the time of surgery. None of these patients reported a history of gout or had a preoperative elevated uric acid level. All cases were treated with either partial or complete excision of the affected sesamoid with resolution of symptoms. In two of those cases, the diagnosis of gout was in association with a procedure performed for a sesamoid fracture. Given that sesamoid pain can be difficult to treat nonsurgically, consideration to gout as a differential diagnosis is reasonable; however, based on the few reported cases, it is likely a rare etiology.

Tibialis Anterior

Gout has also been described as a rare cause of spontaneous tibialis anterior tendon rupture. When considering gout at a potential etiology for spontaneous tibialis anterior rupture, it is important to exclude other potential causes such as prior steroid injection into the tibialis anterior tendon sheath or systemic steroid treatment. Both nonsurgical treatment with ankle foot orthosis and surgical treatment with either direct repair of the tendon (with or without allograft augmentation) or a variety of tendon transfer techniques may be considered in these cases depending on the patients' functional goals and risk factors for surgery.

### Gout in a 15-year-old boy with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a case study [^117U7R79]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Joint pain is a common complaint in pediatrics and in the face of persistent, severe, or recurrent symptoms, the differential typically expands to include bony or structural causes versus rheumatologic conditions. In this case, however, diagnosis was complicated because the child had two distinct etiologies causing joint pain. Moreover, the patient's second diagnosis was gout, a very uncommon condition in a pediatric patient, even in the setting of morbid obesity.

Poly-articular juvenile idiopathic arthritis was considered as the unifying diagnosis when the patient presented with involvement of multiple joints. The typical presenting features of JIA are morning stiffness, pain and swelling of the joints, limited range of motion, and joint contractures. Radiographs may show some soft tissue swelling and osteopenia early, with subchondral sclerosis and erosions evident after long-standing disease, but MRI has been shown to be more sensitive for bone marrow edema and tenosynovitis, as well as bone erosions, cartilage lesions, and synovial hypertrophy. JIA is most often seen in children of European descent, but affects children throughout the world. The disease is thought to be idiopathic with its cause poorly understood, although there is mounting evidence that autoimmunity may be involved. There is also thought to be potential genetic susceptibility in affected individuals. While the majority of the patient's overall complaints did seem to fit the diagnosis of JIA both in his clinical presentation and laboratory and imaging results, as well as his response to treatment, his right ankle continued to be refractory to treatment.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part I: diagnosis. report of a task force of the standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^113X9swV]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the diagnosis of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert, representing 13 European countries. Ten key propositions regarding diagnosis were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Wherever possible the sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio (LR), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated for diagnostic tests. Relative risk and odds ratios were estimated for risk factors and co-morbidities associated with gout. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the evidence hierarchy. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

10 key propositions were generated though three Delphi rounds including diagnostic topics in clinical manifestations, urate crystal identification, biochemical tests, radiographs, and risk factors/co-morbidities. Urate crystal identification varies according to symptoms and observer skill but is very likely to be positive in symptomatic gout (LR = 567 (95% confidence interval (CI), 35.5 to 9053)). Classic podagra and presence of tophi have the highest clinical diagnostic value for gout (LR = 30.64 (95% CI, 20.51 to 45.77), and LR = 39.95 (21.06 to 75.79), respectively). Hyperuricaemia is a major risk factor for gout and may be a useful diagnostic marker when defined by the normal range of the local population (LR = 9.74 (7.45 to 12.72)), although some gouty patients may have normal serum uric acid concentrations at the time of investigation. Radiographs have little role in diagnosis, though in late or severe gout radiographic changes of asymmetrical swelling (LR = 4.13 (2.97 to 5.74)) and subcortical cysts without erosion (LR = 6.39 (3.00 to 13.57)) may be useful to differentiate chronic gout from other joint conditions. In addition, risk factors (sex, diuretics, purine-rich foods, alcohol, lead) and co-morbidities (cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and chronic renal failure) are associated with gout. SOR for each proposition varied according to both the research evidence and expert opinion.

Conclusions

10 key recommendations for diagnosis of gout were developed using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence for diagnostic tests, risk factors, and co-morbidities was evaluated and the strength of recommendation was provided.

### The modern management of gout [^114xwFmG]. Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis characterized by self-limiting but excruciatingly painful acute attacks. These are a consequence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals being deposited within articular or periarticular tissue. Chronic tophaceous gout can develop after years of acute intermittent gout. Recent discoveries, including the role of the inflammasome and intracellular events demonstrating that pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1 beta, -8 and TNF-alpha, promote neutrophil influx. Also, genetic advances with the identification of the URAT-1 transporter and genetic variation in SLC 2A9 as a key regulator of urate homoeostasis, have given us deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of gout, and also allow for more targeted treatments. Hopefully, new and emerging therapeutic options will reduce treatment-resistant gout in patients who are unresponsive or unable to take traditional urate lowering therapy. The development of new therapies may also increase patient numbers being treated in the specialist setting, which may have several secondary benefits.

### Spontaneous resolution of acute gout: mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^117DkHKm]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis that has been increasing in both prevalence and incidence. Consequently, management of refractory and chronic gout has been gaining attention. Onset of gout is related to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals under hyperuricaemia. Interestingly, acute gout attacks often resolve spontaneously within 7–10 days, and many studies have confirmed the notion that gout flares can be self-relieved. However, the underlying mechanism for spontaneous remission of gout requires further elucidation. In this article, we summarise the roles and mechanisms related to spontaneous remission of gout, which are essential for understanding its pathogenesis and developing potential targeted therapies.

### Interleukin-1 inhibitors for acute gout [^114gt9LN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Acute gout flares cause significant pain and disability and it is important to provide quick and effective pain relief. Traditional options for managing acute flares include colchicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of interleukin-1 inhibitors (anakinra, canakinumab, rilonacept) in acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 19 June 2013. We applied no date or language restrictions. We performed a handsearch of the abstracts from the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) (2009 to 2012) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (2009 to 2011) conferences and of the references of all included trials. We also screened the Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the World Health Organization and Clinical Trials Registry Platform of the US National Institutes of Health.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised clinical trials (controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) assessing an interleukin-1 inhibitor (anakinra, canakinumab or rilonacept) against placebo or another active treatment (colchicine, paracetamol, NSAIDs, glucocorticoids (systemic or intra-articular), adrenocorticotropin hormone, a different interleukin-1 blocking agent or a combination of any of the above) in adults with acute gout.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted the data. If appropriate, we pooled data in a meta-analysis. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included four studies (806 participants) in the review. The studies had an unclear risk of selection bias and low risk of performance and attrition biases. One study each had an unclear risk of detection and selection bias. Three studies (654 participants) compared subcutaneous canakinumab compared with intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in the treatment of acute gout flares of no more than five days' duration. Doses of canakinumab were varied (10 to 150 mg), but most people (255/368) were treated with canakinumab 150 mg. None of the studies provided data on participant-reported pain relief of 30% or greater. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that canakinumab 150 mg was probably superior to triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in terms of pain relief, resolution of joint swelling and in achieving a good treatment response at 72 hours following treatment, but was probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Mean pain (0- to 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS), where 0 mm was no pain) was 36 mm after triamcinolone acetonide treatment; pain was further reduced by a mean of 11 mm with canakinumab treatment (mean difference (MD) -10.6 mm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -15.2 to -5.9). Forty-four per cent of participants treated with canakinumab had resolution of joint swelling at 72 hours compared with 32% of participants treated with triamcinolone (risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.74, number needed to treat for an addition beneficial outcome (NNTB) 9); 65% of participants treated with canakinumab assessed their response to treatment as good or excellent compare with 47% of participants treated with triamcinolone acetonide (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.61, NNTB 6). Function or health-related quality of life were not measured. In both groups, 0.7% of participants withdrew from treatment (RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2 to 7.2); there was one death and one alteration of laboratory results in each of the treatment groups. Adverse events were more frequent in participants receiving canakinumab (61%) compared with triamcinolone acetonide (51%; RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4, number needed to treat for an addition harmful outcome (NNTH) 10). Low-quality evidence from one study (152 participants with an acute gout flare of no more than 48 hours' duration and affecting fewer than four joints) comparing rilonacept 320 mg with indomethacin (50 mg three times a day for three days followed by 25 mg three times a day for up to nine days) indicated that indomethacin may improve pain more than rilonacept at 24 to 72 hours, and there may be no evidence of a difference in withdrawal rates or adverse events. The mean change (improvement) in pain from baseline with indomethacin was 4.3 points (measured on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale, where 0 was no pain); pain was improved by a mean of only 2.5 points with rilonacept (MD 2.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 4.75, 25% less improvement in absolute pain with rilonacept). Inflammation, function health-related quality of life and participant global assessment of treatment success were not measured. Rates of study withdrawals due to adverse events were low in both groups: 1/75 (1%) participants in the rilonacept group compared with 2/76 (3%) participants in the indomethacin group (RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.05 to 5.5). Adverse events were reported in 27/75 (36%) participants in the rilonacept group and 23/76 (30%) in the indomethacin group (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9).

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence indicated that compared with a single suboptimal 40-mg dose of intramuscular injection of triamcinolone acetonide, a single subcutaneous dose of 150 mg of canakinumab probably results in better pain relief, joint swelling and participant-assessed global assessment of treatment response in people with an acute gout flare but is probably associated with an increased risk of adverse events. The cost of canakinumab is over 5000 times higher than triamcinolone acetonide; however, there are no data on the cost-effectiveness of this approach. We found no studies comparing canakinumab with more commonly used first-line therapies for acute gout flares such as NSAIDs or colchicine. Low-quality evidence indicated that compared with maximum doses of indomethacin (50 mg three times a day), 320 mg of rilonacept may provide less pain relief with a similar rate of adverse events.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^113bRmD5]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Diagnosis and treatment of gout [^114KMSzy]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is an ancient disease that has caused pain and suffering over many centuries. The tragedy is that today we have excellent medication for the prevention of chronic gout, yet many people continue to be plagued by gout attacks and develop chronic arthritis. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide. This is related to ageing and lifestyle changes. Gout is increased in people with the metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of diuretics and intake of beer and sugared drinks.

This video and associated Powerpoint presentations should help anyone who manages patients with gout to understand how to elicit a good history, examine them and generate a differential diagnosis; the emphasis is to understand the causes of gout and take a proactive role (see online supplementary video and file). The good news is that gout can improve with lifestyle changes, and medication is relatively inexpensive.

### Gout [^111wMtrC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on gout:

- **Definition**: Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterized by the deposition of monosodium urate monohydrate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: Gout is due to persistently elevated blood levels of uric acid (hyperuricemia), which is often multifactorial (increased intake of purine-rich foods, defects in purine metabolism, older age, male sex, obesity, renal failure, diuretics).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of gout is estimated at 3,900 persons per 100,000 population. The incidence of gout is estimated at 400 per 100,000 person-years in men, and 140 per 100,000 person-years in women.
- **Disease course**: In patients with acute gout, deposition of urate monohydrate crystals inside joint cavities initiate an inflammatory response that results in the clinical manifestations of arthritis. Chronic synovitis, bony erosions, cartilage damage, and tophi formation may occur in patients with chronic gout.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The 1-year recurrence rate for acute gout attack in patients who have experienced an attack in the past year is estimated at 69%.

### Gout: a clinical and radiologic review [^117Cd29C]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### Gout: update on some pathogenic and clinical aspects [^111gQVTo]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Pathogenesis of gout inflammation remains unknown, but recent advances have been made with respect to initiation, amplification, and self-limitation. Direct crystal-cell membrane contact leads to cell activation, involving membrane-associated molecules. Resolution of acute gout inflammation is a mechanism that is controlled by monocyte-macrophage switch, which results in the loss of cytokine production capability and, conversely, the ability to produce anti-inflammatory molecules. MRI and ultrasound findings provide preliminary data that are not yet used in clinical trials. Diagnosis and management recommendations are missing, but this gap will be filled soon with the upcoming European League Against Rheumatism Task Force's recommendations on gout.

Long-term management of gout focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means to achieve and maintain serum urate levels in a subsaturating range. Despite a firm understanding of gout pathophysiology, means to achieve certain diagnosis, and a variety of effective therapies, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

Key Points for Practice
- During a second gout flare-up in one year, low-dose allopurinol can be started with anti-inflammatory therapy without worsening the flare-up.
- Allopurinol is the preferred urate-lowering agent, but HLA testing should be offered to patients of Southeast Asian or African American descent before starting to identify patients at risk for an allergic reaction. From the AFP Editors Although effective medications exist to prevent and treat acute flare-ups, gout remains the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States. Urate-lowering therapy is underused despite previous recommendations from the American College of Rheumatology. The ACR published updated guidelines for gout management focused on improving prevention of flare-ups. When to Consider Urate-Lowering Therapy Urate-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with two or more gout flare-ups per year, tophaceous gout, or damage attributable to gout visible on radiography.

Consider starting therapy for patients with a second flare-up even if not within one year. With a first gout flare-up, shared decision-making is appropriate in patients at high risk because of a serum urate level of 9 mg per dL or higher, urolithiasis, or stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. Urate-lowering therapy has not been shown to be beneficial for patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia. The ACR recommends starting urate-lowering therapy during an acute flare-up instead of waiting until it resolves. Therapy started during a flare-up does not increase or prolong symptoms as long as anti-inflammatory treatments are provided. The ACR notes that patients are most motivated for treatment during an exacerbation. Anti-inflammatory medications such as colchicine or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be continued for three to six months after starting urate-lowering therapy.

Acute Flare-up Management Several medications are effective for acute flare-ups. The effectiveness of low-dose colchicine is similar to that of high-dose colchicine with fewer adverse effects. NSAIDs and glucocorticoids are as effective as colchicine. Glucocorticoids can be given intramuscularly, intra-articularly, or orally. Interleukin-1 inhibitors and adrenocorticotropic hormone have less evidence and higher cost. Limited evidence suggests topical ice is helpful as an adjuvant treatment.
