## Question

Are antibiotics indicated when NTEROPATHOGENIC E. COLI (EPEC) is Detected Abnormal and ENTEROTOXIGENIC E. COLI (ETEC)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when antibiotics are indicated after detection of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and/or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in stool testing, and what regimens to consider if treatment is warranted. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and typical clinical course of EPEC and ETEC. Then, I should verify guideline-based indications for antibiotics in non-travel and travel settings. Next, I will review host risk factors and severity markers that lower the threshold to treat. After that, I need to check antimicrobial stewardship considerations and resistance. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and outline preferred agents and caveats, including pediatric and pregnancy contexts [^112uQ4Tf] [^116PfkuA].

> Let me first confirm the pathogen profiles. EPEC causes attaching and effacing lesions via the LEE pathogenicity island, with typical EPEC carrying the EAF plasmid (bfpA+) and atypical EPEC lacking it, whereas ETEC produces ST and/or LT toxins driving watery diarrhea; I should confirm that this mechanistic distinction aligns with their usual noninvasive clinical phenotypes, which it does [^113cAfWP] [^116JFCnf] [^114MCM6x].

> Now, I need to consider the natural history. Wait, let me verify whether most detected EPEC/ETEC illnesses are self-limited. In a large pediatric series with multiplex PCR, single-pathogen EPEC/ETEC cases were predominantly mild and rarely treated with antibiotics initially, and adult data show that multiplex detection is common yet does not necessarily mandate antibiotics, reinforcing that supportive care suffices in many cases [^114Zgrbc] [^113G1E69].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should also weigh severity and host context. GEMS analyses and related studies show that ETEC and typical EPEC are strongly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea, dehydration, and increased mortality risk among young and especially malnourished children, who more often require IV fluids and present with signs like sunken eyes and loss of skin turgor, so the threshold to treat is lower in these high-risk groups [^111CYRf4] [^1162QdfQ] [^114YKtcP] [^117QhNsB].

> Next, I should review guidance for travel-associated disease. For traveler's diarrhea, antibiotics are recommended for severe disease and may be considered for moderate disease; azithromycin is preferred in children and pregnancy and in fluoroquinolone-resistant regions, rifaximin is appropriate for noninvasive, non-dysenteric illness (classically ETEC), and fluoroquinolones remain an adult option where resistance is low, alongside standard rehydration and symptomatic therapy [^112vsBVb] [^11395mmb] [^116eiXeB] [^116PfkuA].

> For non-travel, community-acquired watery diarrhea, I should confirm the default approach. IDSA and ACG emphasize supportive care and reserving antibiotics for select severe cases or specific pathogens; routine antibiotic therapy solely based on EPEC/ETEC detection is not recommended, and symptomatic management with oral rehydration, and antiemetics when needed, is standard, especially in otherwise healthy hosts with mild illness [^112uQ4Tf] [^116PfkuA] [^117S7csM].

> I need to ensure antimicrobial stewardship is integrated. Detection of EPEC/ETEC on multiplex PCR frequently triggers unnecessary antibiotics, with substantial rates of inappropriate prescribing and low stewardship oversight; additionally, resistance in enteric E. coli pathotypes is rising globally, arguing against reflexive treatment and for a symptom-severity–guided approach [^116bJj4Q] [^113G1E69] [^115aeqa1] [^115BzcCE].

> But wait, what if the detection reflects colonization or mixed infections. High co-detection rates mean EPEC/ETEC may be bystanders in some episodes, and dual infections can modulate severity; in vitro synergy between ETEC toxins and EPEC-mediated epithelial effects suggests potential for worse illness in coinfections, which should prompt careful clinical correlation rather than automatic antibiotics [^114Zgrbc] [^112Hb977].

> Let me synthesize a decision framework. Antibiotics are generally not indicated for mild, non-bloody, self-limited watery diarrhea in immunocompetent hosts after EPEC/ETEC detection; they should be considered for moderate to severe traveler's diarrhea, for severe dehydration or systemic toxicity, and for high-risk hosts such as malnourished children or the immunocompromised; for persistent diarrhea beyond 14 days, I should review for alternative etiologies including parasites as per IDSA [^112uQ4Tf] [^112vsBVb] [^116PfkuA] [^1157vCiZ].

> I should double-check the regimen choices when treatment is justified. Azithromycin is first-line in children and pregnancy and is a strong option broadly for traveler's diarrhea; rifaximin is suitable for noninvasive, non-dysenteric adult traveler's diarrhea and is not appropriate when invasive features or dysentery are present; fluoroquinolones remain alternatives for adults where local resistance allows; all are typically given as short courses, often single-dose or 1–3 days in traveler's diarrhea settings alongside rehydration, with selection tailored to severity, comorbidities, and regional resistance patterns [^11395mmb] [^112vsBVb] [^116PfkuA]. Wait, I initially considered rifaximin for any EPEC detection, but I should correct that; rifaximin is indicated for noninvasive traveler's diarrhea, classically ETEC, and is not used for suspected invasive disease or dysentery, and EPEC-specific antibiotic therapy is not routinely recommended outside of the severity and risk-based contexts already described [^11395mmb] [^116PfkuA].

> Finally, I will state the core principle clearly. I should confirm that antibiotics are not routinely indicated for all EPEC or ETEC detections; management should be anchored to clinical severity, host risk, and travel context, with supportive care as the foundation and antibiotics reserved for defined scenarios where benefits outweigh risks, in alignment with IDSA, ACG, and ISTM guidance and stewardship best practices [^112uQ4Tf] [^116PfkuA] [^112vsBVb] [^116bJj4Q].

In general, **antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC** because it is usually self-limited [^114Zgrbc]; reserve antibiotics for severe, persistent, or high-risk cases (infants, immunocompromised, malnourished) [^111CYRf4]. For ETEC, **antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent diarrhea**, especially in travelers [^112vsBVb] [^11395mmb], to shorten illness and reduce stool output. Use azithromycin or rifaximin first-line due to rising resistance; avoid fluoroquinolones in children and pregnant women [^11395mmb]. Always prioritize rehydration and supportive care [^116PfkuA], and use antibiotics only when clearly indicated to limit resistance [^116ez1RU].

## Clinical indications for antibiotic therapy

| **Attribute** | **Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)** | **Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)** |
|-|-|-|
| General recommendation | Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC infections, as they are typically self-limited and resolve with supportive care alone [^112uQ4Tf] [^116UrcTL] | Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe ETEC infections, particularly in travelers' diarrhea, to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms [^11395mmb] [^112vsBVb] |
| Indications for antibiotic therapy | Severe or persistent diarrhea (lasting > 14 days); immunocompromised patients; infants or young children with moderate-to-severe dehydration or malnutrition; outbreak settings with high morbidity or mortality [^116PfkuA] [^111CYRf4] | Moderate-to-severe diarrhea (≥ 3 unformed stools in 24 hours with associated symptoms such as fever, abdominal cramps, or dehydration); persistent diarrhea (> 14 days); immunocompromised patients; travelers' diarrhea with significant impact on daily activities [^11395mmb] [^116PfkuA] |
| Antibiotic options | Azithromycin: 10 mg/kg once daily for 3 days (maximum 500 mg/day); ceftriaxone: 50–75 mg/kg IV once daily (maximum 2 g/day) for severe cases or hospitalized patients | Azithromycin: 1 g single dose or 500 mg once daily for 3 days; rifaximin: 200 mg three times daily for 3 days (not recommended for invasive infections); ciprofloxacin: 500 mg twice daily for 3 days (use with caution due to increasing resistance and safety concerns in children and pregnant women) [^11395mmb] [^112vsBVb] |
| Clinical outcomes | Antibiotic therapy in EPEC infections has been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea and bacterial shedding, particularly in severe or persistent cases | Antibiotic therapy significantly reduces the duration of diarrhea, bacterial shedding, and risk of complications in ETEC infections [^11395mmb] [^1177DAoq] |

## Antibiotic resistance considerations

Antibiotic resistance varies by region [^111pweqs]. For **EPEC**, patterns show rising resistance to ampicillin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and fluoroquinolones [^115BzcCE]. Antibiotic selection should be guided by **local resistance data and susceptibility testing** [^116ez1RU]. For **ETEC**, strains increasingly resist fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, particularly in developing countries [^111pweqs]. Azithromycin and rifaximin remain effective options, and ongoing resistance monitoring is essential [^11395mmb] [^113LKdRk].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

IDSA recommends antibiotic therapy for **moderate-to-severe travelers' diarrhea**, including ETEC infections, but not routinely for mild cases or EPEC infections [^112uQ4Tf]. ISTM likewise recommends antibiotics for **moderate-to-severe travelers' diarrhea**, with azithromycin, rifaximin, and fluoroquinolones as options [^11395mmb] [^112vsBVb].

---

## Potential risks and benefits of antibiotic therapy

Benefits: Antibiotic therapy can reduce the duration and severity of **diarrhea**, **bacterial shedding**, and **risk of complications**, particularly in moderate-to-severe ETEC infections [^11395mmb]. Risks: Adverse effects, antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and development of **antibiotic resistance** [^116ez1RU]. These risks must be balanced against the potential benefits, especially in mild or self-limited infections.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **EPEC**: Antibiotics are not routinely indicated for EPEC infections, but may be considered in severe, persistent, or high-risk cases. Azithromycin and ceftriaxone are recommended options when antibiotics are indicated.

- **ETEC**: Antibiotics are indicated for moderate-to-severe or persistent ETEC infections, particularly in travelers' diarrhea. Azithromycin and rifaximin are recommended first-line options, with ciprofloxacin as an alternative [^11395mmb].

- **General recommendation**: Antibiotic therapy should be guided by clinical severity, patient risk factors, local resistance patterns, and clinical guidelines. Supportive care, including rehydration, remains the cornerstone of management for both EPEC and ETEC infections [^116PfkuA] [^112uQ4Tf].

The epidemiology, demographics, clinical presentations, and outcomes associated with enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) pathotypes in US children are not well understood.

- **Methods**: This study was a retrospective chart review of all pediatric patients with a stool sample submitted to the Children's Hospital Colorado clinical microbiology laboratory for testing with the BioFire FilmArray Gastrointestinal Pathogen Panel from October 2015 through October 2017.

- **Results**: During the study period, 5,692 patient stool samples were submitted; 679 (13%) were positive for EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC. Notably, 163/232 (70%) of patients with EAEC, 282/493 (57%) with EPEC, and 49/58 (85%) with ETEC had detection of at least one other pathogen. Of all E. coli-positive stool samples, only 158/679 (23%) were from low-risk patients who were singly infected with EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC. In this cohort, most cases were associated with acute diarrhea (50%), abdominal pain (61%), and/or cramping (49%), and presented without fever (14%), emesis (28%), or lethargy (7%). Thirteen (8%) of these 158 patients received antibiotics at the time of their initial presentation to care. Of the 145 patients who did not receive antibiotics at their initial visit, 23 (16%) returned to care due to the persistence of symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: Our results suggest that the majority of patients singly infected with EAEC, EPEC, or ETEC present with mild, self-limited gastrointestinal (GI) complaints. Further research is needed to determine what role these infections play in clinical symptoms.

### The effect of acute malnutrition on enteric pathogens, moderate-to-severe diarrhoea, and associated mortality in the Global Enteric Multicenter Study cohort: a post-hoc analysis [^111CYRf4]. The Lancet Global Health (2020). High credibility.

This post-hoc, exploratory analysis found typical EPEC and ST-ETEC to have a stronger association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children with acute malnutrition than among children with better nutritional status. Conversely, Shigella spp, norovirus, and sapovirus had a more pronounced association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children with better nutritional status. Children with acute malnutrition were at high risk of mortality following an episode of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and represented nearly two-thirds of the deaths observed among children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. The case fatality for every pathogen was higher among children with acute malnutrition, but this increase was less pronounced among children with norovirus, Cryptosporidium spp, or acute watery diarrhoea.

The GEMS control group enabled this analysis to differentiate malnutrition-associated differences in diarrhoea aetiology from pathogens that are more prevalent among malnourished children due to prolonged carriage. Previous evidence suggests that malnourished children are particularly vulnerable to pathogenic E coli, and we found ST-ETEC and typical EPEC to have a stronger association with diarrhoea among children with acute malnutrition. Many of the most virulent pathogens (Shigella spp, rotavirus, and Cryptosporidium spp) had contradictory results in relative and absolute risk models. For example, in logistic regression, Shigella spp had a stronger association with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea among children without acute malnutrition, but this interaction was…

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^1162QdfQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). High credibility.

Morbidity, mortality, and poor nutritional outcomes of young children due to diarrheal illnesses are leading health concerns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrhea is a leading cause of malnutrition and the third leading cause of death in children under five years, accounting for nearly half a million deaths in this age group each year. Of these diarrheal deaths, approximately 90% occur in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) are the foremost pathotypes of E. coli associated with childhood diarrheal illnesses. According to the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS), Shigella and heat stable (ST)-toxin producing ETEC, either alone or along with heat labile (LT)-toxin producing ETEC, are the leading enteric pathogens associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD) in children under five years. Pathogens associated with increased risk of infant mortality include ST-ETEC and typical EPEC, with the risk of mortality being 8.5 times higher in MSD-affected children than in asymptomatic children within the first two years of life. Apart from diarrheal morbidity and mortality, ETEC and EPEC have also been reported to be linked with other symptoms or conditions caused by undernutrition, especially stunting, among children under five years. Both ST-ETEC and LT-ETEC develop increasing virulence due to colonization and adherence to the intestinal mucosal membrane, resulting in a profuse loss of water and electrolytes leading to exacerbation of dehydration.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^113Xmu2W]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains differ in several characteristics. Typical EPEC, a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries, is rare in industrialized countries, where atypical EPEC seems to be a more important cause of diarrhea. For typical EPEC, the only reservoir is humans; for atypical EPEC, both animals and humans can be reservoirs. Typical and atypical EPEC also differ in genetic characteristics, serotypes, and virulence properties. Atypical EPEC is more closely related to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) and, like STEC, these strains appear to be emerging pathogens.

### Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli [^111sNapv]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC) are an increasingly important cause of diarrhoea. E. coli belonging to this category cause watery diarrhoea, which is often persistent and can be inflammatory. EAEC have been implicated in sporadic diarrhoea in children and adults, in both developing and developed countries, and have been identified as the cause of several outbreaks worldwide. EAEC are defined by their ability to adhere to epithelial cells in a characteristic "stacked-brick" pattern but are otherwise highly heterogeneous.

Genes that could contribute to the pathogenicity of EAEC encode adhesins, toxins, and other factors, all of which are only partially conserved. Practicable tools are needed to improve diagnosis and identify risk factors. EAEC-infected individuals can be treated with fluoroquinolones, but there is a need to examine alternative treatment protocols.

At present, less than half of all acute health care facilities have antimicrobial stewardship programs. By targeting areas that are vulnerable to inappropriate antimicrobial use and by employing novel strategies to increase the reach of stewardship interventions, providers can make antimicrobial stewardship a universal practice in all health care settings. This review discusses how stewardship can have a significant impact in areas where it has traditionally been absent, in facilities both with and without formal antimicrobial stewardship programs.

### Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli: Foe or innocent bystander [^116UrcTL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) remains one of the most important pathogens infecting children and is one of the main causes of persistent diarrhea worldwide. Historically, typical EPEC (tEPEC), defined as those isolates with the attaching and effacement (A/E) genotype (eae(+)), which possess bfpA(+) and lack the stx(-) genes, are strongly associated with diarrheal cases. However, the occurrence of atypical EPEC (aEPEC; eae(+)bfpA(-)stx(-)) in both diarrheal and asymptomatic hosts has led investigators to question the role of these pathogens in human disease. Epidemiological data are helping to answer the question of whether EPEC is mainly a foe or an innocent bystander during infection.

### Comparative analyses of phenotypic and genotypic methods for detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli toxins and colonization factors [^113iFo7d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the main causes of childhood diarrhea in developing countries and in travelers. However, this pathogen has often not been reported in surveys of diarrheal pathogens due to a lack of simple standardized methods to detect ETEC in many laboratories. ETEC expresses one or both of two different enterotoxin subtypes: heat-stable toxins, a heat-labile toxin (LT), and more than 22 different colonization factors (CFs) that mediate adherence to the intestinal cell wall.

We compare established phenotypic and genotypic detection methods and newly developed PCR detection methods with respect to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and ease of performance. The methods include GM1-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and dot blot techniques using specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for phenotypic detection of the toxins and CFs, respectively, as well as different PCR and DNA/DNA hybridization techniques, including new PCR assays, for genotypic identification of the toxin and CF genes, respectively. We found very good general agreement in results derived from genotypic and phenotypic methods. In a few strains, LT and CFs were identified genetically but not phenotypically.

Based on our analyses, we recommend initial screening for ETEC in clinical samples by multiplex toxin gene PCR. Toxin-positive strains may then be analyzed by dot blot tests for detection of the CFs expressed on the bacterial surface and by PCR for determination of additional CFs for which MAbs are currently lacking, as well as for strains that harbor silencing elements.

Regarding the medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to the management of Enterobacterales infections, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend avoiding the use of cephamycins for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^116vWNLm]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical EPEC seem to constitute two groups of distinct organisms that have in common the LEE pathogenicity island. Atypical EPEC are closer to STEC in genetic characteristics, serotypes, production of toxins, reservoir, and other epidemiologic aspects. As STEC, they resemble emerging pathogens. In industrialized countries, they have become a more frequent cause of diarrhea than typical EPEC, and the same shift may be occurring in Brazil. A large number of Stx-negative, eae-positive typical and atypical EPEC-like strains outside the EPEC O serogroups, as well as atypical EPEC strains, require further study with regard to their virulence and epidemiologic significance.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections, specifically Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the administration of cefepime for treating infections caused by organisms at moderate risk of significant AmpC production, such as E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically concerning Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend considering the choice of antibiotic treatment based on antimicrobial sensitivity testing results for infections caused by less commonly recovered organisms (such as H. alvei, C. youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica). If these organisms are susceptible to ceftriaxone, administering ceftriaxone is advised.

### Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli activates ezrin, which participates in disruption of tight junction barrier function [^114S6Rfs]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is an important human intestinal pathogen, especially in infants. EPEC adherence to intestinal epithelial cells induces the accumulation of a number of cytoskeletal proteins beneath the bacteria, including the membrane-cytoskeleton linker ezrin. Evidence suggests that ezrin can participate in signal transduction. The aim of this study was to determine whether ezrin is activated following EPEC infection and if it is involved in the cross talk with host intestinal epithelial cells. We show here that following EPEC attachment to intestinal epithelial cells there was significant phosphorylation of ezrin, first on threonine and later on tyrosine residues. A significant increase in cytoskeleton-associated ezrin occurred following phosphorylation, suggesting activation of this molecule. Nonpathogenic E. coli and EPEC strains harboring mutations in type III secretion failed to elicit this response. Expression of dominant-negative ezrin significantly decreased the EPEC-elicited association of ezrin with the cytoskeleton and attenuated the disruption of intestinal epithelial tight junctions. These results suggest that ezrin is involved in transducing EPEC-initiated signals that ultimately affect host physiological functions.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^115QGtW8]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

The association of clinico-epidemiological factors with ETEC or EPEC infection among children with MSD and in asymptomatic children was explored. According to a multivariate logistic regression analysis of ETEC cases, children aged 12–23 months had higher odds of having ETEC MSD compared with children aged 0–11 months. For asymptomatic ETEC infection, there was no such age variation. Children from middle-class households showed a higher likelihood of being infected with asymptomatic ETEC compared with the richest households; however, no such association was observed between the wealth index and ETEC MSD. The presence of Campylobacter in stool samples had a significant positive association with ETEC infection both in asymptomatic and MSD children. Among clinical features of MSD, sunken eyes had a significant positive association, whereas dysentery and fever had negative associations with ETEC infection.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis of EPEC children revealed a lower likelihood of EPEC-positive MSD cases in both the 12–23-months and 24–59-months age groups, whereas in asymptomatic cases, only the 24–59 months age group was less likely to get EPEC infection compared with children aged 0–11 months. Asymptomatic EPEC infection is significantly higher in children from lower–middle-class families compared with rich.

### Identification and characterization of NleI, a new non-LEE-encoded effector of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) [^1127c4Xg]. Microbes and Infection (2006). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), a major gastrointestinal pathogen, causes infantile diarrhea in many developing countries. EPEC is an attaching and effacing (A/E) pathogen that utilizes a LEE-encoded type III secretion system (TTSS) to deliver effector proteins into host cells. These effectors have been identified as potential virulence factors in A/E pathogens, including EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and Citrobacter rodentium (CR). We used a proteomics approach to identify a new non-LEE-encoded effector, NleI, from the EPEC sepL and sepD mutants. The nleI gene, located in a prophage-associated island with nleBCD, is also present in EHEC and CR, but not in E. coli K-12.

In EPEC, the transcription of nleI was increased upon sepD inactivation but remained unaffected in ler and sepL mutants. We demonstrated that NleI is secreted and translocated into HeLa cells in a TTSS-dependent manner, and that the CesT chaperone is required for efficient NleI translocation. Nevertheless, under overexpression conditions, the first 20 amino acids of NleI are sufficient to support both secretion and translocation. After translocation, NleI can be detected in the cytoplasmic and membrane of HeLa cells.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: a modelling analysis [^115aeqa1]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

Diarrhoea mortality has declined significantly globally and in the poorest countries, whereas diarrhoea morbidity has declined more slowly. These observed patterns have refocused attention on the positive relationship between recurring and frequent non-fatal diarrhoea episodes and childhood stunting. Childhood stunting increases the likelihood of death from diarrhoea, pneumonia, and measles, among other infections. Stunting also affects cognitive development, which might determine a child's ability to learn, their educational attainment, and future earnings.

Although rotavirus accounts for most diarrhoea-related childhood deaths, other enteric pathogens play an important role in childhood mortality and morbidity. The Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) conducted in Africa and Asia found that four diarrhoeal pathogens — rotavirus, shigella, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), and Cryptosporidium spp. — were significantly associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea, accounting for 70% of diarrhoeal disease in children younger than 5 years.

Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem for the treatment of these pathogens. Shigella is resistant to several antibiotic classes, and several nations report greater than 50% resistance to certain antibiotic classes by pathogenic E. coli. This situation makes new prevention strategies critical. Promising interventions under development are vaccines against ETEC and shigella, which can potentially prevent infection, morbidity, and mortality from these pathogens and combat antibiotic resistance by reducing antibiotic use.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^115J3ckY]. Emerging infectious diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains also differ in adherence patterns. The typical strains exhibit only the LA (localized adherence) pattern, while atypical strains may display the LAL (localized-like adherence) pattern, the DA (diffuse adherence) pattern, or the AA (aggregative adherence) pattern. The LAL pattern is characteristic of most serotypes and is primarily mediated by intimin. The DA pattern is mediated by the Afa adhesin, and the AA is mediated by an aggregative adhesin. The cdt gene of serotype O86:H34 and the afa gene of serotype O55:H7 are located on the bacterial chromosome.

- **Virulence characteristics of atypical EPEC strains**: These are not encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) and are based on strains isolated in São Paulo, Brazil. The EAST, a heat-stable toxin 1 of EAEC, E-hly as EHEC hemolysin, along with AA and Afa adhesin, denote significant virulence factors.

- **Intimin types of EPEC serotypes**: Typical and atypical EPEC also have interesting differences regarding the intimin types.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^117QhNsB]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). High credibility.

In examining the characteristics of ETEC- and EPEC-positive MSD children, it was noted that both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases showed a nearly similar distribution across different age groups (0–11 months, 12–23 months, and 24–59 months), genders, and breastfeeding statuses. Notably, ETEC-positive MSD was predominantly found in children aged 0–11 months and 12–23 months, comprising about 40% in each age group, while EPEC-positive MSD was most prevalent among the 0–11 months age group (49%). Gender differences were observed, with girls (43%) being less susceptible to both ETEC and EPEC MSD than boys.

At the time of enrollment, children suffering from ETEC-positive MSD exhibited more severe clinical features compared to those with ETEC-negative MSD. These features included sunken eyes, loss of skin turgor, vomiting, and the need for intravenous rehydration therapy. Similarly, EPEC-positive MSD children also more frequently experienced loss of skin turgor and required intravenous rehydration compared to their EPEC-negative counterparts. Conversely, symptoms such as blood in stool and fever were more common in ETEC-negative MSD children than in those who were ETEC-positive.

A trend was observed regarding maternal literacy and hygiene practices; mothers of ETEC- and EPEC-negative children tended to be more literate than those of positive cases. Furthermore, these mothers often sourced their drinking water from tube wells; however, there was a higher use of treated water among ETEC-positive versus ETEC-negative MSD cases. A notable discrepancy was found in hygiene practices related to handwashing. Caregivers of ETEC-negative children were more likely to wash hands after defecation and before cooking, whereas handwashing was more prevalent among caregivers of ETEC-positive children after cleaning a child who had defecated.

Finally, co-pathogen presence varied significantly between groups. Campylobacter was frequently identified in children with ETEC-positive MSD (P < 0.001), while Aeromonas and Shigella were more commonly observed in ETEC-negative children.

In the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, particularly concerning Enterobacterales infections, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend:

- **Treatment options for pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs**: Administer TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin as the preferred options for treating infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.
- **Alternatives due to resistance or toxicity**: Administer ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin when resistance or toxicities preclude the use of TMP/SMX or fluoroquinolones.
- **Alternative option**: Aminoglycosides can be administered as an alternative treatment option.

### Detection of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli by use of melting-curve analysis and real-time multiplex PCR [^115wq2Tr]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains are important causes of diarrhea in children from the developing world and are now being recognized as emerging enteropathogens in the developed world. Methods of detection are too expensive and labor-intensive for routine detection of these organisms to be practical. We developed a real-time fluorescence-based multiplex PCR for the detection of all six of the currently recognized classes of diarrheagenic E. coli. The primers were designed to specifically amplify eight different virulence genes in the same reaction: aggR for enteroaggregative E. coli, stIa/stIb and lt for enterotoxigenic E. coli, eaeA for enteropathogenic E. coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), stx(1) and stx(2) for STEC, ipaH for enteroinvasive E. coli, and daaD for diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC). Eighty-nine of ninety diarrheagenic E. coli and 36/36 nonpathogenic E. coli strains were correctly identified using this approach (specificity, 1.00; sensitivity, 0.99). The single false negative was a DAEC strain. The total time between preparation of DNA from E. coli colonies on agar plates and completion of PCR and melting-curve analysis was less than 90 minutes. The cost of materials was low. Melting-point analysis of real-time multiplex PCR is a rapid, sensitive, specific, and inexpensive method for detection of diarrheagenic E. coli.

### Targeting virulence traits: Potential strategies to combat extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli infections [^114mCH32]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are able to colonize, invade, and induce disease in body niches outside the gastrointestinal tract. The emergence of (multi)resistant ExPEC variants calls for alternative antimicrobial strategies with reduced pressure on the selection of antibiotic resistances. Recent research efforts focus on targeting such virulence traits or interfering with ExPEC colonization of extraintestinal niches. These strategies aim to prevent or treat ExPEC infections and reduce the risk of further emergence of antibiotic resistances.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically in the management of Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering nitrofurantoin or TMP/SMX as preferred options for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems are recommended as alternative options, but do not use them if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Additionally, a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) may be administered as another alternative option.

### Emerging enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains [^112KaPRH]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Prevalence of distinct combinations of virulence-related DNA sequences in eae+ EAF- stx- Escherichia coli strains outside the EPEC serogroups was studied in three cities in Brazil. All strains hybridized with the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) A, LEE B, LEE C, and LEE D probes constructed by McDaniel et al, which suggested that they bear a complete LEE region.

DNA sequences similar to bfpA were detected in 14 (14.1%) of the 99 strains studied; however, only two expressed Bfp in Western blot experiments (not shown). These two strains also carried perA and presented AA/LA in 3 hours. The HeLa pattern of the remaining bfpA+ strains varied, but none of them had compact clusters in 3 hours, which is typical of LA. Thus, Bfp expression was found only in strains presenting aggregative adherence/LA in 3 hours, as in typical LA of EPEC.

PCR assays with specific primers for the variable region of intimin were used to identify five intimin types (α, β, γ, δ, and ε). Most strains had a non-typable intimin (64.6%), but the distribution of these strains varied: approximately 70% in São Paulo and 29%–35% in Rio de Janeiro and Ribeirão Preto. Recently, new schemes were proposed to identify intimin subtypes, which were not tested. The prevalence of typable intimins varied among the three areas analyzed. Intimin subtypes β (11.1%) and γ (12.1%) prevailed, and intimin ε was not found. The intimin types of two strains were not determined because amplification products of the expected size were obtained.

### Outbreaks of virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli — are we in control [^114oWWoG]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The recurrence of outbreaks caused by virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli strains poses a significant challenge to global public health. The complexity of these pathogens, combined with their rapid transmission and potential for severe outcomes, necessitates a proactive and coordinated response.

- **Epidemiological surveillance**: Ensuring efficient monitoring and timely identification of outbreak sources is crucial to control the spread of these infections. Enhanced surveillance systems and prompt reporting can significantly reduce response times and contain outbreaks more effectively.

- **Prevention strategies**: Implementation of robust prevention measures, such as public awareness campaigns and stringent food safety standards, play a pivotal role in mitigating the risk of infection. Educating the public on proper hygiene practices and safe food handling contributes to reducing transmission rates.

- **Control measures**: Combining vaccination efforts with improved sanitation and access to clean water provides a comprehensive approach to controlling these outbreaks. Targeted vaccination programs can significantly impact disease reduction in high-risk populations.

The collaboration of public health authorities, researchers, and policymakers is essential to develop and implement effective strategies against virulent diarrheagenic Escherichia coli outbreaks. Continuous research and adaptation of strategies are necessary to stay ahead of evolving pathogenic threats and protect global health security.

### Association of enteropathogen detection with diarrhoea by age and high versus low child mortality settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Tfze5]. The Lancet Global Health (2021). Low credibility.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, adhering to the PRISMA guidelines. Literature from January 1, 1990, to July 9, 2019, was compiled from Embase, Cochrane, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases. The search terms used included: (diarrh* OR gastroenteritis OR enteric infection*) AND (aeromonas OR entamoeba OR cryptosporidium OR giardia lamblia OR adenovir* OR astrovir* OR sapovirus OR norovirus OR rotavirus OR Escherichia coli OR etec OR epec OR E. coli OR cholera* OR campylobacter OR shigell* OR salmonell*). The goal was to identify studies quantifying the association between enteropathogens and diarrhoea.

Studies were included if they were of case-control or cohort design, examined at least one enteropathogen of interest, and focused on the outcome of diarrhoea. Only articles published in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Chinese were considered. Studies were excluded if they did not report on non-diarrhoeal controls, included participants with a broad case definition of gastroenteritis preventing reviewers from determining if all cases had diarrhoea, were limited to nosocomial infections, or were conducted solely among patients with underlying chronic conditions (except HIV). Additional details on inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the appendix (p. 1).

### What is antimicrobial stewardship [^116ez1RU]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Use of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' has grown exponentially in recent years, typically referring to programs and interventions that aim to optimize antimicrobial use. Although antimicrobial stewardship originated within human healthcare, it is increasingly applied in broader contexts including animal health and One Health. As the use of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship' becomes more common, it is important to consider what antimicrobial stewardship is, as well as what it is not.

- **Aims**: To review the emergence and evolution of the term 'antimicrobial stewardship'.

- **Sources**: We searched and reviewed existing literature and official documents, which mostly focused on antibiotics. We contacted the authors of the first publications that mentioned antimicrobial stewardship.

- **Content**: We describe the historical background behind how antimicrobial stewardship came into use in clinical settings. We discuss challenges emerging from the varied descriptions of antimicrobial stewardship in the literature, including an over-emphasis on individual prescriptions, an under-emphasis on the societal implications of antimicrobial use, and language translation problems.

- **Implications**: To help address these challenges, we suggest viewing antimicrobial stewardship as a strategy, a coherent set of actions which promote using antimicrobials responsibly. We stress the continuous need for 'responsible use' to be defined and translated into context-specific and time-specific actions. Furthermore, we present examples of actions that can be undertaken within antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

### Improvement in detection of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in patients with travelers' diarrhea by increasing the number of E. coli colonies tested [^116XS4RQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

No cause of one-third of travelers' diarrhea (TD) cases can be detected despite microbiologic assessment. We propose that these pathogen-negative TD cases include undetected enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). As a standard in diagnostic microbiology, samples of five E. coli colonies were tested to detect ETEC from stool cultures. We compared the sensitivities and the number of ETEC detected by 20 colonies with those of 5, 10, and 15 colonies. The percent detection of ETEC with five E. coli colonies was significantly different from that using 20 E. coli colonies. Of the 116 subjects studied, the number positive for ETEC for 5, 10, 15, and 20 colonies tested were 22 (19.0%), 37 (31.9%), 45 (38.8%), and 46 (39.7%), respectively. Based on our results, we recommend the testing of at least 10 E. coli colonies for optimum detection of ETEC in patients with TD.

### Phylogenetic comparisons reveal multiple acquisitions of the toxin genes by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli strains of different evolutionary lineages [^1111TESU]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli is a diverse bacterial species widely distributed in the environment, existing both as a commensal and a pathogen across different host species. Human intestinal pathogenic E. coli results in over 160 million cases of diarrhea and approximately 1 million deaths annually, with the majority attributed to the pathovar enterotoxigenic E. coli. The pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic E. coli relies on the production of a colonization factor to promote adhesion to the intestinal epithelium and the elaboration of heat-labile or heat-stable toxins, which induce secretory diarrhea. Despite the high morbidity and mortality associated with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection, little is known about the genetic background of this global pathogen.

Through multilocus sequence typing, we demonstrate that enterotoxigenic E. coli isolates are present in all phylogenetic lineages of E. coli, indicating that the acquisition of toxin genes may be sufficient to generate an enterotoxigenic strain. Additionally, screening of diarrheal isolates for the presence of other genes previously linked to enterotoxigenic E. coli virulence revealed their scarcity. These observations carry significant implications for disease epidemiology and the design of effective vaccines.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: A modelling analysis [^111pweqs]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella are two major pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children younger than 5 years. Diarrhoea is associated with an increased risk of stunting, which puts children at risk of death due to other infectious diseases.

- **Methods**: We modelled ETEC-related and Shigella-related mortality and the effect of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea episodes to determine the number of children with stunting due to these infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries. We applied population attributable risk for an increased number of deaths due to other infectious diseases in children who are stunted. We calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.

- **Findings**: In children younger than 5 years, we estimate 196 million (95% UI 135–269) episodes of ETEC and Shigella diarrhoea occur annually, resulting in 3.5 million (0.8–5.4) cases of moderate-to-severe stunting and 44,400 (29,400–59,800) total ETEC deaths and 63,100 (44,000–81,900) total Shigella deaths in 2015. Additional infectious disease mortality due to stunting resulted in increases of 24% (8–34; for ETEC) and 28% (10–39; for Shigella) over direct deaths due to diarrhoeal episodes. The distribution of mortality and morbidity varied geographically, with African Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region countries bearing the greatest burden.

- **Interpretation**: The expanded effects of non-fatal ETEC and Shigella-related diarrhoeal episodes can have lasting consequences. Prevention of these infections could reduce the risk of direct death and stunting.

### Molecular mechanisms of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection [^115ygX13]. Microbes and Infection (2010). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of diarrheal illness in developing countries and the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. ETEC constitute a diverse pathotype that elaborates heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins. Recent molecular pathogenesis studies reveal sophisticated pathogen-host interactions that might be exploited to prevent these important infections. While vaccine development for these pathogens remains a formidable challenge, extensive efforts to exploit new genomic and proteomic technology platforms in the discovery of novel targets are presently ongoing.

### Emerging themes in the molecular pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^117QPwDE]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are common pathogens that comprise a genetically diverse diarrheagenic E. coli pathovar, defined by the production of heat-labile toxin (LT) and/or heat-stable toxin (ST). It is estimated that worldwide, hundreds of millions of symptomatic ETEC infections occur annually, a burden predominantly borne by young children of low-middle-income countries. In these regions, ETEC remain a major cause of deaths due to acute diarrheal illness. Abundant in low-middle-income areas where clean water and sanitation remain limited, ETEC are perennially the most common pathogen isolated from travelers with infectious diarrhea. Surprisingly, they have also been associated with outbreaks and sporadic cases in more developed areas, including the United States, where recently introduced culture-independent methods may accelerate their identification.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^113cAfWP]. Emerging infectious diseases (2002). Low credibility.

The EAF plasmid is not essential for the formation of A/E lesions, although its presence enhances their efficiency, probably through the influence of a cluster of plasmid-borne regulatory genes (per A, B, C) that increase expression of the chromosomal LEE genes. Evidence also indicates that BFP plays a role in host cell adhesion that would similarly increase the efficiency of A/E lesion formation.

In 1995, during the Second International Symposium on EPEC in São Paulo, most participants accepted the following EPEC definition: "EPEC are diarrheogenic Escherichia coli that produce a characteristic histopathology known as attaching and effacing (A/E) on intestinal cells and that do not produce Shiga, Shiga-like, or verocytotoxins. Typical EPEC of human origin possess a virulence plasmid known as the EAF (EPEC adherence factor) plasmid that encodes localized adherence on cultured epithelial cells mediated by the BFP, while atypical EPEC do not possess this plasmid. The majority of typical EPEC strains fall into certain well-recognized O:H serotypes". According to this definition, the basic difference between typical and atypical EPEC is the presence of the EAF plasmid in the first group of organisms and its absence in the second.

The most studied EPEC strains belong to a series of O antigenic groups known as EPEC O serogroups. Twelve EPEC serogroups were recognized by the World Health Organization in 1987: O26, O55, O86, O111, O114, O119, O125, O126, O127, O128, O142, and O158. These serogroups include both typical and atypical EPEC strains, as well as other diarrheogenic E.

### Drug-resistant diarrheogenic Escherichia coli, Mexico [^115BzcCE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The best-characterized diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DE) groups include enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC), and Shiga toxin–producing (STEC) E. coli. STEC is also known as verotoxin-producing or enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Except for slow-fermenting sorbitol STEC (such as O157:H7), DE are not routinely sought as stool pathogens in clinical laboratories worldwide, perhaps due to a lack of rapid and sensitive laboratory techniques. However, DE are a leading cause of diarrhea in children in developing countries and are increasingly recognized as important enteropathogens in developed countries. To establish the prevalence and resistance patterns of these microorganisms in hospitalized children in Mexico, we conducted a prospective study. E. coli strains were analyzed using two comprehensive multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays, and strains harboring DE genes were subsequently analyzed for their antimicrobial resistance patterns.

### Identification and characterization of human monoclonal antibodies for immunoprophylaxis against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection [^1177DAoq]. Infection and Immunity (2018). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is one of the main causes of diarrhea in infants in the developing world, as well as a major cause of traveler's diarrhea. The transmission of ETEC occurs when contaminated food or water is ingested. ETEC infections are characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps, and, in some cases, mild fever. Symptoms usually occur 1 to 3 days after infection and last for a few days. When adult travelers develop ETEC diarrhea, a short course of antibiotics can decrease the duration and volume of diarrhea. However, ETEC strains are becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, and there are currently no licensed vaccines for protecting travelers against ETEC diarrhea.

ETEC mediates small intestine adherence through filamentous bacterial surface structures known as colonization factors (CF). Once bound to the small intestine, the bacteria produce heat-labile toxins (LT) and/or heat-stable toxins (ST) that, through a cascade process, cause a net flow of water from the cell into the intestinal lumen, resulting in watery diarrhea. ETEC vaccine development efforts have focused on the induction of host immunity against CFs or toxins by using cellular or subunit-based approaches. LT has been considered a possible target based on its strong immunogenicity, while ST was not initially considered due to poor immunogenicity and potent toxicity. Progress has been made recently in the identification of effective LT-ST toxoids. However, anti-ST and anti-LT antibody responses may not be sufficient for effective protection against ETEC diarrhea.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: a modelling analysis [^1157qUH5]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). Low credibility.

- **Research in context**: Evidence before this study indicates a focused examination of the literature.

We used two search strings for the literature review: one for the aetiology in children younger than 5 years and another for diarrhoea and stunting. First, we searched PubMed for articles published between Oct 29, 2010, and Oct 29, 2015, without language or publication restrictions by location. We found 59 results for "aetiology under five" with the search string ("ETEC" OR "enterotoxigenic E coli" OR "enterotoxigenic" OR "Shigella") AND ("children under five" OR "children under 5" OR "children < 5") AND ("morbidity" OR "illness" OR "stunting" OR "episodes" OR "events" OR "cases") AND ("cause" OR "etiology" OR "aetiology").

Second, we searched PubMed for articles published between inception and Oct 29, 2015, without language or publication restrictions by location. We found 129 results for "diarrhoea and stunting" with the search string ("diarrhea" OR "diarrea" OR "diarrhoea") AND ("stunting" OR "height for age" OR "height" OR "Z score") AND ("child" OR "children under five" OR "children under 5" OR "children < 5") AND ("outcomes" OR "changes").

From the articles identified, we selected the most relevant peer-reviewed journal articles on the subject of ETEC and Shigella deaths in children under 5 years of age, incidence, and the association of stunting and diarrhoea. No publications systematically attempted to quantify the burden of ETEC and Shigella diarrhoea together with associated ETEC- and Shigella-induced stunting and resulting deaths from other infectious diseases. The Global Burden of Disease study has produced estimates.

### Rapid molecular detection of gastrointestinal pathogens and its role in antimicrobial stewardship [^113G1E69]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

We aimed to detect the etiological agents of acute diarrhea by a molecular gastrointestinal pathogen test (MGPT) and to assess the impact of MGPT on antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASP). This is a prospective observational study that was conducted between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2017. We included patients who had acute diarrhea. At the end of 2015, we implemented ASP in acute diarrhea cases and compared the outcomes in the pre-ASP and post-ASP periods. An FDA-cleared multiplexed gastrointestinal PCR panel system, the BioFire FilmArray (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City, UT), which detects 20 pathogens in stool, was used. In 499 out of 699 patients (71%), at least one pathogen was detected.

Among 314 adults with positive MGPT results, 101 (32%) tested positive for enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), 71 (23%) for enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), 68 (22%) for enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), 55 (18%) for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC), 48 (15%) for Campylobacter, 21 (7%) for Salmonella, and 20 (6%) for Clostridium difficile strains. Norovirus was detected in 17% of cases. Among 185 children, 55 (30%) tested positive for EPEC, 37 (20%) for C. difficile, 32 (17%) for Norovirus, 29 (16%) for EAEC, 22 (12%) for STEC, 21 (11%) each for ETEC and Campylobacter, 20 (11%) for Salmonella, and 16 (5%) for Rotavirus strains.

Inappropriate antibiotic use decreased in the post-ASP period compared with the pre-ASP period among inpatients (42.9% and 25.8%, respectively; P = 0.023). Using MGPT in clinical practice significantly decreased the unnecessary use of antibiotics. Detection of high rates of C. difficile in children and Salmonella spp., as well.

### Emerging themes in the molecular pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli [^114MCM6x]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are ubiquitous diarrheal pathogens that thrive in areas lacking basic human needs such as clean water and sanitation. These genetically plastic organisms cause significant morbidity among disadvantaged young children, manifesting as both acute diarrheal illness and sequelae of malnutrition and growth impairment. The recent discovery of additional plasmid-encoded virulence factors and elucidation of their critical role in the molecular pathogenesis of ETEC may inform new approaches to the development of broadly protective vaccines.

- **Complexity of ETEC-related conditions**: Although the pathogens have been closely linked epidemiologically with non-diarrheal sequelae, these conditions remain poorly understood.
- **Emerging data on ETEC toxins**: While canonical effects of ETEC toxins on cellular signaling promoting diarrhea are well-known, new research suggests that these toxins may also drive changes in intestinal architecture and associated sequelae. Understanding the molecular events underlying these changes could guide the development of vaccines that prevent acute diarrhea and ETEC-associated sequelae.

### Typical and atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^116JFCnf]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a leading cause of infantile diarrhea in developing countries. In industrialized countries, the frequency of these organisms has decreased, but they continue to be an important cause of diarrhea. The central mechanism of EPEC pathogenesis is a lesion called attaching and effacing (A/E), characterized by microvilli destruction, intimate adherence of bacteria to the intestinal epithelium, pedestal formation, and aggregation of polarized actin and other elements of the cytoskeleton at sites of bacterial attachment (Figure 1). The fluorescent actin staining test allows the identification of strains that produce A/E lesions, through detection of aggregated actin filaments beneath the attached bacteria. The ability to produce A/E lesions has also been detected in strains of Shiga toxin–producing E. coli (enterohemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC]) and in strains of other bacterial species.

The genetic determinants for the production of A/E lesions are located on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), a pathogenicity island that contains the genes encoding intimin, a type III secretion system, a number of secreted (Esp) proteins, and the translocated intimin receptor named Tir.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections [^112T6Th6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically concerning Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing bacteria, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend administering meropenem, imipenem/cilastatin, or ertapenem as preferred options for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales. Administer meropenem or imipenem/cilastatin as the preferred carbapenem for critically ill patients and/or patients experiencing hypoalbuminemia. Consider transitioning to oral TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin after an appropriate clinical response is achieved, assuming susceptibility is demonstrated.

### Single multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect diverse loci associated with diarrheagenic Escherichia coli [^112Agb4x]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli isolates were detected in both patient and food samples. These isolates include different strains such as STEC (Shiga-toxin–producing Escherichia coli), ETEC (enterotoxigenic E. coli), EIEC (enteroinvasive E. coli), and EPEC (enteropathogenic E. coli).

### Interactions of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli with pediatric and adult intestinal biopsy specimens during early adherence [^11328PYt]. Infection and Immunity (2009). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) strains cause watery diarrhea almost exclusively in young children. The basis for this age discrimination has never been determined, but it may be related to host cell receptors. During infection, EPEC strains express type IV bundle-forming pili composed of repeating subunits of the protein called bundlin. The very first interaction between EPEC and in vitro-cultured epithelial cells is mediated by the binding of alpha-bundlin to a carbohydrate receptor that contains, at a minimum, the N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) glycan sequence. However, bundlins expressed from the beta-bundlin allele do not bind LacNAc glycan sequences.

Herein, we investigated whether EPEC strains use alpha-bundlin to mediate early adherence to human intestinal biopsy specimens cultured in vitro by assessing the ability of isogenic EPEC mutants expressing either the alpha(1)- or beta(1)-bundlin allele or a bundlin-deficient EPEC strain to bind to these specimens. Furthermore, we directly compared the abilities of a wild-type EPEC strain to bind to the epithelial surfaces of both human adult and pediatric biopsy specimens. Our results demonstrate that beta-bundlin does not act as an adhesin during early EPEC adherence to adult duodenal biopsy specimens. The results also indicate that EPEC binds equally well to adult and pediatric biopsy specimens in an early adherence assay. This result is supported by the finding that the early adherence of EPEC to both adult and pediatric biopsy specimens was inhibited by LacNAc neoglycoconjugates, suggesting that organisms express…

Regarding the medical management for acute diarrhea, specifically with respect to symptomatic therapy, the IDSA 2017 guidelines recommend considering the administration of antinausea and antiemetic agents, such as ondansetron, to facilitate tolerance of oral rehydration in pediatric patients over 4 years of age and in adolescent patients with acute gastroenteritis associated with vomiting.

### Emerging enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains [^1127qkAA]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Escherichia coli strains of nonenteropathogenic serogroups carrying the eae gene, but lacking the enteropathogenic E. coli adherence factor plasmid and Shiga toxin DNA probe sequences, were isolated from patients (children, adults, and AIDS patients) with and without diarrhea in Brazil. Although diverse in phenotype and genotype, some strains are potentially diarrheagenic.

### Emerging enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains [^116KbGtR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

In this study, we sought to verify the frequency with which eae + EAF– stx– E. coli strains of non-EPEC serogroups occur in persons of poor socioeconomic status in three Brazilian cities; we also compared these strains' genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Although these strains occurred in 5% to 6% of the populations studied, including nondiarrheic children in São Paulo and Ribeirão Preto, 73%–88% of them were dissociated from other well-established enteropathogens.

Although O51:H40 was the most frequent serotype found and occurred in all three areas studied, the non-EPEC eae + EAF– stx– strains comprised a large variety of serotypes, and many were O nontypable. Moreover, the strains had diverse adherence patterns and various combinations of pathogenic E. coli DNA virulence sequences; the prevalence of these properties varied among the areas studied. Altogether, these data show that eae + EAF– stx– E. coli strains outside the EPEC serogroups are even more diverse than already observed. As we have emphasized previously, such diversity challenges the diagnosis of these putative pathogens.

All strains carried an apparently complete LEE region, and approximately 75.0% of them had the potential to promote attaching and effacing lesions in HeLa cells, as detected by FAS. Thus, at least these FAS+ strains are potentially enteropathogenic, since they are capable of inducing attaching and effacing lesions in vitro and may occur in diarrheic patients of various ages and in patients with AIDS.

### Parenteral vaccination with recombinant EtpA glycoprotein impairs enterotoxigenic colonization [^116cidoa]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a heterogeneous, diarrheagenic pathogenic variant (pathovar) of E. coli, defined by the production of heat-labile and/or heat-stable enterotoxins. These pathogens are a leading cause of diarrheal illness in young children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as immunologically naïve travelers to areas where clean water and sanitation remain limited. They remain a significant cause of death due to acute diarrheal illness among children less than five years of age.

Although the death rate from acute illness appears to have declined appreciably over the last several decades due to the implementation of oral rehydration therapy and other measures, infections with these pathogens continue largely unabated and have been linked repeatedly to a number of non-diarrheal sequelae, including micronutrient deficiencies, malnutrition, and growth impairment. Additionally, malnourished children are at a substantially increased risk of death due to diarrhea caused by ETEC and other pathogens. The long-term morbidity associated with these pathogens is driven by subclinical intestinal damage, characterized by alterations in the absorptive architecture of the small intestine — a condition known as environmental enteropathy or enteric dysfunction.

Most ETEC vaccine development has focused on a group of pathovar-specific, plasmid-encoded antigens known as colonization factors (CFs). At the time of writing, at least 29 distinct antigens have been described. The ideal ETEC vaccine, oral or parenteral, would be broadly protective.

### Burden of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Shigella non-fatal diarrhoeal infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries: a modelling analysis [^117UHEJb]. The Lancet Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Shigella are two major pathogens that cause moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children younger than five years. Diarrhoea is associated with an increased risk of stunting, which puts children at risk of death due to other infectious diseases.

We modelled ETEC-related and Shigella-related mortality and the effect of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea episodes to determine the number of children with stunting due to these infections in 79 low-income and lower middle-income countries. We applied population-attributable risk for an increased number of deaths due to other infectious diseases in stunted children. We also calculated 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the point estimates.

In children younger than five years, we estimate that 196 million (95% UI 135–269) episodes of ETEC and Shigella diarrhoea occur annually, resulting in 3.5 million (0.8–5.4) cases of moderate-to-severe stunting and 44,400 (29,400–59,800) total ETEC deaths and 63,100 (44,000–81,900) total Shigella deaths in 2015. Additional infectious disease mortality due to stunting resulted in increases of 24% (8–34; for ETEC) and 28% (10–39; for Shigella) over direct deaths due to diarrhoeal episodes. The distribution of mortality and morbidity varied geographically, with African Region and Eastern Mediterranean Region countries bearing the greatest burden.

The expanded effects of non-fatal ETEC and Shigella-related diarrhoeal episodes can have lasting consequences. Prevention of these infections could reduce the risk of direct mortality and morbidity associated with diarrhoeal diseases in children.

### Mutual enhancement of virulence by enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^112Hb977]. Infection and Immunity (2006). Low credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are common causes of diarrhea in children in developing countries. Dual infections with both pathogens have been noted fairly frequently in studies of diarrhea worldwide. In previous laboratory work, it was observed that cholera toxin and forskolin markedly potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release from the host cell, mediated by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.

In this study, we examined whether the ETEC heat-labile toxin (LT) or the heat-stable toxin (STa, also known as ST) potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release. We found that both crude ETEC culture filtrates and purified ETEC toxins potentiated EPEC-induced ATP release in cultured T84 cells. Coinfection of T84 cells with live ETEC plus EPEC bacteria also resulted in enhanced ATP release compared to EPEC alone.

In Ussing chamber studies of chloride secretion, adenine nucleotides released from the host by EPEC significantly enhanced the chloride secretory responses triggered by crude ETEC filtrates, purified STa, and the peptide hormone guanylin. Additionally, adenosine and LT had additive or synergistic effects in inducing vacuole formation in T84 cells. Therefore, ETEC toxins and EPEC-induced host cell damage both enhance the virulence of the other type of E. coli. Our in vitro data demonstrate a molecular basis for microbial interaction, which could result in increased severity of disease in vivo in individuals coinfected with ETEC and EPEC.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) causes diarrheal illness in infants in the developing world and travelers to countries where the disease is endemic, including military personnel. ETEC infection of the host involves colonization of the small intestinal epithelium and toxin secretion, leading to watery diarrhea.

Regarding the medical management of antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, specifically in the context of Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend reserving ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam, and cefiderocol for the treatment of infections caused by organisms exhibiting carbapenem resistance.

### Comparative analysis of locus of enterocyte effacement pathogenicity islands of atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli [^111ZmRXm]. Infection and Immunity (2004). Low credibility.

The pathogenicity of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is linked to the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS) that directly transfers bacterial effector proteins into eukaryotic cells. Atypical diffusely adhering EPEC (DA-EPEC) strains that harbor homologues of the LEE but lack the EPEC adherence factor plasmid have been increasingly associated with outbreaks of diarrhea.

In this study, we have completely sequenced and functionally characterized LEE pathogenicity islands derived from the clinical DA-EPEC isolates 3431 (O8:H-) and 0181 (O119:H9:K61). LEE3431 and LEE0181 exhibit genetic organization analogous to that of the prototype LEE(E2348/69). Genes constituting the T3SS apparatus are highly conserved. However, LEE-encoded effector proteins exhibit major differences. Transfer and functional expression of LEE0181 in an E. coli XL1 blue MR background demonstrated that LEE0181 contains all the information for signal transduction and pedestal formation.

### Infectious diseases society of America 2024 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections [^112qCGNZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative infections, particularly in the context of Enterobacterales infections and ESBL-producing strains, the IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend retaining the initial antibiotic therapy if clinical improvement is observed with piperacillin/tazobactam initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales.

For extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales pyelonephritis and complicated UTIs, consider using TMP/SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems instead of piperacillin/tazobactam, recognizing that the risk of clinical failure with piperacillin/tazobactam may be low. It is advisable to avoid using piperacillin/tazobactam for treating infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales, even if susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam is demonstrated.

### Treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^111414wZ]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a specialized group of E. coli capable of causing severe colonic disease and renal failure. Their pathogenicity stems from virulence factors that allow the bacteria to colonize the colon and deliver powerful toxins known as verotoxins (VT) or Shiga toxins (Stx) to the systemic circulation. The recent devastating E. coli O104:H4 epidemic in Europe has highlighted the limited effectiveness of current therapies. By studying the sources and distribution of these bacteria and their mechanisms of disease causation, we can better prevent and treat future sporadic cases and common source outbreaks. Due to the complexity of pathogenesis, a multitargeted treatment approach is likely necessary. Developments in these treatment strategies are discussed.

### Inhibition of attaching and effacing lesion formation following enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection [^113Vtmh2]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) and Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) induce cytoskeletal changes in infected epithelial cells. To further characterize host cytosolic responses to infection, a series of specific cell-signaling inhibitors were employed. Initial bacterial adhesion to HEp-2 epithelial cells was not reduced, whereas alpha-actinin accumulation in infected cells was blocked by a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C inhibitor (ET-18-OCH3), phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002), and a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid. A cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (NS-398), however, did not block alpha-actinin reorganization in response to EPEC and STEC infections. Understanding signal transduction responses to enteric pathogens could provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

### Use of gastrointestinal syndromic multiplex molecular assays and detection of pathotypes in pediatric wards [^116bJj4Q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

We observed a substantial rate of inappropriate therapy following the detection of E. coli for 45% of the 69 introduced antibiotics. Interestingly, one study in adults showed that the use of gastrointestinal mPCR leads to a decrease in antimicrobial prescriptions, with 14.5% discontinuation versus 4.5% in the standard stool culture group. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial on adults showed that routine molecular point-of-care testing for gastrointestinal pathogens, despite improving time to results and reducing time spent in single-occupancy isolation rooms, was also accompanied by increased antibiotic use.

In addition, a previous French pediatric study showed that antibiotic therapy was initiated in 16.3% of cases following a positive mPCR result, and only 0.6% of cases saw antibiotics discontinued. Many cases with EPEC and EAEC detection received antibiotic treatment, suggesting that a positive result, even for weakly pathogenic bacteria, might lead to the prescription of antibiotics despite available guidelines. The AMS team conducted few prescription reviews (12%), and several were retrospectively deemed inappropriate despite existing recommendations. This underscores the potential inconsistencies in the literature and the challenges in applying guidelines based on microbiological results, even by experts like the AMS team, especially in facilities caring for patients with significant comorbidities. The limited involvement of the AMS team here was primarily due to reviews being conducted only at the clinicians' request.

### Clinico-epidemiological characteristics of symptomatic and asymptomatic enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli diarrhea and impact on child growth [^114YKtcP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). High credibility.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia (E.) coli (ETEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are major bacterial causes of childhood diarrhea. We explored the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of children aged under 5 years associated with moderate-to-severe diarrhea (MSD), asymptomatic ETEC or EPEC infections, and the subsequent impact on growth reflected by the z-score. Data from 9,439 MSD and 13,128 asymptomatic children were extracted from the Global Enteric Multicenter Study, conducted between 2007 and 2011.

Epidemiological risk factors and clinical characteristics of ETEC and EPEC infection were explored using multivariable logistic regression. A paired t-test was used to investigate the impact of infection on nutritional status. Children aged 12–23 months were more affected by ETEC-positive MSD compared to those aged 0–11 months, whereas children aged 0–11 months were more vulnerable to EPEC-positive MSD.

ETEC- and EPEC-positive MSD children exhibited more clinical signs of dehydration, like sunken eyes and loss of skin turgor preservation, and required more intravenous rehydration than ETEC- and EPEC-negative MSD children. Among other identified co-pathogens, the presence of Campylobacter in the analyzed stool sample was more likely to be associated with symptomatic MSD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.17–1.71), asymptomatic children with ETEC infection (aOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16–1.73), and asymptomatic EPEC infection (aOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.04–1.43). Significant growth faltering was noted in MSD children with ETEC (mean difference 0.22, 95% CI 0.10–0.34) and EPEC.

### A method for fast and simple detection of major diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli in the routine diagnostic laboratory [^115UF5g2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

A multiplex PCR was developed for the detection of the following genes characteristic of diarrhoeagenic Escherichia coli (DEC): verocytotoxins 1 (vtx1) and 2 (vtx2), characteristic of verocytotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC); intimin (eae), found in enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), attaching and effacing E. coli, and VTEC; heat-stable enterotoxin (estA) and heat-labile enterotoxin (eltA), characteristic of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC); and invasive plasmid antigen (ipaH), characteristic of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shigella spp. The method allowed the simultaneous identification of all six genes in one reaction and included a 16S rDNA internal PCR control.

When applied to pure cultures from a reference strain collection, all virulence genes in 124 different DEC strains and 15 Shigella spp. were identified correctly, and there were no cross-reactions with 13 non-E. coli species. The detection limit of the method was 10^2–10^3 DEC CFU/PCR in the presence of 10^6 non-target cells. When the multiplex PCR was tested with colonies from plate cultures of clinical stool samples, it was a faster, more sensitive, less expensive, and less laborious diagnostic procedure than DNA hybridisation. When used with DNA purified from spiked stool samples (by two different commercial kits), the method had a detection limit of 10^6 CFU/mL stool sample.

### Treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) [^112gVRfG]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) are a specialized group of E. coli that can cause severe colonic disease and renal failure. Their pathogenicity derives from virulence factors that enable the bacteria to colonize the colon and deliver extremely powerful toxins known as verotoxins (VT) or Shiga toxins (Stx) to the systemic circulation. The recent devastating E. coli O104:H4 epidemic in Europe has shown how helpless medical professionals are in terms of offering effective therapies. By examining the sources and distribution of these bacteria, and how they cause disease, we will be in a better position to prevent and treat the inevitable future cases of sporadic disease and victims of common source outbreaks. Due to the complexity of pathogenesis, it is likely a multitargeted approach is warranted. Developments in terms of these treatments are discussed.
