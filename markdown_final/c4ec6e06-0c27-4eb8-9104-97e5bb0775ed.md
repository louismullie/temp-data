## Question

when to refer for undescended testes?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when to refer for undescended testes, including considerations for congenital versus acquired cases, special situations like bilateral nonpalpable testes, and guidance on imaging and counseling. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core guideline trigger for referral timing. Then, I should verify the rationale for that timing and the target age for surgery. Next, I will distinguish congenital from acquired cryptorchidism and clarify how that changes urgency. After that, I need to check the emergent referral scenario of bilateral nonpalpable testes and DSD workup. I will then examine the role of ultrasound and other imaging. Finally, I should review counseling points, follow-up for retractile testes, and practical implementation barriers and solutions, before summarizing a concise algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the core referral trigger. The American Urological Association guideline states that infants with a history of cryptorchidism detected at birth who do not have spontaneous descent by 6 months of age, corrected for gestational age, should be referred to a surgical specialist for timely evaluation, because spontaneous descent after 6 months is unlikely and delayed treatment risks fertility and malignancy, so I should anchor on 6 months corrected as the referral threshold [^113XkA5R] [^112o1y2v] [^114uqBqf].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale and surgical timing target. The AUA specifies that in the absence of spontaneous descent by 6 months, surgery should be performed within the next year, meaning orchiopexy by about 12 to 18 months of life to preserve germ cell integrity and mitigate long-term risks, and this timing is supported by histologic data showing declining germ cell counts after 15 to 18 months, especially in bilateral cases, which strengthens the case for not deferring beyond 18 months [^112o1y2v] [^112Soz9F] [^114uTvYT].

> Hold on, I should distinguish congenital from acquired cryptorchidism. For congenital UDT, the 6-month corrected referral rule applies, whereas for acquired UDT, defined as a previously scrotal testis that ascends and cannot be manipulated back into the scrotum, referral should occur promptly after diagnosis regardless of age, ideally before puberty, because acquired UDT carries similar histologic risks and ascent can occur throughout childhood, peaking around 8 years, so I need to ensure I do not apply a wait-and-see approach to acquired cases [^116KTB4X] [^1162Cjvg] [^115fHCWZ].

> I need to check the emergent referral scenario. Any phenotypic male newborn with bilateral nonpalpable testes requires immediate specialist consultation for evaluation of a possible disorder of sex development, and circumcision should be deferred until the workup is complete, given the risk of 46, XX CAH and other DSDs presenting this way, so I should not delay this referral under any circumstance [^117CrW7d] [^11174rS9] [^116QDmH6].

> Next, I should review imaging before referral. The AUA advises against ordering ultrasound or other imaging prior to referral because imaging rarely changes surgical decision-making and has poor specificity for localization, and multiple studies show high rates of unnecessary ultrasounds that misclassify retractile testes and add cost without benefit, so I should explicitly counsel against pre-referral imaging unless the specialist requests it for a specific intraoperative planning purpose [^116L4bjE] [^111m23sf] [^113FNrZf].

> But wait, what if the testis is nonpalpable on exam by the urologist. In that selected scenario, some centers use targeted ultrasound to guide surgical approach and potentially avoid diagnostic laparoscopy, yet this is an exception after specialist examination and not a substitute for timely referral, so I should not generalize this to pre-referral imaging in primary care [^111a8cj3] [^116L4bjE].

> Let me consider counseling and long-term risks. I should confirm that families are counseled on increased risks of subfertility and testicular cancer with UDT, and that orchiopexy before puberty reduces malignancy risk compared to postpubertal repair, while also emphasizing that scrotal repositioning does not eliminate all long-term risks, which supports the importance of early surgery and ongoing surveillance including testicular self-exam education at adolescence [^1124ZPLM] [^117PWghZ] [^116rkWMT].

> I will now examine retractile testes and monitoring. Retractile testes are not normal variants and carry a meaningful risk of secondary ascent, so I should arrange annual examination until puberty and document position at each well-child visit, because a substantial proportion will ascend and require surgery if they fail to remain in the scrotum, and this monitoring strategy helps avoid both missed ascent and unnecessary early surgery [^1162P8pe] [^115dvdVj] [^114UJgyX].

> Next, I should review practical implementation barriers and solutions. Despite clear guidelines, many boys are still referred and operated on late, often due to knowledge gaps, unnecessary ultrasounds, and system delays, so I need to ensure proactive education for primary care, direct referral pathways, and scheduling systems that prioritize infants approaching 6 months, as educational interventions have been shown to reduce referral age and unnecessary imaging in real-world settings [^114fqzM8] [^117CL3jU] [^113ChrsZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the median age at orchiopexy in some cohorts was 30 months, but I should double-check that figure. The Croatian series reported a median orchiopexy age of 30 months for congenital UDT, which underscores the persistent delay problem, whereas U.S. database analyses show modest improvements after 2014 but still only about half of boys undergoing timely orchiopexy by 18 months, reinforcing the need for earlier referral and streamlined access [^114Hcw6w] [^113BoMkf] [^116a1WrN].

> Let me synthesize a concise algorithm. For congenital UDT, refer at 6 months corrected if not descended, with the surgical goal of orchiopexy by 12 to 18 months. For acquired UDT, refer promptly after diagnosis at any age, aiming for surgery before puberty. For bilateral nonpalpable testes in a newborn, refer immediately for DSD evaluation. Avoid pre-referral imaging. Monitor retractile testes annually. And counsel families on fertility and cancer risks with planned long-term follow-up and self-exam education [^113XkA5R] [^112o1y2v] [^116KTB4X] [^117CrW7d] [^116L4bjE] [^1124ZPLM].

---

Refer for undescended testes if the testis is **not descended by 6 months** (corrected age) [^113XkA5R] or if **newly detected** after 6 months [^116KTB4X]. Immediate referral is required for **bilateral nonpalpable testes** [^117CrW7d] or suspected **disorder of sex development** [^notfound]. Do not delay referral for imaging [^116L4bjE]; early orchiopexy by 6–12 months [^112dqz3h] reduces risks of infertility and malignancy [^117PWghZ]. Monitor retractile testes annually [^1162P8pe] and refer if they become nonpalpable or fail to remain in the scrotum [^116KTB4X].

---

## Indications for referral

### Congenital undescended testes

For congenital undescended testes, **referral at 6 months** is indicated if the testis has not descended spontaneously by 6 months (corrected gestational age) [^113XkA5R] [^115oBJz1], as descent after this age is unlikely [^114uqBqf]. Immediate referral is warranted for bilateral nonpalpable testes or suspected disorders of sex development (DSD) [^117CrW7d] [^11174rS9] [^116QDmH6].

---

### Acquired undescended testes

For acquired undescended testes, **referral after 6 months** is indicated for newly diagnosed cases after 6 months (corrected age) [^116KTB4X] [^1162Cjvg], as acquired UDT carries risks similar to congenital UDT [^114UJgyX].

---

### Retractile testes

For retractile testes, **annual monitoring** should continue until puberty [^1162P8pe], with referral if the testis becomes nonpalpable or fails to remain in the scrotum [^116KTB4X].

---

## Timing of referral

Early referral is critical to enable **orchiopexy by 6–12 months** [^113XkA5R] [^112dqz3h], which optimizes fertility and reduces malignancy risk [^117PWghZ]. Delays are common: median ages at referral and surgery often exceed 12 months [^116Deoaq] [^116a1WrN], and many children are still operated on after 18 months [^113BoMkf] [^114Hcw6w].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation before referral

Physical examination is the **primary diagnostic tool** [^112Baw8z]; routine imaging is not recommended before referral [^116L4bjE] [^111m23sf]. Imaging (ultrasound, MRI) is generally unnecessary and may delay care [^113FNrZf]; reserve for select cases at the specialist's discretion [^111a8cj3].

---

## Consequences of delayed referral

Delayed referral and surgery increase risks of:

- **Infertility**: Reduced sperm count and quality [^114JC113].
- **Malignancy**: Higher testicular cancer risk [^1124ZPLM] [^117PWghZ].
- **Testicular atrophy**: Higher risk with delayed orchiopexy [^notfound].

## Summary of referral guidelines

| **Clinical scenario** | **Referral timing** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Congenital UDT (unilateral or bilateral) | 6 months (corrected age) if not descended | - Spontaneous descent unlikely <br/> - Early surgery reduces complications [^113XkA5R] [^112o1y2v] |
| Acquired UDT | Immediately upon diagnosis after 6 months | Similar risks to congenital UDT [^114UJgyX] |
| Bilateral nonpalpable testes or suspected DSD | Immediate referral | - Evaluate for DSD <br/> - Urgent specialist input [^117CrW7d] [^11174rS9] |
| Retractile testes | Annual monitoring; refer if nonpalpable or fails to remain in scrotum | Risk of secondary ascent [^1162P8pe] [^116rkWMT] |

---

Referral for undescended testes should occur by **6 months** (corrected age) if the testis has not descended [^113XkA5R], or immediately upon diagnosis of acquired UDT [^116rkWMT]. Immediate referral is required for bilateral nonpalpable testes or suspected DSD [^117CrW7d]. Early orchiopexy improves fertility and reduces malignancy risk [^117PWghZ]; avoid delays from unnecessary imaging [^111sMDk4].

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^112Me895]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

An evidence-based Consensus on the treatment of undescended testis (UT) was recently published, recommending to perform orchidopexy between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis and to avoid the use of hormones. In Italy, current practices on UT management are little known. Our aim was to describe the current management of UT in a cohort of Italian children in comparison with the Consensus guidelines. As management of retractile testis (RT) differs, RT cases were described separately.

Methods

Ours is a retrospective, multicenter descriptive study. An online questionnaire was filled in by 140 Italian Family Paediatricians (FP) from Associazione Culturale Pediatri (ACP), a national professional association of FP. The questionnaire requested information on all children with cryptorchidism born between 1/01/2004 and 1/01/2006. Data on 169 children were obtained. Analyses were descriptive.

Results

Overall 24% of children were diagnosed with RT, 76% with UT. Among the latter, cryptorchidism resolved spontaneously in 10% of cases at a mean age of 21.6 months. Overall 70% of UT cases underwent orchidopexy at a mean age of 22.8 months (SD 10.8, range 1.2–56.4), 13% of whom before 1 year. The intervention was performed by a paediatric surgeon in 90% of cases, with a success rate of 91%. Orchidopexy was the first line treatment in 82% of cases, while preceded by hormonal treatment in the remaining 18%. Hormonal treatment was used as first line therapy in 23% of UT cases with a reported success rate of 25%. Overall, 13 children did not undergo any intervention (mean age at last follow up 39.6 months). We analyzed the data from the 5 Italian Regions with the largest number of children enrolled and found a statistically significant regional difference in the use of hormonal therapy, and in the use of and age at orchidopexy.

Conclusions

Our study showed an important delay in orchidopexy. A quarter of children with cryptorchidism was treated with hormonal therapy. In line with the Consensus guidelines, surgery was carried out by a paediatric surgeon in the majority of cases, with a high success rate.

### Management of the undescended testis in children: an American Pediatric Surgical Association outcomes and evidence based practice committee systematic review [^114uTvYT]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Management of undescended testes (UDT) has evolved over the last decade. While urologic societies in the United States and Europe have established some guidelines for care, management by North American pediatric surgeons remains variable. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the published evidence regarding the treatment of (UDT) in children.

Methods

A comprehensive search strategy and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were utilized to identify, review, and report salient articles. Five principal questions were asked regarding imaging standards, medical treatment, surgical technique, timing of operation, and outcomes. A literature search was performed from 2005 to 2020.

Results

A total of 825 articles were identified in the initial search, and 260 were included in the final review.

Conclusions

Pre-operative imaging and hormonal therapy are generally not recommended except in specific circumstances. Testicular growth and potential for fertility improves when orchiopexy is performed before one year of age. For a palpable testis, a single incision approach is preferred over a two-incision orchiopexy. Laparoscopic orchiopexy is associated with a slightly lower testicular atrophy rate but a higher rate of long-term testicular retraction. One and two-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy have similar rates of testicular atrophy and retraction. There is a higher relative risk of testicular cancer in UDT which may be lessened by pre-pubertal orchiopexy.

### Undescended testes: does age at orchiopexy affect survival of the testis? [^1122TS79]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The optimal age at which to perform orchiopexy for cryptorchidism has long been debated. The aim of this study was to determine if age at orchiopexy affected testicular atrophy.

Methods

A retrospective review of patients undergoing orchiopexy from 2000 to 2010 was conducted. An individual testis, rather than patient, was used as the dependent variable. A total of 349 testicles from 1126 charts (ICD-9 = 752.51) were identified. Primary study outcome was testicular survival without atrophy.

Results

Mean follow up for the study was 25 months. There was postoperative atrophy in 27 testes (7.7%). Intraabdominal testicle was independently associated with increased postsurgical atrophy (p < 0.0001). The odds of postsurgical atrophy were 15.66 times higher for an abdominal vs. inguinal location (95% CI: 5.5–44.6). Testicular atrophy was highest for orchiopexy at ages 13–24 months (n = 16 of 133, 12%) vs. those less than 13 months (n = 3 of 64, 5%), and those greater than 24 months (n = 8 of 152, 5%) (p = 0.0024). After adjusting for location, age was not statistically significant with postsurgical atrophy (p = 0.055).

Conclusions

From this study we conclude that there is no increase in testicular atrophy in patients less than 13 months.

### Acquired undescended testis: when does the ascent occur? [^115fHCWZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Little is known about the timeframe in which acquired undescended testes occur. To guide recommendations for screening examinations, we aimed to (1) specify the ratio of acquired undescended testes in orchiopexy cases and to (2) identify a predisposing age for the development of acquired undescended testis.

Methods

Three-hundred-forty cases of orchiopexy were retrospectively analyzed and classified as congenital or acquired cases of undescended testis. In acquired cases, the time of the last documented physiological testicular position was obtained. The time of testicular ascent was approximated by calculating the mean between the last physiological finding and orchiopexy.

Results

In 151 cases (44.4%) prior physiological position of testes was documented and acquired undescended testis was assumed. In 115 of these cases (76.2%) details on the age at last physiological position were available. Ascent occurred between the age of one and fourteen. The 50th, 75th, 85th, 90th and 95th percentile for the estimated age at ascent was 5.8, 7.3, 8.4, 8.7 and 11.1 years, respectively.

Conclusions

Acquired undescended testes are a common cause of cryptorchidism. Ascent occurs throughout all prepubertal ages, emphasizing the need to regular follow-up of testicular position until puberty.

Type Of Study

Prognosis study.

Level Of Evidence

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^112Baw8z]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism guideline — well-child screening and ongoing evaluation emphasizes routine palpation and continued surveillance. Primary care providers should palpate testes for quality and position at each recommended well-child visit. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B) Spontaneous descent of testes may occur in the first six months of life, and testes may "ascend" out of the scrotum (acquired cryptorchidism). Given the potential for change in testicular position throughout childhood, careful evaluation of the scrotum should be performed at every scheduled well-child check, which is in line with the recommendations of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: guidelines and reality – a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^113ox9eu]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Strikingly, our results show a statistically significant influence of the presence of a department for pediatric surgery on the timing of orchidopexy in UDT. In hospitals with pediatric surgery departments, significantly more children received surgical treatment according to guideline recommendations; both before (29% vs. 17%) as well as after modification of the guideline (10% vs. 3%). Even though it is no secret that mutual reservations concerning medical interventions in young patients are somewhat ubiquitous, it yet seems surprising that the above mentioned impact is that distinct. However, even though statistically significant, the number of patients undergoing orchidopexy before the age of 1 is still extremely low.

There are several valid explanatory approaches for the discrepancy specified above. Provided that all cases of UDT are actually primary in nature, possible influencing factors are screening failure, a lack of knowledge among referring health care providers, timing problems with referral to subspecialties, the unwillingness of parents to have a surgical procedure performed on their child at a young age, the surgeons' endeavor to perform surgery in patients of an older age in order to avoid complications associated with immaturity as well as the general health state of the patient himself.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^112sMGyv]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association — cryptorchidism orchiectomy indications and intraoperative considerations state that when operating on an abdominal testis, surgeons may encounter circumstances that preclude orchidopexy (e.g., atretic and/or short vas deferens, very short testicular vessels, dysmorphic testis, postpubertal male), and in these situations an orchiectomy may be prudent if a normal contralateral descended testis is present; to help determine advisability a biopsy may be appropriate but its utility is not proven; if orchiectomy is performed, counsel on protective sporting gear; autotransplant is another option but has been done sparingly; additionally, Guideline Statement 15 specifies that in boys with a normal contralateral testis, surgical specialists may perform an orchiectomy when the contralateral testis is normal and there are very short vessels/vas, a dysmorphic or very hypoplastic testis, or postpubertal age.

### Undescended testis: a roundtable discussion based on clinical scenarios-part 2 [^112KcLJF]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most frequent genital anomaly in boys. However, its treatment varies widely throughout the world. This second part of our roundtable discussion aims to continue to ask global experts to express their attitudes towards several case scenarios of UDT in order to explore the rationale for their clinical decisions. As the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we believe that this roundtable series will facilitate colleagues all over the world to reflect and improve their practices regarding the treatment of UDT.

### Cryptorchidism (undescended testicle) [^116rkWMT]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism refers to an undescended testicle, the most common genitourinary malformation in male children. It is diagnosed with history and physical examination findings, and primary care physicians play a key role in the early identification of the condition. Early surgical intervention reduces the risk of testicular cancer and preserves fertility. Patients should be referred for surgical intervention at six months of age or at the time of diagnosis if the child is older. After surgery, patients require lifelong surveillance and counseling regarding fertility implications and increased risk of testicular conditions. Patients with bilateral undescended testicles that are nonpalpable should undergo endocrinologic evaluation for sexual development disorders. Retractile testicles are a variant of cryptorchidism and should be monitored annually until puberty, when acquired ascent becomes unlikely due to greater testicular volume. Based on expert opinion, all patients with a history of cryptorchidism should undergo annual clinical examination and be taught self-examination techniques for early detection of testicular cancer.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^114Hcw6w]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Undescended testes (UDT) is the most common anomaly of the male genitourinary tract. The guidelines suggest that orchidopexy in congenitally UDT should be performed between 6 months and 18 months of age, while in acquired UDT, orchidopexy should be performed before puberty. Delay in treatment increases the risk of cancer and infertility. The main aim of this study was to determine whether we meet international standards in the treatment of UDT.

Methods

The present study included all boys who underwent orchidopexy either due to congenital or acquired UDT in 2019 (from January 1 to December 31). For each group, laterality, location, associated anomalies, premature birth and in how many cases ultrasound was applied were determined. Additionally, for each group, the types of surgery, the number of necessary reoperations, and in how many cases atrophy occurred were determined. Finally, ages of referral, of clinical examination, and of orchidopexy were determined.

Results

During this period, 198 patients with 263 UDT underwent orchidopexy. The median time of orchidopexy for the congenital group was 30 months, while that for the acquired group was 99 months. In the congenital group up to 18 months of age, orchidopexy was performed in 16 (16%) boys, while in the acquired group up to 13 years of age, orchidopexy was performed in 95 (96.94%) boys.

Conclusion

Given the well-known risks of late treatment of UDT, orchidopexy needs to be performed much earlier, especially in the congenital group.

### Unidentified undescended testes in teenage boys with severe learning disabilities [^1143iebH]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Nine boys of secondary school age were referred with undescended testes (UDT) to paediatric surgeons over a period of 8years. All were referred from the same community paediatric clinic for children with severe learning disabilities. UDT cause concern because of a threefold increase in the incidence of cancer. Cosmesis and reduced fertility were seen as less relevant issues for these boys. The late identification and incidence of UDT are discussed. It is suggested that awareness of this issue should be raised and screening introduced. Advice is needed on the appropriate management of UDT in this group of boys.

### Socio-occupational class, region of birth and maternal age: influence on time to detection of cryptorchidism (undescended testes): a Danish nationwide register study [^114NbWxB]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

The present study investigated the influence of socio-occupational class, geographical region and maternal age on time to detection of cryptorchidism. Rate of detection was independent of socio-occupational group in both birth cohorts. In fact, the cumulative distribution of TTD of cryptorchidism in children of employed parents in white collar group 1 almost exactly matched that in children of unskilled manual workers. There was no indication of a change in the influence of socio-occupational group between boys born 1981 to 1987 and 1988 to 1994. Detection rates did, however, vary between geographical regions. A similar pattern were obtained for surgical correction after a diagnosis.

These findings indicate that inequality in childhood socio-occupational status does not influence time to detection and correction of cryptorchidism in Denmark. The overall tendency of non-adherence to routine prophylactic visits by parents of low social classes thus seem to have only minor impact, if any, on the diagnosis and treatment of cryptorchidism. It has, however, been shown, that although low income and education predict fewer contacts with specialist care, this may not be so for hospital referral. Actually, patients of low socioeconomic status may be referred relatively more frequently to hospital care than patients of high status. This may somewhat compensate the less frequent use of preventive examinations in childhood at the general practitioners. Furthermore, detection of cryptorchidism does not entirely depend on visits at the general practitioner; A trained nurse specialised in child and family health care provides home visits following childbirth, and school-aged boys regularly attend the school nurse during the years of primary and lower secondary school in Denmark.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^111sMDk4]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our single-center retrospective study aimed, in addition to general characteristics, to determine whether children with congenital and acquired UDT were surgically treated on time, as negative repercussions of untimely treatment were clearly identified. At the end of the 20th century, scientists made it clear that the optimal time for treatment of congenital UDT is within the first year of life and that there are no harmful effects or risks to the child. Although the first comprehensive research on this topic did not clearly distinguish the group of congenital from acquired testes, the researchers expressed concern, since in less than 50% of boys orchidopexy was performed by the age of 2 years. Already in the same year, it was considered necessary to determine whether there was a tendency to reduce the age at which orchidopexy was performed. For the Irish child population, the mean time of orchidopexy in one decade has been reduced by 3 years, while in the Danish population, for 6 years, the reduction was half a year, which instilled optimism. In two decades, the Mdn of orchidopexy performed in the Chinese population was reduced by 7 years, although only 2% of healthcare practitioners knew the recommended age for orchidopexy. Researchers in Germany have recognized that the theoretical knowledge of primary pediatricians and early referral is extremely important. Steckler et al reported in their study that only 30% of pediatricians and 14% of family physicians recommended orchidopexy between 6 months and 12 months of age. Gerber et al pointed out the suspicion that poor quality clinical examination by pediatricians may also be a factor that may influence the untimely diagnosis of this condition. The study by Cho et al showed that the intervention by an interactive survey aimed at general practitioners had positive effects on reducing referral time. We also believe that the time of referral to our institution must be significantly reduced, especially for the congenital group. In addition to the pediatrician's and general practitioner's theoretical knowledge, several other factors have been identified that are significantly related to the time to surgery, such as the age of the diagnosing physician, the age of the surgeon performing the surgery, and the urbanization of the patient's residence. The study from the neighboring country also states that the residence of patients is extremely important, given that 28.13% of boys from urban areas underwent surgery by 18 months of age, while from rural areas, this percentage was only 15.46. A total of 22.6% of boys compared with our 16% underwent surgery before 18 months of age. Compared with our study, a New Zealand study showed that the Mdn waiting time from referral to clinical examination was only 1.84 months (vs 3.5 months), while the Mdn from clinical examination to orchidopexy was only 2.95 months (vs 12.5 months). At a single-center in Saudi Arabia, the Mdn waiting time for elective orchidopexy was 4.8 months, while in another center, the time was 8.1 months, but they had a slightly higher Mdn from referral to clinical examination (4.1 months). There is no doubt that we need to do orchidopexy for our patients faster than the day when the clinical examination was performed. It is interesting to note that even countries with a Mdn age for surgery of 1.05 and 1.49 years show a tendency towards a lower Mdn in the future. In a study by Chen et al, similar to our results, 32% of boys had an associated inguinal hernia, but in our study, we had more boys with bilaterally UDT (32.82% vs 11.3%). On the other hand, according to a study by Zhao et al, only 14% of boys had an inguinal hernia or hydrocele, while 15.2% had bilaterally UDT. Analogous to our results, only 16.9% of boys underwent surgery by 18 months of age. According to Marret et al, during the Mdn follow-up of 5.5 years, ultrasound verified atrophy in 11% of cases, while during our 2-year follow-up, atrophy was recorded in 3.42% of cases. Although in our study the rate is not high, according to Elzeneini et al, the rate of testicular atrophy is much lower in two-stage Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy, which should guide us in the future. Although meta-analysis concluded that ultrasound cannot reliably locate non-palpable testes and that ultrasound is unnecessary in preoperative evaluation of boys with UDT because it does not affect final surgical management, according to a study by Soto-Palou et al, 46.4% of boys underwent ultrasound preoperatively. In our study, as many as 63.6% of patients underwent ultrasound, which certainly extended the time to orchidopexy. Ultrasound was mostly requested by pediatric surgeons. This habit will certainly need to be reduced by adequate education of all stakeholders involved in treatment. Comprehensive studies that clearly distinguish congenital from acquired UDT began to appear only a few years ago. In the study of Boehme et al, almost identical results were observed in the proportion of congenital and acquired UDT, which is confirmed by our study. The study also found that there were more children born prematurely in the congenital group than in the acquired group (51% vs 34%), which was confirmed by our results (16% vs 4%). Regarding patients who had an associated inguinal hernia, a significantly higher number was recorded in the congenital group (50% vs 18%), which was confirmed by our study (36% vs 21%). It should be emphasized that the time interval, from diagnosis to orchidopexy, was only 3 months. Regarding the congenital UDT, a study by Zvizdic et al, analogous to our results, found that the right side is more often affected. An almost identical percentage of boys had an associated congenital inguinal hernia. Although we had a better Mdn referral time (14 months vs 23 months), the Mdn time of orchidopexy was far worse (30 months vs 24 months).

### Undescended testis in older boys: further evidence that ascending testes are common [^115SY39a]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

We recommend orchiopexy between 9 and 18 months of age for surgical, testicular, and psychological reasons. However, in practice, we observed many patients coming to orchiopexy at a later age. To understand this difference better, we reviewed our experience with patients undergoing late orchiopexy.

Methods

We reviewed retrospectively the office medical records of all boys who had undergone an orchiopexy between July 1997 and April 2006. We defined a "late" orchiopexy as that performed at 4 years of age or later. Each boy was examined carefully by a pediatric urologist, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative findings were reviewed.

Results

There were 191 late orchiopexies in 177 patients (from a total of 587 orchiopexies in 552 patients). Median age at the operation was 7.2 years (range, 4.0–16.2). Preoperatively, the testes were palpable in 140 (72%) and nonpalpable in 51 (28%). The apparent reason for the late orchiopexy was an ascending testis (previously descended) in 85 (45%), parental delay in 41 (22%), late referral in 39 (20%), and iatrogenic cryptorchidism in 18 (9%). Ascended testes were more likely to have a history of being retractile (85% vs 30%), to have a patent processus vaginalis (78% vs 54%), and to be localized to the superficial inguinal area (87% vs 50%).

Conclusions

Primary care provider and parent education on the benefits of early orchiopexy is important, but in addition, ascending testes are much more common than previously thought. Patients with retractile testes should be followed regularly.

### Use of ultrasound for the palpable undescended testis: a wasteful practice [^111m23sf]. Family Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many primary care physicians order an ultrasound (US) before referral to specialist care for suspected undescended testis; however, the value of this practice is questionable.

Objective

To determine the proportion of boys referred for suspected undescended testis who had accompanying US, the cost of this practice and the accuracy of US for testis localization when compared with physical examination by a pediatric urologist.

Methods

This was a retrospective chart review at a pediatric urology service, including all patients referred for suspected undescended testis from 2008 to 2012. We determined the cost of US ordered, and calculated Cohen's kappa, sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive value.

Results

We identified 894 eligible patients; 32% (289/894) were accompanied by US. In 77% (223/289), the urologist was able to palpate the testis: 51% (147/289) had a normal/retractile testis and 26% (76/289) had a palpable undescended testis. At a cost of 71.10 CAD per US, 20 547.90 CAD was expended on this practice. Of the 223 patients with palpable testes, we were able to gather detailed US and physical examination results for 214 patients. Cohen's kappa was 0.06 (95% CI -0.005, 0.11; P = 0.10). US had 92.8% sensitivity (95% CI 84.1, 96.9%) and 15.2% specificity (95% CI 10.2, 21.9%) to detect an undescended testis. The positive predictive value was 34.2% (95% CI 27.8, 41.3%), while the negative predictive value was 81.5% (95% CI 63.3, 91.8%).

Conclusions

Referral of patients for suspected undescended testis should not be accompanied by an US study as US is not useful in these cases.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116if87Y]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cryptorchidism is one of the most common pediatric disorders of the male endocrine glands and the most common genital disorder identified at birth. This guideline is intended to provide physicians and non-physician providers (primary care and specialists) with a consensus of principles and treatment plans for the management of cryptorchidism (typically isolated non-syndromic).

Materials and Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature was conducted using controlled vocabulary supplemented with key words relating to the relevant concepts of cryptorchidism. The search strategy was developed and executed by reference librarians and methodologists to create an evidence report limited to English-language, published peer-reviewed literature. This review yielded 704 articles published from 1980 through 2013 that were used to form a majority of the guideline statements. Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions were used for guideline statements lacking sufficient evidence-based data.

Results

Guideline statements were created to inform clinicians on the proper methods of history-taking, physical exam, and evaluation of the boy with cryptorchidism, as well as the various hormonal and surgical treatment options.

Conclusions

Imaging for cryptorchidism is not recommended prior to referral, which should occur by 6 months of age. Orchidopexy (orchiopexy is the preferred term) is the most successful therapy to relocate the testis into the scrotum, while hormonal therapy is not recommended. Successful scrotal repositioning of the testis may reduce but does not prevent the potential long-term issues of infertility and testis cancer. Appropriate counseling and follow-up of the patient is essential.

### Cryptorchidism… [^114ku8wK]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism, also known asundescended testis, is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. The word is from Ancient Greek κρυπτός 'hidden' and ὄρχις 'testicle'. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life, making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.
4. Undeveloped or severely abnormal
5. Missing. About two-thirds of cases without other abnormalities are unilateral; most of the other third involve both testes. In 90% of cases, an undescended testis can be felt in the inguinal canal.

In a small minority of cases, missing testes may be found in the abdomen or appear to be nonexistent. Undescended testes are associated with reduced fertility, increased risk of testicular germ-cell tumors, and psychological problems when fully-grown. Undescended testes are also more susceptible to testicular torsion and inguinal hernias. Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend during the first year of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an orchiopexy. Although cryptorchidism nearly always refers to congenital absence or maldescent, a testis observed in the scrotum in early infancy can occasionally "reascend" into the inguinal canal. A testis that can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal is referred to as retractile.

Cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and poor semen quality make up the syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Signs and symptoms Infertility Many men who were born with undescended testes have reduced fertility, even after orchiopexy in infancy. The reduction with unilateral cryptorchidism is subtle, with a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported by the same study for the general population of adult men. Cancer risk One of the strongest arguments for early orchiopexy is reducing the risk of testicular cancer. About one in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develops testicular cancer, roughly a four- to 40-fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the third and fourth decades of life.

The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men. The most common type of testicular cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and one of the advantages of orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^114UJgyX]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Well-child genital examination frequency and risks related to acquired and retractile testes are highlighted. A genital examination should be performed at every well-child check as outlined by the Bright Futures of the AAP. Documentation of testes in the dependent scrotum in the first few years of life should not preclude continued examination of the genitals at every scheduled clinic visit. Systematic genital examination will allow identification and referral of boys with acquired cryptorchidism. Acquired cryptorchid testes are at risk for developing the same adverse histologic changes seen in primary cryptorchid testes and contribute significantly to the number of orchiopexies performed. Systematic and continued genital examinations will also allow identification of boys with retractile testes. While retractile testes do not require surgical correction, the risk of testicular ascent may be higher in boys with retractile testes than in boys whose testes are always positioned in the dependent scrotum.

What is already known on this topic

The guidelines suggest that orchidopexy in congenitally undescended testes (UDTs) should be performed between 6 months and 18 months of age, while in acquired UDTs, orchidopexy should be performed before puberty.
Delay in treatment increases the risk of cancer and infertility.

Cryptorchidism — natural history and postnatal changes include both spontaneous descent and re-ascent: suprascrotal testes were newly diagnosed in about 2% of boys examined longitudinally up to 10 years; spontaneous descent of congenitally cryptorchid testes occurred in 35–45% of newborn boys, usually prior to 3 months of age, and re-ascent was reported in 22% of boys; in a referral population, spontaneous descent occurred in 24% of boys presenting prior to age 4 months and none at or after 6 months, totaling 6.9% in the first year of life.

### Retractile testis – is it really a normal variant? [^115dvdVj]. The Journal of Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Retractile testes are thought to represent a normal variant of descended testes in prepubertal boys. We studied retractile testes to determine their natural history.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 122 boys (mean age 5.4 years) who were referred for a suspected undescended testis and were found to have a retractile testis. A retractile testis was defined as a suprascrotal testis that could be manipulated easily into the scrotum and remained there without traction until the cremasteric reflex was induced. The boys were followed by annual examinations, which demonstrated the presence of retractile, descended (nonretractile) or undescended testes, and the presence or absence of a taut or inelastic spermatic cord in association with a retractile testis.

Results

Of 204 retractile testes 61 (30%) descended (became nonretractile), 66 (32%) became UDTs and 77 (38%) remained retractile. Of the 62 retractile testes with a taut or inelastic spermatic cord 35 (56%) became UDTs. Of the 61 orchiopexies performed 8 (13%) showed a patent processus vaginalis. Boys in whom UDTs vs descended testes developed were a mean of 4.9 vs 6.6 years old (p = 0.001). The chance of spontaneous descent was 58% in boys 7 years or older, compared to 21% in boys younger than 7 (p < 0.0001).

Conclusions

A retractile testis is not a normal variant. Retractile testes have a 32% risk of becoming an ascending or acquired undescended testis. The risk is higher in boys younger than 7 years old, or when the spermatic cord seems tight or inelastic. Boys with retractile testes should be monitored annually until the testes have clearly descended.

### Orchiopexyen.wikipedia.org › wiki › orchiopexy… [^1127z8dG]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Orchiopexy is a surgery to move and/or permanently fix a testicle into the scrotum. While orchiopexy typically describes the operation to surgically correct an undescended testicle, it is also used to resolve testicular torsion. Indications Undescended testicle Undescended testicles affect 1% of males and present bilaterally in 10% of those cases. The cause is unknown, with a small percentage associated with developmental abnormalities or chromosomal aberrations. Early orchiopexy reduces the risks for cancer and sterility in males with cryptorchidism, or undescended testes. Cryptorchidism is associated with tubular atrophy and sterility. In addition, cryptorchid testes carry a three to five times higher risk for testicular cancer. Patients are at increased risk for the development of cancer and atrophy in the contralateral, normally descended testes as well.

There are multiple different orchiopexy techniques used to correct an undescended testicle due to the large variation in location where the testes may present. The procedures have a high overall success rate. Testicular torsion Orchiopexy is performed in the event of testicular torsion, a urologic emergency presenting with intense pain and often without inciting injury. While neonatal torsion occurs with no anatomic defect to account for its occurrence, adult torsion results from a bilateral congenital anomaly often called a "bell-clapper deformity", where the testis is abnormally anchored in the scrotal sac, leading to increased mobility. Twisting of the spermatic cord results in obstruction of the testicular venous drainage. Intense vascular engorgement and infarction may lead to testicular injury and sterility. If the cord is manually untwisted within approximately six hours the testis has a high chance of remaining viable.

One in three cases results in dead testes, requiring orchiectomy. Surgical techniques For fixation of the undescended testes For the management of palpable undescended testes the standard inguinal approach is the appropriate procedure. Approximately 50% of non-palpable testis are high in the inguinal canal or abdominal, while the other 50% are atrophic, and usually located in the scrotum. Diagnostic laparoscopy is often advised to determine the location of non-palpable testis.
- Standard open inguinal orchiopexy is most appropriate procedure for palpable testes. With this technique, the spermatic cord and testicular vessels can be easily visualized and a patent processus vaginalis can be easily corrected. This approach requires a second incision to secure the testicle within the scrotum.
- Laparoscopic orchiopexy is best used for abdominal testis, while mobile/peeping testis distal to the inguinal ring should be approached with the standard one-stage laparoscopic or open orchiopexy. The major proposed benefits of laparoscopic orchiopexy are the possibility of high retroperitoneal dissection and/or rerouting the testes through a shorter pathway medial to the inferior epigastric vessels for a more favorable scrotal position. The benefits of both techniques is debated, with neither showing a difference in success rates.

### Acquired undescended testes in boys with hypospadias [^114GkCzw]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We determined the incidence of acquired undescended testes in boys with hypospadias.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of 566 boys with hypospadias who were referred to our outpatient clinic between January 2000 and September 2009. Acquired undescended testes were defined as testes that were documented at the bottom of the scrotum at least once after birth by the pediatric urologist at our institution but were subsequently documented to have moved from a satisfactory scrotal position by the same pediatric urologist or an equally experienced pediatric urologist. However, this definition did not include undescended testes after inguinoscrotal surgery. We excluded boys with gender development disorders with testicular dysgenesis, those who underwent bilateral inguinoscrotal surgery and those without congenital cryptorchidism who were followed less than 3 months.

Results

Of the 566 boys with hypospadias 100 met study exclusion criteria. Of the 466 boys included in analysis 29 (6.2%) had congenital cryptorchidism and 15 (3.2%) had acquired undescended testes. Urethroplasty was performed in 413 boys, including 91 with distal, 132 with mid and 181 with proximal hypospadias. The incidence of congenital cryptorchidism and acquired undescended testes in boys with proximal hypospadias was significantly higher than that in boys with other types of hypospadias (p = 0.03 and 0.001, respectively).

Conclusions

Boys with proximal hypospadias are at a higher risk for acquired undescended testes than those with other mild types of hypospadias. Thus, testicular location should be monitored regularly until after puberty.

### European Association of Urology-European society of paediatric urology guidelines on paediatric urology: summary of 2024 updates. part II [^115W97Lf]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

We present a summary of part II of the 2024 update of the European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society of Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines on paediatric urology. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of a number of urological conditions in the paediatric population. The aim is to provide practical recommendations for clinical management of these conditions with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

Methods

For the guidelines update, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations in the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with the conditions outlines. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and the importance of shared decision-making with patients and their guardians/caregivers. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of undescended testes, testicular tumours in prepubertal boys, acute scrotum, hypospadias, congenital penile curvature, urinary tract infections, daytime lower urinary tract conditions, urachal remnants, and transitional urology.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

Part II of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of a number of paediatric urological conditions, with recommendations designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Table 1
Characteristic indicators in patients undergoing orchidopexy

Table 2
Associated anomalies in children with congenital and acquired undescended testes

Out of a total of 263 orchidopexies performed, 249 (94.68%) were performed using the Dartos pouch technique (123 in congenital group and 126 in acquired group), while 14 (5.32%) were performed using the single-stage Fowler-Stephens procedure (eight in congenital group and six in acquired group). Within the congenital group, seven reoperations were performed due to inadequate position of the testis within the scrotum (six inguinal testis with four of the left side and two of the right side) and one abdominal left testis, while in the acquired group, three reoperations were performed (one inguinal right testis and two abdominal right testis). In total, 10 patients were reoperated and followed up for 2 years. During follow-up, all testes undergoing orchidopexy were palpated in the scrotum, but atrophy (> 50% loss of volume after orchiopexy) was verified by ultrasound in nine (3.42%) testes (five in the congenital group and four in the acquired group).

The referral time to our institution, age at which the patient underwent clinical examination, and age at which the patient received surgery are summarized in table 1. The Mdn time from referral to clinical examination was 3.5 months in the congenital group and 6 months in acquired group (p = 0.007). The Mdn time from clinical examination to orchidopexy was 12.5 months in the congenital group and 18.5 months in the acquired group (p = 0.003) (figure 1). In the congenital group up to 18 months of age, orchidopexy was performed in 16 (16%) boys, while in the acquired group up to 13 years of age, orchidopexy was performed in 95 (96.94%) boys (figure 2).

### Management of undescended testis may be improved with educational updates for referring providers [^117CL3jU]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

A large proportion of boys referred for undescended testis (UDT) is not managed optimally prior to the referral, with the majority seen at > 1 year of age and many having unnecessary ultrasound (US). Our objective was to assess the magnitude of these problems in our area and to determine if unnecessary US decreased following interventions to educate referring providers (RPs).

Materials and Methods

A chart review was done on new patients referred for UDT from January 2010 to June 2012. Data collection included age on date of pediatric urology office visit, whether or not RPs obtained an US, and whether the pediatric urology examination revealed an UDT or retractile testis. Several educational updates for RPs were provided and the proportion having US was tracked during the study period.

Results

Of 363 boys referred for UDT, only 17% (62) were seen at < 1 year of age, and 62% (227) had retractile testis. US had been obtained in 24% (87/363). There was a statistically significant decrease in the proportion of patients having had an unnecessary US following the last update (p < 0.01).

Conclusions

Delayed urology consultation and unnecessary US for UDT are common in our area. A brief focused educational update was effective in decreasing US in our area.

### Factors which delay surgery for undescended testis in Ontario: a retrospective population based cohort study on timing of orchidopexy between 2006 and 2012 [^111jGVXK]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Delays in performing orchidopexy (OP) for undescended testis (UDT) result in loss of germ cells. Despite practice guidelines recommending OP by 18 months of age, significant delays in OP occur. This delay may impact fertility and increase the risk of testicular malignancy in boys with UDT.

Objective

The objective of this study is to identify factors associated with delayed OP with the goal of identifying modifiable risk factors.

Study Design

A population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted using linked databases held at ICES to evaluate factors associated with timing of OP in Ontario for 4339 male newborns undergoing their first OP between 2006 and 2012. Primary outcome was delayed OP (> 18 months). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify patient, physician, and hospital risk factors for delayed OP.

Results

Median age at OP was 24 months, while median age at first surgical consult was 20 months (IQR 10–60 months). Older age at first surgical consult (> 12 months vs. < 9 months, OR 17.83) was identified as the primary risk factor for delayed OP, besides ICU hospitalization (OR 3.42), associated hypospadias (OR 2.30), higher hospital OP volume (OR 1.91), more healthcare visits in first year of life (OR 1.05), and older surgeon age (OR 1.02).

Discussion

Our findings support reports that OP is often performed past guideline recommendations. Interventions that result in earlier referral for UDT (< 6 months) may result in timely OP. Limitations for this study include potential misclassification or missing data within the utilized databases.

Conclusion

The most important barrier to timely OP is delay in first surgical consultation. Aiming for an earlier referral through guideline modifications or education to referring providers may help achieve the goal of timely OP.

### Current referral patterns and means to improve accuracy in diagnosis of undescended testis [^115YchdZ]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The goals were to determine current referral patterns for boys suspected of having undescended testis (UDT) and to identify factors to assist primary care providers in distinguishing retractile testes from UDTs on the basis of history, physical examination, or imaging findings.

Methods

By using a standardized history assessment, visual inspection of the scrotum for symmetry, physical examination, and review of previously obtained imaging findings, we performed a prospective observational study with consecutive patients referred to a pediatric urologist for evaluation of UDT.

Results

Of 118 boys, 51 (43%) had descended testes, 60 (51%) had UDTs, and 7 (6%) had initially indeterminate findings. Boys with UDT were referred at a median age of 43.3 months. Patients referred at < 1 year or > 10 years of age were significantly more likely to have UDT than were those referred at 1 to 10 years of age. History of UDT at birth, prematurity, and scrotal asymmetry strongly increased the risk of UDT. Genital ultrasonography had been performed for 25% of patients, incorrectly indicating UDT for 48%.

Conclusions

Most boys were referred well beyond the recommended age of < 12 months for orchiopexy. Only one-half of the patients had UDT, with most errors in diagnosis being made for boys 1 to 10 years of age, which suggests difficulty distinguishing UDT from retractile testis. Positive birth history findings, prematurity, and scrotal asymmetry predicted UDT and can be used by primary care physicians in their assessment before referral. Genital ultrasonography did not distinguish UDTs from retractile testes.

### Heresy-is there a role for ultrasound in management of the non-palpable testicle? [^111a8cj3]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

AUA Guidelines do not support the routine use of ultrasound (US) in evaluation of boys with an undescended testicle (UDT) prior to urology referral. Multiple studies have demonstrated that real time US is inferior to a physical examination by a pediatric urologist in detecting an UDT. However, improved US technology, which now permits detection of the non-palpable testis located just proximal to the internal ring, may aid in guiding the surgical approach to the non-palpable testis. We evaluated US findings of boys deemed to have a non-palpable UDT and compared them to surgical findings.

Objective

To assess the role of pre-operative ultrasonography in guiding surgical management in boys deemed to have a non-palpable testis by a pediatric urologist.

Study Design

US of boys with a non-palpable UDT, as reported by a pediatric urologist on physical exam, during a 3-year period, were reviewed. All US were performed jointly by a technician and pediatric radiologist. Patient demographics, laterality, and intra-operative findings were assessed.

Results

Thirty-one boys with a non-palpable testicle on physical exam underwent scrotal/inguinal/pelvis US at a median age of 7.5 months (IQR 2.5–12.3 months). Two patients had bilateral non-palpable testicles, 21 had a non-palpable left sided testicle and 8 had a non-palpable right sided testicle. Of the 33 non-palpable testes, 5 (15.2%) were identified in the inguinal canal. Sixteen (48.5%) were visualized in the lower pelvis just proximal to the internal ring and graded as intra-abdominal. Four (12.1%) nubbins or very atrophic testes were identified in the inguinal region or scrotum and 5 (15.2%) testes were not identified on US. Three (9.1%) testes were observed to be mobile between the lower pelvis just proximal to the internal ring and the inguinal canal. Of the 8 patients with testes that were identified in the inguinal canal, or mobile between the lower pelvis and inguinal canal, 7 avoided a diagnostic laparoscopy and underwent an inguinal orchiopexy. Of the 16 testicles located in the lower pelvis proximal to the internal ring, only 2 underwent laparoscopy/laparoscopic orchiopexy.

Discussion

In cases of a non-palpable testicle following a physical examination by a urologist, an ultrasound can impact the operative plan, and allow for patients to avoid laparoscopy. In our cohort, 87.5% of non-palpable testes avoided laparoscopic surgery after ultrasound identification of a viable testis.

Conclusions

US in the evaluation of cryptorchidism can guide surgical management in select cases in which a testis is non-palpable following careful examination by a urologist.

### Age at surgery and outcomes of an undescended testis [^116jxkJd]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common genital anomaly in boys. Current guidelines recommend surgery before 12 months of age to maximize fertility and potentially reduce the risk of future malignancy. We investigated the prevalence of UDT and examined rates of surgery and age at surgery in an Australian population.

Methods

UDT was identified from all live-born infants in New South Wales, Australia, from 2001 to 2011 using routinely collected record-linked birth and hospital data. The prevalence of UDT, surgery rates, age at surgery, postsurgical outcomes, and risk factors for surgery performed later than the recommended age were evaluated.

Results

There were 10875 (2.1%) boys with a recorded diagnosis of UDT. Corrective surgery was performed in 4980 (45.8%), representing a cumulative prevalence of 9.6 per 1000 male births. Five percent of surgeries were orchidectomies, and 9% of boys had revision surgery. Median age at surgery was 16.6 months (interquartile range 11.8 to 31.0 months), decreasing from 21 months for boys born in 2001 to 13 months for boys born in 2010. Among those boys having surgery before 36 months (n = 3897), 67% had corrective surgery after the recommended 12 months of age; socioeconomic disadvantage, regional/remote area of residence, and lack of private health insurance were risk factors for having corrective surgery after 12 months.

Conclusions

One in 50 boys born are diagnosed with UDT; two-thirds had no report of corrective surgery. The age at surgery is decreasing; however, two-thirds of surgeries are performed after 12 months of age.

### Factors associated with delay in undescended testis referral [^112FmEpb]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Undescended testis (UDT) is one of the most common congenital disorders and is associated with infertility and testicular cancer. Multiple guidelines internationally have recommended orchiopexy by 18 months. Multiple large retrospective studies published in the last decade have found persistent delay in timing of orchiopexy.

Objective

The aim of the study was to determine timing at which UDTs are referred at the tertiary pediatric hospital and assess factors that are associated with delay in UDT referral.

Study Design

Based on clinical observations and previous data, a series of clinical and socio-economic variables were constructed to design a prospective database. All patients who underwent orchiopexy for UDT from March 1, 2017, to August 31, 2018, were reviewed for demographic and clinical data. Referral appointments after 18 months were considered delayed. Factors associated with delay in UDT referral were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis with logistic regression.

Results

One hundred seventy-eight patients underwent orchiopexy for UDT. The median age was 44 months, and 64% of them had delay in referral. On univariate analysis, normal birth testicular examination, diagnosis of 'retractile testicle', long gap without seeing pediatrician, diagnosis by a new physician, and primary language non-English were associated with delayed UDT referral. On multivariate analysis, delayed referral was associated with normal testicular examination at birth, history of 'retractile testis', diagnosis not by the regular primary care provider, and other health or social issues that may have led to delay.

Discussion

This is the first prospective study analyzing timing of referral for boys with cryptorchidism. It was found that timing of treatment of UDT with orchiopexy has not improved over the last decade. Major causes in delay in referral may be due to poor of education of families and lack of routine testicular examinations by referring providers. Secondary ascent may account a significant number of delayed orchiopexy cases.

Conclusion

Most patients at Doernbecher had delayed referral of cryptorchidism. Factors associated with delay were determined. To improve treatment of cryptorchidism, quality-based interventions and the importance of education and routine testicular examinations need to be focused on.

### Society for endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^113x9aph]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Partial gonadal (testicular) dysgenesis can present with a spectrum of phenotypes ranging from clitoromegaly, to ambiguous genitalia or severe hypospadias. Müllerian structures may or may not be present, and testes of variable size and architecture are present along the path of descent. The biochemical profile is similar to complete gonadal dysgenesis, but generally less severe. If mild degrees of clitoromegaly in infancy are overlooked, a 46, XY child with partial gonadal dysgenesis may first present at puberty with progressive androgenization. Genetic analysis and associated features may be useful in defining the molecular aetiology of some forms of gonadal dysgenesis. 67 This group of conditions are also associated with a risk of tumour development, which may be related to the extent of androgenization of the external genitalia in the XY child. 68

### Undescended testis: 513 patients' characteristics, age at orchidopexy and patterns of referral [^116Deoaq]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Undescended testis (UDT) affects 1–6% of males. Current recommendations are to correct maldescent by 1 year of age. We identify the population characteristics of children referred and managed for UDT, age at referral and orchidopexy, and patterns of referral.

Design, Setting and Patients

Retrospective 5-year review of all patients operated for UDT from 2007 to 2011 in our institution. Patient demographics, neonatal diagnosis of UDT, age at referral, referral source and age at first orchidopexy were recorded. Data are reported as median (range).

Results

There were 513 boys with 576 undescended gonads; 450 (88%) had unilateral UDT. Congenital (present at birth) UDT was diagnosed in 287 (56%) children. Seventy-nine (15%) were premature births, 41 (8%) had associated major genitourinary abnormalities. Median age at referral was 1.1 (0–16.2) years; median age at first orchidopexy was 1.6 (0–17.2) years. When corrected for age, those with a history of prematurity and associated major genitourinary malformations were referred and operated on earlier. There was no difference in age at referral and orchidopexy when comparing unilateral versus bilateral maldescent, and palpability of UDT. Of those with congenital UDT, 70% were operated at beyond 1 year of age. Those referred from public tertiary hospitals were younger than those referred from community clinics (p < 0.0001) and private healthcare institutions (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Despite early diagnosis in many patients with UDT, most are referred and operated after 1 year of age, even in congenital UDT. Premature babies, those with major genitourinary anomalies, and those seen in public tertiary hospitals are referred earlier. Community health initiatives must emphasise prompt referral to allay the impact of delayed surgery.

### Timely orchiopexy by 18 months of age: are we meeting the standards defined by the 2014 AUA guidelines? [^113BoMkf]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cryptorchidism is one of the most common reasons for pediatric urology referral and one of the few pediatric urologic conditions in which there are established AUA guidelines that recommend orchiopexy be performed before 18 months of age. While access to timely orchiopexy has been studied previously, there is no current study with data from a national clinical database evaluating timely orchiopexy after the AUA guidelines were published. Additionally, prior studies on delayed orchiopexy may have included patients with an ascended testis, which is a distinct population from those with true undescended testicles.

Objectives

To evaluate in a national, clinical database if timely orchiopexy improved after the AUA guidelines were published in 2014. In particular, we aim to evaluate a younger group of patients, 0–5 years of age, in an effort to account for potential ascending testes.

Study Design

Using Cerner Real-World Data™, a national, de-identified database of 153 million individuals, we analyzed pediatric patients undergoing orchiopexy in the United States from 2000 to 2021. We included males 0–18 years old and further focused on the subset 0–5 years. Primary outcome was timely orchiopexy, defined as age at orchiopexy less than 18 months. Predictor variables included race, ethnicity and insurance status. Statistical analyses were performed using logistic regression.

Results

Of the total 17,012 individuals identified as undergoing orchiopexy, 9274 were ages 0–5 at the time of surgery. Comparing time periods pre and post AUA guidelines (2000–2014 versus 2015–2021), we found a significant difference in the proportion of timely orchiopexy (51% versus 56%, respectively; p < 0.0001) (Figure). In multivariable analyses, Hispanic (OR = 0.65, p < 0.0001), African American (OR = 0.74, p < 0.0001), and Native American males (OR = 0.66, p = 0.008) were less likely to have timely orchiopexy compared to non-Hispanic White males. Individuals without insurance (OR = 0.81, p = 0.03) or with public insurance (OR = 0.88, p = 0.02) were less likely to have timely orchiopexy as compared to those with private insurance.

Conclusions

Nearly a decade after publication of the AUA cryptorchidism guidelines, a large proportion of patients are still not undergoing orchiopexy by 18 months of age. This is the first study to show that timely orchiopexy has improved among patients 0–5 years, but the majority of patients are still not undergoing timely orchiopexy. Health disparities were apparent among Hispanic, African American, Native American, and uninsured males, highlighting the need for further progress in access to pediatric surgical care.

### Assessment of prior well child checks in children with concerns for testicular position: opportunities for early referral from an integrated health system [^114XYSkK]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess, through an integrated primary and specialty care pediatric health system, the association of well-child checks prior to referral with final urological diagnosis with the aim to identify opportunities for earlier referral of care.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of children referred from primary care to urology for undescended testis (UDT) within our integrated primary-specialty care health system in 2019, comparing children who had undescended testicles to those with either normal or retractile testicles based on the final urology examination. Demographics, including age, comorbidities, and the status of prior well-child check (WCC) within primary care, were reviewed. Outcomes of age at referral and surgical intervention for UDT were compared across referral categories.

Results

Stratifying by final diagnosis of 88 children included in the analysis, children with UDT were referred much later (85months, interquartile ranges 31–113) than children without UDT on final diagnosis (33months, interquartile ranges 15–74, P = 0.002). Furthermore, children with UDTs had a greater proportion with prior abnormal WCCs (N = 21/41, 51%) than those without UDT (N = 8/47, 17%) (P < .001).

Conclusion

Children with prior abnormal WCCs were more likely to have a final diagnosis of UDT, with prior abnormalities being documented approximately 12months prior to referral, indicating opportunities for improved referral patterns to urology.

### Age at orchidopexy in the UK: has new evidence changed practice? [^1165DNF8]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Research suggesting progressive deterioration in an undescended testis has led to the reduction in the target age for orchidopexy to 6–12 months of age. This age was selected as normal testicular descent is unlikely after 3 months of age and it is timed to prevent early gonadocyte developmental delay as suggested by Hutson and Hasthorpe. This study aims to determine the current age at orchidopexy in one UK training centre and whether changing targets have altered practice.

Methods

The demographics of orchidopexies performed at a single unit between 1998 and 2011 were reviewed.

Results

A total of 1325 orchidopexies were performed over 13 years. The median age at orchidopexy fell between 1998 and 2011. There was an initial drop in the age for orchidopexy in 2000 corresponding with the change in target age to "less than 18 months". However, no subsequent improvement was seen over the following decade.

Discussion

Early orchidopexy is not being achieved. We have identified how slowly such advice is implemented locally and recognise the national need to address this. The approach should include earlier primary care referral directly from the routine postnatal check to a centre prepared to undertake surgery in this age group.

Results

Timing of orchidopexy in patients with undescended testis

Table 2 and Fig. 1 show the age distribution of all boys that received orchidopexy because of UDT between 2003 and 2012 (n = 3587). 41% of the patients were older than 4 years. From 2003 to 2008 4% were operated before age 1 and 22% before the age of 2. After the guideline recommendation was modified (including one year tolerance) only 5% were operated in their first year of life and 27% before the age of 2. Respective 95-% confidence intervals were [−3%; +1%; corresponding Fisher p = .209] for the incidence difference of children operated in their first year of life and [−13%; −5%; corresponding Fisher p < .001] for the first two years of life. Figure 2 demonstrates the age distribution at the time of orchidopexy of all cases from 1 to 17 years of age before and after change of the guideline recommendation, respectively. Taking into consideration only boys aged 4 years and younger, only 8% received orchidopexy in the first year of life from 2003 to 2008 and 9% from 2010 to 2012.

While an average of 266 total cases have been operated each year between 2003 and 2008 (n = 1598) in all analyzed hospitals, that number rose to 518 cases per year between 2010 and 2012 (n = 1553). There has been a decrease in the general population number in Germany from 82,5 million inhabitants in 2003 to 80,5 million in 2012 and an increase in the incidence of orchidopexies in the analyzed hospitals from 3,2/1.000.000 to 6,4/1.000.000 (data not shown).

### Referrals for cryptorchidism: analyzing for quality from a pre-COVID dataset [^112338wC]. Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify risk factors associated with an inaccurate diagnosis, delayed referral, and/or inappropriate ultrasound in consecutive referrals for an undescended testicle (UDT).

Methods

This study was approved by the institutional review board. Data was prospectively collected for all children referred to University of Oklahoma's pediatric urology service from August 2019 to February 2020. The data was imported into SAS vs 9.4 for analysis. We categorized the "quality" of referral by a point system using 3 factors (no previous ultrasound, ≤ 18 months, correct location). An optimal referral had an accurate testicular examination, was referred by 18 months of age, and no diagnostic ultrasound.

Results

We collected 75 referrals. Thirty-nine (52.0%) had confirmed UDT, requiring surgery. Twenty-seven (69.2%) had an accurate initial examination. Forty-one (54.7%) were outside the optimal age. Thirty-four were considered low quality (0–1 qualities) and 41 were high quality (2–3 qualities). Seven (9.3%) were optimal (3/3 qualities). Referrals that needed intervention were statistically more likely to be higher quality.

Conclusion

Increased quality of UDT referrals directly correlated with the likelihood for treatment. This study reveals a need for more education on UDT referral in the community. By improving referring provider knowledge and skills, we can minimize unnecessary referrals.

### Society for endocrinology UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development (revised 2015) [^115Wwi6k]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

It is generally accepted that investigations are necessary in those cases where the appearance of the genitalia is so ambiguous that sex assignment is not possible at birth or the appearance is not consistent with any prenatal genetic tests. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of atypical genitalia may be as high as 1 in 300 births, 23 but the birth prevalence of a condition that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as 1 in 5000 births. 24

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. 25 These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS) 26 (Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of less than 11. 26 In boys with atypical genitalia, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. 27 In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed over a decade ago revealed a likely cause in about 30% of cases 28 and based on current reports of genetic analysis in XY DSD, a genetic cause may be identified in about 40% of cases. 29 With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

### Socio-occupational class, region of birth and maternal age: influence on time to detection of cryptorchidism (undescended testes): a Danish nationwide register study [^114JC113]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Maldevelopment of the male reproductive tract is a major determinant of poor fertility later in life. Congenital cryptorchidism (undescended testes) is one such condition. Early treatment may alleviate the adverse effects of cryptorchidism on fertility, and the earlier orchiopexy is performed, the less the effect on future semen quality. Adverse influence on gonadal cell populations in cryptorchid boys has been observed already at 3–6 months of age, and based on current literature, it is recommended that cryptorchidism is treated between 6 and 12 months of age.

Different long-term outcomes of cryptorchidism may arise from genetic, biological and environmental determinants, interacting with social, cultural and economic factors. The Danish health care system is tax-financed and accessible for all Danish citizens. Therefore economic factors related directly to contact and treatment within the health care system would not be expected to significantly influence time to detection. A tax-financed health care system does however not remove all barriers to detection of disease. Time to detection of cryptorchidism might therefore be hypothesized to vary with parental socioeconomic factors such as competing priorities and time restraints, lack of information and knowledge, communication barriers, medical mistrust, health professionals' perception of patients relative to socioeconomic status, and age. Children of parents with low socioeconomic status are less likely to participate in the free preventive child examinations that are offered at the general practitioner until the age of five years. The overall incidence of hospital referrals for cryptorchidism increases after each examination and it has been estimated that testis palpation is performed in 60%-90% of these visits. Non-adherence to routine prophylactic visits in low social classes may be an important reason for a delayed diagnosis and treatment. Furthermore, Danish hospitals (with few exceptions) were owned by the counties, and the treatments as well as the criteria for treatment may vary between counties as may regional differences in distance to hospital care.

Delayed diagnosis and treatment of cryptorchidism may affect male fertility in a life-course perspective. The present study investigates whether social class, maternal age and geographical region influence time to detection and surgical treatment of cryptorchidism. The study was performed in two cohorts, i.e. boys born in 1981 to 1987 or in 1988 to 1994, to investigate potential changes in the influence of social class and geographical region between these two time periods.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^111159m1]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association (AUA) cryptorchidism guideline — definition and locations state that cryptorchidism, or undescended testes (UDT), is defined as failure of a testis to descend into a scrotal position, most commonly referring to a present testis in an extrascrotal position and potentially an absent testis termed vanishing (or vanished). Congenital cryptorchidism refers to testes that are extrascrotal from birth, whereas acquired cryptorchid testes are intrascrotal at birth but later identified in an extrascrotal position. Cryptorchid testes locations include prescrotal (above or at the scrotal inlet), superficial inguinal pouch, external ring (or prepubic), canalicular (within the inguinal canal), ectopic (most commonly perineal), and abdominal.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^113bTugm]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

In the future, we must strive to surgically treat children with congenital UDT much earlier, up to 18 months of age, in order to prevent long-term consequences of untimely treatment. Children with undescended testicles will have to get more priority appointments for surgery. Also, unnecessary referrals to ultrasound should be reduced, except in specific indications that require it. It will certainly be necessary to conduct extensive education and public health intervention for pediatricians and family physicians in order to move the time of referral to an earlier age. We will examine the real reasons for the delay in referral with a questionnaire that we plan to conduct and analyze soon.

Cryptorchidism — DSD assessment with hypospadias or nonpalpable testes (Guideline Statement 7): Providers should assess the possibility of a disorder of sex development (DSD) when there is increasing severity of hypospadias with cryptorchidism (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). A newborn boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes must be evaluated for disorder of sexual development (DSD) and should not be circumcised until after the workup is complete, and a 46 XX individual with severe congenital adrenal hyperplasia can be mistaken for a boy with bilateral nonpalpable testes. The possibility of DSD or other syndromes should be entertained when unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism is present with phallic anomalies, such as hypospadias or micropenis; in these cases, the presence of a nonpalpable gonad or proximal hypospadias significantly increases the risk of DSD, and radiological, genetic and endocrinological evaluations are indicated in cryptorchid males with disorder of sex development.

This case of ectopic testis highlights the importance of a thorough first newborn examination followed by senior review when appropriate, and the expertise required to interpret neonatal ultrasounds. Following a provisional diagnosis of unilateral undescended testicle in a newborn, an ultrasound scan was unable to correctly identify the condition, resulting in a delay in diagnosis. The condition was later recognised incidentally, which led to a successful surgical correction. The early clinical examination and recognition of ectopic testis allows a timely surgical intervention preventing potential complications.

Undescended testis (UDT, cryptorchidism) is the most common congenital anomaly of the genital tract. Despite its high incidence, the management of UDT varies between specialties (urology, pediatric surgery, pediatric urology, pediatric endocrinology). Therefore, as the European Association of Urology - Young Academic Urologists Pediatric Urology Working Group, we requested experts around the world to express their own personal approaches against various case scenarios of UDT in order to explore their individual reasoning. We intended to broaden the perspectives of our colleagues who deal with the treatment of this frequent genital malformation.

### Age at orchiopexy for undescended testis in the United States [^116a1WrN]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the male genitalia. The American Urological Association guidelines recommend orchiopexy by age 18months to ameliorate the risk of subfertility. The study aim was to assess adherence to these guidelines on a national level.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed both the State Ambulatory Surgery Database (SASD) in 2012 and the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) for 2015. All patients aged 18years or less with a diagnosis of UDT who underwent orchiopexy were included. Demographic data including age at repair as well as surgical subspecialty and payer status were extracted.

Results

Analysis of the 2012 SASD for New Jersey, Florida, and Maryland yielded 1654 patients. The majority were white, 791 (48.3%), with a median age at repair of 4years (IQR 1–8). Most patients, 1048 (64%), had orchiopexy later than age 2. A total of 844 males were identified from the PHIS database. Of these, 63% were white. The median age at repair was 5years (IQR 1–9). There were 577 (68%) patients older than 2years at orchiopexy.

Conclusion

Almost 70% of boys with undescended testes in the United States are undergoing orchiopexy at least 6months later than the recommended age.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: guidelines and reality – a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^1147Vkwh]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Primary undescended testis is the most common congenital anomaly of the urogenital system and the most common disorder in pediatric surgery, affecting up to 30% of preterm and 3% of term infants worldwide. A synopsis of nomenclature and possible origins of non-scrotal position of the testis is presented in Table 1. The non-scrotal position of the testis bears a considerable risk for the development of both uni- and contra-lateral testicular malignancy as well as impaired fertility. Testicular decent takes place at two stages under control of insulin-like hormone 3 between 8 and 15 weeks of development and androgens facilitating inguinoscrotal migration afterwards. While plenty of research is dedicated to improve understanding of the morphological complexity involved in the process of testicular descent, the exact cause of cryptorchidism currently remains elusive. Relevant risk factors include prematurity, genetic predisposition, endocrine disorders (e.g. disrupted hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis), small-for-gestational-weight (SGA), birth weight < 2500 g as well as environmental factors (nicotine, alcohol, pesticides). 10% of the cases are bilateral and are commonly associated with complex syndromes or other congenital malformations such as abdominal wall defects or neural tube defects. Spontaneous descent occurs in approximately 70% of the cases, mostly within the first three (to six) months of life. After six months of life therapeutic intervention is indicated, as a spontaneous descent is then unlikely. Hormonal treatments with GnRH monotherapy or in combination with ß-HCG yield success rates of 15–20%. However, secondary re-ascent occurs in approximately 20% of the successfully treated boys and a positive effect of hormonal therapy on the degree of paternity remains to be scientifically proven. Scrotal or inguinal orchidopexy is the surgical treatment of choice in prepubertal boys with palpable, cryptorchid testes. In case of nonpalpable testes an examination under anaesthesia by a surgical specialist is indicated. If the testis remains unpalbable, surgical exploration and laparoscopic abdominal orchidopexy are the treatment of choice. Surgery bears a high success rate and complications occur infrequently (1–3%). In UDT, early orchidopexy has been proven to improve prognosis regarding testicular growth, number of germ cells and the risk for malignant transformation. Recently, experts even suggested surgery to take place as early as within the first three to nine months of life in order to prevent abnormal gonocyte maturation in the affected testis. Neoadjuvant GnRH treatment has been shown to improve the fertility index in prepubertal UDT and is thus thought to improve fertility later in life. A prospective randomized trial published by Spinelli et al. in 2014 reported that patients with UDT and a testicular atrophy index > 20% had a significant increase in testicular volume after 5 years of follow-up when treated with pre- and postoperative GnRHa therapy. Consequently, treatment recommendations for UDT can be assumed to remain dynamically changing in the near future.

### Clinical and gonadal features and early surgical management of 45, X / 46, XY and 45, X / 47, XYY chromosomal mosaicism presenting with genital anomalies [^113ySyiD]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

We performed a retrospective study of a cohort of patients presenting with genital ambiguity and found to have a 45, X/46, XY or 45, X/47, XYY karyotype, managed in the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children between 1988 and 2009. At least one gonadal biopsy or gonadectomy specimen was available for each patient. Each specimen was reviewed and re-classified by a specialist paediatric pathologist (NJS), according to previously published criteria. Definitions are summarized in Table 1. In all cases presence of morphological intratubular germ cell neoplasia was specifically searched for. Data were expressed as median (range).

Our current practice is for all newly referred patients with a possible DSD to be initially assessed and investigated by the endocrine team. Patients are also examined at the same time by a paediatric urologist and input from a clinical psychologist is provided in most cases. Clinical findings and investigation results are then discussed at a multidisciplinary meeting involving endocrinologists, paediatric urologists, geneticists, adolescent urologists and gynaecologists, and clinical psychologists. Management plans and the potential sex of rearing are discussed with the family at all stages of this process. Patients are typically re-admitted for an examination under anaesthetic, cystoscopy and laparoscopy at 2–3 months of age, although in cases where the findings may have a bearing on the sex of rearing, the procedures may need to be performed more urgently, in the first few weeks of life. (Early in the series, laparoscopy was not generally available and hence some of the patients underwent a laparotomy.) In patients raised male, intra-abdominal gonads are biopsied and a laparoscopic first-stage Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy is performed if indicated. Obvious streak gonads are removed laparoscopically. In patients raised male with palpable but undescended gonads, an orchidopexy is performed before 1 year of age. To date, the gonad has not been routinely biopsied, unless it appeared to be abnormal macroscopically. Intrascrotal gonads are not normally biopsied. Hypospadias repair is performed at 1–2 years of age. In patients raised female, both gonads are typically removed. Appropriateness and timing of reconstructive surgery in female patients depends on a number of factors. All gonads excised or biopsied are routinely submitted for histological evaluation. Specimens were assessed for standard morphological features of intratubular germ cell neoplasia with placental-like alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) immunostaining on all cases with seminiferous tubules present, using standard avidin-biotin procedure on a diagnostic automated LEICA bond immunostainer (Novocastra PLAP clone 8A9).

### Identifying and addressing training deficiencies in the examination of cryptorchidism-a quality improvement study [^114283dD]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate and timely diagnosis of cryptorchidism by primary care providers (PCPs) is critical to oncologic and fertility outcomes. Physical exam is the mainstay of diagnosis, but little is known about PCPs' skills in examining cryptorchid patients. Patients referred to surgeons for cryptorchidism often have normal or retractile testes on exam, and delayed or missed diagnosis of cryptorchidism may contribute to advanced age at surgical intervention. Previous studies on cryptorchidism have not investigated the baseline training, confidence, and/or exam skills of providers.

Objective

The authors aimed to define baseline training and provider confidence in the exam of cryptorchid patients and to improve examiner confidence using bedside teaching with a pediatric urologist. Secondarily, baseline training and confidence were correlated to skill.

Study Design

Medical students, family medicine, pediatrics, and urology residents, and pediatric attendings completed surveys on baseline training and self-reported confidence in the examination of cryptorchid patients at an academic institution from 2017 to 2018. N.G.K. (pediatric urologist) proctored examinations of cryptorchid patients and provided standardized grades and individualized feedback. Surveys were readministered after 3 months. Non-parametric comparison tests were performed to determine intervention effect and compare subgroups.

Results

Ninety-two respondents participated. 62% reported little to no formal training on the scrotal exam, 50% were self-taught, and 20% defined undescended testis incorrectly. Confidence increased with level of training, comparing attendings to residents to students (P < 0.001). Those who learned from a mentor had higher baseline confidence than those who did not (P < 0.01). Baseline confidence and amount of formal training positively correlated with exam skill as graded during proctored sessions (n = 59, P < 0.01). Provider confidence was higher after proctored exams (Fig. 2, n = 32, P < 0.0001).

Discussion

Significant training deficiencies exist in the examination of cryptorchid patients. A single proctored exam with a pediatric urologist can improve provider confidence and may improve exam skills. A rotation with pediatric urology, including proctored exams of cryptorchid patients, has become standard practice for pediatric trainees at the authors institution as a result of this study.

Conclusions

While further studies are required to assess the effectiveness of bedside teaching and its impact on accurate and timely diagnosis of cryptorchidism, implementation of the authors quality improvement recommendations at other teaching institutions would help address training deficiencies in the examination of cryptorchid patients.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116SGYLn]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism — purpose and therapeutic context — defines undescended testis (UDT) as a common pediatric condition and states treatment aims and current therapy. It notes that cryptorchidism is "one of the most common pediatric disorders of the male endocrine glands and the most common genital disorder identified at birth", that "the main reasons for treatment of cryptorchidism include reducing the risks of impairment of fertility potential, testicular malignancy, torsion and/or associated inguinal hernia", and that "the current standard of therapy in the United States is orchidopexy (also referred to as orchiopexy in the literature), or surgical repositioning of the testis within the scrotal sac; while hormonal therapy has fewer advocates". It cautions that "successful scrotal relocation of the testis, however, may reduce but does not prevent all of these potential long-term sequelae in susceptible individuals".

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^112SDU3W]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Undescended testes (UDT) is the most common congenital anomaly of the male genitourinary tract. In patients with UDT, testes can most often stop in the abdominal cavity or in the inguinal canal on their way. Congenital UDT occurs predominantly unilaterally in preterm infants. Most testes that do not descend at birth will complete the descent within the first 3 months of life, while spontaneous descent after the sixth month is extremely rare. After a series of studies reporting the negative effects of such laid testes, the recommendation from some associations is that treatment should begin as early as 6 months and end no later than 18 months. Acquired UDT occurred in a group of boys whose testes are palpable in the scrotum and can be observed during neonatal and infant life, but will ascend over time. In this group of boys, it is important to note that orchidopexy before puberty can significantly reduce the risk of testicular cancer. Due to low success rates, there are fewer and fewer proponents of hormone therapy. Since hormonal treatment can improve fertility indices, it is recommended as an additional tool in addition to orchidopexy, especially in boys who have UDT on both sides. The most common technique with a high success rate is Dartos pouch technique. For non-palpable intra-abdominal testes, the simplest and most accurate way of locating is diagnostic laparoscopy, after which Fowler-Stephens orchiopexy is most often used for testicular locating, but there are other techniques currently available that have not been used in our hospital. The severity of the outcome of untreated UDT, especially infertility and cancer, requires early referral of such boys for definitive treatment.

### Further evidence for spontaneous descent of acquired undescended testes [^115hPixB]. The Journal of Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

It is still controversial whether acquired undescended testis can best be managed by orchiopexy or by the wait and see method. We prospectively evaluated spontaneous descent of acquired undescended testes and possible predictive factors in prepubertal boys.

Materials and Methods

From 1982 to 2004 spontaneous descent was awaited until at least Tanner stage P2G2 in 109 boys with a total of 83 unilateral and 52 bilateral acquired undescended testes. Annually we established testis position and size. After Tanner stage P2G2 orchiopexy was done for all testes in an unstable scrotal position.

Results

Two boys (3 acquired undescended testes) were excluded from analysis. Of 132 acquired undescended testes 75 descended spontaneously (57%, 95% CI 48–65), including 40 of 75 (57%) in early puberty or before puberty and 32 of 75 (43%) in mid puberty. Orchiopexy was performed in 57 of 132 acquired undescended testes (43%). Acquired undescended testes showed an increasing chance of descending spontaneously with increasing age (p trend = 0.002). In 63 of 82 unilateral undescended testes we were able to compare testis volume at the onset of puberty with that of the healthy contralateral side. Of 17 testes that needed orchiopexy 12 (71%) had a volume that was more than 1 mL smaller than the healthy testis. This was noted in only 18 of 46 spontaneously descended acquired undescended testes (39%, p = 0.053). Other factors, such as the most caudal testicular position at referral or the frequency of confirmed descended testicular position before referral, were not predictive of spontaneous descent.

Conclusions

A conservative wait and see approach to acquired undescended testis until puberty could prevent more than half of the boys from undergoing orchiopexy and it does not seem detrimental in terms of testicular volume.

### Mini-puberty, physiological and disordered: consequences, and potential for therapeutic replacement [^112dqz3h]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical Management of Undescended Testes

Orchidopexy, a surgical procedure whereby UDT are moved and surgically fixed in the scrotum, with or without pretreatment with short-term hCG or nasal GnRH, has been the recommended treatment modality for UDT, including in those with CHH. Current therapeutic standards in Europe are inconsistent, but most recommendations aim at normalizing the position of the testes during the second half of the first year of life. The Consensus Statement of the European consortium studying GnRH biology recommends surgical correction of cryptorchidism between age 6 and 12 months.

In summary, the current standard of care for neonatal UDT does not consider the underlying pathophysiology. The timing of therapy and duration of GnRH nasal spray therapy is insufficient to mimic mini-puberty, and the protocols using hCG injections lack FSH and are also given for only 3 weeks. Current treatment strategies with hormones (nasal GnRH for 4 weeks or weekly intramuscular injections of hCG for 3 weeks) are successful in promoting testicular descent in 20% to 25% of patients; however, reascension rates of 25% of these lead to a final success rate of only 15%. Surgical orchidopexy has a success rate of around 90% and is therefore the preferred first-line treatment in many countries. However, this may potentially cause trauma to the testes and in some cases (∼2%), testicular atrophy. This risk of atrophy is highest in male infants with an intra-abdominal position of the testes. A key difference between orchidopexy in CHH vs isolated cryptorchidism is the nature of the short spermatic cord, which thereby requires greater surgical mobilization. In those with bilateral cryptorchidism due to CHH, surgery alone is also not enough to increase the potential for fertility.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^115b1yDV]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Statement 10.9 — intersex variations and timing of surgery — We suggest health care professionals counsel parents and children with intersexuality (when cognitively sufficiently developed) to delay gender-affirming genital surgery, gonadal surgery, or both, so as to optimize the children's self-determination and ability to participate in the decision based on informed consent. However, it is important to note some anatomic variations, such as obstruction of urinary flow or exposure of pelvic organs, pose an imminent risk to physical health. Others, such as menstrual obstruction or long-term malignancy risk in undescended testes, have eventual physical consequences. A third group of variations, i.e., variations in the appearance of external genitals or vaginal depth, pose no immediate or long-term physical risk. The above recommendation addresses only those anatomic variations that, if left untreated, have no immediate adverse physical consequences and where delaying surgical treatment poses no physical health risk.

### Referral patterns for undescended testis: a 7 year comparative analysis of primary care providers [^114fqzM8]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cryptorchidism, or undescended testis (UDT), is identified in 1% of boys by one year of age and carries long term risks of infertility and testicular neoplasia. In 2014, the American Urological Association (AUA) released a guideline statement stating that patients with UDT should be referred to a urologist by 6 months of age in order to facilitate timely surgical correction. This study is the follow-up to a 2010 study assessing referral patterns to our university center from primary care providers.

Objective

In this new study, we aim to identify changes in referral patterns in response to the establishment of the 2014 AUA guidelines and to understand how our referring physicians stay abreast of current knowledge regarding UDT.

Study Design

A 9 question anonymous survey regarding UDT referral patterns was sent to providers who had previously referred a patient to our pediatric urology practice. The results were categorized by specialty and were compared to the similar survey from 2010.

Results

Surveys were sent to 500 physicians with 138 (27.6%) responses received. Less than half of respondents reported that they would refer a boy with unilateral or bilateral palpable UDT by 6 months of age (37.0% and 38.4% respectively). This was not significantly different than the 2010 survey (p = 0.68 and 0.27 respectively). Two-thirds of physicians would refer a patient with unilateral nonpalpable UDT within the recommended time frame (68.8%); this was also unchanged from 2010 (p = 0.87). There was an improvement in respondents who would refer immediately for bilateral nonpalpable testes from 49.8% in 2010 to 53.6% in 2017 (p = 0.01). Residency training was most commonly cited as the primary source of knowledge regarding UDT although 89.3% of respondents citing this were > 5 years removed from residency training.

Discussion

Delayed referral patterns were reported by the majority of providers for palpable UDT and by greater than one-third of providers for nonpalpable UDT. There was minimal change in referral patterns between 2010 and 2017 despite the release of the AUA cryptorchidism guidelines in 2014. In both 2010 and 2017, residency training was identified as the primary source of knowledge regarding management of UDT.

Conclusion

These findings suggest an unmet need for education regarding contemporary management of UDT for the primary care physicians in our community.

### Due to testicular cancer… [^111JHMyu]. Wikipedia (2004). Low credibility.

Monorchism is the state of having only one testicle within the scrotum. Terminology An individual having monorchism can be referred to as monorchid. Causes This can be due to one testicle:

- Not descending into the scrotum during normal embryonic or fetal development, also known as undescended testis or cryptorchidism. In this case the testis is within the abdominal cavity, somewhere along the normal route of descent – most commonly, within the inguinal canal. Such a testis has an increased risk of malignancy.
- Disappearing during development due to some intrauterine insult. This is thought to be most likely vascular, such as testicular torsion.
- Not being created in the first place, known as congenital monorchism.
- Being surgically removed through orchiectomy.

### Guideline implementation for the treatment of undescended testes: still room for improvement [^1158KMmS]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Early orchidopexy (OP) around the age of 1 year is recommended in boys with congenital undescended testis (UDT) worldwide since decades. Former retrospectives studies did not distinguish congenital from acquired UDT with a consecutive negative bias concerning the age at surgery.

Methods

In a retrospective analysis, data of all boys who underwent OP in eight pediatric surgery institutions from 2009 to 2015 were analyzed. Congenital or acquired UDT were differentiated. Patients were categorized into 3 groups of age at surgery: (1) < 12 months, (2) 12–24 months, (3) > 24 months. Data of one institution were analyzed in detail: exact age of first referral, exact age at surgery, intraoperative findings.

Results

Out of 4448 boys, 3270 boys had congenital UDT. In 81% (2656 cases) surgery was performed beyond the age of 1 year, in 54.4% (1780) beyond the age of 2 years. chi-Square statistics showed a higher rate of early operations in hospitals compared to outpatient services and in Germany compared to Switzerland. In 694 congenital detailed cases, median age at referral was 13 months [range 0–196], median age at surgery was 15 months [range 0–202].

Conclusion

Delayed referral is the main reason for guideline non-conform delayed surgery in UDT.

### Use of ultrasound in the evaluation of cryptorchidism: a single-institution analysis [^113FNrZf]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The American Urological Association guidelines recommend against the performance of ultrasound and other imaging modalities in the evaluation of patients with cryptorchidism before expert consultation. We aimed to examine our institutional experience with cryptorchidism and measure adherence to currently available guidelines.

Methods

An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of ultrasound utilization in the evaluation of patients with cryptorchidism was performed from June 1, 2016, to June 30, 2019, at a single tertiary level pediatric hospital.

Results

We identified 1796 patients evaluated in surgical clinics for cryptorchidism. Surgical intervention was performed in 75.2% (n = 1351) of the entire cohort. Ultrasound was performed in 42% (n = 754), most of which were ordered by referring physicians (91% n = 686). Of those who received an ultrasound, surgical intervention was performed in 78% (n = 588). Those 166 patients (22%) who did not undergo surgical intervention were referred with ultrasounds suggesting inguinal testes; however, all had normal physical examinations or mildly retractile testes at the time of consultation and were discharged from the outpatient clinic. There were 597 patients referred without an ultrasound, 81% (n = 483) were confirmed to have cryptorchidism at the time of specialist physical examination and underwent definitive surgical intervention, the remainder (19%, n = 114) were discharged from the outpatient clinics.

Conclusions

Ultrasound evaluation of cryptorchidism continues despite high-quality evidence-based guidelines that recommend otherwise, as they should have little to no bearing on the surgeon's decision to operate or the type of operation. Instead, physical examination findings should guide surgical planning.

Cryptorchidism — testicular descent timing and epidemiology by gestational age: At approximately 22–25 weeks of gestation, the testes are located at the internal ring, and the inguinoscrotal phase occurs between 25–30 weeks; the prevalence of cryptorchidism is 1–3% in full-term and 15–30% in premature male infants, descent is unlikely after six months of corrected age, and the prevalence in infants < 900 g is approximately 100%; obtaining gestational age is thus critical to timely surgical referral for persistent undescended testes.

### Management of cryptorchidism: a survey of clinical practice in Italy [^113oHmfD]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Undescended testicle (UT) is present at birth with a frequency varying from 2% to 8%: in Italy the estimated prevalence is 3.5% in term babies. UT includes both a non-palpable testis and a palpable supra-scrotal testis which cannot be pulled down to the scrotum or does not remain there by six months of age. UT should be differed from retractile testis (RT), a condition where the testis is palpable in the supra-scrotal region but, once pulled down to the scrotum, remains there after the exhaustion of the cremasteric activity. In this case RT should not be treated. Differential diagnosis between a true RT and a supra-scrotal UT may not be easy.

The difficulty in achieving consensus on UT management depends largely on the long follow-up from diagnosis until the attainment of full testicular function in adulthood. An up-to-date evidence-based Consensus on the treatment of UT has been published with the following recommendations: a) hormones are not recommended; b) orchidopexy should be performed between 6 and 12 months of age, or upon diagnosis, if it occurs later; c) orchidopexy should be performed at centres with both paediatric surgeons or urologists and paediatric anaesthesiologists. These recommendations, in line with those by Swiss surgeons, are important in order to avoid adulthood consequences of UT, such as azoospermia or oligospermia, endocrine insufficiency and possible tumoral degeneration.

Retractile testis (RT) may be more difficult to diagnose. According to the Consensus, RT should not undergo surgery but should be followed-up once yearly given the possible risk of reascent.

In Italy, current practices on UT management are little known and they appear to be heterogeneous. We hypothesised a non-adherence to the Nordic Consensus guidelines, with a delay in orchidopexy. We carried out a retrospective observational study among Italian Family Paediatricians (FP) on a cohort of children with UT in order to describe the current management of cryptorchidism in Italy, before the Consensus publication. Since the differential diagnosis between UT and RT can be problematic, we decided to describe the management of RT cases separately.

### Trends in the treatment of undescended testes: a pediatric tertiary care center experience from Croatia [^116p4SR7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population and selection

The present research was conducted at the Children's Hospital Zagreb, the largest pediatric tertiary center for the treatment of children in Croatia. The total number of children aged 0–18 living in the area under the jurisdiction of our hospital is 300 000. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients undergoing orchidopexy in 2019 (from January 1 to December 31, prepandemic year) by searching the hospital information system (IN2 BIS) of our institution. The information system was searched according to the following International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes: Q53.1 (undescended testicle, unilateral), Q53.2 (undescended testicle, bilateral), and Q53.9 (undescended testicle, unspecified). This study included all patients who underwent orchidopexy due to congenital or acquired, unilateral or bilateral UDT. Patients who underwent orchidopexy due to ectopic testis or had testicular agenesis were excluded from the study.

Study variables and outcomes

The primary outcome of this research was to determine the cumulative number of orchidopexy in 2019 and the distribution of orchidopexy performed on congenital and acquired UDT. For each group, the number of right-sided, left-sided and bilateral UDT, and in how many cases ultrasound was initiated preoperatively was determined separately. Depending on the position of the testes, the number of abdominal and inguinal testes was determined. In addition, we analyzed how many patients had inguinal hernia or hydrocele and how many children were born at term or prematurely. Finally, we determined from whom the patients were referred to the pediatric surgeon and the relevant associated anomalies.

The secondary outcome was to determine the method of surgical treatment (Dartos pouch technique or laparoscopic Stephen-Fowler procedure) and the number of necessary reoperations in relation to the initial position and side of the UDT.

The third and main outcome was to determine the age of the boys' referral at our institution, the age at which the boys were examined, and the age of the operative treatment, as well as the time between referral, clinical examination, and the orchidopexy. Regarding the valid consensus, we determined how many patients in the congenital UDT group were operated on before 18 months and how many patients in the acquired UDT group were operated on before 13 years of age, so until puberty.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^116KTB4X]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

Cryptorchidism — Guideline statement 4 (acquired cryptorchidism referral and monitoring) states: Providers should refer boys with the possibility of newly diagnosed (acquired) cryptorchidism after six months (corrected for gestational age) to an appropriate surgical specialist. (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Acquired cryptorchidism is the ascent of a previously descended testis and subsequent inability to manipulate the testis back into the scrotum. The prevalence of acquired cryptorchidism is 1–7% and peaks around 8 years of age. Given the potential ascent of previously descended testes, a scrotal examination should be performed at every well-child check.

### Mapping of referral patterns for undescended testes-risk factors for referral of children with normal testes [^1139T6rc]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Accurate referral of boys with suspected undescended testes (UDT) is of importance to preserve fertility and reduce risk of future testicular cancer. While late referral is well studied, there is less knowledge about incorrect referrals, hence, referral of boys with normal testes.

Objective

To evaluate the proportion of UDT referrals that did not lead to surgery or follow-up, and to assess risk factors for referral of boys with normal testes.

Study Design

All UDT referrals to a tertiary center of pediatric surgery during 2019–2020 were retrospectively assessed. Only children with suspected UDT in the referral (not suspected retractile testicles) were included. Primary outcome was normal testes at examination by a pediatric urologist. Independent variables were age, season, region of residence, referring care unit, referrer's educational level, referrer's findings, and ultrasound result. Risk factors for not needing surgery/follow-up were assessed with logistic regression and presented as adjusted odds ratios with a 95% confidence interval (aOR, [95% CI]).

Results

A total of 378 out of 740 included boys (51.1%) had normal testes. Patients > 4 years (aOR 0,53, 95% CI [0,30–0,94]), referrals from pediatric clinics (aOR 0.27, 95% CI [0.14–0.51]) or surgery clinics (aOR 0.06, 95% CI [0.01–0.38]) had lower risk of normal testes. Boys referred during spring (aOR 1.80, 95% CI [1.06–3.05]), by a non-specialist physician (aOR 1.58, 95% CI [1.01–2.48]) or referrer's description of bilateral UDT (aOR 2.34, 95% CI [1.58–3.45]), or retractile testes (aOR 6.99, 95% CI [3.61–13.55]) had higher risk of not needing surgery/follow-up. None of the referred boys that had normal testes had been re-admitted at the end of this study (October 2022).

Discussion

Over 50% of boys referred for UDT had normal testes. This is higher or equal to previous reports. Efforts to reduce this rate should in our setting probably be directed towards well-child centers and training in examination of testicles. The main limitation of this study is the retrospective design and the rather short follow-up time, which however should have very modest effect on the main findings.

Conclusion

Over 50% of boys referred for UDT have normal testes. A national survey regarding the management and examination of boys testicles has been launched and directed at well-child centers to further evaluate the findings of the current study.

### Evaluation and treatment of cryptorchidism: AUA guideline [^112Soz9F]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

American Urological Association cryptorchidism — treatment guidance states that providers should not use hormonal therapy to induce testicular descent as evidence shows low response rates and lack of evidence for long-term efficacy (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). In the absence of spontaneous testicular descent by six months (corrected for gestational age), specialists should perform surgery within the next year (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). In prepubertal boys with palpable, cryptorchid testes, surgical specialists should perform scrotal or inguinal orchidopexy (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). In prepubertal boys with nonpalpable testes, surgical specialists should perform examination under anesthesia to reassess for palpability of testes, and if nonpalpable, surgical exploration and, if indicated, abdominal orchidopexy should be performed (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). At the time of exploration for a nonpalpable testis in boys, surgical specialists should identify the status of the testicular vessels to help determine the next course of action (Clinical Principle). In boys with a normal contralateral testis, surgical specialists may perform an orchiectomy (removal of the undescended testis) if there are either very short testicular vessels and vas deferens, dysmorphic or very hypoplastic testis, or postpubertal age (Clinical Principle). Providers should counsel boys with a history of cryptorchidism and/or monorchidism and their parents regarding potential long-term risks and provide education on infertility and cancer risk (Clinical Principle).

### Cryptorchidism… [^115jjgUc]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Cryptorchidism, also known as undescended testis, is the failure of one or both testicles to descend into the scrotum. The word is from Ancient Greek κρυπτός 'hidden' and ὄρχις 'testicle'. It is the most common birth defect of the male genital tract. About 3% of full-term and 30% of premature infant boys are born with at least one undescended testis. However, about 80% of cryptorchid testes descend by the first year of life, making the true incidence of cryptorchidism around 1% overall. Cryptorchidism may develop after infancy, sometimes as late as young adulthood, but that is exceptional.
4. Undeveloped or severely abnormal
5. Missing. About two-thirds of cases without other abnormalities are unilateral; most of the other third involve both testes. In 90% of cases, an undescended testis can be felt in the inguinal canal.

In a small minority of cases, missing testes may be found in the abdomen or appear to be nonexistent. Undescended testes are associated with reduced fertility, increased risk of testicular germ-cell tumors, and psychological problems when fully-grown. Undescended testes are also more susceptible to testicular torsion and inguinal hernias. Without intervention, an undescended testicle will usually descend during the first year of life, but to reduce these risks, undescended testes can be brought into the scrotum in infancy by a surgical procedure called an orchiopexy. Although cryptorchidism nearly always refers to congenital absence or maldescent, a testis observed in the scrotum in early infancy can occasionally "reascend" into the inguinal canal. A testis that can readily move or be moved between the scrotum and canal is referred to as retractile.

Cryptorchidism, hypospadias, testicular cancer, and poor semen quality make up the syndrome known as testicular dysgenesis syndrome. Signs and symptoms Infertility Many men who were born with undescended testes have reduced fertility, even after orchiopexy in infancy. The reduction with unilateral cryptorchidism is subtle, with a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported by the same study for the general population of adult men. Cancer risk One of the strongest arguments for early orchiopexy is reducing the risk of testicular cancer. About one in 500 men born with one or both testes undescended develop testicular cancer, roughly a four- to 40-fold increased risk. The peak incidence occurs in the third and fourth decades of life.

The risk is higher for intra-abdominal testes and somewhat lower for inguinal testes, but even the normally descended testis of a man whose other testis was undescended has about a 20% higher cancer risk than those of other men. The most common type of testicular cancer occurring in undescended testes is seminoma. It is usually treatable if caught early, so urologists often recommend that boys who had orchiopexy as infants be taught testicular self-examination, to recognize testicular masses and seek early medical care for them. Cancer developing in an intra-abdominal testis would be unlikely to be recognized before considerable growth and spread, and one of the advantages of orchiopexy is that a mass developing in a scrotal testis is far easier to recognize than an intra-abdominal mass.

### Operative management of cryptorchidism: guidelines and reality – a 10-year observational analysis of 3587 cases [^116XEzR9]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Undescended testis (UDT) is the most common disorder in pediatric surgery and one of the most important risk factors for malignancy and subfertility. In 2009 local guidelines were modified and now recommend treatment to be completed by the age of 1. Aim of this study was to analyze age distribution at the time of orchidopexy, whether the procedure is performed according to guideline recommendations and to assess primary care pediatricians' attitude regarding their treatment approach.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 3587 patients with UDT regarding age at orchidopexy between 2003 and 2012 in 13 German hospitals. Furthermore, we conducted an anonymized nation-wide survey among primary care pediatricians regarding their attitude toward management of UDT.

Results

Before modification of the guideline 78% (n = 1245) of the boys with UDT were not operated according to guideline recommendations. After the modification that number rose to 95% (n = 1472). 42% of the orchidopexies were performed on patients aged 4 to 17 years. 46% of the primary care pediatricians were not aware of this discrepancy and 38% would only initiate operative management after the first year of life. In hospitals with pediatric surgery departments significantly more patients received orchidopexy in their first year of life (p < .001).

Conclusion

The guideline for UDT in Germany has not yet been implemented sufficiently. Timing of orchidopexy must be optimized in order to improve long-term prognosis. Both primary care providers and parents should be educated regarding the advantages of early orchidopexy in UDT. Prospective studies are needed to elucidate the high rate of late orchidopexies.

### Educational survey of regional general practitioner's management of paediatric patients with undescended testis [^113ChrsZ]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Recent recommendations have lowered the ideal age of surgery for undescended testis (UDT) to 3–6 months of age. However, many publications demonstrate that age at surgery is still above the recommended age of 1 year as originally suggested in 1996.

Aim

Through a web-based educational survey, we aimed to combine questions regarding General Practioner's (GPs) management of these patients with educational slides with advice to update them with current recommendations.

Methods

The regional GPs were invited by email and letter to undertake the web-based questionnaire devised using SurveyMonkey(®). Educational slides were shown after each questionnaire slide. Feedback was immediate and a one-page summary was emailed to the GP on completion. A pre- and post-educational intervention audit was undertaken to ascertain the change in age of referral for patients < 5 years of age.

Results

144 (36%) of 401 GPs undertook this survey. 84% were happy assessing infants (< 1year) with UDT. 16% were unhappy discussing management with parents for palpable UDT. 52% were happy discussing malignant risk with parents. 80% thought that ultrasonography was routinely used. Optimal referral time was thought to be 6–12 months (42%) and time of surgery was 1–2 years (50%). 72% would refer a patient with palpable UDT after 6 months of age. Only 41% were happy to assess testicular size at puberty. 98% found this format of an educational survey was helpful. The average age of referral for patients < 5 years improved significantly after educational intervention from 2.8 years in 2010 to 1.25 years in 2013 (p < 0.01).

Discussion

With an interactive survey, we were able assess and also educate the regional GPs with regard to management of paediatric patients with UDT. There is a varied range of knowledge and practice demonstrated which we hoped to standardise and thereby increase efficiency and decrease the age of referral. A large majority would refer patients with UDT after 6 months of age that would make the target of surgery < 6 months unachievable unless they are aware of current recommendations. This study is limited by a 36% response rate but that is comparable to other surveys. Also, referrals come from other sources that were not included. The causal effect of the educational survey is hypothesised.

Conclusion

This educational survey has confirmed the varied management by GPs. The referral age was demonstrated to be reduced after this intervention and this process was widely accepted by GPs that undertook the educational survey.

### Management of undescended testes: European Association of Urology / European Society for Paediatric Urology guidelines [^115zojP6]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Undescended testis is the most common endocrinological disease in the male newborn period. Incidence varies between 1.0% and 4.6% in full-term neonates, with rates as high as 45% in preterm neonates. Failure or delay of treatment can result in reduced fertility and/or increased testicular cancer risk in adulthood.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of boys with undescended testes which reduce the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer in adulthood.

Evidence Acquisition

Embase and Pubmed were searched for all relevant publications, from 1990 to 2015 limited to English language. Data were narratively synthesized in light of methodological and clinical heterogeneity. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed.

Evidence Synthesis

There is consensus that early treatment, by 18 months at the latest, for undescended testes is mandatory to avoid possible sequelae regarding fertility potential and cancer risk. The current standard therapy is orchidopexy, while hormonal therapy is still under debate. However, in some individuals the successful scrotal placement of previously undescended testes may not prevent potential negative long-term outcomes regarding fertility and testicular malignancy.

Conclusions

There is good evidence for early placement of undescended testes in the scrotal position to prevent potential impairment of fertility and reduce the risk of testicular malignancy. No consensus exists on the various forms of hormonal treatment, which are assessed on an individual basis.

The influence of the presence of a pediatric surgery department on the timing of orchidopexy in UDT is presented in Table 3. Without exception, more patients were operated according to guideline recommendations in hospitals with a department of pediatric surgery both before and after modification of the guideline (Fisher p < .001).

Nationwide survey of primary care pediatricians

73% of the responding pediatricians consider the referral of the treating primary care pediatrician the most important influencing factor for the timing of operative management in UDT. 23% mentioned the parents' decision as most influential (Fig. 3a). 54% of the respondents documented the average timing of orchidopexy in UDT to be delayed while 46% were in the opinion that on average surgical treatment is performed in a timely manner (Fig. 3b). 59% considered the first year of life as the optimal period for orchidopexy in UDT, 38% refer for surgery in the second year of life (Fig. 3c). 15% of the primary care pediatricians would only initiate treatment - regardless whether conservative or surgical - after the first year of life (Fig. 3d). The question which treatment modality should primarily be initiated in patients with UDT was answered with "conservative treatment" by 82% and "surgical procedure" by 17% of the pediatricians (data not shown).

### A narrative review of the history and evidence-base for the timing of orchidopexy for cryptorchidism [^1147Ch6V]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Consensus recommendations for surgical management of cryptorchidism recommend orchidopexy between 6 and 18 months of age. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted elective surgical scheduling.

Objective

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we sought to review the available data regarding the natural history, surgical management, and infertility- and cancer-related risks associated with cryptorchid testes. The purpose of this review is to provide parents, referring providers, and surgeons with information to inform their decisions to proceed with or delay orchidopexy.

Methods

A retrospective review and analysis of all available articles relevant to the natural history, surgical management, and infertility- and cancer-related risks of cryptorchidism present on PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library was conducted.

Results

The quality of historic literature pertaining to the effect of cryptorchidism on fertility and malignancy differ, with poorer data available on fertility. Cryptorchid testes may show histologic differences as early as birth, and some of these changes may have prognostic value in future fertility. Formerly unilateral cryptorchid men have slightly but not significantly reduced paternity rates compared to the general population. Cryptorchid testes have an increased risk of germ cell carcinogenesis, and robust data suggest the risk for malignancy in cryptorchid testes increases substantially after puberty.

Conclusion

The current body of evidence regarding the risks for future infertility and testicular cancer support the consensus recommendations for surgical correction of cryptorchidism between 6 and 18 months of age. During the uncertain time of the COVID-19 pandemic, decision for orchidopexy is a shared-decision between physician and parent. For an infant or young boy with a unilateral undescended testes, delaying orchidopexy several months until a time of decreased exposure risk is unlikely to result in substantial or sustained fertility or malignant risks.

### Pediatric inguinal and scrotal surgery-practice patterns in U.S. academic centers [^112YSdhB]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Both pediatric urologists and pediatric surgeons perform hernia repairs, hydrocelectomies and orchiopexies. We hypothesized that surgeons perform more incarcerated and female hernia repairs while urologists perform more orchiopexies and hydrocelectomies.

Methods

The Vizient-AAMC Faculty Practice Solutions Center® database was queried from January 2009 to December 2014 to identify patients 10years or younger who underwent the above procedures performed by pediatric specialists. Age, gender, race, insurance, geographic region and surgeon volume were examined.

Results

In the study 55,893 surgeries were identified: 26,073 primary hernia repairs, 462 recurrent hernia repairs, 3399 laparoscopic hernia repairs, 9414 hydrocele repairs and 16,545 orchiopexies. Pediatric surgeons performed 89% of primary hernia repairs with an annual median surgeon volume of 4 cases/year. Pediatric urologists performed 62% of hydrocelectomies and 83% of orchiopexies with annual median surgeon volumes of 6 and 24, respectively. Pediatric surgeons performed all procedures in younger patients and performed more female and incarcerated hernia repairs.

Conclusions

Pediatric surgeons operate on younger patients and treat more patients with inguinal hernias while pediatric urologists care for more boys with undescended testes and hydroceles. This knowledge of referral patterns and care between specialties with overlapping expertise will allow improvements in training and access.

American Urological Association — Guideline Statement 14 states that at the time of exploration for a nonpalpable testis in boys, surgical specialists should identify the status of the testicular vessels to help determine the next course of action (Clinical Principle), and that identification of the testicular vessels should be the end point of any exploration for a nonpalpable testis. The guideline notes radiologic imaging is typically not helpful because of lack of both sensitivity and specificity for identifying an abdominal testis, and that surgical approaches include laparoscopic, inguinal, or scrotal exploration.

Table 1
Synopsis of nomenclature and etiology for non-scrotal testes

In Germany, the first official treatment guideline for UDT (AWMF-register, no. 006/022) from 1999 targeted orchidopexy to be performed within the first two years of life. In 2009 this guideline recommendation was modified, indicating that operative treatment has to be completed by the end of the first year of life. This modification was preceded by consensus statements of several international expert consortiums in 2008. The importance of early orchidopexy in undescended testis can be expressed by the fact that age at orchidopexy has been suggested as a general indicator of the quality of regional child health services.

Aim of this retrospective study was to analyze age distribution at orchidopexy and whether timing of operative treatment in patients with UDT in Germany is managed according to guideline recommendations. Furthermore, we investigated whether the guideline modification concerning earlier timing of orchidopexy has been implemented in day-to-day clinical routine. In addition, a nationwide survey was carried out to assess the primary care pediatricians' attitude regarding operative management of UDT.

### UK guidance on the initial evaluation of an infant or an adolescent with a suspected disorder of sex development [^113McrQZ]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Which newborn should be investigated and how extensively?

If the appearance of the external genitalia is sufficiently ambiguous to render sex assignment impossible or the phenotype is not consistent with prenatal genetic tests, then de facto, extensive investigation is required. However, the extent of genital ambiguity may depend on the expertise of the observer, and prior to presentation to a clinical expert, the label of ambiguous genitalia is often assigned to newborns where the most appropriate sex of rearing is not immediately clear to those present at the child's birth. The birth prevalence of genital anomalies may be as high as one in 300 birthsbut the birth prevalence of complex anomalies that may lead to true genital ambiguity on expert examination may be as low as one in 5000 births.

Besides those whose genitalia are truly ambiguous, in the clinical situation, infants can often be divided into those who are apparently a boy with atypical genitalia and those who are apparently a girl with atypical genitalia. However, it is very important to bear in mind that the same girl with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) may present as an apparent girl with clitoromegaly or an apparent boy with bilateral undescended testes. When evaluating these infants, the clinical features of the external genitalia that require examination include the presence of gonads in the labioscrotal folds, the fusion of the labioscrotal folds, the size of the phallus and the site of the urinary meatus on the phallus, although the real site of the urinary meatus may, sometimes, only become clear on surgical exploration. These external features can be individually scored to provide an aggregate score, the external masculinization score (EMS; Fig. 1). Routine systematic examination of 423 consecutive, apparently healthy, term newborn boys revealed that 412 (98%) had the maximum EMS of 12, 10 had an EMS of 11 and only 1 of 423 had an EMS of < 11. In boys with genital anomalies, a chromosomal anomaly may be present in approximately 3% of those with isolated cryptorchidism, 7% of those with hypospadias and 13% of those with a combination of cryptorchidism and hypospadias. In infants with proximal hypospadias (penoscrotal, scrotal, perineal), detailed biochemical and molecular studies performed a decade ago revealed a likely cause in 31% of cases. With advances in biochemical and molecular techniques, it is unclear whether the diagnostic yield is even greater now.

- the increased risk of malignancy with an undescended testis increasing with the age at orchidopexy

- the increased risk of later malignancy with a failed or delayed orchidopexy; the earlier the treatment, the lower the risk of impaired fertility and testicular cancer

- the reduced rates of fertility with unilateral undescended testis

### Prevalence of acquired undescended testis in 6-year, 9-year and 13-year-old Dutch schoolboys [^113NNob6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the prevalence of acquired undescended testis (UDT) in Dutch schoolboys.

Design and Participants

As a part of routine school medical examinations, during a 2-year period (2001–3), testis position was determined in 6-year, 9-year and 13-year-old schoolboys. Before the examination, a parent questionnaire was sent inquiring both about the position of the testes and whether the child had been admitted earlier to hospital for orchidopexy. In 6-year and 13-year olds, a physical examination was performed by the school medical officer; in 9-year olds, a school nurse interview was held. Each boy for whom there was any doubt of the scrotal position was referred to the hospital for examination of both testes.

Setting

Institution for Youth Health Care "Noordkennemerland" and Medical Centre Alkmaar, Alkmaar, the Netherlands.

Results

Testis position was determined in 2042 boys aged 6, 1038 aged 9 and 353 aged 13. Of these, 47, 53 and 8 boys, respectively, were referred to the hospital and seen for further evaluation. The diagnosis of acquired UDT was made in 25 boys aged 6, 23 aged 9 and four aged 13. In 33 boys, a congenital UDT was diagnosed; 32 (97%) had already been diagnosed and treated at an early age.

Conclusions

The prevalence of acquired UDT for 6-year, 9-year and 13-year olds was, respectively, 1.2% (25/2042), 2.2% (23/1038) and 1.1% (4/353). In addition, congenital UDT is treated during the early years of life and, in contrast with popular belief, screening programmes for detecting UDT in the early years are successful.
