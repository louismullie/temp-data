## Question

myocarditis management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about myocarditis management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial presentation and risk stratification. Then, I should review diagnostic confirmation with ECG, biomarkers, echocardiography, and how to choose between CMR and EMB. Next, I will consider acute management including guideline-directed heart failure therapy, hemodynamic support, and arrhythmia control. After that, I need to evaluate etiology-specific immunosuppression, including giant cell, sarcoid, eosinophilic, autoimmune, and ICI-related myocarditis. Finally, I will address special populations and long-term follow-up including activity restriction, device therapy, and surveillance, ensuring each step is corroborated by high-quality sources and correcting any missteps as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndromes and why they matter for triage; myocarditis spans chest pain mimicking ACS, dyspnea and LV dysfunction, arrhythmias or syncope, and fulminant shock, and I should remember that a prodromal viral illness is common, which means my index of suspicion must be broad across cardiology subspecialties to avoid missed diagnoses and to guide urgency of care tiering [^114ymGS8] [^114Pxg6s].

> I need to ensure early risk stratification is explicit; high-risk features such as hemodynamic instability, cardiogenic shock, malignant ventricular arrhythmias, or high-grade AV block demand ICU-level care in specialized centers with MCS capacity, whereas stable presentations without arrhythmia and preserved function can be managed on the ward or as outpatients with close follow-up, and I should verify that recommendations emphasize rapid transfer to appropriately resourced facilities to prevent multi-organ failure in fulminant cases [^115vQRwz] [^114FCK3D] [^1155auJQ].

> Next, I should review the first-tier diagnostic workup; a 12-lead ECG is mandatory in all suspected cases, troponin and natriuretic peptides support myocardial injury and heart failure burden, inflammatory markers can assist, and echocardiography defines ventricular function and pericardial effusion, while I must not forget that coronary disease often needs explicit exclusion in the appropriate clinical context, sometimes with angiography in younger patients individualized by pretest probability [^111RwJkw] [^111YmjCT] [^112HnfYy] [^113hWYr5].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of CMR versus EMB because I initially thought CMR might obviate biopsy; wait, that is not accurate, since in stable patients CMR is preferred first to characterize edema and scar, but CMR does not replace EMB and must not delay biopsy when presentations are life-threatening or when a specific, treatable histology is suspected, so I will place CMR before EMB in stable scenarios and prioritize EMB without delay if unstable [^1124jFEN] [^1161qAQn].

> I will now examine definite indications for EMB; I should confirm that biopsy is indicated in unexplained acute myocarditis with shock or need for inotropes or MCS, in Mobitz II or complete heart block, in sustained or symptomatic VT, or when there is failure to respond to guideline-based therapy within 1 to 2 weeks, and that CCS guidance similarly supports EMB in new-onset severe HF with compromise, high-grade block, VT, or refractoriness to therapy [^116iYWY6] [^114A648e] [^112wrPgp].

> Let me double-check tissue handling details to avoid sampling errors; at least three myocardial samples of 1–2 mm should be obtained, with immediate formalin fixation for histology and immunohistochemistry and snap-frozen aliquots for viral PCR, and I should remember that repeat biopsy can be considered when sampling error is suspected or to monitor response to etiology-directed therapy [^115MgFVw] [^115SwcmK] [^1146qh49].

> Now, I will consider initial supportive management; guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure using ACE inhibitors or ARBs or ARNI, evidence-based beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid antagonists, and judicious diuretics remains the cornerstone regardless of etiology, and I need to ensure this is initiated promptly in those with LV dysfunction [^115AFkWE] [^115vQRwz].

> For hemodynamic compromise, I need to escalate thoughtfully; inotropes and vasopressors are first-line to stabilize perfusion, and if shock persists, I should not delay mechanical circulatory support such as VA-ECMO or percutaneous ventricular assist devices within experienced centers, since early aggressive support in fulminant myocarditis is linked to improved recovery, although I should acknowledge that some supportive recovery data derive from lower-credibility sources and interpret them cautiously [^115vQRwz] [^11321ZAU].

> Next, I should review arrhythmia management; symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias during the acute phase are generally approached with amiodarone plus beta-blockade while correcting precipitants, high-grade AV block may require temporary pacing, and patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias should be managed in specialized centers with expertise in arrhythmia and device therapy during the acute episode [^116FYXhg] [^112MySPi].

> Before jumping to immunosuppression, I need to ensure active infection is excluded; immunosuppressive therapy should start only after ruling out viral genomes on EMB by PCR and aligning histology with an immune-mediated process, and I should reconcile guidance that generally advises against empiric immunotherapy in unselected myocarditis with the strong exceptions where etiology-specific benefits are clear [^1138n56j] [^112gQTwA] [^112ju9zp].

> Let me think about giant cell myocarditis specifically because timing is critical; immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids combined with a calcineurin inhibitor such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus is recommended and can be life-saving, with early consideration of transplantation or durable MCS if instability persists despite optimal therapy [^1169MSnX] [^111RnU66] [^117MyEWG].

> I need to check other immune-mediated phenotypes; corticosteroids are recommended in cardiac sarcoidosis when ventricular dysfunction or arrhythmias are present, immunosuppression is also indicated in specific eosinophilic or toxic myocarditis with heart failure or arrhythmias, and in systemic autoimmune disease–associated myocarditis such as SLE or PAN, disease-specific immunosuppressants including IV corticosteroids are considered appropriate, while infection-negative lymphocytic myocarditis refractory to standard therapy may warrant individualized immunosuppression after multidisciplinary review [^112er1NW] [^116yUVCv] [^115QFY6w].

> For ICI myocarditis, I should confirm the distinct protocol; I need to immediately hold and generally not rechallenge the ICI even for mild toxicity, initiate high-dose glucocorticoids as first-line therapy with pulse methylprednisolone followed by a taper guided by biomarkers, and escalate to agents such as antithymocyte globulin, mycophenolate, abatacept, or infliximab with the heart failure caveat if refractory, ensuring a comprehensive cardiac workup including ECG, troponin, natriuretic peptide, CRP, echocardiography with strain, and CMR to support diagnosis and to direct monitoring [^115kX36g] [^11113gK7] [^117T39a8] [^113rjqGV].

> I will now examine special contexts to avoid missing nuances; in fulminant myocarditis, early MCS and transfer to an advanced heart failure center are essential to avert multiorgan failure and to enable rapid, etiology-specific treatment, which means my threshold to escalate support should be low when perfusion is threatened [^115vQRwz].

> Let me consider pediatrics carefully; I should avoid routine corticosteroids in pediatric myocarditis unless a specific indication exists, consider IVIG in selected young patients with clinical or biopsy-proven disease, and ensure early ICU monitoring for arrhythmia, heart block, ST changes, or low output given their high risk of rapid deterioration and cardiac arrest [^114LUY5Q] [^115YEGRW] [^115mnjpL].

> For vaccine-associated myocarditis, I should confirm the typical course; young males often present within days of mRNA vaccination with chest pain, troponin elevation, and diffuse ECG changes, with a generally benign and self-limited course, so management is supportive with early CMR to confirm the diagnosis and EMB reserved for severe or persistent injury or when immunosuppression is being considered [^114d2Jok] [^114ndd7y].

> Next, I should review long-term management and embedded earlier truncation; hmm, wait a minute, the earlier note on device therapy was truncated, so I should correct it by stating that ICD placement can be considered before discharge after hemodynamically not-tolerated sustained VT or VF during the acute phase and later for selected chronic-phase indications, with catheter ablation as a potential alternative in carefully selected chronic-phase patients, while all patients require structured follow-up with clinical assessment, ECG, and echocardiography and prolonged activity restriction with individualized athlete return-to-play decisions rather than a one-size-fits-all rule [^111E2ysc] [^116n2ffT] [^114wq5vN] [^1122Goag] [^117AKoyo] [^111BySyj] [^116YXNJ1].

---

Myocarditis management is **primarily supportive**, with guideline-directed heart failure therapy and close monitoring [^112FvsBV] [^115AFkWE]. Immunosuppression is reserved for **biopsy-proven autoimmune or giant cell myocarditis**, while mechanical circulatory support or transplantation is considered for refractory cases [^115PiFsf] [^112nwDUn] [^1147BnRL]. Arrhythmias are managed with beta-blockers, amiodarone [^116FYXhg], and ICDs as indicated [^111E2ysc]. Physical activity is restricted for at least 3–6 months, and follow-up includes clinical assessment, ECG, echocardiography, and CMR to guide return to activity and detect complications [^1122Goag] [^111BySyj].

---

## Initial evaluation and diagnosis

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history, physical exam, ECG [^111RwJkw], and echocardiography are essential for initial evaluation and risk stratification [^114ymGS8].

- **Laboratory tests**: Cardiac biomarkers (troponin, BNP/NT-proBNP), inflammatory markers (CRP), and viral serologies are recommended [^112HnfYy] [^114ymGS8].

- **Cardiac MRI (CMR)**: Non-invasive gold standard for diagnosing myocarditis [^1161qAQn], assessing inflammation, edema, and fibrosis [^116b1sWi] [^1124jFEN].

- **Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB)**: Gold standard for definitive diagnosis [^116iYWY6], indicated in severe or refractory cases, or when specific etiologies (e.g. giant cell myocarditis) are suspected [^114A648e] [^114ymGS8].

---

## General supportive management

- **Hemodynamic stabilization**: Use vasopressors and inotropes as needed [^113XT5DB]; mechanical circulatory support (e.g. ECMO, LVAD) for refractory shock [^112nwDUn] [^115vQRwz].

- **Heart failure management**: Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) including ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, and diuretics [^112FvsBV] [^115AFkWE].

- **Arrhythmia management**: Beta-blockers and amiodarone for ventricular arrhythmias; ICD implantation for sustained VT/VF or high-risk patients [^111E2ysc].

---

## Immunosuppressive therapy

- **Indications**: Reserved for biopsy-proven autoimmune myocarditis, giant cell myocarditis, or myocarditis associated with systemic autoimmune diseases [^115PiFsf] [^1143C3HR].

- **Agents**: Corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors [^1143C3HR], and other immunosuppressants (e.g. mycophenolate mofetil) [^114dLCqz].

- **Contraindications**: Active viral infection must be excluded before initiating immunosuppression [^1138n56j].

---

## Mechanical circulatory support and transplantation

Mechanical circulatory support with **ECMO or LVAD** is indicated in **fulminant myocarditis with refractory cardiogenic shock** [^115vQRwz] [^112nwDUn]. Heart transplantation is considered for patients with **irreversible myocardial damage** or **refractory heart failure** despite optimal medical and mechanical support [^1147BnRL].

---

## Activity restriction and rehabilitation

Physical activity restriction should be strict during the **acute phase** and continued for at least **3–6 months** after recovery. Return-to-play decisions should be individualized based on **clinical recovery**, imaging findings [^1122Goag], and the **absence of arrhythmias** [^111BySyj].

---

## Follow-up and long-term management

Regular clinical monitoring — including **clinical assessment, ECG, and echocardiography** — is recommended [^1122Goag]. CMR is used to assess resolution of inflammation and to guide long-term management [^114Pxg6s] [^1122Goag]. Ongoing management of heart failure, arrhythmias, and other complications follows standard guidelines [^112FvsBV] [^115AFkWE].

---

## Special considerations

For **pediatric myocarditis**, early ICU monitoring, immunosuppressive therapy such as IVIG [^114RNUHw], and mechanical support are employed as indicated [^115mnjpL] [^115YEGRW]. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis is managed with **high-dose corticosteroids** [^113rjqGV], with additional **immunosuppressive agents** for refractory cases [^112eu95X] [^117T39a8].

---

Myocarditis management is primarily supportive, with immunosuppression reserved for specific cases. Mechanical circulatory support or transplantation is considered for refractory cases, and **long-term follow-up is essential** to monitor for and manage complications [^112HnfYy].

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: Considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^114SMSdR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

While definite acute myocarditis forms the tip of the iceberg of the myocarditis spectrum, a large proportion of patients in clinical practice do not undergo myocarditis testing, leading to missed opportunities in diagnosis. The wide spectrum of clinical manifestations of myocarditis — chest pain, dyspnea/heart failure, syncope, or arrhythmia-related — results in patients being seen across multiple cardiology subspecialties. Raising clinical suspicion of myocarditis is essential to establish a diagnosis.

Probable myocarditis occurs when endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging generates borderline or inconclusive results. Definite myocarditis includes cases with a confirmed diagnosis. Unexplored myocarditis refers to cases in which no confirmatory investigations are performed. CMR indicates cardiac magnetic resonance imaging; EMB, endomyocardial biopsy; MINOCA, myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries; NICMP, nonischemic cardiomyopathy; PVC, premature ventricular complexes; VT, ventricular tachycardia; º, case finding in electrophysiology; *, case finding in interventional cardiology; and, case finding in heart failure and imaging.

For example, around 33% of patients with myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries may receive a diagnosis of myocarditis.

### Recognition and initial management of fulminant myocarditis: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115vQRwz]. Circulation (2020). High credibility.

Fulminant myocarditis (FM) is an uncommon syndrome characterized by sudden and severe diffuse cardiac inflammation, often leading to death resulting from cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, or multiorgan system failure. Historically, FM was almost exclusively diagnosed at autopsy. By definition, all patients with FM will need some form of inotropic or mechanical circulatory support to maintain end-organ perfusion until transplantation or recovery. Specific subtypes of FM may respond to immunomodulatory therapy in addition to guideline-directed medical care.

Despite the increasing availability of circulatory support, orthotopic heart transplantation, and disease-specific treatments, patients with FM experience significant morbidity and mortality due to a delay in diagnosis and initiation of circulatory support, as well as a lack of appropriately trained specialists to manage the condition. This scientific statement outlines the resources necessary to manage the spectrum of FM, including extracorporeal life support, percutaneous and durable ventricular assist devices, transplantation capabilities, and specialists in advanced heart failure, cardiothoracic surgery, cardiac pathology, immunology, and infectious disease.

Education of frontline providers who are most likely to encounter FM first is essential to increase timely access to appropriately resourced facilities, prevent multiorgan system failure, and tailor disease-specific therapy as early as possible in the disease process.

Fulminant myocarditis is an inflammatory process that occurs in the myocardium and causes acute-onset heart failure. If patients with fulminant myocarditis are aggressively supported in a timely manner, nearly all can have an excellent recovery. In this review, we discuss the clinical and histological distinguishing features of fulminant myocarditis and contrast this disease entity with nonfulminant myocarditis. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, methods of diagnosis, management options, and prognosis of fulminant myocarditis are reviewed in detail.

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: Considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^114ymGS8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The diagnostic approach to myocarditis must be tailored to the clinical setting (outpatient versus inpatient) and adjusted according to disease severity, which greatly impacts immediate risk. A streamlined 3-tier diagnostic approach is suggested:

- **First tier**: Includes investigations for all patients to assess immediate prognosis. This consists of detailed history taking, physical evaluation, laboratory analysis, ECG, and echocardiography. Although these elements lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to conclusively diagnose myocarditis, they are crucial for excluding other causes and assessing risk, whether patients present as inpatients or outpatients. Essential components of this evaluation are detailed in a corresponding table.

- **Second tier**: Aimed at confirming a definitive diagnosis of myocarditis.

- **Third tier**: Involves auxiliary diagnostic evaluations and care titration based on assessments made during the first two tiers.

Analysis of patient cohorts reveals that chest pain is a presenting complaint in 27% to 89% of patients, dyspnea/heart failure/LV dysfunction in 19% to 80%, and arrhythmias or syncope in 6% to 22%. Up to 80% of patients report a prodromal episode, such as gastrointestinal symptoms or sore throat, before presentation.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis: Pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [^117AoWQe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

ICI-related myocarditis is a complex disease that presents with similarities to many other acute cardiac syndromes. This overlap, along with the relative novelty of the entity and only a preliminary understanding of the pathophysiological characteristics, makes it a difficult condition to diagnose and treat. Additionally, ICI-related myocarditis is uncommon, complicating efforts to study it in a randomized manner. Most guidance is available from case reports and small case series.

It is necessary for both oncologists and cardiologists to maintain a high suspicion for this ICI-related cardiac toxicity. Studies evaluating multimodality imaging and invasive testing with endomyocardial biopsy will guide the development of better diagnostic algorithms for this condition. Treatment is largely based on glucocorticoids, with a possible role for more targeted immune modulators depending on the clinical course of individual patients.

As indications and use of ICIs continue to expand, more cases of ICI-related myocarditis will likely be identified. Further research is needed to establish mechanisms, develop diagnostic strategies, and guide the treatment of this disease entity.

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: Considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^114Pxg6s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Myocarditis is most recognized in patients with moderate to severe, recent-onset heart failure. However, less typical presentations, including myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries and arrhythmias, are important manifestations but less commonly recognized to be caused by myocarditis. Most cases of myocarditis can be self-limiting without specific treatment; however, appropriate identification of risk during the diagnostic process of myocarditis and once a diagnosis is established is of primordial importance to identify patients in need of more specific follow-up and management.

We propose a flexible, multitiered approach to the diagnostic process, allowing for the capturing of the spectrum of myocarditis at an early time-point and individualized use of diagnostic resources through disease severity phenotyping. This approach provides structured follow-up care once myocarditis is confirmed. Such diagnostic processes allow for the identification of specific etiologies with potential therapeutic consequences or for the comprehension of disease chronicity by understanding genetic contributions, elements of persistent immune dysregulation, and degree of cardiac damage.

The article highlights the evolving field of immunophenotyping in myocarditis, generating potential for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches. Currently, long-term follow-up should be titrated to the refined risk assessments of patients with a diagnosis of myocarditis and includes arrhythmia monitoring and imaging when the results will likely impact management.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis: Pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [^115kX36g]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

If there is any suspicion of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related myocarditis, consensus recommends holding the ICI, even for mild toxicity. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for the management of immune-related adverse events (IRAE) grade the severity of toxicity into four categories (grade 1 to grade 4), with grade 4 being the most severe. For most other organ system IRAEs, it is not recommended to hold the ICI for grade 1 toxicity, but in the case of ICI-related myocarditis, it is advised to hold the ICI even for this mild grade of toxicity. This is due to the concern for high mortality related to this IRAE.

It is also not known whether ICI therapy can be safely restarted after an episode of successfully treated ICI-related myocarditis. There is one case report in which a patient developed myocarditis on nivolumab, followed by reinitiation of therapy with a different ICI, pembrolizumab. Within two weeks of the first dose, the patient developed worsening heart failure requiring hospitalization, followed by permanent discontinuation of the ICI. Therefore, we do not recommend a repeated trial of ICI in patients with previous ICI-related myocarditis.

In addition to immunosuppression, patients should also be treated with conventional cardiac therapy. For acute decompensated heart failure, intravenous diuretics, inotropes, and mechanical circulatory support are recommended, as per the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines. Arrhythmia management for ventricular tachycardia is also guided by these protocols.

### Return to play after myocarditis: Time to abandon the one-size-fits-all approach [^111BySyj]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians around the world were confronted with concerns that myocarditis, a non-ischaemic inflammatory disease of the myocardium, could occur more frequently following SARS-CoV-2 infection than after other respiratory viruses. This concern was particularly pertinent for athletes because exercise continuation during acute myocarditis may increase the severity of myocardial damage and act as a trigger of lethal arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in individuals with myocardial inflammation and scar. Despite the recognition that sports should be avoided during acute myocarditis, the timing of exercise resumption in the postacute phase, when symptoms have resolved, is almost entirely dependent on expert consensus. This commentary examines the rationale underpinning return-to-play (RTP) recommendations and proposes a more individualised approach.

### Diagnosis and management of myocarditis: An evidence-based review for the emergency medicine clinician [^113XT5DB]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is a potentially fatal condition that can be misdiagnosed in the emergency department (ED) setting.

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of myocarditis, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Myocarditis occurs when inflammation of the heart musculature causes cardiac dysfunction. Symptoms may range from mild to severe and are often preceded by a viral prodrome. Laboratory assessment and an electrocardiogram can be helpful for the diagnosis; however, echocardiography is the ideal test in the ED setting. Some patients may also require advanced imaging, though this will often occur during hospitalization or follow-up. Treatment is primarily focused on respiratory and hemodynamic support. Initial hemodynamic management includes vasopressors and inotropes, whereas more severe cases may require an intra-aortic balloon pump, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or a ventricular assist device. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided while intravenous immunoglobulin remains controversial.

- **Conclusion**: Myocarditis is a serious condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### Management of cardiac disease in cancer patients throughout oncological treatment: ESMO consensus recommendations [^113rjqGV]. Annals of Oncology (2020). High credibility.

In specific circumstances, such as myocarditis, particularly in relation to patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced myocarditis, the ESMO 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining a comprehensive work-up. This includes ECG, troponin, BNP or NT-proBNP, CRP, viral titer, echocardiogram with global longitudinal strain, and cardiac MRI. These assessments are crucial for identifying immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated cardiovascular toxicity, especially myocarditis and other common differential diagnoses. This approach is recommended for patients developing new cardiovascular symptoms or those with incidentally detected arrhythmia, conduction abnormality on ECG, or LV systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram while undergoing or after the recent completion of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

### Advances in the diagnosis of myocarditis in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: An overview of diagnostic tests [^116b1sWi]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Early recognition of myocarditis in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies can help initiate targeted treatment to prevent worse clinical outcomes. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance and endomyocardial biopsy are important tools in the detection of myocarditis and are the non-invasive and invasive gold standard techniques, respectively. There is no one perfect test for detecting myocarditis; therefore, a strategy combining cardiac biomarkers (troponin I) with non-invasive imaging modalities, especially CMR, is essential for obtaining an earlier diagnosis. The future in this field is exciting, and there are other imaging modalities, such as 18 F-FDG-PET/CT, that have shown great promise in detecting myocardial inflammation in other autoimmune diseases.

### Myocarditis: Emergency department recognition and management [^1167Wtrg]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an acute inflammatory syndrome involving the heart and related structures. In many instances, the presentation is obvious, and appropriate treatment and disposition follow accordingly. In other situations, patients present with viral illness of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts (or both), or nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue and weakness, leading the clinician astray.

### Management of myocarditis-related cardiomyopathy in adults [^115c5QeF]. Circulation Research (2019). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is generally a mild and self-limited consequence of systemic infection of cardiotropic viruses. However, patients can develop a temporary or permanent impairment of cardiac function, including acute cardiomyopathy with hemodynamic compromise or severe arrhythmias. In this setting, specific causes of inflammation are associated with variable risks of death and transplantation. Recent translational studies suggest that treatments tailored to specific causes of myocarditis may impact clinical outcomes when added to guideline-directed medical care.

This review summarizes recent advances in translational research that influence the utility of endomyocardial biopsy for the management of inflammatory cardiomyopathies. Emerging therapies for myocarditis, based on these mechanistic hypotheses, are entering clinical trials and may add to the benefits of established heart failure treatment.

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: Considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^113hWYr5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

After a first‐tier evaluation that allows for understanding the immediate prognosis, a second tier of evaluation consists of establishing the diagnosis of definite myocarditis. The common findings of elevated troponin, ST‐segment and T‐wave abnormalities, chest pain, and regional wall motion abnormalities render coronary artery disease a frequent differential diagnosis, often necessitating a coronary angiogram for its exclusion. The younger age of patients with suspected myocarditis (mean age, 34–47 years in large series) argues for individualization of the diagnostic approaches to exclude coronary artery disease.

The emerging understanding of the role of Th17 in myocardial injury in myocarditis, but not in myocardial infarction, could become clinically useful in the future. A recently identified microRNA (mmu‐miR‐721) produced by the Th17 subset differentiates with great diagnostic accuracy between both conditions. As outlined in Figures 2 and 5, in patients with suspected myocarditis, confirmation of the diagnosis needs to be attained using either EMB or CMR.

### Diagnosis and treatment of acute myocarditis: A review [^112HnfYy]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Acute myocarditis, defined as a sudden inflammatory injury to the myocardium, affects approximately 4 to 14 people per 100,000 each year globally and is associated with a mortality rate of approximately 1% to 7%.

- **Observations**: The most common causes of myocarditis are viruses, such as influenza and coronavirus; systemic autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus; drugs, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors; and vaccines, including smallpox and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Approximately 82% to 95% of adult patients with acute myocarditis present with chest pain, while 19% to 49% present with dyspnea, and 5% to 7% with syncope. The diagnosis of myocarditis can be suggested by presenting symptoms, elevated biomarkers such as troponins, electrocardiographic changes of ST segments, and echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities or wall thickening. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or endomyocardial biopsy are required for definitive diagnosis. Treatment depends on acuity, severity, clinical presentation, and etiology.

Approximately 75% of patients admitted with myocarditis have an uncomplicated course, with a mortality rate of approximately 0%. In contrast, acute myocarditis complicated by acute heart failure or ventricular arrhythmias is associated with a 12% rate of either in-hospital mortality or need for heart transplant. Approximately 2% to 9% of patients have hemodynamic instability — characterized by the inability to maintain adequate end-organ perfusion — and require inotropic agents or mechanical circulatory support, such as extracorporeal life support.

Based on this broad clinical spectrum, we propose a standardized referral and diagnostic process towards myocarditis (Figure 3). Establishing a diagnosis of definite myocarditis has numerous diagnostic and therapeutic implications, including:

- **Temporary prohibition of competitive sports**: Immediate restriction from competitive sports can prevent further cardiac complications.
- **Search for specific forms of myocarditis**: Targeted therapies may be needed, such as immunosuppressive therapies in sarcoidosis, eosinophilic, and giant cell myocarditis, or the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors or antibiotics in Lyme carditis.
- **Timing of diagnostic tests**: Conduct tests such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging before device implantation to ensure accurate assessment.
- **Genetic screening**: Implement genetic counseling and potential cascade screening to identify familial patterns and implications.

### National trends and outcomes of endomyocardial biopsy for patients with myocarditis: From the National Inpatient Sample Database [^116VhTVb]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

The utility of endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in the management of myocarditis in the era of advanced cardiac imaging has been challenged.

- **Methods and results**: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample Database (years 1998–2013) was queried to identify hospitalization records with a primary diagnosis of myocarditis, and underwent EMB procedure. We identified 22,299 hospitalization records with a diagnosis of myocarditis during the study period. Of those, 798 (3.6%) underwent EMB procedures. There was an average decrease in the incidence of EMB for myocarditis by 0.15% (p < 0.01) over the study period. Younger patients, women, and those with chronic kidney disease were more likely to undergo EMB. On multivariate analysis, patients with myocarditis who underwent EMB had higher in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.41–2.74) and longer median hospital stay (9 days vs. 3 days; p < 0.001). EMB was associated with a higher incidence of cardiac tamponade (odds ratio [OR] 5.21, 95% CI 2.76–9.82), cardiogenic shock (OR 4.66, 95% CI 3.75–5.78), need for intra-aortic balloon pump (OR 3.52, 95% CI 2.49–4.97), and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OR 4.26, 95% CI 2.78–6.53).

- **Conclusions**: The use of EMB in hospitalizations with myocarditis has decreased over time. The use of EMB was associated with a higher likelihood of in-hospital mortality and morbidity. Whether these findings represent a causative association from the procedure or a consequence of more severe disease in this group could not be confirmed in this study.

### Diagnostic approach for suspected acute myocarditis: Considerations for standardization and broadening clinical spectrum [^111ZMZDv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Myocarditis is most recognized in patients with moderate to severe, recent-onset heart failure. However, less typical presentations, including myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries and arrhythmias, are important manifestations but are less commonly recognized to be caused by myocarditis. Most cases of myocarditis can be self-limiting without specific treatment; however, appropriate identification of risk during the diagnostic process of myocarditis and once a diagnosis is established is of primordial importance to identify patients in need of more specific follow-up and management.

We propose a flexible, multitiered approach to the diagnostic process, allowing for capturing of the spectrum of myocarditis at an early time-point, individualized use of diagnostic resources through disease severity phenotyping, and providing structured follow-up care once myocarditis is confirmed. Such diagnostic processes allow for identification of specific etiologies with potential therapeutic consequences or allow for the comprehension of disease chronicity by understanding genetic contributions or elements of persistent immune dysregulation and degree of cardiac damage.

- **The evolving field of immunophenotyping**: This highlights the potential for the development of targeted therapeutic approaches.

Currently, long-term follow-up should be titrated to the refined risk assessments of patients with a diagnosis of myocarditis and includes arrhythmia monitoring and imaging when the results will likely impact management. Genetic testing should be considered.

### Viral myocarditis: Diagnosis, treatment options, and current controversies [^1146XqzK]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Myocarditis — a frequent cause of dilated cardiomyopathy and sudden cardiac death — typically results from a cardiotropic viral infection followed by active inflammatory destruction of the myocardium. Characterization of this disease has been hampered by its heterogeneous clinical presentations and diverse etiologies. Advances in cardiac MRI and molecular detection of viruses by endomyocardial biopsy have improved our ability to diagnose and understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of this elusive disease.

However, therapeutic options are currently limited for both the acute and chronic phases of myocarditis. Several randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated potential benefit with immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory therapies, but further investigations are warranted. In this review, we explore the pathophysiology, natural history, and modes of diagnosis of myocarditis, as well as evidence-based treatment strategies. As novel imaging techniques and human in vitro models of the disease emerge, the landscape of therapies for myocarditis is poised to improve.

### Vaccine-triggered acute autoimmune myocarditis: Defining, detecting, and managing an apparently novel condition [^1132uNgM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Regardless, an approach like that described by Sandeep and colleagues would almost certainly have identified most of the complicated (adult) cases summarized in one of the systematic reviews. Given the apparent low risk of the condition, however, future iterations of such pathways are likely to include higher thresholds for admission, lower thresholds for discharge, and additional diagnostic work‐ups when myocardial injury is severe or relentless. In our Institute's pathway for suspected myocarditis in adults, early CMR (sometimes repeated days later in aggressive disease) has a prominent role in diagnosis as well as prognosis. This approach, as well as considering endomyocardial biopsy and positron emission tomography with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose before immunosuppression, are other areas where these pathways may be further shaped for the purposes of risk assessment.

- **Immunosuppression management**: The third component recommends that immunosuppression should be considered alongside supportive management only when adverse outcomes seem likely or have been manifest. By and large, this assessment is accomplished by considering the magnitude of myocardial injury, its functional consequences, and the likely trajectory of the injurious process.

- **Immune mechanism assumptions**: If the diagnosis of post-vaccine myocarditis is correct, it seems safe to assume that the effector mechanism includes immunologically mediated myocardial injury. Accordingly, there is support for immune suppression, at the same time eliminating concerns of causing harm by "releasing" an undetected infectious cause from its immunological constraints.

### The quest for new approaches in myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy [^115iiZ2G]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Myocarditis represents a diverse group of heart-specific immune processes classified by clinical and histopathological manifestations. Up to 40% of dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with inflammation or viral infection. Recent experimental studies have revealed complex regulatory roles for several microribonucleic acids and T-cell and macrophage subtypes. Although the prevalence of myocarditis remained stable between 1990 and 2013 at about 22 per 100,000 people, overall mortality from cardiomyopathy and myocarditis has decreased since 2005.

The diagnostic and prognostic value of cardiac magnetic resonance has improved with the development of new, higher-sensitivity sequences. Positron emission tomography has emerged as a useful diagnostic tool for cardiac sarcoidosis. The sensitivity of endomyocardial biopsy may be increased, particularly in suspected sarcoidosis, through the application of electrogram guidance to target regions of abnormal signal. Investigational treatments based on mechanistic advances are entering clinical trials. Revised management recommendations regarding athletic participation following acute myocarditis have heightened the importance of early diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and management of myocarditis in children: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114RNUHw]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Myocarditis remains a clinical challenge in pediatrics, initially recognized at autopsy before the use of endomyocardial biopsy, which provided a histopathology-based diagnosis as per the Dallas criteria. Due to its invasive nature and low sensitivity, the focus of endomyocardial biopsy shifted towards clinical suspicion. With advances in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, a comprehensive examination of the whole heart in vivo has gained acceptance for diagnosing myocarditis. The presentation of the condition may range from minimal symptoms to severe cases of heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock. Outcomes may vary widely, from full resolution to chronic heart failure and the necessity of heart transplantation, with inadequate indicators to predict the trajectory of the disease.

The American Heart Association commissioned this writing group to delve into the knowledge and management of pediatric myocarditis. This statement underscores advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis, evolving pathogeneses, modern laboratory testing, and the use of mechanical circulatory support, with particular emphasis on innovations in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Despite these advancements, the absence of a universally accepted definition of myocarditis continues to hinder progress in disease-targeted therapy.

### High risk and low prevalence diseases: Myocarditis [^1155auJQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Myocarditis is a serious condition that carries with it a high rate of morbidity and mortality. This review highlights the pearls and pitfalls of myocarditis, including presentation, diagnosis, and management in the emergency department (ED) based on evidence.

- **Discussion**: Myocarditis is an inflammatory syndrome of the myocardium, most often resulting from a viral infection, that can cause life-threatening cardiovascular collapse. It has a highly variable presentation and no widely available specific diagnostic test, making it a challenging diagnosis. Emergency clinicians should obtain an electrocardiogram and perform bedside ultrasound to assess cardiac function. Treatment in the ED is largely supportive, focusing on resuscitation, cardiovascular support, cardiology specialist consultation, and appropriate disposition.

- **Conclusions**: An understanding of myocarditis can assist emergency clinicians in diagnosing and managing this potentially deadly disease.

### Vaccine-triggered acute autoimmune myocarditis: Defining, detecting, and managing an apparently novel condition [^114ndd7y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

An approach to detection and management in adults that includes the same components described above appears to be appropriate, but with the important difference that pretest probabilities change in older age groups. The incidence of postvaccine myocarditis becomes much lower, and alternative causes of cardiac symptoms and acute myocardial injury are more frequently encountered, even in populations with normal coronary angiograms. Accordingly, our own in-house pathways for evaluating adult patients will almost always include early CMR to help sort through a list of differential diagnoses and endomyocardial biopsy when immunosuppression is being considered to suppress immune-mediated myocardial injury. Positron emission tomography with 18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging and genetic testing may also play an important part in these assessments.

### Vaccine-triggered acute autoimmune myocarditis: Defining, detecting, and managing an apparently novel condition [^114d2Jok]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Sandeep et al. adopt a pragmatic approach to the detection and management of post-vaccine myocarditis in children and adolescents. Their approach can be considered a three-part pathway.

- **Detection and diagnosis**: This part of the pathway assesses the probability that a presentation with acute myocardial injury is causally related to recent vaccination. Diagnosis is considerably more straightforward than in other settings where myocarditis might be suspected, because most presentations currently confer a high pretest probability.

	- A unique combination of typical features characterizes the vast majority of cases of post-vaccine myocarditis: near-identical, easily "detected" pathogenetic agents; typical temporal features; and similar clinical features, typically including chest pain, ECG changes, and troponin elevation. Clinical presentations share other strikingly similar features, including sex (overwhelmingly male), young age (more clearly defined when adult cases are studied), timing of vaccine exposure (typically within five days of a second mRNA vaccine; intriguingly, some data infer that presentations after the first dose can develop if infection with COVID-19 acts as the first "vaccine"), and medium-term outcomes appear to be overwhelmingly benign.

- **Considering and eliminating alternative causes**: This part of the pathway gives due attention to considering and eliminating alternative causes of acute myocardial injury, which include other forms of myocarditis. In fact, post-vaccine myocarditis strongly resembles a form of acute myocardi…

This recommendation should be made after thorough discussion with the patient and provided that established endpoints have been reached. It applies to patients with hemodynamically well-tolerated sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) during the chronic phase of myocarditis, preserved left ventricular (LV) function, and a limited scar that is amenable to ablation.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis: Pathophysiological characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment [^11113gK7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated myocarditis has largely been based on the use of glucocorticoids, including both oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone. Mahmood et al. described that 86% of their patients received glucocorticoids, observing lower peak and discharge troponins when high-dose glucocorticoids were used. Additionally, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were lower in patients receiving high-dose compared to those receiving low-dose glucocorticoids. Although the criteria for choosing high-dose versus low-dose steroids in this retrospective series are not entirely clear, the authors recommend pulse dose steroids at 1000 mg daily, followed by 1 mg/kg daily of either oral or intravenous steroids.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guidelines for immune-related adverse events (IRAE) suggest initiation at 1 mg/kg daily of either intravenous or oral steroids. There is no consensus on the duration for which steroids must be continued or on how to taper the steroids. The ASCO clinical practice guidelines for IRAE recommend a taper of at least 4 to 6 weeks, which is shorter than those in trials of steroid taper for viral myocarditis. Trials for viral myocarditis have examined steroid durations of at least 3 months and up to a year. For ICI-related myocarditis, most case reports and case series track the response to steroids by monitoring troponin levels. If the troponin level begins to increase again, steroid dosing is increased and tapered over a longer period, although criteria for the increase are not yet standardized. Using these limited data, we recommend the use of high-dose steroids for treatment.

### Clinical strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis: A narrative review [^1115LzP6]. JAMA Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

In the last decade, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been approved for the treatment of many cancer types. Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated myocarditis has emerged as a significant and potentially fatal adverse effect. Recognizing, diagnosing, and treating ICI-associated myocarditis poses new challenges for the practicing clinician. Here, the literature on ICI-associated myocarditis is reviewed.

- **Observations**: Clinical presentation and cardiac pathological findings are highly variable in patients with ICI-associated myocarditis. Although endomyocardial biopsy is the criterion standard diagnostic test, a combination of clinical suspicion, cardiac biomarkers (specifically troponin), and cardiac imaging, in addition to biopsy, is often needed to support the diagnosis. Importantly, the combination of a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor with a programmed cell death protein 1 or programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor increases the risk of developing ICI-associated myocarditis.

- **Conclusion and relevance**: This review aims to provide a standardized diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients with suspected ICI-associated myocarditis. A complete history of recent cancer treatments and physical examination in combination with cardiac biomarkers, cardiac imaging, and endomyocardial biopsy represent a pragmatic diagnostic approach for most cases of ICI-associated myocarditis. The addition of novel biomarkers or imaging modalities is an area of active research and should be evaluated in larger cohorts.

### Management of acute myocarditis and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy: An expert consensus document [^112ZiMVT]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the heart that may occur because of infections, immune system activation, or exposure to drugs. The diagnosis of myocarditis has changed due to the introduction of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. We present an expert consensus document aimed at summarizing the common terminology related to myocarditis while highlighting some areas of controversy, uncertainties, and unmet clinical needs.

In fact, controversies persist regarding mechanisms that determine the transition from the initial trigger to myocardial inflammation and from acute myocardial damage to chronic ventricular dysfunction. It is still uncertain which viruses (besides enteroviruses) cause direct tissue damage, act as triggers for immune-mediated damage, or both. Regarding terminology, myocarditis can be characterized according to etiology, phase, severity of the disease, predominant symptoms, and pathological findings. Clinically, acute myocarditis (AM) implies a short time elapsed from the onset of symptoms and diagnosis (generally less than one month).

In contrast, chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy indicates myocardial inflammation with established dilated cardiomyopathy or hypokinetic nondilated phenotype, which in advanced stages evolves into fibrosis without detectable inflammation. Suggested diagnostic and treatment recommendations for AM and chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy are mainly based on expert opinion given the lack of well-designed contemporary clinical studies in the field. We will provide a shared and practical approach to patient diagnosis.

Could CMR refine RTP recommendations?

In the era of personalized medicine, a more individualized approach that recognizes the heterogeneity of myocarditis presentations seems desirable. Although there is a paucity of evidence regarding the incidence of complications, there are some surrogates of disease activity that may provide guidance. Inflammatory alterations of the myocardium reveal a rapid and consistent decrease in a time frame that is shorter than the restriction period of 3 months. T1 and T2 relaxation times are the only single parameters of ongoing myocardial inflammation/edema to show significant differences between patients with myocarditis and control subjects at 4–8 weeks follow-up examinations. Although these differences in T1 and T2 relaxation times increase the sensitivity for diagnosing subtle cases of acute myocarditis, their value for predicting clinical events in the convalescence phase has not been investigated. Thus, CMR criteria by itself, although useful for early diagnosis in symptomatic patients, are insufficient to guide clinical decision-making and should always be considered in the appropriate clinical context.

What do the Guidelines Say?

The diagnostic criteria and management of IC i ‐related myocarditis proposed by the recent guidelines are shown in Table S10. Briefly, although the ASCO‐2018 11 and the ESMO‐2017 12 guidelines gave specific recommendations for the management of IC i ‐related myocarditis, there is no consensus on diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the absence of strong evidence. The diagnosis of IC i ‐related myocarditis remains challenging, especially because patients with definite myocarditis on endomyocardial biopsy may have no signs of myocarditis on cardiac magnetic resonance in up to 50% of cases. 66 Moreover, physicians are faced with the issue of asymptomatic patients with only a rise in troponin levels during their follow‐up. 49 Regarding management, all available guidelines agree on the need to discontinue IC i therapy in patients with a suspected or proven IC i ‐related myocarditis and to rapidly initiate high‐dose corticosteroids. For corticosteroid‐refractory or high‐grade myocarditis with hemodynamic instability, other immunosuppressive therapies such as antithymocyte globulin, infliximab (except in patients with HF), mycophenolate mofetil, or abatacept are suggested. However, their potential interest has not been demonstrated in prospective well‐designed trials.

### Part 4: Pediatric basic and advanced life support: 2020 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^115mnjpL]. Circulation (2020). High credibility.

The 2020 American Heart Association guidelines recommend that, in specific circumstances for myocarditis — particularly in pediatric patients — advanced cardiac life support should be considered. Pediatric patients with acute myocarditis presenting with arrhythmias, heart block, ST-segment changes, and/or low cardiac output should be referred early to ICU monitoring and therapy, due to the high risk of cardiac arrest.
