## Question

When do you give sickle cell patients hemoglobin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when we should "give hemoglobin" to patients with sickle cell disease and what that actually means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "giving hemoglobin" means inducing endogenous fetal hemoglobin with hydroxyurea versus administering donor hemoglobin via red blood cell transfusions. Then, I should verify indications, timing, and dosing for hydroxyurea in children and adults. Next, I will review when to use simple versus exchange transfusions for acute events, perioperative care, pregnancy, and chronic stroke prevention. Finally, I need to confirm safety thresholds, monitoring requirements, and key contraindications so we avoid harm from hyperviscosity or teratogenicity.

> Let me first clarify the terminology, because "give hemoglobin" could mean two distinct strategies with different goals and risks. Hydroxyurea increases a patient's own fetal hemoglobin (HbF), thereby reducing HbS polymerization and downstream complications. By contrast, red blood cell (RBC) transfusions deliver donor hemoglobin to increase oxygen-carrying capacity, acutely dilute HbS, and in chronic programs maintain a low HbS percentage. I should confirm both are evidence-based disease-modifying approaches used in complementary scenarios rather than interchangeable options in every setting [^111FDujb] [^111whY3h] [^1162TBc6].

> Next, I should review when to start hydroxyurea in children. The NHLBI expert panel recommends offering hydroxyurea universally beginning at about 9 months of age for infants and toddlers with sickle cell anemia genotypes (HbSS or HbSβ0), even if they are not yet clinically severe, to maximize HbF induction and prevent organ damage. Wait, let me verify the genotype scope here — this universal recommendation is for SCA (HbSS/HbSβ0), while HbSC is a separate phenotype where evidence is emerging but not guideline-standard. Yes, that distinction is correct and important to preserve [^111FCgFL] [^111jJyZZ] [^116UJR2B] [^115nHbsh].

> For adults, I should confirm the symptomatic threshold. In SCA, classic indications include three or more moderate-to-severe vaso-occlusive crises in 12 months or otherwise clinically significant severity. Robust data show hydroxyurea increases HbF, reduces VOEs and acute chest syndrome, and likely improves survival over time. Hold on, I should double-check that survival signal — it comes from long-term follow-up of the MSH cohort and observational data, acknowledging the original RCT wasn't powered for mortality, but the trend and mechanistic plausibility are consistent [^114m3mKg] [^116Zstsx] [^112ZKxCY] [^11782sjP].

> Now, dosing and monitoring need to be precise. I need to check labeled starting doses and escalation: adults often start at 15 mg/kg/day and children at 20 mg/kg/day, then escalate every 8 weeks toward a maximum tolerated dose up to about 35 mg/kg/day while monitoring CBCs and reticulocytes. Let me verify the lab targets — I should aim for robust HbF induction; many children can achieve HbF over 30% without clinically significant myelosuppression when therapy is optimized, though there is no single obligatory HbF threshold for efficacy. Yes, that aligns with modern practice and the FDA label-based ranges for dosing [^115qxwmy] [^1121deB3] [^113w1GUV].

> I need to ensure safety and contraindications are front and center. Pregnancy and lactation remain situations where hydroxyurea is not recommended due to teratogenic concerns; in those settings, transfusion-based strategies are typically preferred. Let me verify that both guideline and contemporary obstetric hematology consensus discourage hydroxyurea during pregnancy — yes, that is consistent across NHLBI and Delphi panel summaries [^112a1aH7] [^114WVqpX].

> I will now examine special situations where hydroxyurea is still indicated and helpful. In SCD with chronic kidney disease, combining hydroxyurea with an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent can improve anemia, provided careful monitoring is feasible. For suspected sickle-related pulmonary hypertension with increased mortality risk, initiating hydroxyurea is recommended to mitigate hemolysis-related vasculopathy. But wait, in HbSC the evidence base is smaller; still, observational data suggest hydroxyurea is safe and may reduce pain, though formal guideline endorsement remains cautious, so I should highlight shared decision-making here [^113TEdC6] [^112m1gH4] [^1143QtCL] [^115nHbsh].

> Switching to transfusion decisions, I should confirm acute indications first. For acute chest syndrome, transfuse when hypoxemia persists with SpO2 less than 90% despite oxygen, or when hemoglobin falls more than 1 g/dL below baseline; for higher baseline hemoglobin values, simple transfusion may not be necessary, so clinical judgment is crucial. Let me not jump to conclusions on modality — many cases use simple transfusion first, with escalation if deterioration continues, and consultation with an SCD expert is advised for complex decisions [^111a8cRn] [^115Hn7pp] [^113zdJrR].

> For acute ischemic stroke, I should confirm that urgent exchange transfusion is the standard of care upon neuroimaging confirmation, followed by a program of monthly transfusions for secondary prevention. I should verify that the guidance applies to both children and adults — yes, NHLBI recommends long-term transfusions post-stroke across ages, with goals to reduce HbS and prevent recurrence [^117AnCNB] [^111Ed8mo] [^111whY3h] [^113SUmJf].

> I need to check other acute indications: for splenic sequestration with acute severe anemia, immediate transfusion with expert consultation is recommended. Let me confirm that this is emphasized as an urgent scenario in the guidelines — yes, it is explicitly called out by NHLBI for emergent management with transfusion [^116RdVTY].

> Next, I should review perioperative management. Before surgery under general anesthesia in SCA, prophylactic transfusion to a hemoglobin of about 10 g/dL within a week before the procedure is recommended, with consultation on whether simple versus partial or full exchange transfusion is appropriate based on individual risk. Wait, I should verify the exact target and timing — raise to 10 g/dL, within about 7 days pre-op, and involve an SCD expert in choosing the transfusion method, which matches NHLBI [^113hKxp7] [^112cBtgc] [^112TvRgF] [^112p4TF1].

> Pregnancy requires extra caution. Because hydroxyurea is avoided, many patients with frequent pain crises, end-organ injury such as pulmonary hypertension or CKD, or high-risk obstetric histories are considered for prophylactic transfusion, although panel consensus varies on universal use. I should confirm the threshold examples: more than two hospitalizations for pain within a month is a common trigger, and there is strong alignment for transfusion with end-organ injury or for primary and secondary stroke prevention during pregnancy. Let me verify these Delphi and expert summaries — they support selective, risk-based prophylactic transfusion and emphasize multidisciplinary planning [^111fvDWK] [^111v2Q8f] [^114WVqpX].

> For chronic transfusion programs outside pregnancy, I should confirm the classic cerebrovascular indications. Children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocities and anyone with prior stroke benefit from long-term monthly simple or exchange transfusions to prevent primary or secondary stroke. Hold on, I should verify that abnormal TCD is typically defined as velocities at or above 200 cm/s — yes, that is the conventional threshold cited in guideline summaries, though modality and targets should be individualized in expert centers [^111whY3h] [^111whY3h].

> Now, I need to apply the key safety principle for intermittent or acute transfusion in SCA: avoid raising hemoglobin above about 10 g/dL because of hyperviscosity and risk of neurologic complications, especially when HbS remains high. Hmm, wait a minute, I should correct myself — this acute threshold does not automatically apply to chronic transfusion programs or scenarios where HbS is substantially lowered over time; viscosity relates to both total Hb and HbS fraction, so chronic programs can safely maintain higher hemoglobin if HbS is kept under about 30% and the rise is gradual. Preserving both the "do not exceed 10 g/dL acutely" rule and its chronic exception prevents overgeneralization and improves safety [^116638oW] [^1142kRuE] [^115QtYpn].

> Let me synthesize this into a practical approach. Start by confirming genotype and age; offer hydroxyurea early and optimize dosing for SCA, escalating to maximum tolerated dose with close CBC and reticulocyte monitoring, while avoiding hydroxyurea in pregnancy. Use transfusions acutely for ACS, stroke, and sequestration; perioperatively target hemoglobin 10 g/dL for procedures with general anesthesia; and use chronic transfusions for stroke prevention or high-risk pregnancy scenarios. I need to ensure we also counsel on alloimmunization, DHTR, and iron overload, employing phenotype/genotype-matched, leukoreduced units and specialist input, consistent with ASH transfusion support guidance [^116UJR2B] [^116638oW] [^1162TBc6].

> Bottom line, "giving hemoglobin" in sickle cell disease can mean either inducing HbF with hydroxyurea or infusing donor RBCs, and the right choice depends on indication and timing. Hydroxyurea is first-line, disease-modifying therapy for most patients with SCA starting in infancy, while transfusions are targeted to acute complications, perioperative and pregnancy management, and chronic cerebrovascular prevention, all under strict safety thresholds and expert monitoring to minimize hyperviscosity and transfusion-related harms [^111FCgFL] [^112ZKxCY] [^113hKxp7] [^117AnCNB] [^116638oW].

Hemoglobin (via RBC transfusion) is used in patients with sickle cell disease for **acute complications** and **chronic prevention** [^111Xy4x5]. For acute indications, transfuse for acute chest syndrome with hypoxemia (SpO2 < 90% on oxygen) [^111a8cRn], acute stroke [^117AnCNB], severe symptomatic anemia (Hb < 5–6 g/dL), or a rapid Hb drop > 2 g/dL from baseline [^116RdVTY]. For chronic prevention, use monthly transfusions for secondary stroke prevention [^111Ed8mo], primary stroke prevention in children with abnormal TCD [^111whY3h], and preoperatively to reach Hb ~10 g/dL before major surgery [^113hKxp7]. Avoid transfusing above **Hb 10 g/dL** [^1142kRuE] to prevent hyperviscosity [^116638oW], and monitor for **iron overload** and **alloimmunization** [^1162TBc6].

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^112GvvWz]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of hydroxyurea treatment should be to maximize its therapeutic benefits, which are pleiotropic. By using a fixed, low dose of hydroxyurea or titrating the dose to achieve a partial clinical effect, such as the earliest detectable reduction in painful episodes or subjective improvement, the opportunity to prevent or mitigate chronic organ injury is likely lost. As previously discussed, the overt complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA) considered when assessing "clinical effect" represent only a fraction of the disease morbidity. Focusing mainly on decreasing overt manifestations of the disease also discounts the insidious progression of organ injury, which often becomes apparent only in adulthood.

To draw an analogy, one would not treat hypertension with the lowest dose needed to prevent hypertensive encephalopathy; rather, treatment is titrated to normalize the condition and prevent or mitigate as much disease-related morbidity as possible. Accordingly, the goal of hydroxyurea therapy should be to minimize or prevent all SCA complications, both overt and covert, and improve the quality of life.

### Effect of hydroxyurea on mortality and morbidity in adult sickle cell anemia: Risks and benefits up to 9 years of treatment [^11782sjP]. JAMA (2003). High credibility.

Hydroxyurea increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and decreases morbidity from vaso-occlusive complications in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA). High HbF levels reduce morbidity and mortality.

The objective of the study was to determine whether hydroxyurea attenuates mortality in patients with SCA. This long-term observational follow-up study examined mortality in patients with SCA who originally participated in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia (MSH), conducted between 1992 and 1995, to determine if hydroxyurea reduces vaso-occlusive events. During the MSH Patients' Follow-up, conducted from 1996 to 2001, patients could continue, stop, or start hydroxyurea. Data were collected during the trial and in the follow-up period.

The study was set in both inpatient and outpatient sickle cell referral centers across 21 locations in the United States and Canada.

A total of 299 adult patients with frequent painful episodes were enrolled in the follow-up. Complete follow-up data through May 2001 were available for 233 patients. In the MSH intervention, patients were randomly assigned to receive either hydroxyurea (n = 152) or a placebo (n = 147).

- **Main outcome measure**: Mortality, HbF levels, painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, and blood cell counts were assessed. It is important to note that the randomized trial was not designed to detect specified differences in mortality.

- **Results**: Seventy-five of the original 299 patients died, with 28% of these deaths resulting from pulmonary disease. Patients with reticulocyte counts less than 250,000/mm³ and hemoglobin levels lower than 9 g/dL had increased mortality (P = 0.002).

### Hydroxyurea therapy for children with sickle cell anemia in Sub-Saharan Africa: Rationale and design of the REACH trial [^111jJyZZ]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Identifying the knowledge gaps - Hydroxyurea is a once-daily oral medication with over 30 years of evidence demonstrating safety and efficacy for both adults and children with sickle cell anemia (SCA). Hydroxyurea capsules are rapidly absorbed, excreted, and have a well-described pharmacokinetic profile; their contents are easily dissolved in various liquids. The benefits of hydroxyurea for patients with SCA are multi-factorial. However, the most important and easily measured benefit is the induction of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), associated with clear laboratory and clinical benefits. Several studies in the United States and Europe have demonstrated that hydroxyurea treatment reduces both the frequency and severity of many acute clinical complications and mortality for adults and children with SCA. After years of accumulated evidence, hydroxyurea is widely accepted as a safe and effective disease-modifying therapy for both adults and children with SCA. New guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) recommend offering hydroxyurea to all children with SCA beginning at 9 months of age, regardless of clinical symptoms.

- **Despite the large body of evidence**: Hydroxyurea is rarely used in low-resource settings, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the burden of SCA is greatest. The use of hydroxyurea in these settings is limited due to three critical knowledge gaps, including a lack of data on the magnitude and impact of SCA in low-resource settings.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^115QtYpn]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

Although clinical practice guidelines have suggested a maximum safe hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of 100 g/L in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) receiving intermittent red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, the evidence does not support extrapolating this threshold for other SCD therapies when making treatment decisions. Hb concentration alone is not an adequate indicator of blood viscosity-related safety issues with older (hydroxycarbamide) or newer (voxelotor) disease-modifying therapies that promote Hb rise. As patients are achieving near-normal Hb levels, additional parameters such as RBC deformability, aggregation, and adhesion need to be considered as predictors of viscosity-related complications in SCD.

Changes in the intracellular Hb composition following treatment with curative therapies may also mitigate risk otherwise associated with increased total Hb. By reducing the contribution of HbS to viscosity, Hb levels > 100 g/L have been safely reached in patients via chronic transfusions, hydroxycarbamide, voxelotor, HSCT, and gene therapy. While phlebotomy has been performed in some patients with HbSC to reduce iron levels, there is no need to preventively phlebotomize patients solely based on higher Hb levels during use of disease-modifying therapies. Patients with HbSC who have higher steady-state Hb levels can also tolerate hydroxycarbamide-promoted Hb rises without an increase in the rate of VOCs or other SCD-related complications but should be closely monitored. Overall, patients with a favorable safety profile, based on their steady-state Hb, SCD genotype, HbS percentage, and RBC rheology can manage these treatments effectively.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^113w1GUV]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Standard laboratory monitoring is essential to support hydroxyurea therapy for children with sickle cell anemia. Key components of laboratory testing include complete blood counts, reticulocyte counts, and measurements of HbF, alongside any age-appropriate laboratory tests and imaging studies. The use of blood counts to adjust the hydroxyurea dose is necessary and logical. Maximizing the hematologic benefits of hydroxyurea through robust HbF induction will prevent or mitigate most disease manifestations, making it important to measure these effects over time. In clinical experience, optimal hydroxyurea dosing can frequently achieve greater than 30% HbF without clinically significant myelosuppression, especially when treatment commences early in life.

Although the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is not used to directly adjust the dose of hydroxyurea, an MCV of 90–110 fL generally reflects optimized therapy, assuming no other effects on MCV. Individuals with α-thalassemia trait and those with HbSβ 0 will exhibit baseline microcytosis. Therefore, while their MCV will increase with treatment, it will reach a lower value compared to others. Both one-gene and two-gene deletional α-thalassemia trait have significant effects on laboratory and clinical treatment responses.

The main goal of hydroxyurea therapy is to increase HbF levels as high as possible. Importantly, there is no strict HbF threshold, such as 20%, 30%, or even 40%, that needs to be achieved for effective management.

### Metabolic signatures of cardiorenal dysfunction in plasma from sickle cell patients as a function of therapeutic transfusion and hydroxyurea treatment [^111yGbjq]. Haematologica (2023). High credibility.

Lifelong transfusion represents a mainstay in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD) in children and adults. Increases in circulating levels of heme and iron, secondary to the elevated hemolytic propensity of sickle RBC, trigger episodes of vaso-occlusion and inflammation, which progressively cause damage to most organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and cardiovascular system, and lead to reduced life expectancy. Interventions based on treatment with hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) have shown efficacy in upregulating the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and increasing mean corpuscular volume, while decreasing the frequency of pain episodes and other acute complications in adults and children with sickle cell anemia of SS or Sβº thalassemia genotypes. This reduces the incidence of life-threatening neurological events such as primary stroke by maintaining transcranial Doppler velocities.

The circulating metabolome offers a window not just on chemical individuality under healthy conditions, but also on dysregulation of systems homeostasis under pathological conditions, such as in the case of SCD. Studies on the circulating metabolome in SCD have identified potential new avenues for metabolic interventions. For example, arginine supplementation has been proposed as a strategy to boost nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and NO-dependent vasodilation, thus counteracting hemoglobin-dependent NO scavenging secondary to intravascular hemolysis and release of RBC arginase, which has been shown to catabolize L-arginine. Similarly, hemolysis-derived free hemoglobin, heme, and iron have been studied in this context.

### Time to rethink haemoglobin threshold guidelines in sickle cell disease [^1142kRuE]. British Journal of Haematology (2021). Low credibility.

The rationale behind the haemoglobin 100 g/l limit with red blood cell transfusion:

Case reports of patients with sickle cell anaemia (SCA; HbSS and HbSβ0 genotypes) who developed complications after RBC transfusions have contributed to recommendations for avoiding Hb increases beyond 100 g/l. Patients in these reports developed adverse neurological outcomes, ranging from headaches to seizures and fatal cerebral bleeds, within days of receiving RBC transfusions. As such, the rate of Hb increase, in addition to the final Hb value, may be an important factor that engenders complications, e.g. an increase in Hb concentration over hours to days versus over weeks to months. Moreover, excessive increases in viscosity have raised concerns about impaired oxygen delivery to tissues due to reduced blood flow. While hyperviscosity has also been considered a risk factor for increased vaso‐occlusive crises (VOCs) in some patients with SCA, those with haemoglobin SC disease (HbSC) generally have higher Hb and viscosity levels but lower rates of VOCs. Given the lack of clinical and observational studies evaluating adverse events associated with increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l, the true incidence of viscosity‐related complications in SCD is difficult to assess. As such, SCD transfusion guidelines recommend not increasing Hb beyond 100 g/l in patients with acute complications related to SCD. However, with long‐term transfusions, where the rise in Hb occurs more slowly and is accompanied by a parallel decline in sickle Hb (HbS), patients who are able to maintain a lower percentage of HbS (< 30%)…

### Changing the clinical paradigm of hydroxyurea treatment for sickle cell anemia through precision medicine [^116ZCUnc]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is a common and devastating inherited blood disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Without treatment, SCA results in tremendous morbidity and early mortality. Hydroxyurea is the primary and most well-established pharmacological therapy with proven benefits to ameliorate the clinical course of SCA, primarily due to its ability to increase the expression of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which prevents the sickling of red blood cells. The optimal induction of HbF depends upon selection and maintenance of the proper dose that maximizes benefits and minimizes toxicity.

Due to the significant interpatient variability in hydroxyurea pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and dosing, most patients treated with hydroxyurea receive suboptimal doses and have only modest treatment responses. Recognizing this variability, using a precision medicine approach, we developed and prospectively evaluated an individualized dosing model for children with SCA, designed to optimize the hydroxyurea dose and clinical response. We utilize novel laboratory methods and a sparse sampling strategy requiring only 10 μL of blood collected 15 minutes, 60 minutes, and 180 minutes following a test dose. We use Bayesian adaptive control to estimate hydroxyurea exposure and to select an individual, optimal starting dose. This dosing model has resulted in HbF responses greater than 30–40%, levels beyond what is achieved with traditional weight-based dosing and trial-and-error dose escalation. This hydroxyurea dosing strategy, if widely implemented, has the potential to change the treatment paradigm.

### Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide) for sickle cell disease [^111FDujb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common inherited diseases worldwide, associated with lifelong morbidity and a reduced life expectancy. Hydroxyurea (hydroxycarbamide), an oral chemotherapeutic drug, ameliorates some of the clinical problems of SCD, particularly pain, by raising fetal hemoglobin. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of hydroxyurea therapy in people with SCD (all genotypes), of any age, regardless of setting.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Haemoglobinopathies Register, which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also searched online trial registries. The date of the most recent search was 16 January 2017.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials, of one month or longer, comparing hydroxyurea with placebo, standard therapy, or other interventions for people with SCD.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, carried out data extraction, and assessed the risk of bias.

- **Main results**: Seventeen studies were identified in the searches; eight randomised controlled trials were included, recruiting 899 adults and children with SCD (haemoglobin SS (HbSS), haemoglobin SC (HbSC), or haemoglobin Sβºthalassaemia (HbSβºthal) genotypes). Studies lasted from six to 30 months. Four studies (577 adults and children with HbSS or HbSβºthal) co…

### Primary prophylaxis in sickle cell disease: Is it feasible? Is it effective [^111D7bYn]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2011). Low credibility.

The consideration of primary prophylaxis to prevent complications of sickle cell disease (SCD) requires a clear understanding of the earliest manifestations of SCD-related organ injury, a reliable clinical or laboratory tool to detect organ dysfunction, and evidence that an intervention instituted in the presymptomatic state can mitigate disease progression. This review examines the pathophysiology of SCD in organs that may be potential targets for intervention, our capacity to evaluate early SCD manifestations, results of clinical trials, and opportunities for future interventions.

### Red blood cell transfusion to treat or prevent complications in sickle cell disease: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^111Xy4x5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Globally, sickle cell disease (SCD) is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders, resulting from the inheritance of two abnormal hemoglobin (beta globin) genes. SCD can cause severe pain, significant end-organ damage, pulmonary complications, and premature death. Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are used to treat complications of SCD, such as acute chest syndrome (ACS), which often involves a single transfusion episode, or they can be part of a regular long-term transfusion program to prevent SCD complications.

- **Objectives**: To summarize the evidence in Cochrane Reviews regarding the effectiveness and safety of RBC transfusions versus no transfusion or restrictive (to increase total hemoglobin) versus liberal (to decrease hemoglobin S level below a specified percentage) transfusion for treating or preventing complications experienced by people with SCD.

- **Methods**: We included Cochrane Reviews of randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that addressed various SCD complications and had RBC transfusion as an intervention or comparator. We assessed the methodological quality of included reviews according to the AMSTAR quality assessment.

- **Main results**: We included 15 Cochrane Reviews; 10 of these had no included studies with an RBC transfusion intervention. Five reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with other interventions, and five contained no studies. Of the 15 reviews, five included participants randomized to RBC transfusion. However, in one of these reviews, only 10 participants were randomized, resulting in no usable data. Four reviews included usable data on the effects of RBC transfusion.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: What's new [^1162TBc6]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2020 guidelines for transfusion support for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) included recommendations on specific indications and administration of transfusion, as well as screening, prevention, and management of alloimmunization, delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions (DHTRs), and iron overload. The ASH Guideline Monitoring Expert Working Group conducted an updated literature search that did not identify new studies that would change the recommendations.

No randomized control trials or systematic reviews that would impact the recommendations were identified. However, since publication, additional therapeutics for SCD that could impact clinical transfusion practice have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or reported.

- **Voxelotor (Oxbryta)**: Hemoglobin S (HbS) polymerization inhibitor that was shown in a phase 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trial involving participants with SCD to significantly increase hemoglobin levels and reduce markers of hemolysis. For recommendation 3, which addresses immunosuppressive therapy for patients with SCD with a history of multiple or life-threatening DHTRs, one should consider voxelotor as a preventive maintenance therapy to improve the baseline hemoglobin of patients at high risk of DHTR if red cell transfusion is required.

- **Tocilizumab (Actemra)**: Monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin 6 (IL-6) receptor. Case reports have described individuals with DHTRs who have shown marked improvement after targeted anti–IL-6 receptor therapy.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^111fvDWK]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

Half of the panelists would recommend starting regular transfusions immediately after stopping hydroxyurea therapy; however, consensus was not reached. Panelists who remained neutral or disagreed would, nonetheless, recommend transfusions in case of SCD-related complications. More than half of the panelists (7 of 12, 58.3%) disagreed with the use of routine prophylactic transfusions in all pregnant individuals with SCD, but consensus was not reached. Most panelists (10 of 12, 83.3%) would recommend prophylactic transfusion therapy for patients with more than two hospitalizations for acute pain during one month in their pregnancy.

There was strong alignment (11 of 12, 91.7%) on starting prophylactic transfusion therapy for patients with a history of poor maternal outcomes during previous pregnancies (e.g. several hospitalizations or significant pain). Although half of the panelists considered primary and secondary stroke prevention as the only absolute indications for prophylactic transfusion therapy for pregnant individuals with SCD, there was consensus (9 of 12, 75.0%) on starting prophylactic transfusion therapy if the patient developed end-organ injury unrelated to stroke during pregnancy (e.g. pulmonary hypertension and acute or chronic kidney disease). Consensus was not reached on starting prophylactic transfusion therapy for patients with poor fetal outcomes or fetal loss during previous pregnancies, although three of the panelists who neither agreed nor disagreed with this statement would consider prophylactic transfusion therapy for fetal losses suspected to result from SCD-related complications.

### 2019 sickle cell disease guidelines by the American Society of Hematology: Methodology, challenges, and innovations [^1129PMs2]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) convened five guideline panels to develop clinical practice recommendations addressing five management areas of highest importance to individuals living with sickle cell disease: pain, cerebrovascular complications, pulmonary and kidney complications, transfusion, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The panels were multidisciplinary and consisted of patient representatives, content experts, and methodologists. The Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Center conducted systematic reviews based on a priori selected questions.

In this exposition, we describe the process used by ASH, including the GRADE approach (Grades of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) for rating certainty of the evidence and the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework. We also describe several unique challenges faced by the guideline panels and the specific innovations and solutions used to address them, including a curriculum to train patients to engage in guideline development, dealing with the opioid crisis, and working with indirect and noncomparative evidence.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^111FCgFL]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

Forty years have passed since the first publication regarding hydroxyurea treatment for sickle cell anemia (SCA). In that proof-of-principle report, oral hydroxyurea given to two patients increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF), which was recognized as a therapeutic goal to reduce sickling. Hundreds of publications have followed, collectively documenting a consistent safety and efficacy profile of this small and simple compound for the treatment of such a complex and life-threatening disease.

In 2014, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health published guidelines for the management of SCA. In that consensus document, a strong recommendation was made to offer hydroxyurea to all infants and toddlers with SCA as young as 9 months of age and to treat older persons based on various clinical settings. Even though newer therapeutic agents have become available, hydroxyurea remains the only disease-modifying treatment that is considered the standard of care for individuals with SCA.

This manuscript focuses on the "modern use" of hydroxyurea for children with SCA, intending to distill many lessons learned through a long series of controlled trials and years of clinical experience with this treatment. Our goal is to summarize the published literature and provide useful suggestions for safe and effective hydroxyurea treatment, arguing that everyone with SCA should receive hydroxyurea with optimal dosing, and that treatment should begin early in life before the onset of organ damage. Herein, SCA refers to both homozygous HbSS and…

### An evidence-based approach to the treatment of adults with sickle cell disease [^114ETKKc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

The application of evidence-based medicine to the management of adults with sickle cell disease (SCD) is primarily driven by clinical expertise and patient preference, as there is a paucity of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data to guide decision-making. A summary of SCD management principles in areas such as health care maintenance, transfusion therapy, treatment and prevention of painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, stroke, renal disease, contraception and pregnancy, and priapism is predominantly based on the authors' interpretation of available observational studies, as well as the opinions of experts in SCD.

RCTs impacting practices address the use of hydroxyurea to prevent painful episodes and acute chest syndrome, the intensity of pre-operative transfusion, transfusion during pregnancy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy for proteinuria. However, most issues in adult SCD care have not been rigorously studied, and management may not be appropriately extrapolated from pediatric data.

While challenging clinical problems need to be addressed by RCTs, there is also a need for the development of practice guidelines using formal methodological strategies. This brief review is not a substitute for the process but provides a literature-based approach to making treatment decisions when caring for adults with SCD.

### Effect of hydroxyurea on the frequency of painful crises in sickle cell anemia. Investigators of the Multicenter Study of Hydroxyurea in Sickle Cell Anemia [^112ZKxCY]. The New England Journal of Medicine (1995). High credibility.

The study MSH was published in 1995 in the journal N Engl J Med, focusing on sickle cell disease. The trial question was: What is the role of hydroxyurea in adult patients with sickle cell anemia? It employed a multi-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, involving 299 patients (151 females and 148 males). Adult patients with sickle cell anemia were included, while key exclusions were sickle cell-beta(+)-thalassemia, sickle cell-beta(0)-thalassemia, pregnancy, narcotic addiction, regular consumption of more than 30 oxycodone capsules (or equivalent) every two weeks, indications of marrow depression, or prior hydroxyurea therapy.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Hydroxyurea group (n = 152)**: Initial dose of 15 mg/kg body weight, adjusted according to marrow depression, platelet count, and hemoglobin level.
	- **Placebo group (n = 147)**: Received Starch 1500, with similar dose adjustments.

- **Primary outcome**: A significant decrease in painful crises (2.5% vs. 4.5%; RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.89).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant decrease in chest syndrome (25 vs. 51; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.2 to 0.78).
	- Significant decrease in the need for transfusions (48 vs. 73; RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.05).

The study concluded that hydroxyurea was superior to placebo in reducing painful crises among adult patients with sickle cell anemia.

### Evaluating the long-term benefits of hydroxyurea in pediatric sickle cell anemia [^116LqRMv]. Blood Advances (2025). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea is the first-line disease-modifying medication in sickle cell anemia (SCA). Hydroxyurea therapy confers significant clinical benefits when compared with no hydroxyurea therapy and has become the primary disease-modifying treatment modality in SCA. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute expert panel report for the management of sickle cell disease recommends that hydroxyurea should be offered to all children aged 9 to 12 months and older with SCA (hemoglobin SS or hemoglobin SSβ0, HbSS/HbSβ0), regardless of clinical severity. Currently, hydroxyurea is recommended as a lifelong medication for patients meeting the treatment criteria, as there is no similarly efficacious second-line medication.

Observational studies document the long-term efficacy of hydroxyurea relative to never using hydroxyurea. Among a cohort of patients followed for 17.5 years, long-term use of hydroxyurea was associated with reductions in pulmonary complications and overall mortality. A separate study documented that, when compared with historic controls who never took hydroxyurea, infants and young children with SCA had fewer episodes of acute chest syndrome and better growth after 4 years on hydroxyurea. Another study documented that hydroxyurea is a viable alternative to chronic transfusion therapy in primary (though not secondary) stroke prevention. Other observational studies have confirmed long-term safety in varied settings.

Of note, there are no published data on the time-varying effect of hydroxyurea. Although it has been shown that long-term use of hydroxyurea…

### A simplified hydroxyurea dosing approach for paediatric sickle cell anaemia in Nigeria: addressing emergency care burden and adherence barriers in low-resource settings [^112Nqi8x]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is a hereditary haematological disorder predominantly affecting individuals of African descent, with significant global health implications. It is characterized by the production of sickle-shaped erythrocytes, leading to vaso-occlusive crises and complications such as acute chest syndrome, stroke, and increased susceptibility to infections. Sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden of this disease, with Nigeria accounting for nearly 150,000 births annually. Despite advances in the understanding and management of SCA, children in resource-limited settings continue to experience high morbidity and mortality due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and limited access to effective therapies.

Hydroxyurea (also known as hydroxycarbamide) is an oral medication that has become a cornerstone of SCA management. It increases foetal haemoglobin production, which in turn inhibits the polymerization of sickle haemoglobin and reduces red cell sickling. Numerous clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that hydroxyurea therapy significantly decreases the frequency of painful crises, hospitalizations, and the need for blood transfusions in SCA patients. Its efficacy in improving quality of life and overall survival has led to recommendations for its use as a standard of care for SCA, including endorsement by the World Health Organization (WHO).

However, the uptake of hydroxyurea in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been limited by multiple challenges. Key barriers include the high cost of the medication.

### Genetic modifiers of fetal hemoglobin affect the course of sickle cell disease in patients treated with hydroxyurea [^111wNBzn]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Patients were recruited through the nationwide German SCD registry (NCT03327428), which collects prospective and retrospective data on patients with SCD in Germany. The study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and received approval from the institutional review board of the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University (S-416/2014). Written informed consent was obtained from patients or their legal guardians.

The data collected included demographic information, diagnosis and genotype, treatment details, laboratory parameters, and clinical events. By the data cutoff date of May 13, 2020, 425 patients with homozygous SCD from 28 different institutions had been enrolled in the registry. The data analysis was conducted by PA, JK, NA, and AK-S, with all co-authors having access to the full registry data.

Treatment guidelines implemented in 2014 recommend parental education, the use of penicillin prophylaxis until at least the age of 5 years, and annual transcranial Doppler ultrasound screening from ages 2 to 18. Hydroxyurea use is encouraged for all patients with SCD who have experienced a vaso-occlusive crisis, even mild ones. The recommended starting dose of hydroxyurea is 15 mg/kg/day for adults and 20 mg/kg/day for children. If the initial dose is insufficient, escalating the dose to the maximum tolerated amount or up to 35 mg/kg/day is advised.

For the analysis of the frequency and distribution of genetic modifiers, patients with homozygous SCD of all ages and irrespective of treatment were included.

### Treatment options for sickle cell disease [^112EJAt6]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) complications begin with the polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (HbS). Thus, SCD therapies focus on preventing HbS production or reducing the circulating amount of HbS. Hydroxyurea treatment has become more widespread, whereas the number of evidence-based indications for erythrocyte transfusion is small. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is a curative option for SCD, but less than 25% of patients have a suitable donor.

This article focuses on supportive and preventive care improvements and the benefits of hydroxyurea. Indications for erythrocyte transfusion, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and gene therapy trials are also summarized.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^114WVqpX]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Over the past decades, important advances have been made in the field of therapeutic options for sickle cell disease (SCD), the world's most common genetic blood disorder. Disease-modifying treatments, including drugs like hydroxyurea or red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (i.e. simple top-up transfusion [ST], manual RBC exchange [mRBCx, consisting of ST and phlebotomy], or automated RBC exchange [aRBCx]), play a major role in preventing complications. Early detection and infection prevention have led to a decrease in childhood mortality caused by SCD, which is now considered a chronic disease in high-income countries. This, in turn, shifts the burden of disease more toward the adult population, including pregnant individuals. Compared to their healthy counterparts, pregnant people with SCD have worse maternal and fetal outcomes, with higher rates of preeclampsia and eclampsia, premature birth, and intrauterine growth retardation. In addition, the risk of SCD-related complications like acute pain episodes requiring hospitalization or acute chest syndrome (ACS) increases during pregnancy.

Therapeutic options for SCD management, including SCD-modifying therapy and supportive interventions for pain control, are limited for pregnant people. The use of hydroxyurea is not recommended during pregnancy because of a potentially increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, and concerns about teratogenic effects. Opioids commonly used for pain management can cause neonatal abstinence syndrome and other negative outcomes in the newborns when administered during pregnancy.

### Genetic modifiers of fetal hemoglobin affect the course of sickle cell disease in patients treated with hydroxyurea [^111Doyvg]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

The major limitation of our study is the selection of few genetic markers that, with the exception of α-thalassemia trait, focus on the expression of HbF but do not consider other mechanisms that may modify the phenotype of SCD. As HbF-boosting polymorphisms are enriched in patients who do not originate from sub-Saharan Africa, we cannot fully discriminate between the effects of single polymorphisms, the genetic background, or even social and behavioral factors. For future studies, a genome-wide characterization of patients may help in the identification of genetic traits causally related to the phenotype of SCD, even in ethnically heterogeneous groups of patients.

In addition, we observed a relatively short period of a maximum of 4 years in young patients who were enrolled in a registry, not in a controlled clinical trial. Because the registry design does not intend source data verification, we do not expect the laboratory parameters and the data on clinical complications to be as complete as in a clinical trial. Similarly, we do not have direct data monitoring patients' adherence to hydroxyurea treatment. However, HbF levels and MCV in these patients were consistently higher than those in hydroxyurea-naïve patients, compatible with good adherence to treatment in the majority of patients.

The γ-globin promoter polymorphism rs7482144 was strongly associated with both pain crises and a reduced need for transfusions, indicating that the same genetic trait may have divergent effects on different phenotypic aspects of SCD. This is one reason why general conclusions on the…

### Optimal disease management and health monitoring in adults with sickle cell disease [^113aVDFZ]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Low credibility.

In countries with access to organized health care, survival of children with sickle cell disease (SCD) has greatly improved, resulting in a growing population of adults with SCD. Transition from pediatric to adult care presents many challenges for the patient, who now faces the reality of emerging complications in many organs that are cumulative, adding to other age-related nonsickle conditions that interact and add to the disease morbidity. We recommend regular comprehensive annual assessments, monitoring for early signs of organ damage, and joint clinics with relevant specialists if applicable. While maintaining a low threshold for intervention with disease-modifying therapies, we should always keep in mind that there is no single complication that is pathognomonic of SCD, and nonsickle comorbidities should always be excluded and treated if present. We need to reevaluate our approach to managing adults with SCD by putting a greater emphasis on multidisciplinary care while proactively considering curative options, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant and gene therapy, and experimental pharmacological agents for adults with SCD of all ages before complications render the patients ineligible for these treatments.

### Optimizing hydroxyurea therapy for sickle cell anemia [^113J2DSB]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea has proven efficacy in numerous clinical trials as a disease-modifying treatment for patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA), but it is currently under-used in clinical practice. To improve the effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy, efforts should be directed toward broadening the clinical treatment indications, optimizing the daily dosage, and emphasizing the benefits of early and extended treatment. This discussion focuses on various issues related to hydroxyurea treatment, drawing from both published evidence and clinical experience.

- **Guidance on hydroxyurea treatment**: Specific guidance is provided regarding important but potentially unfamiliar aspects of hydroxyurea treatment for SCA, such as escalating to maximum tolerated dose, treating in the setting of cerebrovascular disease, switching from chronic transfusions to hydroxyurea, and using serial phlebotomy to alleviate iron overload.

- **Future research directions**: Future research directions to optimize hydroxyurea therapy include personalized dosing based on pharmacokinetic modeling, predicting fetal hemoglobin responses based on pharmacogenomics, and assessing the risks and benefits of hydroxyurea for non-SCA genotypes and during pregnancy/lactation.

Another critical initiative is the introduction of hydroxyurea safely and effectively into global regions with a high disease burden of SCA but limited resources, such as sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and India. Final considerations emphasize the long-term goal of optimizing hydroxyurea therapy, aiming for treatment to be accepted as a standard of care for all patients with SCA.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^111o4uJL]. Haematologica (2025). Low credibility.

The prescription of hydroxyurea at an optimized dose is a necessary first step, but it is not sufficient. There are many barriers to optimal treatment, including challenges with medication adherence, with reported rates of adherence to hydroxyurea ranging from 12% to 100% in children. Like any chronic and often apparently quiescent disease, there will be barriers and interruptions to chronic medication therapy that should be expected and mitigated with dedicated infrastructure. Given that a subset of barriers are social challenges, at minimum, a dedicated social work program is needed. We also recommend dedicated psychologists to improve adherence and self-management.

Hydroxyurea increases the MCV and HbF, so displaying long-term trends in these measures is useful to understand medication effects (dosing, adherence) over time and is a helpful way to reinforce medication adherence, along with monitoring pharmacy refills. Reviewing morphological improvements on the blood smear (comparison of before and during hydroxyurea therapy) with patients and families can also promote adherence.

Consistency in prescribing practices across the medical team is needed and should be supported by institutional guidelines. All members of the team (nurses, nurse practitioners, social workers, etc) need to understand the importance of optimized disease-modifying therapy to provide regular reinforcement and support to patients who have this severe chronic disease. A population-level quality improvement effort is also needed to monitor hydroxyurea prescription rates, HbF levels, and clinical outcomes.

### Emerging disease-modifying therapies for sickle cell disease [^112sRWgk]. Haematologica (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease afflicts millions of people worldwide and approximately 100,000 Americans. Complications are myriad and arise as a result of complex pathological pathways "downstream" to a point mutation in DNA, and include red blood cell membrane damage, inflammation, chronic hemolytic anemia with episodic vaso-occlusion, ischemia and pain, and ultimately risk of cumulative organ damage with reduced lifespan of affected individuals. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's 2014 evidence-based guideline for sickle cell disease management states that additional research is needed before investigational curative therapies will be widely available to most patients with sickle cell disease. At the time of writing, sickle cell disease has been cured by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in approximately 1,000 people, most of whom were children, and significantly ameliorated by gene therapy in a handful of subjects who have only limited follow-up thus far. During a timespan in which over 20 agents were approved for the treatment of cystic fibrosis by the Food and Drug Administration, similar approval was granted for only two drugs for sickle cell disease (hydroxyurea and L-glutamine) despite the higher prevalence of sickle cell disease. This trajectory appears to be changing, as the lack of multimodal agent therapy in sickle cell disease has spurred engagement among many in academia and industry who, in the last decade, have developed new drugs poised to prevent complications and alleviate suffering. Identified therapeutic strategies include fetal hemoglobin induction, inhibition…

### Evaluation of pharmacological efficacy and safety of hydroxyurea in sickle cell disease: Study of a pediatric cohort from Chhattisgarh, India [^115D87xy]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a condition involving abnormal hemoglobin associated with a severe clinical phenotype and complications. Hydroxyurea (HU) is a drug approved by the US FDA and commonly used for treating adult SCD patients with clinical severity. However, its use in pediatric groups remains atypical. Despite the high prevalence of the disease in Chhattisgarh, there is a lack of evidence supporting its use in pediatric patients.

This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacological and clinical efficacy and safety of HU in a large pediatric cohort with SCD from Central India. The study cohort consisted of 164 SCD children (138 with Hb SS and 26 with Hb S beta-thalassemia) who were 14 years of age or younger and on HU therapy. These children were monitored for toxicity, hematological, and clinical efficacy at baseline (pre-HU) and after 24 months (post-HU).

The results highlight the beneficial effects of HU at a mean dose of 18.7 ± 7.0 mg/kg/day. A significant improvement was observed in both physical and clinical parameters, as well as hematological parameters, including fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), total hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) levels when evaluated against the baseline. No significant adverse effects were observed during the treatment period. Similar results were obtained from independent analysis of Hb SS and Hb Sβ patients.

These findings strengthen the evidence for the beneficial effects of hydroxyurea in the pediatric population, showing no serious adverse effects, and support the expansion of its use under regular monitoring.

### Does hydroxyurea prevent pulmonary complications of sickle cell disease [^116LiL5k]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

A 27-year-old man with sickle cell disease (HbSS) presents to the sickle cell clinic for follow-up following a screening echocardiogram revealed an increased tricuspid regurgitant velocity of 2.7 m/s. He has a history of two painful crises per year and has been hospitalized three times over the past ten years for management of painful crises. He had one episode of acute chest syndrome at age 15 that was treated with an RBC exchange transfusion, supplemental oxygen, and intravenous antibiotics; mechanical ventilation was not required. He has not experienced additional episodes of acute chest syndrome and does not have a history of stroke, retinopathy, or leg ulcers. The patient has never been treated with hydroxyurea and wants to know whether hydroxyurea will prevent future pulmonary complications related to sickle cell disease.

### Transfusion therapy for sickle cell disease: What's new [^116hR6oz]. Blood Advances (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of the 2020 guidelines was to provide evidence-based recommendations for RBC transfusion support in patients with SCD. Because high-quality evidence was not uniformly available for each transfusion topic, the panel's goal was to provide clinical decision support for shared decision-making by patients and clinicians based on the available evidence. Ongoing clinical trials studying chronic transfusion therapy for pregnant women with SCD, or adults with SCD and pulmonary arterial hypertension (SCD and Cardiovascular Risk–RBC Exchange trial [SCD-CARRE]), will guide future recommendations. As new therapeutics are approved and ongoing clinical trials provide new evidence, guideline monitoring will continue to incorporate new management approaches and highlight top research priorities.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^117NrCtu]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

Consensus was not reached regarding the Hb level that should be targeted before delivery, with 5 of 12 experts (41.7%) indicating that this should be determined on a case-by-case basis. However, most panelists (9 of 12, 75.0%) agreed that the targeted level would not differ between vaginal delivery or cesarean section, assuming all other variables are the same.

- **Consensus results of the Delphi panel for delivery and follow-up**: Most panelists (8 of 12, 66.7%) would prefer ST over other transfusion modalities (i.e. mRBCx [modified/partial] or aRBCx) for a pregnant individual with SCD not receiving prophylactic transfusion therapy during pregnancy but who needed transfusion before delivery; however, consensus was not reached. Panelists who neither agreed nor disagreed with this statement indicated their decision would depend on the Hb level.

More than half of the experts (7 of 12, 58.3%) agreed that in the absence of maternal and/or fetal complications, spontaneous labor should be awaited up to 40 weeks of gestation, and half disagreed with inducing labor or planning a cesarean section at 36 to 38 weeks of gestation; the results were consistent across specializations. However, a consensus was not reached. Panelists strongly agreed (11 of 12, 91.7%) that the decision for labor induction or elective cesarean section should be taken by a multidisciplinary team including OB/GYN specialists, hematologists, neonatologists, anesthesiologists, and blood bank specialists.

Most panelists (10 of 12, 83.3%) also agreed that in addition

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^111v2Q8f]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

- **Prevention of complications**: Most panelists (9 of 12, 75.0%) would start prophylactic transfusion therapy for patients with heterozygous HbS (HbSC) genotype who started experiencing frequent acute pain episodes leading to hospitalization during their pregnancy, even in the absence of other risk factors. Although consensus was not reached, more than 50% of the panelists (7 of 12, 58.3%) stated that a patient's genotype (HbSC vs. HbSS) would not influence their decision to start prophylactic transfusions to prevent SCD-related complications, assuming all other disease- and pregnancy-related factors are the same.

- **Treatment of complications**: Consensus was not reached regarding the criteria (including the Hb cut-off level) to be considered for performing a transfusion for a pregnant patient with SCD and progressively worsening asymptomatic anemia, although all panelists would recommend transfusions in at least one of the proposed scenarios. Transfusion would be recommended by half of the panelists if the patient's Hb level dropped to < 7 g/dL, and by over half of the panelists (8 of 12, 66.7%) if the patient's Hb level dropped to < 4 g/dL, or if the patient became symptomatic. Panelists who did not select the 4 g/dL Hb threshold preferred to recommend transfusion at a higher Hb level. Over half of the panelists (8 of 12, 66.7%) would not recommend transfusion following a single uncomplicated pain episode.

### Evolving treatment paradigms in sickle cell disease [^115avhwL]. Hematology. American Society of Hematology Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inheritable hemoglobinopathy characterized by the polymerization of hemoglobin S in red blood cells, resulting in chronic hemolytic anemia, vaso-occlusive painful crisis, and multiorgan damage. In SCD, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation occurs both inside the red blood cells and within the vascular lumen, augmenting hemolysis and cellular adhesion. This review discusses the evolving body of literature on the role of ROS in the pathophysiology of SCD, as well as some emerging therapeutic approaches to SCD with a focus on the reduction of ROS.

### The modern use of hydroxyurea for children with sickle cell anemia [^116BbXTZ]. Haematologica (2025). High credibility.

In this modern era of rapid advancements in the treatment of sickle cell anemia (SCA), whether pharmacological or genetic, it is crucial to remain mindful of the safe and broadly effective disease-modifying therapy provided by hydroxyurea. The express goal is to prevent chronic organ damage that can develop while awaiting genetic or curative therapy. Simultaneously, it is essential to modernize our use of hydroxyurea and not continue prescribing it as was done several decades ago.

The more significant risk is the under-treatment of this severe and unforgiving disease. Hydroxyurea should be offered more widely and at optimal doses, ideally using precision dosing. As has been opined about hydroxyurea: do not leave for tomorrow what you can do today; prescribe it early and often.

### Hemoglobin sickle cell disease complications: A clinical study of 179 cases [^111Q4Qsk]. Haematologica (2012). Low credibility.

Hemoglobin sickle cell disease is one of the most frequent hemoglobinopathies. Surprisingly, few studies have been dedicated to this disease, which is currently considered a mild variant of homozygous sickle cell disease. The aim of this study was to update our knowledge about hemoglobin sickle cell disease.

- **Design and methods**: The study involved a single-center series of 179 patients. Clinical and biological data were collected, with special attention to the assessment of pulmonary arterial hypertension and nephropathy.

- **Results**: Hemoglobin sickle cell diagnosis was delayed and performed in adulthood in 29% of cases. The prevalence of hospitalized painful vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome, and priapism was 36%, 20%, and 20%, respectively. The most common chronic organ complications were retinopathy and sensorineural otological disorders, occurring in 70% and 29% of cases, respectively. The prevalence of complications commonly reported in homozygous sickle cell disease, such as nephropathy, suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, strokes, and leg ulcers, was relatively low (13%, 4%, and 1%, respectively). Phlebotomy was performed in 36% of this population with a baseline hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dL and prevented recurrence of acute events in 71% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Our data suggest that hemoglobin sickle cell disease should not be considered a mild form of sickle cell anemia. Instead, it should be recognized as a separate disease, with special emphasis on viscosity-associated otological and ophthalmological disorders, and a low prevalence of vasculopathy (strokes, pulmonary hypertension, ulcers, and nephropathy). Phlebotomy was found to be useful in managing the condition.

### Management of sickle cell disease: Summary of the 2014 evidence-based report by expert panel members [^111whY3h]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a life-threatening genetic disorder affecting nearly 100,000 individuals in the United States and is associated with many acute and chronic complications requiring immediate medical attention. Two disease-modifying therapies, hydroxyurea and long-term blood transfusions, are available but underused.

The objective of this report is to support and expand the number of health professionals able and willing to provide care for persons with SCD.

- **Evidence review**: Databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, TOXLINE, and Scopus were searched using prespecified search terms and keywords. The goal was to identify randomized clinical trials, nonrandomized intervention studies, and observational studies. Literature searches of English-language publications from 1980, with updates through April 1, 2014, addressed key questions developed by the expert panel members and methodologists.

- **Findings**: Strong recommendations for preventive services include daily oral prophylactic penicillin up to the age of 5 years, annual transcranial Doppler examinations from the ages of 2 to 16 years in those with sickle cell anemia, and long-term transfusion therapy to prevent stroke in children with abnormal transcranial Doppler velocity (≥ 200 cm/s). Strong recommendations addressing acute complications include rapid initiation of opioids for the treatment of severe pain associated with a vaso-occlusive crisis and the use of incentive spirometry in hospitalized patients.

### Managing sickle cell disease and related complications in pregnancy: Results of an international Delphi panel [^111j33QU]. Blood Advances (2024). Low credibility.

The Delphi panel aimed to reach a consensus on transfusion guidelines for pregnant patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). There was no alignment among panelists on the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to target when recommending prophylactic transfusion therapy for these patients.

Consensus was reached by 75.0% of the panelists (9 out of 12) on a pretransfusion target. However, 66.7% of the panelists (8 out of 12) would not choose automated red blood cell exchange (aRBCx) over standard transfusion (ST) and modified/partial red blood cell exchange (mRBCx) to prevent alloimmunization, assuming the same method of RBC phenotyping/genotyping, resulting in no consensus.

The panelists reached consensus on recommending sickle trait-negative blood products, with 83.3% (10 of 12) in favor, and leukocyte-reduced (pre-storage) blood products, supported by 75.0% of the panelists (9 of 12), for pregnant individuals with SCD.

For prophylactic transfusions, 83.3% of the panelists (10 out of 12) recommended peripheral venous access whenever possible. Additionally, 75.0% agreed that even if venous access is difficult, the same transfusion modality should be used, utilizing a different access method. None of the panelists would alter their decision to recommend transfusion in such cases.

### Effects of hydroxyurea treatment for patients with hemoglobin SC disease [^115nHbsh]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Although hemoglobin SC (HbSC) disease is usually considered less severe than sickle cell anemia (SCA), which includes HbSS and HbS/β(0)-thalassemia genotypes, many patients with HbSC experience severe disease complications. These complications include vaso-occlusive pain, acute chest syndrome, avascular necrosis, retinopathy, and poor quality of life. Despite 20 years having passed since the clinical and laboratory efficacy of hydroxyurea was proven in adult SCA patients, the safety and utility of hydroxyurea treatment for HbSC patients remain unclear. Recent NHLBI evidence-based guidelines highlight this as a critical knowledge gap, noting that HbSC accounts for approximately 30% of sickle cell patients within the United States. At the time of writing, only five publications have reported short-term, incomplete, or conflicting laboratory and clinical outcomes of hydroxyurea treatment in a total of 71 adults and children with HbSC.

We now report on a cohort of 133 adult and pediatric HbSC patients who received hydroxyurea, typically for vaso-occlusive pain. Hydroxyurea treatment was associated with a stable hemoglobin concentration, increased fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and reduced white blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute reticulocyte count (ARC). Reversible cytopenias occurred in 22% of patients, primarily neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Painful events were reduced with hydroxyurea, more so in patients over 15 years old. These multicenter data support the safety and potentially salutary effects of hydroxyurea treatment for HbSC disease; however, a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial is needed to further substantiate these findings.
