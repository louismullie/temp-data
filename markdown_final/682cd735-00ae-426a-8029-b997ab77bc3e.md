## Question

Can amiodarone be used to treat bradycardia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether amiodarone can be used to treat bradycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-approved indications to confirm what amiodarone is actually intended to treat. Then, I should verify the labeled contraindications, especially around preexisting bradycardia and conduction disease. Next, I will review adverse effect data to see how often bradycardia occurs with amiodarone. After that, I need to examine the pharmacologic mechanism to determine whether it would plausibly improve or worsen slow heart rates. I will then check real-world toxicity reports and overdose guidance to see how amiodarone-associated bradycardia is managed. Finally, I should confirm guideline-recommended therapies for bradycardia and synthesize whether any scenario justifies amiodarone for treating bradycardia itself [^1148gwhd] [^115iyQDG].

> Let me first confirm the core indication question because I need to ensure we are anchored in labeling before inferring practice. The FDA labeling for Pacerone states amiodarone is indicated for documented, life-threatening ventricular fibrillation and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia, which are tachyarrhythmias rather than bradyarrhythmias, and there is no labeled use for treating bradycardia itself [^1148gwhd] [^117Y97dE].

> Wait, let me verify contraindications because that will immediately clarify risk boundaries. The FDA lists sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block, and bradycardia leading to syncope without a functioning pacemaker as contraindications to amiodarone, reflecting concern that the drug can worsen slow conduction and low heart rates in the absence of pacing support [^112Rmfdh].

> I should now review adverse effect signals to see how often bradycardia actually occurs on therapy. Both the IV and oral SPL warnings explicitly note that amiodarone can cause symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest, reinforcing that bradycardia is a toxicity signal rather than a therapeutic target, and symptomatic bradycardia has been observed in clinical studies including postoperative prophylaxis cohorts and during IV administration where hypotension and bradyarrhythmia are prominent early adverse effects that at times require dose adjustment or discontinuation [^1153wCQy] [^117LW65H] [^112XPfWo] [^11526TGA].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism without checking the electrophysiology. Amiodarone is a multichannel blocker with antiadrenergic effects that include beta-blocking and calcium channel–blocking properties, which depress sinus node automaticity and slow AV nodal conduction, so mechanistically it is expected to exacerbate or induce bradycardia rather than correct it, especially in susceptible patients with intrinsic conduction system disease [^112XrmK9] [^1113fAZY].

> I should double-check real-world toxicity contexts because they can crystallize management. Serious symptomatic bradycardia including cardiac arrest has been repeatedly reported when amiodarone is coadministered with sofosbuvir-containing regimens, prompting FDA warnings and recommendations for inpatient cardiac monitoring at initiation, and case reports document extreme bradycardia and asystole within hours of coadministration, with resolution after stopping the hepatitis C therapy or amiodarone, which underscores causality and clinical risk [^117FJ9WM] [^1125bVQ9] [^116j2ex1].

> Let me verify how clinicians are told to treat amiodarone-associated bradycardia, because that will reveal whether the drug is considered causal. In both oral and IV overdose guidance, the FDA directs clinicians to manage ensuing bradycardia with beta-adrenergic agonists and temporary pacing as needed, which is consistent with bradycardia being a toxic effect of amiodarone rather than a therapeutic aim [^113QwyUw] [^114zG7uS].

> Next, I should review guideline-based therapy for bradycardia to be sure I am not overlooking any niche role for antiarrhythmics. Contemporary bradycardia management recommends atropine for symptomatic sinus bradycardia in acute coronary syndromes and escalation to beta-agonists or temporary pacing when indicated, while permanent pacing is used for persistent or high-grade conduction system disease; antiarrhythmics like amiodarone are not indicated to treat bradycardia and instead are recognized as negative chronotropes that can worsen it, especially when combined with other rate-slowing drugs [^115iyQDG] [^115gLXxM] [^113BvFNW].

> But wait, what if a patient needs amiodarone for tachyarrhythmia control and also has intermittent bradycardia; could that be an exception. Let me reconsider with the label in mind. The labeling allows that contraindications related to bradycardia are specifically in those without a functioning pacemaker, implying that if a pacemaker is present to protect against slow rates, amiodarone may be used for its intended tachyarrhythmic indications in carefully selected scenarios; that still does not make amiodarone a treatment for bradycardia itself, and even in atrial fibrillation care, expert guidance restricts amiodarone to selected patients for rate or rhythm control after weighing risks, not for alleviating slow heart rates [^112Rmfdh] [^111ZhBxQ] [^112RemVt].

> In synthesis, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and aligned with evidence. There is no evidence or guideline support for using amiodarone to treat bradycardia; rather, bradycardia is a contraindication without pacing support and a well-documented adverse effect, with guideline-endorsed therapies for symptomatic bradycardia being atropine, beta-agonists, and temporary or permanent pacing as appropriate; therefore, amiodarone should not be used to treat bradycardia, and if bradycardia occurs on amiodarone, the response is drug withdrawal or dose modification with supportive chronotropic therapy and pacing when indicated [^1148gwhd] [^112Rmfdh] [^115iyQDG] [^114zG7uS] [^113QwyUw].

---

No — amiodarone is **not used to treat bradycardia** [^115iyQDG]. It is contraindicated in patients with bradycardia, sick sinus syndrome, or second- or third-degree AV block without a pacemaker [^112Rmfdh] because it can cause or worsen bradycardia and conduction block [^1153wCQy]. If bradycardia occurs during amiodarone therapy, **stop the drug** and treat with atropine, isoproterenol, or temporary pacing as needed [^113QwyUw] [^114zG7uS]. Amiodarone is **indicated only for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias**, not for bradycardia management [^1148gwhd] [^117Y97dE].

---

## Pharmacological effects of amiodarone on heart rate and conduction

Amiodarone has **complex electrophysiological effects** that significantly affect heart rate and cardiac conduction [^115ZRH51]:

- **Sinus node suppression**: Amiodarone can suppress sinus node automaticity [^113L8aRS], leading to sinus bradycardia or sinus arrest [^1153wCQy].

- **AV nodal conduction delay**: Amiodarone prolongs AV nodal conduction, potentially causing first-degree, second-degree, or complete AV block [^1153wCQy] [^115ZRH51].

- **Negative chronotropic effects**: Amiodarone exhibits negative chronotropic properties [^115ZRH51], further contributing to bradycardia [^1153wCQy].

---

## Clinical evidence of amiodarone-induced bradycardia

Multiple clinical studies and case reports have documented **bradycardia** with amiodarone therapy [^116bfvJh]:

- **Incidence**: Bradycardia is a common adverse effect of amiodarone, occurring in approximately 1–10% of patients receiving intravenous amiodarone [^116bfvJh] [^112XPfWo].

- **Severity**: Bradycardia induced by amiodarone can be severe, leading to symptomatic bradycardia, sinus arrest, or even cardiac arrest [^1153wCQy] [^114zG7uS].

- **Risk factors**: The risk of bradycardia is increased in patients with pre-existing sinus node dysfunction, AV conduction abnormalities, electrolyte disturbances, or concomitant use of other negative chronotropic medications [^1153wCQy] [^115ZRH51] [^117FJ9WM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines and expert consensus provide **clear recommendations** on the use of amiodarone in patients with bradycardia [^115iyQDG]:

- **Contraindications**: Amiodarone is contraindicated in patients with sick sinus syndrome, second- or third-degree AV block, or bradycardia leading to syncope without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh] [^117LW65H].

- **Monitoring**: Patients receiving amiodarone should be closely monitored for the development of bradycardia or conduction disturbances, particularly during initiation and dose adjustments [^1153wCQy] [^112ce4FK].

- **Management of bradycardia**: If significant bradycardia occurs during amiodarone therapy, the drug should be discontinued or the dose reduced. Temporary pacing or pharmacological interventions (e.g. atropine, isoproterenol) may be required in severe cases [^113QwyUw] [^114zG7uS] [^115iyQDG].

---

## Alternative treatments for bradycardia

Several **alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments** are available for managing bradycardia. **Pharmacological treatments** commonly used to manage symptomatic bradycardia include atropine, isoproterenol, dopamine, and epinephrine [^113QwyUw] [^113kzc2f] [^115iyQDG], while **non-pharmacological treatments** involve temporary or permanent pacemaker implantation for persistent or symptomatic bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction or AV block [^115gLXxM] [^116DFwwC].

---

## Risks and complications of using amiodarone in bradycardic patients

Using amiodarone in patients with pre-existing bradycardia or conduction abnormalities [^1153wCQy] can lead to **significant risks and complications**, including worsening bradycardia leading to syncope or cardiac arrest [^114zG7uS] and induction or exacerbation of AV block that may necessitate temporary or permanent pacing [^1153wCQy]. Beyond its bradycardic effects, amiodarone is also associated with pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and proarrhythmic effects [^113Qeczr] [^117NzRB4].

---

## Clinical scenarios where amiodarone may be considered despite bradycardia

In rare cases, amiodarone may be considered despite bradycardia if appropriate precautions are taken. In these situations, **life-threatening arrhythmias** (e.g. ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia) may warrant amiodarone use despite bradycardia when temporary pacing or other supportive measures are available [^1148gwhd] [^117Y97dE], and in **pacemaker-dependent patients**, it may be used cautiously with close monitoring and adjustment of device settings as necessary [^1153wCQy] [^115ZRH51].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Amiodarone is **not indicated for the treatment of bradycardia** [^1148gwhd]. It is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing bradycardia, sinus node dysfunction, or AV block without a functioning pacemaker [^112Rmfdh]. Because amiodarone can cause or exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances, careful monitoring and management are required [^112ce4FK]. Alternative pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments should be considered for managing bradycardia [^115iyQDG].

### Signifor [^116vrVMv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia and QT prolongation**: Bradycardia has been reported with the use of Signifor [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Patients with cardiac disease and/or risk factors for bradycardia, such as a history of clinically significant bradycardia, high-grade heart block, or concomitant use of drugs associated with bradycardia, should be carefully monitored. Dose adjustments of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or correction of electrolyte disturbances may be necessary.

- **QT prolongation**: Signifor is associated with QT prolongation. In two thorough QT studies with Signifor, QT prolongation occurred at therapeutic and supra-therapeutic doses. Signifor should be used with caution in patients who are at significant risk of developing prolongation of QTc, such as those with congenital long QT prolongation, uncontrolled or significant cardiac disease (including recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or clinically significant bradycardia), on anti-arrhythmic therapy or other substances known to lead to QT prolongation, and with hypokalemia and/or hypomagnesemia.

A baseline ECG is recommended before initiating therapy with Signifor, and monitoring for an effect on the QTc interval is advisable. Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia must be corrected prior to Signifor administration and should be monitored periodically during therapy.

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^116tZDCj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of amiodarone hydrochloride IV for the treatment of stable ventricular tachycardia in adults is as follows:

- **Loading**: 150 mg IV bolus
- **Subsequently**: 1 mg/min IV continuous infusion over the next 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min IV continuous infusion over the remaining 18 hours.

---

### Corlanor [^113BvFNW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Corlanor has several important drug interactions to consider, specifically regarding CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers and negative chronotropes.

- **CYP3A4-based interactions**: Corlanor is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors increases ivabradine plasma concentrations, while CYP3A4 inducers decrease them. Increased plasma concentrations may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors include azole antifungals (e.g. itraconazole), macrolide antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin, telithromycin), HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir), and nefazodone. Avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, verapamil, and grapefruit juice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Additionally, avoid CYP3A4 inducers such as St. John's wort, rifampicin, barbiturates, and phenytoin.

- **Negative chronotropes**: Most patients receiving Corlanor will also be treated with a beta-blocker. The risk of bradycardia increases with the concomitant administration of drugs that slow heart rate (e.g. digoxin, amiodarone, beta-blockers). It is crucial to monitor heart rate in patients taking Corlanor with other negative chronotropes.

### Comparison of beta-blockers, amiodarone plus beta-blockers, or sotalol for prevention of shocks from implantable cardioverter defibrillators: The OPTIC study: A randomized trial [^111Yv6QN]. JAMA (2006). High credibility.

Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy is effective but is associated with high-voltage shocks that are painful.

- **Objective**: To determine whether amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol are more effective than beta-blocker alone for the prevention of ICD shocks.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A randomized controlled trial with blinded adjudication of events was conducted with 412 patients from 39 outpatient ICD clinical centers located in Canada, Germany, the United States, England, Sweden, and Austria. The trial ran from January 13, 2001, to September 28, 2004. Patients were eligible if they had received an ICD within 21 days for inducible or spontaneously occurring ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to receive treatment for 1 year with amiodarone plus beta-blocker, sotalol alone, or beta-blocker alone.

- **Main outcome measure**: The primary outcome was ICD shock for any reason.

- **Results**: Shocks occurred in 41 patients (38.5%) assigned to beta-blocker alone, 26 (24.3%) assigned to sotalol, and 12 (10.3%) assigned to amiodarone plus beta-blocker. A reduction in the risk of shock was observed with the use of either amiodarone plus beta-blocker or sotalol versus beta-blocker alone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.68; p < 0.001). Amiodarone plus beta-blocker significantly reduced the risk of shock compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14–0.52; p < 0.001) and sotalol (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22–0.85; p = 0.02). There was a trend for sotalol to reduce shocks compared with beta-blocker alone (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–1.01; p = 0.055).

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^1172pub7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals and in patients as part of normal aging or disease. Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above a certain duration.

The 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline) marked a significant shift from prior guidelines, which emphasized device-based implantation recommendations, to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. This review highlights the changes in the new guideline and describes the key elements in evaluating and managing patients presenting with bradycardia.

The dosage of amiodarone hydrochloride PO for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in adults (life-threatening, recurrent, refractory, hemodynamically unstable) is specified as follows:

- **Loading**: 800–1,600 mg PO daily for 1–3 weeks until an initial therapeutic response is achieved.
- **Subsequently**: 600–800 mg PO daily for 1 month.
- **Maintenance**: 400 mg PO daily.

### Extreme bradycardia after first doses of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir in patients receiving amiodarone: 2 cases including a rechallenge [^116j2ex1]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Sofosbuvir and daclatasvir are direct-acting antiviral drugs used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection. In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration and European Medical Agency warned that bradycardia could occur when amiodarone was administered in combination with sofosbuvir, but no case reports had been published. We report extreme bradycardia within 2 hours after intake of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir by two patients receiving amiodarone.

The first patient experienced cardiac asystole 30 minutes after receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir. Amiodarone, sofosbuvir, and daclatasvir treatment were stopped; after ten days, the cardiac evaluation was normal and the patient was discharged. The second patient was taking amiodarone and propranolol. Two hours after receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir, he had an extreme sinus node dysfunction (heart rate of 27 beats/min). Amiodarone and propranolol were stopped, but the patient continued receiving sofosbuvir and daclatasvir for three days, and sinus bradycardia was recorded each day, two hours after intake of these drugs. When he stopped taking the drugs, no bradycardia was observed. Administration of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir on day 13 induced bradycardia two hours after intake. However, no bradycardia occurred following a rechallenge eight weeks after the patient stopped taking amiodarone.

These observations indicate that patients treated with amiodarone should be continuously monitored within the first 48 hours following the initiation of sofosbuvir and daclatasvir.

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^1164e3as]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The dosage of amiodarone hydrochloride IV for the treatment of ventricular tachycardia in adults (pulseless) is detailed as follows:

- **Loading**: 300 mg IV bolus.
- **Subsequently**: 1 mg/min IV continuous infusion over the next 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min IV continuous infusion over the remaining 18 hours.

---

### Sovaldi access [^117FJ9WM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Serious symptomatic bradycardia when coadministered with amiodarone**: Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia and cases requiring pacemaker intervention have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. A fatal cardiac arrest was reported in a patient taking amiodarone who was coadministered a sofosbuvir-containing regimen (Harvoni [ledipasvir/sofosbuvir]). Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with Sovaldi is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative, viable treatment options and who will be coadministered Sovaldi, it is crucial to:

- **Counsel patients** about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia.
- **Recommend cardiac monitoring** in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking Sovaldi and need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative, viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

### A practical guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone: 2007 [^113L8aRS]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is commonly used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in various inpatient and outpatient settings. Overuse and underuse of amiodarone are common, and data regarding patterns of use are sparse and largely anecdotal. Due to adverse drug reactions, proper use is essential to deriving optimal benefits from the drug with the least risk. This guide updates an earlier version published in 2000, reviews indications for the use of amiodarone, and recommends strategies to minimize adverse effects. The recommendations included herein are based on the best available data and the collective experience of the members of the writing committee.

### Amiodarone and the thyroid [^112XrmK9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Among the drugs affecting the thyroid gland, no drug has puzzled and fascinated endocrinologists more than amiodarone. Amiodarone is a potent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking properties. It is very rich in iodine, with a 100-mg tablet containing an amount of iodine that is 250 times the recommended daily iodine requirement. Amiodarone produces characteristic alterations in thyroid function tests in euthyroid patients. Understanding these alterations is crucial in avoiding unnecessary investigations and treatment. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction occurs because of both its iodine content and the direct toxic effects of the compound on thyroid parenchyma.

Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is more common in iodine-deficient regions of the world, whereas amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism is usually seen in iodine-sufficient areas. In contrast to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism, amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a difficult condition to diagnose and treat.

In this review, we discuss the alterations in thyroid function tests seen in euthyroid subjects, the epidemiology and mechanism of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction, treatment options available, and the consequences of amiodarone use in pregnancy and lactation. Finally, we propose a follow-up strategy for patients taking amiodarone.

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^117UFF72]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Cardiac toxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or double in a patient with an elevated baseline.

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Therapy-resistant ventricular tachycardia caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: a case report of electrical storm [^115wY88R]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Electrical storm is a challenging diagnosis for the clinician and requires detailed evaluation of the patient. Amiodarone is frequently used for the cessation of ventricular tachycardia attacks. Within the antiarrhythmic effects of amiodarone, there are some harmful effects associated with the drug. Thyroid gland toxicity is one of the most important adverse effects of amiodarone and is referred to as amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis may alter arrhythmia and lead to frequent ventricular tachycardia attacks. Herein, we report a case of electrical storm caused by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis.

### Dronedarone [^115GtEMk]. Circulation (2009). High credibility.

Amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation. Extra-cardiac side effects have been a limiting factor, especially during chronic use, and may offset its benefits. Dronedarone is a noniodinated benzofuran derivative of amiodarone that has been developed for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Similar to amiodarone, dronedarone is a potent blocker of multiple ion currents, including the rapidly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current, the slowly activating delayed-rectifier potassium current, the inward rectifier potassium current, the acetylcholine-activated potassium current, peak sodium current, and L-type calcium current, and exhibits antiadrenergic effects. It has been studied for the maintenance of sinus rhythm and control of ventricular response during episodes of atrial fibrillation. Dronedarone reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation but may be unsafe in those with severe heart failure. This article reviews evidence of the safety and effectiveness of dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### The continued search for physiological pacing: Where are we now [^116DFwwC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiac pacing is an effective treatment for patients with bradycardia due to sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular block. Despite decades of technological advances, the optimal ventricular pacing site to mimic normal human ventricular physiology and achieve the best hemodynamic response remains elusive. The exploration began with atrial synchronous right ventricular (RV) apical pacing, progressing through alternative RV pacing sites, minimizing RV pacing, biventricular pacing, left ventricular (LV) pacing, and His-bundle pacing. Understanding the deleterious effects of long-term RV apical pacing in vulnerable populations has created tremendous interest in alternative pacing options.

This paper reviews the status of available pacing options, with particular focus on His-bundle pacing. Permanent His-bundle pacing has emerged as the leading candidate for physiological pacing because it provides nearly normal electrical activation of both ventricles and thereby avoids ventricular dyssynchrony. Synchronized LV pacing, multisite LV pacing, and LV endocardial pacing offer promise as novel pacing options in select patients.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^117LSMup]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The effect of amiodarone on conduction velocity (CV) and refractoriness with temperature was examined.

Figure 4A, top panel, presents a representative isochrone map illustrating the effect of amiodarone on CV at 36°C. Amiodarone showed no significant effect on CV at baseline (CV 36‐Alone = 43 ± 3 cm/s versus 36‐Amio = 40 ± 3 ms, P = ns). Ischemia slowed CV; however, this was not influenced by the addition of amiodarone (decrease in CV by 36‐Amio = 47 ± 5% versus 36‐Alone = 50 ± 6%, P = ns).

In Figure 4A, similar conduction slowing (crowding of isochrones) is observed in both 36‐Alone and 36‐Amio during ischemia (right panels) with both demonstrating transmural conduction block. The bottom panel of Figure 4A illustrates the effect of amiodarone on CV at 32°C. Amiodarone did not alter CV at baseline before ischemia (32‐Alone = 35 ± 3 cm/s, 32‐Amio = 34 ± 3 cm/s, P = ns).

However, amiodarone significantly slowed CV during ischemia compared with control (decrease in CV by 32‐Amio = 39 ± 5% versus 32‐Alone = 19 ± 5%, P = 0.03). In the lower part of Figure 4A, there is more conduction slowing (crowding of isochrones) in 32‐Amio compared to 32‐Alone, where conduction is relatively preserved. Importantly, neither demonstrate conduction block. Figure 4B presents summary data on CV slowing from baseline during ischemia and reperfusion at 36°C (left) and 32°C (right).

### Amiodarone and dronedarone: An update [^114eqdRj]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

This article provides a contemporary review of the role of amiodarone and dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation who need to undergo rhythm control therapy for relief of symptoms. Amiodarone is the most widely prescribed antiarrhythmic drug for this indication. Recent findings show that its use is not associated with increased mortality even in patients with advanced structural heart disease. However, its extracardiac side effect profile may limit its widespread use. Dronedarone appears to be a useful drug in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. However, the compound cannot be used in patients with heart failure. In permanent atrial fibrillation, dronedarone is likewise contraindicated based on findings from the PALLAS trial.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^117C6ZLj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Figure 6**: Effect of temperature on arrhythmia initiation with amiodarone.

	**A**: A representative arrhythmia at 36°C with amiodarone (Amio) is demonstrated. At 36°C with amiodarone, programmed electrical stimulation (PES) during ischemia induces ventricular fibrillation (VF). The upper section shows representative recordings at three sites from the endocardium (Site A) to the midmyocardium (Site C). The lower section includes activation time (AT) and repolarization (Repol) time (RT) maps for these PES trials. During steady-state pacing (S1), two premature beats (S2 and S3) are introduced. Conduction slowing and block (indicated by a red line in the upper section and a red bar in the lower section) are observed on the S3 beat, inducing reentrant VF (denoted by black curved arrows in the lower section). Steep repolarization gradients, shown by the crowding of isochrones, are observed in the subendocardium at the site of block (S2 on the Repolarization map).

	**B**: Under the same conditions at 32°C, amiodarone does not induce VF, despite worsening conduction velocity and dispersion of repolarization. No arrhythmia occurs under these conditions. The upper section shows representative recordings at three sites from the midmyocardium (Site A) to the epicardium (Site C). In the lower section, activation time (AT) and repolarization time (RT) maps for these PES trials are displayed. At 32°C, conduction is markedly slowed, but premature beats do not block as repolarization has already occurred when the beats arrive. The repolarization slowing, marked by the crowding of isochrones, occurs further downstream towards the epicardium.

In summary, the addition of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) to amiodarone produces conduction slowing and introduces action potential duration (APD) heterogeneity, increasing the dispersion of repolarization (DOR). However, it does not induce block or reentrant arrhythmias. Amiodarone without…

### Cardiovascular collapse with intravenous amiodarone in children: A multi-center retrospective cohort study [^1123wEKJ]. Pediatric Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the incidence of cardiovascular collapse in children receiving intravenous (IV) amiodarone and to identify the population at risk, a multicenter study was conducted. The study involved patients aged ≤ 18 years who received intravenous amiodarone between January 2005 and December 2015. A retrospective analysis was performed to identify patients who developed cardiovascular collapse, defined as bradycardia and/or hypotension.

Of 456 patients who received amiodarone, cardiovascular collapse occurred in 47 patients (10%). Patient risk factors for collapse in a univariate analysis were as follows: age < 3 months (p = 0.04), depressed cardiac function (p < 0.001), blood pressure below the 3rd percentile (p < 0.001), and high lactate at baseline (p < 0.001). Administration risk factors included bolus administration (p = 0.04) and bolus administration over ≤ 20 minutes (p = 0.04). In multivariate analysis, age, baseline blood pressure less than the 3rd percentile, and rapid bolus delivery were independent risk factors for cardiovascular collapse in the study group. The mortality rate was significantly higher in the collapse group (28% versus 8%).

In conclusion, we found an association between IV amiodarone administration and the risk of developing cardiovascular collapse in a significant subset of children. Extreme caution and careful hemodynamic monitoring are recommended when using IV amiodarone in this population, especially in young infants, hemodynamically compromised patients, and patients receiving rapid amiodarone bolus administration.

### Amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma [^111jiT8i]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia, and respiratory failure three weeks after the initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 μIU/mL (normal: 0.3–5 μIU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was < 0.2 ng/dL (normal: 0.8–1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy, and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit.

He received 500 μg of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 hours of therapy and 150 μg intravenously daily thereafter. Hemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 hours. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 μg orally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24-hour excretion of iodine was 3657 μg (normal: 25–756 μg).

The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, specifically in relation to rate control, long-term control, amiodarone, and dronedarone, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend initiating amiodarone for rate control only in highly selected patients. These include critically ill individuals or those experiencing significant side effects from, or contraindications to, first-line agents. This recommendation follows careful consideration of alternative agents and the risks and benefits associated with amiodarone therapy.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^1176EDwQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Effect of amiodarone on conduction block and inducible arrhythmias with temperature

At 36°C, amiodarone did not prevent conduction block (36-Alone = 6/7, 36-Amio = 5/8). Similarly, the addition of amiodarone did not worsen arrhythmia susceptibility at 36°C (36-Alone = 3/5, 36-Amio = 3/8; one 36-Alone experiment did not undergo PES). At 32°C, CV slowing and worsening of DOR with amiodarone did not promote transmural conduction block (32-Alone = 0/7, 32-Amio = 0/8) and also did not affect arrhythmia susceptibility (32-Alone = 1/4, 32-Amio = 0/8; three 32-Alone experiments did not undergo PES).

Figure 6A shows an arrhythmia induced by PES at 36°C during ischemia with amiodarone. The top panel illustrates the ECG and action potentials from three sites, while the bottom panel displays activation time (upper) and corresponding repolarization time (lower) maps for each beat during the initiation of VF. Extra endocardial beats were given, resulting in subsequent conduction block (site C, upper panel, red block symbol, and S3 activation map, red bar) and reentrant excitation originating from site C (indicated by arrows and the first beat of VF). Block and reentry occur at the site of maximal RG on the previous beat (S2 repolarization time map, site C). VF initiation (upper panels and VF map) occurs by a reentrant mechanism.

Figure 6B demonstrates significant conduction slowing with amiodarone at 32°C (evident in the crowding of isochrones on all activation maps); however, no arrhythmia was induced. This is attributable to the amelioration of RG, which prevents conduction block in the presence of TH, so CV slowing did not increase susceptibility to arrhythmias.

### Amiodarone and thyroid physiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management [^1113fAZY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Although amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic agent, its use is limited by a wide variety of potential toxicities. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive "bench to bedside" overview of the ways amiodarone influences thyroid function.

We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other clinically relevant studies. The search was limited to English-language reports published between 1950 and 2017. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, hypothyroidism, myxedema, hyperthyroidism, thyroid storm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular arrhythmia, and electrical storm.

Google and Google Scholar, as well as bibliographies of identified articles, were reviewed for additional references. We included 163 germane references in this review. Because amiodarone is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic drugs in the United States, the mechanistic, diagnostic, and therapeutic information provided is relevant for practicing clinicians in a wide range of medical specialties.

### May toxicity of amiodarone be prevented by antioxidants? A cell-culture study [^1116x72G]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Innumerous studies have been published regarding the treatment and prophylaxis of postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF). Amiodarone is a type 3 anti-arrhythmic agent frequently used for medical cardioversion with varying protocols. It has potentially serious side effects across a wide spectrum, including photosensitivity, pulmonary toxicity, polyneuropathy, gastrointestinal upset, bradycardia, torsades de pointes (rare), hepatic toxicity, thyroid dysfunction, and ocular complications.

Currently, there are no clinical agents available for the prevention of amiodarone-induced toxicity. The aim of this study is to underline the toxic effects of amiodarone in cell culture media and propose potential antioxidant agents for clinical use to prevent amiodarone-induced toxicity.

### Bradyarrhythmias, temporary and permanent pacing [^115gLXxM]. Critical Care Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is common in critical care units. It may be transient, asymptomatic, and of little consequence, or it can be life-threatening. Bradycardia may result from abnormalities of the sinus node, atrioventricular node, or the His-Purkinje system. It may also be precipitated by drug effects or enhanced vagal tone. Proper diagnosis is pivotal to determining prognosis and management. Temporary and permanent pacing is now readily available, markedly improving the morbidity and mortality associated with bradyarrhythmias.

### Randomized comparison of intravenous procainamide vs. intravenous amiodarone for the acute treatment of tolerated wide QRS tachycardia: the PROCAMIO study [^113h19pL]. European Heart Journal (2017). High credibility.

Unexpected findings: It is clear from the hypothesis and the sample size considerations that we did not expect such a high incidence of major adverse effects in the amiodarone arm. Leak et al. reported on using a bolus of 150 mg of amiodarone in 11 critically ill patients and stated that "hypotension, cardiac failure, and bradyarrhythmias were not induced by this treatment". In 38 critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias, a mean of 242 mg of amiodarone was shown to control heart rate without hypotension in any patient. In a series of 15 patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (reVT), amiodarone at an initial dose of 5 mg/kg over 15 minutes resulted in no significant adverse effects. In severely hypotensive reVT, amiodarone produced less hypotension than bretylium. We hypothesized that if amiodarone was safe in these very sick patients, it would be so in the stable patient with tolerated VT. However, in retrospect, some findings can explain our results:

- **Antiarrhythmic action**: When the arrhythmia is immediately life-threatening, an antiarrhythmic action can produce such a benefit that it overcomes potential adverse effects.

- **Catecholamine counteraction**: In studies performed during resuscitation, all patients had previously received intravenous catecholamines (adrenaline), and in critically ill patients, most were receiving catecholamines. These drugs may have counteracted the hypotensive effects of amiodarone.

Limitations: The study included fewer patients than required according to our sample size calculations. Several reasons probably accounted for this, including the extension of emergency protocols to treat these patients.

### Unusual and early hyperglycemia following amiodarone infusion in two infants [^112VR9xT]. Pediatric cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent that is widely used for tachyarrhythmias, especially ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia. It has some mild short-term effects, such as skin rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and corneal microdeposits, as well as long-term side effects, including thyroid dysfunction, visual disturbances, pulmonary infiltrates, ataxia, and hepatitis. We present two infants who experienced hyperglycemia following amiodarone infusion during the early postoperative period.

### Nexterone [^11526TGA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Persistence of adverse effects**: Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (9 to 36 days) and its metabolite desethylamiodarone (9 to 30 days), adverse reactions or interactions, as well as observed adverse effects, can persist following amiodarone withdrawal.

- **Hypotension**: Hypotension is the most common adverse reaction seen with intravenous amiodarone, occurring most often in the first several hours of treatment and is likely related to the rate of infusion. In some cases, hypotension may be refractory and result in a fatal outcome. Hypotension necessitating alterations in intravenous amiodarone therapy was reported in 3% of patients, with permanent discontinuation required in less than 2% of patients. Treat hypotension initially by slowing the infusion; additional standard therapy may be needed, including vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. Monitor the initial rate of infusion closely and do not exceed the recommended rate [see Dosage and Administration (2)].

- **Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) post-cardiac transplant**: In retrospective studies, amiodarone use in transplant recipients prior to heart transplants has been associated with an increased risk of PGD. PGD is a life-threatening complication of heart transplantation that presents as a left, right, or biventricular dysfunction occurring within the first 24 hours of transplant surgery for which there is no identifiable secondary cause (see section 6.2). Severe PGD may be irreversible. For patients who are on the heart transplant waiting list, consideration should be given to alternative treatments.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^115uMmho]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

Our data, both ex vivo and in vivo, suggest that despite both promoting and ameliorating individual arrhythmia substrates, the overall effect of amiodarone is not proarrhythmic over the range of temperatures used in targeted temperature management (TTM).

- **Acute vs. chronic use**: Clinically and mechanistically, the effects of amiodarone are divided into chronic use and acute intravenous (IV) administration. Acute administration generally produces more conduction delay and less post-repolarization refractoriness than chronic administration.

- **Mechanism of action**: During conduction, amiodarone affects sodium (I Na) and L‐type calcium channels, causing conduction slowing. During repolarization, amiodarone has mixed effects on potassium currents, including I Kr, I Ks, I To, and I K, ATP, which explains the minimal effect on dispersion of repolarization (DOR) under normal conditions. Acute amiodarone administration also does not affect the resting membrane potential.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^111aaehA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The addition of amiodarone to hypothermia worsens ischemia-induced DOR and transmural CV slowing. Despite these apparent worsening of arrhythmia substrates ex vivo, there was no increase in conduction block or inducible arrhythmias in either model. These data suggest that amiodarone may not be proarrhythmic when used during TTM, particularly during ischemia/reperfusion as observed during resuscitation. A potential increase in incidence of PEA observed will be important to further evaluate.

### Innovative approaches to anti-arrhythmic drug therapy [^114g5KqQ]. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2006). Low credibility.

Normal cardiac function requires an appropriate and regular beating rate, known as cardiac rhythm. When the heart rhythm is too fast or too slow, cardiac function can be impaired, resulting in derangements that range from mild symptoms to life-threatening complications. These irregularities, particularly those involving excessively fast or slow rates, are referred to as cardiac 'arrhythmias'.
In the past, treating cardiac arrhythmias with drugs has proven challenging due to inadequate effectiveness and the risk of serious complications. However, a variety of recent advances have opened up exciting possibilities for developing novel and superior approaches to arrhythmia therapy. This article reviews recent progress and future prospects for treating two particularly important cardiac arrhythmias: atrial fibrillation and ventricular fibrillation.

### Oral amiodarone for prevention of atrial fibrillation after open heart surgery, the Atrial Fibrillation Suppression Trial (AFIST): a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^112XPfWo]. Lancet (2001). High credibility.

Beta-blockers and amiodarone reduce the frequency of atrial fibrillation after open-heart surgery; however, the effectiveness of oral amiodarone in older patients already receiving beta-blockers is unknown. We have assessed the efficacy of oral amiodarone in preventing atrial fibrillation in patients aged 60 years or older undergoing open-heart surgery.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which patients undergoing open-heart surgery (n = 220, average age 73 years) received amiodarone (n = 120) or placebo (n = 100). Patients enrolled less than 5 days before surgery received 6 g of amiodarone or placebo over 6 days beginning on preoperative day 1. Patients enrolled at least 5 days before surgery received 7 g over 10 days beginning on preoperative day 5.

- **Findings**: Patients on amiodarone had a lower frequency of any atrial fibrillation (22.5% vs 38.0%; p = 0.01; absolute difference 15.5% [95% CI 3.4–27.6%]), and there were significant differences in favor of the active drug for symptomatic atrial fibrillation (4.2% vs 18.0%, p = 0.001), cerebrovascular accident (1.7% vs 7.0%, p = 0.04), and postoperative ventricular tachycardia (1.7% vs 7.0%, p = 0.04). Beta-blocker use (87.5% amiodarone vs 91.0% placebo), nausea (26.7% vs 16.0%), 30-day mortality (3.3% vs 4.0%), symptomatic bradycardia (7.5% vs 7.0%), and hypotension (14.2% vs 10.0%) were similar.

- **Interpretation**: Oral amiodarone prophylaxis in combination with beta-blockers prevents atrial fibrillation and symptomatic fibrillation and reduces the risk of cerebrovascular accidents and ventricular tachycardia.

**Overdosage**: There have been cases, some fatal, of amiodarone overdose. Effects of an inadvertent overdose of intravenous amiodarone include hypotension, cardiogenic shock, bradycardia, AV block, and hepatotoxicity. Treat hypotension and cardiogenic shock by slowing the infusion rate or with standard therapy: vasopressor drugs, positive inotropic agents, and volume expansion. Bradycardia and AV block may require temporary pacing. Monitor hepatic enzyme concentrations closely. Neither amiodarone nor DEA is dialyzable.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug for treating supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. The appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to provide clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone with an appropriate management strategy for its safe use.

The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and applied this information, along with their collective experience, in its development.

- **Intravenous and oral dosing**: Management guides are provided for the dosing of amiodarone.
- **Outpatient follow-up**: Appropriate strategies for the outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug are discussed.
- **Recognized adverse effects**: The adverse effects of amiodarone are outlined.
- **Consultation with specialists**: Recommendations on when to consult specialists to assist in patient management are included.

All clinicians must be cognizant of the drug's appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Ataxia caused by amiodarone in older people [^112KuMCR]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease, or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognized side effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid, and eyes. Neurological side effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include an assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system, especially in older patients.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^1172oWqT]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The study investigates the effects of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation. The researchers aimed to understand how these interventions impact cardiac function and potentially improve outcomes. By conducting a series of controlled experiments, they assessed various parameters related to cardiac arrhythmias and explored underlying mechanisms.

- **Background**: Amiodarone is a medication used to manage certain types of serious irregular heartbeat. Hypothermia, in a controlled medical context, is sometimes used post-cardiac arrest to improve neurological outcomes.

- **Methods**: The study comprised a detailed examination of cardiac tissues subjected to these interventions. Parameters such as conduction velocity and arrhythmia inducibility were measured. The role of ion channels and other cellular components was also evaluated.

- **Results**: The findings suggest that both amiodarone and hypothermia have distinct impacts on arrhythmic substrates. Amiodarone consistently reduced arrhythmia inducibility; hypothermia modified the function of ion channels and reduced arrhythmogenic potential in cardiac tissues.

- **Conclusion**: The combined use of amiodarone and therapeutic hypothermia may offer enhanced protective effects during resuscitation by targeting different mechanisms responsible for arrhythmias. Further research is needed to optimize these interventions for clinical application.

### Increased mortality after dronedarone therapy for severe heart failure [^1144R1py]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is a novel antiarrhythmic drug with electrophysiological properties similar to those of amiodarone. However, it does not contain iodine and thus does not cause iodine-related adverse reactions. Therefore, it may be of value in the treatment of patients with heart failure.

- **Methods**: In a multicenter study with a double-blind design, we planned to randomly assign 1000 patients hospitalized with symptomatic heart failure and severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction to receive 400 mg of dronedarone twice a day or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the composite of death from any cause or hospitalization for heart failure.

- **Results**: After the inclusion of 627 patients (310 in the dronedarone group and 317 in the placebo group), the trial was prematurely terminated for safety reasons. This decision was made at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board in accordance with the board's predefined rules for termination of the study. During a median follow-up of 2 months, 25 patients in the dronedarone group (8.1%) and 12 patients in the placebo group (3.8%) died (hazard ratio in the dronedarone group, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). The excess mortality was predominantly related to worsening of heart failure, with 10 deaths in the dronedarone group and 2 in the placebo group. The primary endpoint did not differ significantly between the two groups; there were 53 events in the dronedarone group (17.1%) and 40 events in the placebo group (12.6%) (hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92 to 2.09; P = 0.12).

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^11358igX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Effect of amiodarone on repolarization gradients**: At 36°C, repolarization gradients increased, but no additional differences were observed with amiodarone (Amio). Similarly, at 32°C, increases in repolarization gradients were noted without changes from amiodarone.

Taken together, amiodarone and therapeutic hypothermia (TH) produce more conduction slowing during ischemia than TH alone. This suggests that TH enhances the class I effect of amiodarone. Although amiodarone also enhanced the dispersion of repolarization (DOR) during TH, no significant differences were found in refractoriness or local repolarization gradients (RG) during TH, which would be expected to enhance susceptibility to reentrant arrhythmias.

### Effect of amiodarone and hypothermia on arrhythmia substrates during resuscitation [^114Qzj7o]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

- **Effect of amiodarone and temperature on APD and DOR ex vivo**: Figure 2A shows the effect of amiodarone on APD and DOR during ischemia at 36°C. The addition of amiodarone alone before ischemia had no significant effect on APD, QT interval, or DOR (before versus after drug: APD 225 ± 7 versus 224 ± 7 ms, QT interval 263 ± 12 versus 259 ± 11 ms, DOR 29 ± 3 versus 33 ± 4 ms, all P = ns). During ischemia, APD and QT interval shortened while DOR increased with or without amiodarone. Figure 2B shows the effect of amiodarone on APD and DOR at 32°C. The colder temperature increased both APD and QT interval before ischemia (as shown previously), and the addition of amiodarone did not further lengthen APD or DOR, although the QT interval was nonsignificantly increased (before versus after drug: APD 286 ± 4 versus 295 ± 6 ms, P = ns, DOR 37 ± 2 versus 34 ± 3 ms, P = ns, QT interval 320 ± 2 versus 336 ± 5 ms, P = 0.06). During ischemia, the addition of amiodarone to 32°C significantly worsened DOR (see summary data, Figure 3). APD and QT shortened from baseline, but without a significant difference with the addition of amiodarone during ischemia.

- **Figure 2 effect on action potential duration and dispersion of repolarization**: A, 36°C. Representative ECG and action potentials from endocardial (ENDO), midmyocardial (M), and epicardial (EPI) cells at control temperatures (36°C) are shown. Left, 36‐Alone. After 15 minutes of ischemia, dispersion increases secondary to relatively greater shortening of epicardial action potential duration (APD). Right, 36‐Amio. Amiodarone (Amio) does not affect APD or DOR.

### Amiodarone and the thyroid [^117NzRB4]. Endocrine Practice (2004). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders:

- **Definition**: Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran, is a potent antiarrhythmic medication that can alter thyroid hormone metabolism and may precipitate hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

- **Pathophysiology**: Amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders are caused by either deiodination, which releases large amounts of iodine that can impair thyroid function, or by direct cytotoxicity on thyroid cells by amiodarone or its metabolite.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in patients taking amiodarone ranges from 5% to 14%.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders include high cumulative doses of amiodarone, longer duration of treatment, a higher baseline TSH level, older age (particularly age ≥ 75 years), and pre-existing thyroid disease such as autonomous thyroid nodules or latent Graves' disease.

- **Disease course**: Amiodarone-associated hypothyroidism is similar to iodine-induced hypothyroidism and typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. It can also lead to myxedema coma, severe bradycardia, prolonged atrioventricular conduction, peripheral edema, and severe muscle cramps. On the other hand, amiodarone-associated hyperthyroidism, or thyrotoxicosis, presents with symptoms such as weight loss, palpitations, heat intolerance, muscle weakness, anorexia, restlessness, tremor, and congestive heart failure.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders is generally favorable. Most patients recover once the medication is discontinued, although some symptoms may persist if treatment duration was prolonged or if there are other complicating factors.

### SPL drug information for amiodarone hydrochloride [^112ce4FK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):

- **Cardiac toxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.

- **Pulmonary toxicity**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Clinical significance and management of atrioventricular block associated with bradycardic/antiarrhythmic drug therapy: Drug-induced or drug-revealed [^113qw3hC]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Low credibility.

In a recent study, Jordan‐Martinez et al. analyzed patients with drug‐related AVB, focusing on identifying predictive factors for pacemaker need. The study population consisted of 127 patients with third‐degree AVB, 2:1 AVB, or second‐degree Mobitz type II AVB, including individuals with atrial fibrillation and AVB. Most of the study patients were elderly and had comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, and ischemic or other heart disease. Most patients were on β‐blockers (78%), 18.1% were on non‐DHP CCBs, and 11.8% were on digoxin. Additionally, 3.9% and 4.8% were receiving flecainide or amiodarone, respectively, in combination with the previously mentioned drugs. Furthermore, 8.6% of the patients were on a combination of digoxin, flecainide, or amiodarone with either β‐blockers or non‐DHP CCBs.

In keeping with the studies mentioned above, drug discontinuation led to the spontaneous resolution of AVB within 48 hours in 47.2% of patients. However, 66.6% of these patients experienced a recurrence of AVB during the 3‐year follow‐up period (median time to AVB recurrence: 65 days; interquartile range: 12–201 days). Overall, 84.36% of patients required permanent pacemaker implantation in the acute setting or during follow‐up, while only 18.1% experienced AVB resolution without recurrence after drug discontinuation.

Importantly, this study identified several factors associated with the overall need for permanent pacing. These included a heart rate < 35 bpm (odds ratio [OR] = 8.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.82–36.17; p = 0.006), increased risk of permanent pacing.

### Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation precipitated by amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis five months after cessation of therapy [^112tBWd2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is currently indicated for the treatment of life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias. It is also used for the treatment of supraventricular dysrhythmias and as maintenance therapy after successful cardioversion of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation. Adverse effects related to its expanded use are increasingly common. We describe a case of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis occurring five months after cessation of therapy and discuss the pathophysiology and treatment of this disorder.

### Post-myocardial infarction beta-blocker therapy: The bradycardia conundrum. Rationale and design for the Pacemaker & beta-blocker therapy post-MI (PACE-MI) trial [^116pPNDK]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated that beta-blockers improve survival after myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with "bradycardia-related" contraindications to beta-blockers, such as those with asymptomatic bradycardia or AV conduction abnormalities, have been excluded from clinical trials of beta-blockers and continue to be excluded from post-MI beta-blocker therapy in routine clinical practice. These patients tend to be elderly and have a high 1-year mortality rate. If beta-blockers provide benefit to the post-MI patient independent of their heart rate-lowering effect, then these patients could benefit substantially from the initiation of beta-blocker therapy. However, in this particular group of patients, beta-blockers can be safely initiated only if more severe or significant bradycardia can be prevented by pacemaker implantation.

It is unclear whether adverse effects related to pacemaker implantation could also negate some or all of the hypothesized benefits of beta-blocker therapy. Although beta-blockers are particularly effective in the elderly, the benefit of beta-blocker therapy in patients with bradycardia-related contraindications to beta-blockers has not been established. The PACE-MI trial is a randomized controlled trial that will address whether beta-blocker therapy enabled by pacemaker implantation is superior to no beta-blocker and no pacemaker therapy after MI in patients with rhythm contraindications to beta-blockers or in those who have developed symptomatic bradycardia due to beta-blockers. The trial will randomize 1124 patients to standard therapy.

### Cardiac arrhythmias in oncological patients-epidemiology, risk factors, and management within the context of the new ESC 2022 guidelines [^111ATDF3]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). High credibility.

Episodes of bradycardia secondary to cancer treatment are usually asymptomatic, depending on the heart rate at the time of the episode. Possible symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, pre-syncope, or syncope. If the patient is symptomatic, Holter-ECG is recommended to assess the severity of the bradycardia and exclude long sinus pauses. A trial of withdrawing anticancer drugs should be performed to confirm the coincidence with the symptoms. A multidisciplinary team should discuss the risks and benefits of continuing the treatment at a lower dose and eventually consider alternative therapy. Pacemaker implantation is indicated when there is no substitution for the treatment. The final decision should take into account patients' preferences and should be made after consultation with a cardiologist and oncologist.

To summarize, the management of arrhythmias in oncological patients should be based on clinical practice guidelines, especially the newest ESC guidelines on cardio-oncology. Careful patient observation for possible symptoms of the arrhythmia and ECG monitoring are the basis of the management during oncological treatment with high arrhythmogenic potential.

### May toxicity of amiodarone be prevented by antioxidants? A cell-culture study [^115iynob]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered rhythm disorder following cardiac surgery. Amiodarone is a very effective agent used in the treatment and prophylaxis of postoperative AF. The risk of toxicity increases with increasing plasma concentrations. Due to its high liposolubility, it accumulates in adipose tissue and highly perfused organs such as the lungs, liver, and spleen. This tendency also contributes to its toxic effects, aside from cellular mechanisms of toxicity.

Free radical formation, direct cytotoxicity, development of lysosomal phospholipidosis, and membrane destabilization are the documented possible cellular mechanisms of toxicity. However, it is known that the predominant molecular mechanism of amiodarone-induced cell death is triggered by oxidative damage. Oxidative stress normally results either from increased production of reactive oxygen species or decreased antioxidant capacity of cells, with the former being the mechanism in the case of amiodarone-induced cytotoxicity. Since it is not possible to prevent the development of oxidative stress itself, it would be rational to increase cellular levels of antioxidants. This is the hypothesis for evaluating the use of antioxidant agents to prevent amiodarone-induced cytotoxicity in this study.

At the time of writing, there are few data concerning the prevention of amiodarone-induced cytotoxicity. In some cell culture and experimental animal studies, antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, were employed and were found to be effective in increasing viability following exposure to toxic doses of amiodarone.

### Pacerone [^113Qeczr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warning: Pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicity**: Pacerone is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias, as its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Pacerone can cause pulmonary toxicity, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, which has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Approximately 10% of pulmonary toxicity cases have been fatal. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. It is recommended to repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Pacerone can also cause hepatotoxicity, which can be fatal. It is critical to obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and to discontinue or reduce dosage if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue Pacerone if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pacerone may exacerbate arrhythmias. Therefore, it is advised to initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Warning: Pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac toxicity**: Refer to the full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning. Reserve Pacerone for patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity, some also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents when possible.

### Comparative safety and effectiveness of sotalol versus dronedarone after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^115acC1E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of significant bradycardia with sotalol compared with placebo or other antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in the setting of prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery. In the meta-analysis by Somberg and Molnar, there was a roughly 2.5-fold increase in significant bradycardia with sotalol compared with amiodarone for the prevention of postoperative AF. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial comparing sotalol, amiodarone plus metoprolol, metoprolol, and placebo for the prevention of AF after cardiac surgery, sotalol had similar efficacy to amiodarone plus metoprolol (both better than placebo) for suppression of AF. However, sotalol had a 3-fold higher risk of bradycardia requiring dose reduction and/or withdrawal compared with amiodarone plus metoprolol and placebo, and it was similar to metoprolol only. Whether this represents a significantly higher bradycardic risk compared with the non-postoperative setting cannot be determined.

Rates of discontinuation for bradycardia were similar between amiodarone and propafenone or sotalol in the Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation, but the difference between propafenone and sotalol was not stated. The increase in patients in need of pacemaker implantation late after AF ablation in our sotalol cohort suggests that patients treated with sotalol after ablation may need to be monitored more closely for the development of significant bradyarrhythmias.

### Synergistic bradycardia from beta blockers, hyperkalemia, and renal failure [^111mxJ4i]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Bradycardia is a common vital sign encountered in the emergency department. These patients are often hemodynamically stable and require no emergent intervention. On occasion, bradycardia can cause hemodynamic instability, and there are established treatment pathways involving atropine, ionotropic and vasopressive infusions, and eventual mechanical pacing, if necessary. However, these pathways fail to account for the many and varied causes of bradycardia and their treatment.

- **Case report**: A 24-year-old man presented to our emergency department with syncope caused by symptomatic bradycardia. This was caused by a largely unrecognized synergistic bradycardia resulting from renal failure, AV nodal blocker use, and hyperkalemia. Our patient's worsening renal failure caused accumulation of both potassium and beta blocker, which resulted in bradycardia and hypotension, in turn worsening renal failure secondary to poor renal perfusion and potentiating his hyperkalemia and beta blocker toxicity.

- **Importance for emergency physicians**: There is a growing number of cases that suggest this is an underrecognized synergistic and potentially lethal mechanism of hemodynamically unstable bradycardia, and the treatment falls outside of typical algorithms for handling bradycardia. Understanding the multiple causes of these patients' hemodynamically unstable bradycardia allows for maximal medical management and can prevent unnecessary invasive management for these patients.

### Amiodarone for pediatric resuscitation: a word of caution [^114iNTY8]. Pediatric Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Intravenous administration of amiodarone has recently been recommended for use during pediatric resuscitation of patients with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. We present two pediatric patients who received amiodarone for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, although they were ultimately determined to have congenital long QT syndrome. Amiodarone is contraindicated in this setting and may have exacerbated the ventricular arrhythmia.

### Ledipasvir and sofosbuvir [^1125bVQ9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Serious symptomatic bradycardia when coadministered with amiodarone**: Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, including fatal cardiac arrest and cases requiring pacemaker intervention, have been reported when amiodarone is coadministered with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir. Bradycardia has generally occurred within hours to days, but cases have been observed up to 2 weeks after initiating HCV treatment. Patients also taking beta blockers, or those with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or advanced liver disease, may be at increased risk for symptomatic bradycardia with the coadministration of amiodarone. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of HCV treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown.

Coadministration of amiodarone with ledipasvir and sofosbuvir is not recommended. For patients taking amiodarone who have no other alternative viable treatment options and who will be coadministered ledipasvir and sofosbuvir, it is advised to:

- **Counsel patients**: Inform them about the risk of serious symptomatic bradycardia.
- **Cardiac monitoring**: Perform cardiac monitoring in an in-patient setting for the first 48 hours of coadministration, after which outpatient or self-monitoring of the heart rate should occur on a daily basis through at least the first 2 weeks of treatment.

Patients who are taking ledipasvir and sofosbuvir and need to start amiodarone therapy due to no other alternative viable treatment options should undergo similar cardiac monitoring as outlined above.

Due to amiodarone's long half-life, patients discontinuing amiodarone just prior to starting ledipasvir and sofosbuvir should be monitored.

### Alecensa [^112kLYE9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Bradycardia**: Symptomatic bradycardia occurred in patients treated with Alecensa. In the pooled safety population [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)], bradycardia occurred in 11% of patients treated with Alecensa. Twenty percent of 521 patients treated with Alecensa, for whom serial electrocardiograms (ECGs) were available, had post-dose heart rates of less than 50 beats per minute (bpm).

Monitor heart rate and blood pressure regularly. For asymptomatic bradycardia, dose modification is not required. For symptomatic bradycardia that is not life-threatening, withhold Alecensa until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate ≥ 60 bpm and evaluate concomitant medications known to cause bradycardia, as well as anti-hypertensive medications. If bradycardia is attributable to a concomitant medication, resume Alecensa at a reduced dose (see Table 2) upon recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of ≥ 60 bpm, with frequent monitoring as clinically indicated.

Permanently discontinue Alecensa in cases of life-threatening bradycardia if no contributing concomitant medication is identified [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Permanently discontinue Alecensa for recurrence of life-threatening bradycardia.

### Suppression of ventricular tachycardia with dronedarone: a case report [^111EtQhs]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2011). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker with similar electrophysiological properties to amiodarone. It has not been studied in humans as an agent to suppress ventricular arrhythmias.

- **Methods**: This case report describes the dramatic antiarrhythmic effects of dronedarone in a patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and recurrent ventricular tachycardia, which was resistant to multiple antiarrhythmic agents and endocardial catheter ablation.

- **Results**: Dronedarone was effective in completely suppressing ventricular tachycardia.

- **Conclusion**: Further research is needed to establish a potential larger role for dronedarone in controlling ventricular arrhythmias in humans.

### Amiodarone-induced neonatal hypothyroidism: a unique form of transient early-onset hypothyroidism [^114ew4hf]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is an iodine-rich drug used to treat cardiac dysrhythmias. The structure of amiodarone resembles that of thyroxine, and treatment with amiodarone may alter thyroid function. The effects of antenatal amiodarone use on fetal/neonatal thyroid function have only been addressed in a limited number of patient reports. We describe two cases of transient neonatal hypothyroidism due to in utero amiodarone exposure, followed by a brief review of the available literature.
