## Question

Why is hypofractionation used in breast cancer treatment?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why hypofractionation is used in breast cancer treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the radiobiological rationale, particularly the α/β ratio and its implications for fraction size sensitivity. Then, I should verify the randomized trial evidence establishing noninferiority and long-term outcomes. Next, I will examine safety and toxicity, including acute and late effects and cardiac considerations. After that, I need to assess patient-centered benefits and access. I will then quantify cost-effectiveness and system efficiency. Subsequently, I should align the evidence with professional guidelines and real-world adoption. Finally, I will address special populations and settings and synthesize why hypofractionation has become standard in many contexts [^111SpRpw] [^116owq5d] [^114qyoh2] [^116sgcky].

> Let me first confirm the radiobiologic foundation before drawing any conclusions, because if the α/β ratio were high, the argument for larger per-fraction doses would be weaker; multiple analyses suggest that breast cancer has a relatively low α/β on the order of about 2.9 to 4.8 Gy, which is similar to late-responding normal breast tissues, implying relative insensitivity to fraction number and greater sensitivity to fraction size, a pattern that supports hypofractionation when total dose is appropriately reduced to preserve late normal tissue tolerance [^1114VBJX] [^111SpRpw] [^114JEa8z].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical efficacy data from randomized trials before proceeding; the UK START trials and the Ontario trial demonstrated that moderately hypofractionated whole-breast regimens such as 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions yield local control and cosmesis comparable to 50 Gy in 25 fractions, with durable 10-year outcomes confirming noninferiority, while the FAST-Forward trial further showed that 26 Gy in five fractions over one week is noninferior at five years to 40 Gy in 15 fractions for ipsilateral breast tumor relapse without excess normal tissue effects in the early interval [^116owq5d] [^1143KXdU] [^114qyoh2].

> Hold on, I should double-check that these findings generalize beyond Western cohorts; a multicenter randomized trial from China confirmed that 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions with a boost was noninferior to 50 Gy in 25 fractions with a boost, with numerically lower five-year local recurrence, and broadly similar toxicity profiles except less grade 2–3 acute skin toxicity with hypofractionation, supporting applicability across diverse populations and practice patterns [^11255G6d].

> I will now examine safety and toxicity more closely, because noninferiority in control must be accompanied by acceptable acute and late effects; pooled randomized data and contemporary trials show similar or reduced acute skin reactions with moderate hypofractionation, and early late effects with one-week schedules are acceptable at five years, though, wait, I need to ensure we do not overstate long-term cardiac safety, as START highlighted that very long follow-up is required and guidelines recommend heart-sparing and cardiac exclusion from primary fields whenever feasible to mitigate late risks [^11255G6d] [^114qyoh2] [^114JEa8z] [^116sgcky].

> But wait, what about patient-centered outcomes and practicality; shorter schedules reduce treatment duration from five to seven weeks down to one to three and a half weeks, which meaningfully decreases travel burden and disruption while improving quality-of-life domains such as fatigue, convenience, and cosmetic satisfaction in comparative assessments, particularly benefiting older adults and those with comorbidities or long travel distances [^114qyoh2] [^112g4SLS] [^111mDcyQ].

> Next, I should review health system efficiency and cost, because value is central to implementation; activity-based costing in low-resource settings shows roughly 40% per-course cost reductions for breast radiotherapy with hypofractionation versus conventional schedules, with modeling suggesting notable increases in throughput and large aggregate savings, and global analyses estimate that adopting hypofractionation can reduce the number of additional machines needed in LMICs and improve access substantially [^113Buuwr] [^111bjp1r] [^1151fSuw].

> Let me think about guideline alignment and real-world adoption to ensure clinical legitimacy; ASTRO's 2011 guideline endorsed moderate hypofractionation for appropriately selected early-stage patients, with the 2018 update expanding eligibility irrespective of age, tumor grade, or receptor status, while the UK standardized hypofractionation years earlier and has incorporated five-fraction regimens into practice, although, hold on, uptake has been slower and variable in the U.S., reflecting physician- and system-level factors and evolving comfort with ultra-hypofractionation as longer-term data mature [^116sgcky] [^111dfkVJ] [^111GfRX5] [^112QViWR].

> I need to check special populations and settings because nuances matter; evidence supports hypofractionation in higher-risk histologies such as grade 3 and in triple-negative disease without compromising local control, older adults tolerate and benefit from shorter courses, low-resource settings have shown feasibility even with 2D planning under controlled protocols, and while postmastectomy and nodal irradiation historically used conventional fractionation, contemporary trials and reviews indicate hypofractionated PMRT can be safe and effective and is increasingly considered in practice and trials [^117Pq1CJ] [^112FrySb] [^111mDcyQ] [^116TqRvo] [^116f5sZA].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost concluded that five-fraction whole-breast schedules are universally standard, but I should correct that and emphasize that five-year FAST-Forward data are reassuring whereas some guidelines counsel caution pending longer follow-up and careful selection, particularly for reconstructed chest wall or when regional nodal irradiation is required, so individualization and adherence to heart- and lung-sparing techniques remain essential [^114qyoh2] [^112QViWR] [^116sgcky].

> Synthesis: leveraging a low α/β ratio shared by tumor and late-responding breast tissues, dose-adjusted hypofractionation achieves biologically equivalent tumor control with fewer fractions while maintaining acceptable toxicity, and randomized evidence across geographies confirms noninferior local control and cosmesis with substantial gains in convenience, capacity, and cost-efficiency; with strong endorsement from major guidelines and growing experience in diverse settings and subgroups, hypofractionation addresses the goals of effective oncologic control, patient-centered care, and sustainable system performance, with prudent technique and case selection ensuring safety as follow-up for the shortest schedules continues to mature [^1114VBJX] [^116owq5d] [^1143KXdU] [^114qyoh2] [^113Buuwr] [^1151fSuw] [^111dfkVJ] [^116sgcky].

---

The rationale for hypofractionation in breast cancer is that **breast cancer's low α/β ratio** (≈3–4 Gy) makes it as sensitive to fraction size as late-responding normal tissues, so larger fractions with fewer treatments can maintain tumor control while limiting late toxicity [^1114VBJX] [^111SpRpw]. Randomized trials show **non-inferior local control and survival** with hypofractionation versus conventional schedules, with similar or better cosmesis and lower acute toxicity [^1143KXdU] [^114qyoh2]. Shorter courses improve patient convenience, reduce costs, and expand access, especially in resource-limited settings [^113Buuwr] [^111bjp1r].

---

## Radiobiological rationale

Breast cancer's **α/β ratio** is ≈3–4 Gy — similar to late-responding normal tissues — supporting larger fractions with fewer treatments [^1114VBJX] [^111SpRpw]. Because tumor control and late normal tissue effects have comparable **fraction-size sensitivity**, hypofractionation can maintain control without excess late toxicity [^111SpRpw].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting hypofractionation

- **START trials**: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks showed non-inferior local control and fewer late normal tissue effects versus 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks [^116owq5d].

- **Canadian trial**: 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over 22 days was non-inferior to 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 35 days, with similar cosmesis and toxicity [^1143KXdU].

- **FAST-Forward trial**: 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week was non-inferior to 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks, with similar or lower normal tissue effects [^114qyoh2].

---

## Patient convenience and quality of life

Shorter treatment duration reduces clinic visits, improving **convenience, adherence, and quality of life** [^113Buuwr]. Reduced acute toxicity, particularly less acute skin toxicity, enhances **comfort and daily functioning** [^112g4SLS].

---

## Economic and healthcare system considerations

Greater **cost-effectiveness** comes from fewer fractions, reducing costs for patients and health systems [^113Buuwr]. Shorter courses result in **increased access**, especially in resource-limited settings [^111bjp1r].

---

## Potential risks and limitations

Ongoing follow-up is warranted for **long-term toxicity**, especially cardiac toxicity [^111SpRpw]. Careful consideration of **patient selection** is required in complex cases (e.g. reconstruction, regional nodal irradiation) [^112QViWR].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

**ASTRO guidelines** recommend hypofractionation for most early-stage breast cancer patients, regardless of age, tumor grade, or receptor status. **NCCN guidelines** likewise endorse hypofractionation as standard after breast-conserving surgery in early-stage disease.

---

Hypofractionation is supported by **radiobiology and randomized trials**, offering **equivalent control** with similar or better toxicity, improved convenience, and lower costs; careful selection and long-term follow-up remain important.

### Benefits of adopting hypofractionated radiotherapy as a standard of care in low-and middle-income countries [^111bjp1r]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have shown that hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with breast and prostate cancer is the most cost-effective radiotherapy regimen. Although dependent on a country's health care system, reimbursement often scales with the number of fractions, making fractionation the largest contributing factor to the cost of radiotherapy treatments. However, most cost-effectiveness data have been reported from high-income countries, with only five studies focused on low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). The first of these studies reported that reducing breast cancer treatments from 25 to 15 fractions across Africa would save an estimated $1.1 billion USD between 2019 and 2025, while reducing prostate cancer treatments from 39 to 20 fractions would save an additional $606 million USD over the same time period. This represents a significant amount of capital that could then be invested in health care infrastructure.

- **Reduced costs**: Four country-level studies have evaluated cost-effectiveness. The first reported that 25-fraction moderately hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer in Hungary was more cost-effective (absolute savings of €1,141 Euros) than a 35–39-fraction three-dimensional radiation therapy (3DCRT) course, despite the extra planning and technology costs and requirements associated with IMRT. Additionally, moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy resulted in a 10% increase in the number of patients who could be treated due to increased efficiency.

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trial A of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial [^111SpRpw]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). High credibility.

In women with early breast cancer prescribed radiotherapy after tumour excision or mastectomy, the effective dose of radiation is adjusted to balance the risk of local cancer recurrence against the risk of harmful effects on healthy tissues. Radiotherapy reduces the risk of local relapse by about 70% and reduces breast cancer mortality. Such treatment is offered to nearly all patients after local tumour excision and to selected patients after mastectomy. The most frequently used schedule worldwide is 50 Gy, delivered in 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy over 5 weeks. This schedule has evolved pragmatically and is based on the assumption that a high total dose delivered in small fractions of 2.0 Gy keeps the amount of normal tissue damage to a minimum while achieving the maximum level of tumour control. This perception was strengthened when early studies of hypofractionation, which did not use adequate reductions in total dose, reported unacceptably high rates of normal tissue injury.

Normal and malignant tissues vary in their responses to radiotherapy fraction size, termed fractionation sensitivity. Responses are described by a model in which the sensitivity (measured by the degree of tissue damage for normal tissues and tumour recurrence rates for malignant tumours) to fraction size is represented by the ratio of two constants, α and β. The lower the ratio of α to β (expressed in Gy), the greater the effect on normal and malignant tissues of changes in fraction size. Healthy tissues of the breast and ribcage are sensitive to fraction size, with α/β values 5 Gy or less.

### Can the adoption of hypofractionation guidelines expand global radiotherapy access? An analysis for breast and prostate radiotherapy [^113Buuwr]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The limited radiotherapy resources for global cancer control have resulted in increased interest in developing time- and cost-saving innovations to expand access to those resources. Hypofractionated regimens could minimize cost and increase access for limited-resource countries. In this investigation, we estimated the percentage cost-savings per radiotherapy course and increased radiotherapy access in African countries after adopting hypofractionation for breast and prostate radiotherapy. For perspective, results were compared with high-income countries.

- **Methods**: The cost and course of breast and prostate radiotherapy for conventional and hypofractionated regimens in low-resource facilities were calculated using the Radiotherapy Cost Estimator tool developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and then compared with another activity-based costing model. The potential maximum cost savings in each country over 7 years for breast and prostate radiotherapy were then estimated using cancer incidence data from the Global Cancer Observatory database with use rates applied. The increase in radiotherapy access was estimated by national capacities from the IAEA directory.

- **Results**: The estimated cost per course of conventional and hypofractionated regimens were US$2,232 and $1,339 for breast treatment, and $3,389 and $1,699 for prostate treatment, respectively. The projected potential maximum cost savings with full hypofractionation implementation were $1.1 billion and $606 million for breast and prostate treatment, respectively.

### Long-term results of hypofractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer [^1143KXdU]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The optimal fractionation schedule for whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery is unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a study to determine whether a hypofractionated 3-week schedule of whole-breast irradiation is as effective as a 5-week schedule. Women with invasive breast cancer who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and in whom resection margins were clear and axillary lymph nodes were negative were randomly assigned to receive whole-breast irradiation either at a standard dose of 50.0 Gy in 25 fractions over a period of 35 days (the control group) or at a dose of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over a period of 22 days (the hypofractionated-radiation group).

- **Results**: The risk of local recurrence at 10 years was 6.7% among the 612 women assigned to standard irradiation as compared with 6.2% among the 622 women assigned to the hypofractionated regimen (absolute difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -2.5 to 3.5). At 10 years, 71.3% of women in the control group as compared with 69.8% of the women in the hypofractionated-radiation group had a good or excellent cosmetic outcome (absolute difference, 1.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -6.9 to 9.8).

- **Conclusions**: Ten years after treatment, accelerated, hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation was not inferior to standard radiation treatment in women who had undergone breast-conserving surgery for invasive breast cancer with clear surgical margins and negative axillary nodes.

### Hypofractionated breast radiotherapy for 1 week versus 3 weeks (FAST-Forward): 5-year efficacy and late normal tissue effects results from a multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised, phase 3 trial [^114qyoh2]. Lancet (2020). High credibility.

We aimed to identify a five-fraction schedule of adjuvant radiotherapy (radiation therapy) delivered in 1 week that is non-inferior in terms of local cancer control and is as safe as an international standard 15-fraction regimen after primary surgery for early breast cancer. Here, we present 5-year results of the FAST-Forward trial.

- **Methods**: FAST-Forward is a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, non-inferiority trial conducted at 97 hospitals (47 radiotherapy centres and 50 referring hospitals) in the UK. Patients aged at least 18 years with invasive carcinoma of the breast (pT1–3, pN0–1, M0) after breast conservation surgery or mastectomy were eligible. We randomly allocated patients to either 40 Gy in 15 fractions (over 3 weeks), 27 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week), or 26 Gy in five fractions (over 1 week) to the whole breast or chest wall. Allocation was not masked because of the nature of the intervention. The primary endpoint was ipsilateral breast tumour relapse; assuming a 2% 5-year incidence for 40 Gy, non-inferiority was predefined as ≤ 1·6% excess for five-fraction schedules (critical hazard ratio [HR] of 1·81). Normal tissue effects were assessed by clinicians, patients, and from photographs. This trial is registered at isrctn.com, ISRCTN19906132.

- **Findings**: Between Nov 24, 2011, and June 19, 2014, we recruited and obtained consent from 4096 patients from 97 UK centres, of whom 1361 were assigned to the 40 Gy schedule, 1367 to the 27 Gy schedule, and 1368 to the 26 Gy schedule. At a median follow-up of 71·5 months (IQR 71·3 to 71·7), the primary endpoint ev.

### Is α/β for breast cancer really low [^1114VBJX]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2011). High credibility.

The low α/β ratio for breast cancer has drawn growing interest in exploring hypofractionation for breast irradiation. This work aims to confirm the low α/β ratio based on large randomized clinical trials of breast irradiation.

- **Methods and materials**: A model based on the generalized linear-quadratic (LQ) model and Poisson statistical model was developed to calculate disease-free survival, considering clonogen proliferation during the course of radiation treatment and the exponential behavior of survival rate with follow-up time. Outcome data from a series of randomized clinical trials of early-stage breast radiotherapy were fitted to estimate the model parameters. Other clinical outcomes, including treatments with surgery alone or radiotherapy alone, were used to validate the model and the estimated parameters. Hypofractionation regimens were proposed based on the newly estimated LQ parameters.

- **Results**: Plausible population-averaged radiobiologic parameters for breast cancer (95% confidence level) are α/β = 2.88 (0.75–5.01) Gy and α = 0.08 ± 0.02 Gy⁻¹; potential doubling time, T(d) = 14.4 ± 7.8 days. The analysis of the radiation-alone data suggested an α/β ratio of 3.89 ± 6.25 Gy, verifying the low α/β ratio based on the post-lumpectomy irradiation data. The hypofractionation regimens that are equivalent to the conventional regimen of 2.0 Gy×25 in 5 weeks include 2.26 Gy×20, 3.34 Gy×10, 4.93 Gy×5, or 3.39 Gy×10 (BID).

- **Conclusions**: The analysis of the available clinical data from multiple institutions supports that breast cancer has a low ratio of α/β, encouraging hypofractionated radiotherapy.

### Implementation and utilization of hypofractionation for breast cancer [^111dfkVJ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). High credibility.

Until recently, hypofractionated radiation therapy in women with breast cancer was considered a harmful practice, potentially resulting in significant injury from late toxicity, such as soft-tissue necrosis and fibrosis. In hindsight, this concern was perhaps due to a limited understanding of the radiobiology of breast cancer. This limitation resulted in an inadequate decrease in total radiation dose in conjunction with the associated increase in dose per fraction. However, prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that dose-adjusted hypofractionated regimens not only result in equivalent survival and local control, but also have comparable, if not better, acute toxicity profiles. With the release of 10-year data supporting hypofractionation (HF) and with endorsement by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) clinical guidelines since 2011, HF has become the new standard of care for women with early-stage breast cancer.

Despite the strength of available data, recent studies suggest that hypofractionated whole breast irradiation remains significantly underutilized in the United States. A paper by Bekelman et al. showed a utilization of HF in the United States of 34% in 2013 for those matching the characteristics delineated by the ASTRO guidelines. In contrast, approximately 70% of patients in Ontario, Canada, receiving whole breast irradiation (without regional lymph node irradiation) received hypofractionated treatment in 2008. In the United Kingdom, most patients with early-stage breast cancer have received hypofractionated treatment since 2008.

### Hypofractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy [^116f5sZA]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). High credibility.

To provide an overview of the major randomized trials that support the use of hypofractionated post-mastectomy radiation therapy for locally advanced breast cancer patients, PubMed was systematically reviewed for publications reporting the use of hypofractionated radiation therapy in patients requiring post-mastectomy radiation.

Standard fractionation, which is typically delivered over 5 to 7 weeks, is considered the standard of care in the setting of post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT). Modern data has established hypofractionated whole breast irradiation, consisting of a 3- to 4-week regimen, as a new standard of care for early-stage breast cancer. Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation has also laid the groundwork for exploring a hypofractionated approach in the setting of hypofractionated post-mastectomy radiation therapy.

While standard fractionation remains the most commonly utilized regimen for PMRT, recently published trials support the safety and efficacy of a hypofractionated approach. Ongoing trials are further investigating the use of hypofractionated PMRT.

### The evolving role of whole breast hypofractionation in older patients with early breast cancer [^111mDcyQ]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Breast cancer in older patients presents an increasing health care challenge. Hypofractionated dose schedules of 15/16 daily fractions of postoperative radiotherapy over 3/3.5 weeks have been established in clinical trials with long-term follow-up as safe and effective and have become the standard of care after breast-conserving therapy for most older patients. Emerging clinical trial data are pushing the limits of hypofractionation to even shorter schedules over a week. This mini-review discusses the applicability of this new data to older patients and the development of guidelines for hypofractionated dose fractionation schedules, which have been adapted to the COVID-19 pandemic for this age group.

### Nation-scale adoption of shorter breast radiation therapy schedules can increase survival in resource constrained economies: Results from a Markov chain analysis [^114mG1B6]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2017). High credibility.

Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation and accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) offer women options for shorter courses of breast radiation therapy. The impact of these shorter schedules on the breast cancer populations of emerging economies with limited radiation therapy resources is unknown. We hypothesized that adoption of these schedules would improve throughput in the system and, by allowing more women access to life-saving treatments, improve patient survival within the system.

We designed a Markov chain model to simulate the different health states that a postlumpectomy or postmastectomy patient could enter over the course of a 20-year follow-up period. Transition rates between health states were adapted from published data on recurrence rates. We used primary data from a tertiary care hospital in Lahore, Pakistan, to populate the model with proportional use of mastectomy versus breast conservation and to estimate the proportion of patients suitable for APBI. Sensitivity analyses on the use of APBI and relative efficacy of APBI were conducted to study the impact on the population.

The shorter schedule resulted in more women alive and more women remaining without evidence of disease (NED) compared with the conventional schedule, with an absolute difference of about 4% and 7% at 15 years, respectively. Among women who had lumpectomies, the chance of remaining alive and with an intact breast was 62% in the hypofractionation model and 54% in the conventional fractionation model.

Increasing throughput in the system by adopting shorter schedules of radiation therapy can potentially enhance patient survival rates in resource-constrained settings. This approach allows for more efficient use of limited resources, thereby increasing the accessibility of life-saving treatments for greater numbers of women.

### Evaluating candidacy for hypofractionated radiation therapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, and endocrine therapy after breast conserving surgery: A Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) analysis [^113GkdJE]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the eligibility of patients for alternative adjuvant radiation therapy options after breast conserving surgery. Adjuvant radiation therapy is the standard of care for most patients. However, there are multiple options beyond standard fractionated whole breast irradiation, including hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HFRT), accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), and endocrine therapy (ET) alone. These alternatives can potentially limit treatment duration and reduce both morbidity and cost. Limited data exist on the percentage of patients eligible for these alternatives. Therefore, a Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) analysis was performed to assess candidacy for these options in women with early-stage breast cancer.

Women treated for breast cancer between 2010 and 2012 were identified in the SEER database. Patients with unknown staging, metastatic disease, T3/T4 disease, and ≥ N1 disease were excluded. Eligibility for HFRT was determined based on the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus guidelines and the IMPORT LOW trial criteria, which tested intensity modulated and partial organ radiotherapy following breast conservation surgery for early breast cancer. Eligibility for APBI was based on guidelines from ASTRO, the American Brachytherapy Society, and the Groupe Européen de Curiethérapie of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiotherapy and Oncology (GEC-ESTRO), as well as the criteria from the GEC-ESTRO APBI and IMPORT LOW trials. Eligibility for ET alone was determined based on the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 and Post-operative Radiotherapy in Minimum Risk Elderly II inclusion criteria.

### Can the adoption of hypofractionation guidelines expand global radiotherapy access? An analysis for breast and prostate radiotherapy [^114L8p7T]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The limited radiotherapy resources for global cancer control have resulted in increased interest in developing time- and cost-saving innovations to expand access to those resources. Hypofractionated regimens could minimize cost and increase access for limited-resource countries. In this investigation, we estimated the percentage cost savings per radiotherapy course and increased radiotherapy access in African countries after adopting hypofractionation for breast and prostate radiotherapy. For perspective, results were compared with high-income countries.

- **Methods**: The cost and course of breast and prostate radiotherapy for conventional and hypofractionated regimens in low-resource facilities were calculated using the Radiotherapy Cost Estimator tool developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and then compared with another activity-based costing model. The potential maximum cost savings in each country over 7 years for breast and prostate radiotherapy were then estimated using cancer incidence data from the Global Cancer Observatory database with use rates applied. The increase in radiotherapy access was estimated by national capacities from the IAEA directory.

- **Results**: The estimated cost per course of conventional and hypofractionated regimens were US$2,232 and $1,339 for breast treatment, and $3,389 and $1,699 for prostate treatment, respectively. The projected potential maximum cost savings with full hypofractionation implementation were $1.1 billion and $606 million for breast and prostate treatment, respectively. The projected increase in radiotherapy access was also considered significant.

### Definitive hypofractionated radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and proton beam therapy for intact breast tumors [^111Q4DYc]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Dosimetric characteristics: Overall, target coverage of GTV was excellent for all three modalities, with over 99% coverage averaged across all plans for a given modality group. Similarly, CTV coverage was excellent, with over 97% for all modality types and no significant differences in coverage between treatment techniques. However, nominal decreases in PTV coverage were noted from SABR (94.5%) to PBT (92.1%) to 3D-CRT (89.0%), but none were statistically significant. Table 2 illustrates the details of the DVH results for each radiation modality and DVH parameter, representing mean dosimetric values for all plans generated for a given treatment modality.

- **Dose-volume histogram comparison**: The volume of ipsilateral breast tissue receiving ≥ 40 Gy was optimal with SABR (4.79% ± 2.60%) and significantly lower (P < .0001) than the other two radiation modalities (PBT: 6.89% ± 3.16%; CRT: 12.76% ± 5.10%). Similar results were observed for the volume of ipsilateral breast tissue receiving ≥ 20 Gy. The maximum dose to ipsilateral skin, ipsilateral chest wall, and breast integral dose were all superior with SABR versus 3-dimensional CRT. Nonetheless, the mean global maximum dose was significantly higher (approximately 59 Gy; 118% hotspot) with SABR relative to both PBT (approximately 53 Gy; 106% hotspot) and 3-dimensional CRT (approximately 55 Gy; 110% hotspot) plans.

Proton plans were significantly superior to 3D-CRT plans nearly across the board, with the exception of contralateral lung, heart, and ipsilateral skin doses. Finally, PBT plans were able to achieve lower contralateral attributes.

### Implementation and utilization of hypofractionation for breast cancer [^115sQLQK]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

For the ASTRO-endorsed group (n = 685), 49% of patients received hypofractionated therapy in 2011, and an upward trend was noted with 80% receiving hypofractionated therapy in 2015. For the directives-endorsed group (n = 1042), 47% of patients received hypofractionated therapy in 2011; again, an upward trend was noted with 73% of patients receiving hypofractionated therapy in 2015.

- **Utilization trends**: Utilization of breast hypofractionation increased for both American Society for Radiation Oncology- and directive-endorsed cohorts from 2011 to 2015.

### Ten-year results of FAST: A randomized controlled trial of 5-fraction whole-breast radiotherapy for early breast cancer [^1128papS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Ten-year results from four randomized trials, totaling over 7,000 patients, confirm the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy following primary surgery for early breast cancer. The UK START-B and Ontario trials established 15- and 16-fraction schedules as new standards of care delivered over 21–22 days.

- **Sensitivity to fraction size**: This was tested in the START pilot and START-A trials by controlling for treatment time, generating an α/β estimate of 3.5 Gy (95% CI, 1.2 to 5.7) for tumor control, comparable to that for late adverse effects.

- **Fifteen- or 16-fraction regimens**: These are unlikely to represent the clinical limits of hypofractionation. The three-year adverse effects of 5-fraction schedules in the UK FAST trial were reported in 2011. In FAST, 5.7 or 6.0 Gy once weekly were tested against 50 Gy in 25 fractions, the standard of care at the time.

The explanatory trial design allowed interpolation between two 5-fraction schedules, suggesting a schedule equivalent to 50 Gy in 25 fractions in terms of late adverse effects. Five fractions of 5.7 and 6.0 Gy were predicted to be radiobiologically equivalent to 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy, assuming α/β values of 3.0 and 4.0 Gy for late normal tissue responses and tumor control, respectively. At a median follow-up of 3 years, 28.5 Gy in 5 fractions was comparable to 50 Gy in 25 fractions and milder than 30 Gy in 5 fractions in terms of adverse effects in the breast. This manuscript presents the 5-year results for change in photographic breast appearance and physician assessments of breast normal tissue effects (NTE) up to 10 years.

### Uptake and costs of hypofractionated vs conventional whole breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery in the United States, 2008–2013 [^1111j9wM]. JAMA (2014). Low credibility.

Based on randomized evidence, expert guidelines in 2011 endorsed shorter, hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) for selected patients with early-stage breast cancer and permitted hypofractionated WBI for other patients.

To examine the uptake and costs of hypofractionated WBI among commercially insured patients in the United States, a retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted using administrative claims data from 14 commercial health care plans. These plans covered 7.4% of US adult women in 2013. Patients with incident early-stage breast cancer treated with lumpectomy and WBI from 2008 to 2013 were classified into two cohorts:

- **Hypofractionation-endorsed cohort**: Included 8924 patients aged 50 years or older without prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement.
- **Hypofractionation-permitted cohort**: Included 6719 patients younger than 50 years or those with prior chemotherapy or axillary lymph node involvement.

The study compared exposures of hypofractionated WBI, which involves 3–5 weeks of treatment, versus conventional WBI, which involves 5–7 weeks of treatment.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The use of hypofractionated and conventional WBI, total and radiotherapy-related health care expenditures, and patient out-of-pocket expenses were measured. Patient and clinical characteristics included year of treatment, age, comorbid disease, prior chemotherapy, axillary lymph node involvement, intensity-modulated radiotherapy, practice setting, and other contextual variables.

- **Results**: Hypofractionated WBI increased from 10.6% (95% CI, 8.8%-12.5%) in 2008 to 34.5% (95%

### The pattern of use of hypofractionated radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer in New South Wales, Australia, 2008 to 2012 [^11191Jhw]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2016). Low credibility.

Increasing phase 3 evidence has been published about the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiation therapy in comparison with standard fractionation in early-stage, node-negative breast cancer. However, uptake of hypofractionation has not been universal. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypofractionation regimen variations in practice across public radiation oncology facilities in New South Wales (NSW).

Patients with early breast cancer registered in the NSW Clinical Cancer Registry who received radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer in a publicly funded radiation therapy department between 2008 and 2012 were identified. Data extracted and analyzed included dose and fractionation type, patient age at first fraction, address (for geocoding), year of diagnosis, year of treatment, laterality, and department of treatment. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type.

Of the 5880 patients fulfilling the study criteria, 3209 patients (55%) received standard fractionation and 2671 patients (45%) received hypofractionation. Overall, the use of hypofractionation increased from 37% in 2008 to 48% in 2012 (range, 7%-94% across departments). Treatment facility and the radiation oncologist prescribing the treatment were the strongest independent predictors of hypofractionation. Weaker associations were also found for age, tumor site laterality, year of treatment, and distance to facility.

Hypofractionated regimens of whole breast radiation therapy have been implemented with varying uptake across different facilities and providers.

### Hypofractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy [^113euPYZ]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

For decades, adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) has been an established standard of care after mastectomy for locally advanced breast cancer. Standard fractionation over a course of 5 to 7 weeks has historically been used to achieve excellent tumor control with low toxicity. However, this regimen can be inconvenient for patients and can increase health care costs.

Hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) has been established as a standard of care for the majority of patients with early-stage breast cancer. However, the expanded use of a hypofractionated (HF) approach in the settings of postmastectomy and regional nodal irradiation is an area of active investigation. Early results support the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy (HF-PMRT). Based on long-term data and results of ongoing trials, HF-PMRT may evolve into a new standard of care.

### Preliminary results of hypofractionated radiotherapy in breast cancer in Chandigarh, India: Single-centre, non-inferiority, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^117GNuMb]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Radiotherapy plays an important role in the management of breast cancer. Over the years, radiotherapy dose fractionation has changed from conventional fraction to hypofraction. There is a continuous effort to settle this radiation dose fractionation and treatment duration phenomenon in breast cancer. In this endeavor, we have published clinical outcomes of a 2-week fractionation schedule where it was observed that acute and late effects were acceptable, with control rates similar to those reported in other trials with hypofractionation. Based on these findings, we started a phase 3 randomised trial to compare a 3-week radiotherapy schedule with a 2-week schedule. Here, we present the acute toxicity and cosmesis data, which are the secondary endpoints of this trial. Local recurrence and survival will be reported at 5 years follow-up.

### Acute toxicity and quality of life of hypofractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer [^112g4SLS]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2020). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the acute toxicity and quality of life (QOL) of hypofractionation compared with conventional fractionation for whole breast irradiation (WBI) following breast-conserving surgery.

- **Methods and materials**: Women with node-negative breast cancer who had undergone breast-conserving surgery with clear margins were randomly assigned to either conventional WBI of 5000 cGy in 25 fractions over 35 days or hypofractionated WBI of 4256 cGy in 16 fractions over 22 days. Acute skin toxicity and QOL were assessed at baseline and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks from the start of treatment for a subgroup of patients. Additionally, QOL was assessed at baseline and 4 weeks post-treatment for all patients. In the acute toxicity substudy, repeated measures modeling was used to analyze treatment by time interactions over the 8-week period for acute toxicity and QOL mean change score. The QOL mean change score from baseline to 4 weeks post-treatment was compared for all patients.

- **Results**: In the acute toxicity substudy, 161 patients participated. In the main trial, 1152 patients participated. Initially, acute skin toxicity was similar between groups, but hypofractionation resulted in less toxicity compared with conventional fractionation toward the end of the 8-week period (P < .001). At 6 weeks from the start of treatment, QOL was improved with hypofractionation for domains such as skin side effects, breast side effects, fatigue, attractiveness, and convenience (all P < .05). In the main trial, hypofractionation led to improved overall QOL and QOL attributed to skin side effects, breast side effects, and attractiveness (all P…

### Definitive hypofractionated radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and proton beam therapy for intact breast tumors [^115wZa5S]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence of breast cancer in the elderly population cannot be understated, with a rate of 47% in women aged ≥ 70 years. However, the management of elderly patients continues to be an area of controversy, with undertreatment of this group becoming more common in the modern era. Recent data suggest that surgical treatment of patients aged ≥ 75 years with stage I-III breast cancer has declined from 90.8% in 1995 to 69.9% in 2011. Even in patients who undergo surgery, adjuvant therapy recommendations continue to be nebulous.

Much of the controversy revolves around patients with multiple medical comorbidities that are expected to independently limit their life expectancy. This premise was the impetus for several prospective trials that sought to identify a low-risk cohort of elderly women with early-stage breast cancer amenable to treatment de-escalation. Some of these patients may have such severe medical comorbidities that they are rendered ineligible for primary surgical resection.

Comorbidities increase dramatically with age, from 9% in patients aged < 50 years to 56% in patients aged ≥ 80 years. Despite these independently life-limiting comorbidities, breast cancer continues to be a significant cause of death in elderly women. A population-based study in the Netherlands reviewed records of patients with a median age of 85.9 years from 1995 to 2005 who were diagnosed with resectable breast cancer but did not undergo surgical resection. The review found that breast cancer was the primary cause of death in 34% of cases.

### Preliminary results of hypofractionated radiotherapy in breast cancer in Chandigarh, India: single-centre, non-inferiority, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial [^116TqRvo]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2024). High credibility.

Globally, most of the randomised trials with hypofractionation in patients with breast cancer have used the 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy technique (3D-CRT). As facilities for 3D-CRT may not be available in low-resource settings, there is a need to determine if hypofractionation is feasible and safe with a 2-dimensional (2-D) technique. In this study, we compared a 3-week radiation schedule with a 2-week schedule of hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients with breast cancer using a 2-D technique.

The study was an open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial. Patients with stage I-III breast cancer, post-mastectomy or after breast-conservative surgery, who needed adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy, were randomised in the Department of Radiotherapy & Oncology, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India, to either 34Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks (2-week arm), or 35Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks to the chest wall and 40Gy/15#/3wks to the breast and supraclavicular fossa (3-week arm). A boost dose, when indicated, was 8–10Gy/2–4#/2–4 days in both arms. Patients were planned on a 2-dimensional (2D) simulator with two tangential fields to the breast/chest wall and an incident supraclavicular fossa field. Acute toxicity was assessed using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grading scale. Assessments were carried out weekly during radiotherapy and at 4 weeks after treatment by the physician. The cosmetic outcome was assessed using the Harvard/National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)/RTOG scale.

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) Trial A of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial [^113gXiU1]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Procedures

START Trial A patients were randomized to either 50 Gy in 25 fractions (control group) or 41.6 Gy in 13 fractions or 39 Gy in 13 fractions (experimental schedules). All regimens were administered over 5 weeks to eliminate treatment time as a variable. This treatment involved five fractions per week in the control group and five treatments per fortnight (Monday, Wednesday, Friday one week, Tuesday and Thursday the next week) in each of the two experimental schedules.

Randomization was arranged via telephone at the Clinical Trials and Statistics Unit at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR-CTSU), Sutton, UK, where patient details were recorded and treatment was allocated. Randomization was not blinded. Computer-generated random permuted blocks were used as the method of allocation, with patients stratified by hospital, type of surgery (breast conserving surgery or mastectomy), and intention to give a tumor bed boost dose or not. Use of adjuvant systemic treatment was recorded, with a requirement of at least a 2-week gap between exposure to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Patients lay in a supine treatment position. The planning target volume was defined as the whole breast with a 1 cm margin to palpable breast tissue; where regional radiotherapy was indicated, the planning target volume was supraclavicular nodes with or without axillary chain with a 1 cm margin. The decision to give regional radiotherapy was made before randomization and was only used in 14% of patients.

### The impact of hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy on local relapse in patients with grade 3 early breast cancer: a population-based cohort study [^117Pq1CJ]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2012). Low credibility.

To determine whether patients with grade 3 early breast cancer have an inferior rate of local disease control at 10 years with hypofractionated radiotherapy compared with more conventionally fractionated schedules, a study was conducted.

- **Methods and materials**: Local relapse rates were compared between patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy or conventionally fractionated radiotherapy to the whole breast. This was done in a population-based cohort of women with early-stage (T1-T2, N0, M0) grade 3 breast cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 and referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency. Cumulative rates of local relapse were estimated using a competing risk method. Factors significant on univariate analysis were included with fractionation group in a multivariate model. The primary end point was local control at 10 years.

- **Results**: A total of 1,335 patients with grade 3 tumors were treated with adjuvant radiotherapy: 252 with conventional fractionation and 1,083 with a hypofractionated schedule. The 10-year cumulative incidence of local relapse was 6.9% in the hypofractionated group and 6.2% in the conventionally fractionated group (p = 0.99).

- **Conclusions**: There is no evidence that hypofractionation is inferior to conventional fractionation for breast conserving therapy in patients with grade 3 breast cancer in this large population-based series after 10 years of follow-up.

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trial A of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial [^114sDvpU]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

At the time of analysis, 93 (4.2%) patients had local-regional tumor relapse, and the hazard ratios relative to the 50 Gy group were 1.05 (95% CI 0.63–1.75) after 41.6 Gy and 1.26 (95% CI 0.77–2.08) after 39 Gy. The estimated absolute differences in local-regional relapse rates compared with 50 Gy at 5 years were 0.2% (95% CI −1.3% to 2.6%) after 41.6 Gy and 0.9% (95% CI −0.8% to 3.7%) after 39 Gy. Since the main concern over hypofractionation is an excess risk rather than a possible benefit, a more precise estimate of the potential excess risk of local-regional relapse was obtained from the upper limit of the one-sided 95% CI for the absolute difference in 5-year local-regional relapse rates for each 13-fraction schedule compared with 50 Gy. These indicated an estimated maximum 2.1% and 3.2% excess risk associated with 41.6 Gy and 39 Gy compared with 50 Gy, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier and cumulative hazard rate plots for local-regional relapse according to fractionation schedule illustrate the low event rate in all randomized groups.

- **Survival analyses**: Survival analyses of relapse and mortality according to fractionation schedule in START Trial A.

- **Kaplan-Meier plot**: Kaplan-Meier plot (A) and Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard plot (B) of local-regional tumor relapse in 2236 patients.

The unadjusted α/β value for local-regional relapse estimated from a Cox proportional hazards regression model was 4.8 Gy (95% CI 0–16.3). Adjusting for prognostic factors resulted in extremely wide confidence limits, since the main effects for total dose and total dose × dose per fractionation schedule could not be accurately determined.

### Geographic and physician-level variation in the use of hypofractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer in the U.S.: A cross-classified multilevel analysis [^115XzvXe]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

Our study has limitations. First, our study includes only employer-sponsored insurance claims for breast cancer patients receiving radiation therapy, which may not be generalizable to populations with other health insurance plans. Second, certain physician-level characteristics can influence their preference for HF-WBI use, including age, gender, years of practice, and school of medical training. The HCCI database does not cover that granular information on the type of physician, so we acknowledge that we can only quantify the overall variation across radiation oncologists but cannot pinpoint exact reasons for this variation. Third, HCCI data were only available until 2017 in this study, which hindered additional analysis of the most recent publication of the 2018 ASTRO guideline on HF-WBI and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors may affect future HF-WBI adoption, and we anticipate a rapid increase in HF-WBI utilization beyond our study period, but to our knowledge, few studies at the time of writing have studied uptake after the 2018 ASTRO guideline was released or post-pandemic. Future studies should further investigate the trend and the situation of HF-WBI use in the U.S.

In conclusion, HF-WBI utilization increased over time (from 2008 to 2017) in the US, but it may take a long time for its full adoption in the U.S. This study demonstrated physician-level and geographic heterogeneity in using HF-WBI among women with early-stage breast cancer. The impact of physicians' medical training and institutional practices on HF-WBI use needs to be further studied.

### Hypofractionated postmastectomy radiation therapy [^116DXYCb]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) is an important component in the multidisciplinary management of patients with breast cancer. Patients with early-stage disease are often treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS), followed by adjuvant RT, with or without systemic agents. In the postmastectomy setting, patients with locally advanced disease, such as node-positive patients, often receive adjuvant RT to the chest wall and draining lymphatics. The benefits of postmastectomy radiation treatment (PMRT) have been demonstrated in multiple randomized trials, as well as the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group meta-analysis, showing improved survival among patients with locally advanced disease.

The most commonly used regimens from prior randomized trials consisted of 1.8 to 2 Gy delivered daily to a total dose of 45 to 50 Gy, with an optional 10 to 16 Gy tumor bed boost. Treatment was delivered to the breast/chest wall with or without regional nodal irradiation. This regimen is referred to as standard fractionation (SF). Hypofractionation consists of the delivery of more than 2.0 Gy daily per fraction over 3 to 4 weeks, to a total dose that is radiobiologically equivalent to the SF. Although the efficacy and tolerability of the SF treatment schedule are well-established, challenges of this prolonged course include inconvenience to the patient, escalation of healthcare costs, and excess use of resources. Using data modeling, Khan et al. demonstrated that widespread adoption of shorter whole-course regimens can address these issues.

### Single-institution prospective evaluation of moderately hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost with or without lymphatic drainage irradiation after breast-conserving surgery [^111sM5rh]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Until 1990, adjuvant breast radiation therapy (RT) employed a fractionation regimen historically named standard fractionation, known today as conventional fractionation (CF). This regimen involves administering the radiation dose over 5 to 7 weeks with 25 to 35 fractions of 1.8 to 2.0 Gy. By that time, clinical evidence, through heterogeneous and diverse patient cohorts, as well as radiobiology modeling data, provided indications that breast cancer could have a higher sensitivity to dose per fraction than other common cancers, with an α/β ratio close to 3.8 Gy. This created the basis for trials testing moderate hypofractionation with a breast RT course delivered with 15 to 20 fractions in 2 to 4 weeks, which was thought to provide similarly high tumor control as standard fractionation and have a low toxicity profile.

Starting in 1986, multiple clinical trials emerged exploring moderate hypofractionation in settings of adjuvant breast RT. The seven most significant of them recruited more than 12,000 patients altogether. These trials provided evidence of the effective and safe use of moderately hypofractionated whole-breast RT (mhWBRT) regimens instead of a conventional 25-fraction regimen, which allows for better addressing the increasing global needs in RT as well as providing more convenience to the patients. Results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer boost versus no boost trial with a 20-year follow-up demonstrated the importance of boost dose to the tumor bed, which provides a 4.4% reduction.

### Altered fractionation: Rationale and justification for whole and partial breast hypofractionated radiotherapy [^113giV7g]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Over the last two decades, there have been significant advances in the application of radiotherapy following breast-conserving surgery. Two important developments are the implementation of whole-breast hypofractionation and accelerated partial-breast irradiation. Three large randomized trials comparing whole-breast hypofractionation with conventional fractionation for early breast cancer have demonstrated similar rates of local recurrence and morbidity. Consequently, whole-breast hypofractionation is now considered an option for selected patients post-breast-conserving surgery. The use of accelerated partial-breast irradiation (APBI) has been explored through various techniques, including multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy, balloon-based brachytherapy, external-beam radiotherapy, and intraoperative radiotherapy. Numerous single and multi-institutional studies have reported favorable long-term results with APBI in terms of tumor control and toxicity, particularly in highly selected, low-risk patients. However, the long-term results from large phase III trials comparing APBI with whole-breast irradiation are still awaited.

### Variation in the use of radiotherapy fractionation for breast cancer: Survival outcome and cost implications [^115YBJrv]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

Substantial variation in the adoption of hypofractionation for breast radiation therapy has been observed, despite the availability of consensus guidelines. This study aimed to investigate the variation in radiation therapy fractionation in breast cancer patients in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, and to estimate survival outcomes and cost implications.

- **Materials and methods**: This is a population-based cohort of patients who received radiation therapy for breast cancer (2009–2013), as captured in the NSW Central Cancer Registry. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with fractionation type. Survival outcome was estimated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Cost per treatment and potential cost savings associated with evidence-based fractionation were estimated.

- **Results**: A total of 10,482 patients were available for analysis, divided into three cohorts (breast alone: N = 7000; breast + nodes: N = 1119; all chest wall: N = 2363). In multivariable analysis, increasing age, laterality (right), year of treatment (2013), early stage, lower socioeconomic status, and regional area of residence were independent predictors of hypofractionation for breast alone radiation therapy. For the breast + nodes and chest wall cohorts, increasing age was a common factor predicting the use of hypofractionation. In multivariable survival analysis, there was no difference between the fractionation regimens at five years. The estimated radiation therapy cost of this cohort approximated $52.1 million, compared with $38.5 million had these practices been fully aligned with evidence-based fractionation.

### Adoption of hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation for early-stage breast cancer: A National Cancer Data Base analysis [^111GfRX5]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2014). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of patient, hospital, and cancer characteristics with the adoption of hypofractionation in a national sample of patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer.

- **Methods and materials**: We performed a retrospective study of breast cancer patients in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2011 who were treated with radiation therapy and met eligibility criteria for hypofractionation. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with the receipt of hypofractionation versus conventional fractionation.

- **Results**: We identified 13,271 women (11.7%) and 99,996 women (88.3%) with early-stage breast cancer who were treated with hypofractionation and conventional fractionation, respectively. The use of hypofractionation increased significantly, with 5.4% of patients receiving it in 2004 compared to 22.8% in 2011 (p < 0.001 for trend). Patients living ≥ 50 miles from the cancer reporting facility had increased odds of receiving hypofractionation (odds ratio 1.57 [95% confidence interval 1.44–1.72], p < 0.001). Adoption of hypofractionation was associated with treatment at an academic center (p < 0.001) and living in an area with high median income (p < 0.001). Hypofractionation was less likely to be used in patients with high-risk disease, such as increased tumor size (p < 0.001) or poorly differentiated histologic grade (p < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The use of hypofractionation is rising and is associated with increased travel distance and treatment at an academic center. Further adoption of hypofractionation may be tempered by both clinical and nonclinical factors.

### Fractionation for whole breast irradiation: An American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) evidence-based guideline [^116sgcky]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2011). Low credibility.

In patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery, randomized trials have found little difference in local control and survival outcomes between patients treated with conventionally fractionated (CF-) whole breast irradiation (WBI) and those receiving hypofractionated (HF-) WBI. However, it remains controversial whether these results apply to all subgroups of patients. We therefore developed an evidence-based guideline to provide direction for clinical practice.

A task force authorized by the American Society for Radiation Oncology weighed evidence from a systematic literature review and produced the recommendations contained herein.

The majority of patients in randomized trials were aged 50 years or older, had disease Stage pT1–2 pN0, did not receive chemotherapy, and were treated with a radiation dose homogeneity within ± 7% in the central axis plane. Such patients experienced equivalent outcomes with either HF-WBI or CF-WBI. Patients not meeting these criteria were relatively underrepresented, and few of the trials reported subgroup analyses. For patients not receiving a radiation boost, the task force favored a dose schedule of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions when HF-WBI is planned. The task force also recommended that the heart should be excluded from the primary treatment fields (when HF-WBI is used) due to lingering uncertainty regarding late effects of HF-WBI on cardiac function. The task force could not agree on the appropriateness of a tumor bed boost in patients treated with HF-WBI.

### Disease control after hypofractionation versus conventional fractionation for triple negative breast cancer: Comparative effectiveness in a large observational cohort [^112FrySb]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2022). Low credibility.

Questions remain about whether moderately hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation is appropriate for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.

- **Methods and materials**: Using the prospective database of a multicenter, collaborative quality improvement consortium, we identified patients with node-negative, triple-negative breast cancer who received whole-breast irradiation with either moderate hypofractionation or conventional fractionation. Using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), we compared outcomes using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimation method with Cox regression models estimating the hazard ratio for time-to-event endpoints between groups.

- **Results**: The sample included 538 patients treated at 18 centers in one state in the United States, of whom 307 received conventionally fractionated whole-breast irradiation and 231 received moderately hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation. The median follow-up time was 5.0 years (95% confidence interval, 4.77–5.15 years). The 5-year IPTW estimates for freedom from local recurrence were 93.6% (95% CI, 87.8%-96.7%) in the moderate hypofractionation group and 94.4% (95% CI, 90.3%-96.8%) in the conventional fractionation group. The hazard ratio was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.51–2.17; p = 0.89). The 5-year IPTW estimates for recurrence-free survival were 87.8% (95% CI, 81.0%-92.4%) in the moderate hypofractionation group and 88.4% (95% CI, 83.2%-92.1%) in the conventional fractionation group. The hazard ratio was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.62–1.67; p = 0.95).

The 5-year IPTW estimates for overall survival were 96.6% (95%…

### The effect of breast volume on toxicity using hypofractionated regimens for early stage breast cancer for patients [^1177X6FP]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Patients**: We identified a total of 114 patients who met the inclusion criteria, of whom 83 were treated with HFRT and 31 were treated with CFRT. A boost of 8 to 12 Gy to the lumpectomy cavity was administered in 55% of patients. The median follow-up time was 42 months. The patient characteristics were well balanced between the HFRT and CFRT treatment regimens, including age, stage, and receptor status, with the exception of follow-up time because HFRT was more recently adopted. Local control was excellent. There was only 1 local recurrence in a patient who was treated with CFRT, which occurred 23 months after completion of the radiation therapy. There were no distant recurrences.

### The effect of breast volume on toxicity using hypofractionated regimens for early stage breast cancer for patients [^116PBgpe]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most common cancer in women. Historically, women who developed breast cancer were treated with mastectomy. However, lumpectomy followed by whole breast radiation therapy has since been shown to carry an equivalent risk of recurrence compared with mastectomy, thereby allowing women to conserve their breasts. The survival benefits of adjuvant radiation therapy for early-stage breast cancer were demonstrated by a systematic review of 17 randomized studies comparing mastectomy with lumpectomy and radiation.

Most of the trials reviewed used the conventional fractionation radiation therapy (CFRT) regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2 Gy. There is increasing interest in reducing the duration of radiation treatment with the use of fraction sizes greater than 2 Gy, known as hypofractionation. Several recent large randomized prospective studies have shown equal efficacy of hypofractionation radiation therapy (HFRT) regimens and conventional regimens. Whelan et al. found that HFRT of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions is not inferior to CFRT with 50 Gy in 25 fractions in women with early-stage breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery with negative margins and negative lymph nodes. Likewise, Haviland et al. found that HFRT of 40.05 Gy in 15 fractions was as effective as 50 Gy in 25 fractions and was associated with lower rates of breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast edema.

### Hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation in women less than 50 years old treated on 4 prospective protocols [^114a2o2U]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2018). Low credibility.

Hypofractionated whole-breast radiation therapy (RT) has demonstrated equivalence to conventionally fractionated RT in multiple randomized trials. Controversy exists regarding its application in younger women due to their underrepresentation in trials and concerns about late toxicity. This study evaluated disease control and cosmetic outcomes in patients under 50 years treated with hypofractionated RT in four prospective single-institutional trials.

From 2003 to 2015, a total of 1313 patients were enrolled in four prospective protocols investigating the use of adjuvant hypofractionated RT after breast-conserving surgery, with a daily or weekly concomitant boost. For this analysis, the records of 348 patients under 50 years at consultation were identified. Overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method by study and across studies using meta-analytic methods. The late effects of RT, clinician-rated cosmesis, and patient-rated cosmesis were also evaluated.

With a median follow-up period of 66.9 months, the overall survival rate was 99.6%, the disease-free survival rate was 96.3%, and the local recurrence-free survival rate was 97.7% at 3 years. Clinician-rated cosmesis (n = 242) was excellent or good in 93.4% of cases and fair or poor in 6.6%. Patient-rated cosmesis (n = 259) was excellent or good in 86.1% and fair or poor in 13.9%. When discrepancies arose between patient and physician ratings, patients more often rated themselves poorly compared to their physicians (P = 0.0044, Cochran-M).

### Clinical experience using hypofractionated radiation schedules in breast cancer [^116eZoWN]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Hypofractionation is attractive for whole- or partial-breast irradiation because it permits treatment to be given with fewer fractions in a shorter period of time and at less cost. A number of cohort studies suggest that hypofractionation may be given to the whole breast safely and with good local control. Recent randomized trials have confirmed that hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation is equivalent to more conventional whole-breast irradiation with respect to local recurrence and cosmetic outcome.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in hypofractionation for the delivery of partial-breast irradiation using a number of techniques, including high-dose-rate brachytherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiation using external-beam techniques, and intraoperative therapy. Early cohort studies report good local control and acceptable morbidity. Randomized trials are now underway to compare this approach to conventional whole-breast irradiation.

### Geographic and physician-level variation in the use of hypofractionated radiation therapy for breast cancer in the U.S.: A cross-classified multilevel analysis [^112KgkP6]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

The role of radiation oncologists in hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation (HF-WBI) has been investigated in the U.S. and Europe due to their serving as the primary gatekeepers determining radiation modality. Bekelman et al. showed that the density of radiation oncologists was associated with a higher likelihood of HF-WBI. Surveys of radiation oncologists have found large variation in preference for HF-WBI across doctors in the U.S. and Europe. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, Boero et al. estimated the effect of radiation oncologists on HF-WBI use to be a median odds ratio (MOR) of 3.08 in breast cancer patients older than 65.

Quite consistently, we found the MOR for radiation oncologists was 2.95 for patients 65 or older and 2.98 for patients younger than 65. Despite key clinical findings of similar efficacy and toxicity profiles, physicians hesitate to use HF-WBI due to concerns about potential cardiac toxicities associated with higher doses per fraction, as discussed in previous studies. Financial considerations can also play an important role in HF-WBI adoption. Studies have shown that HF-WBI reduced costs and personal financial adversity. Physicians may not be motivated to recommend lower-number-fractionation schedules due to lower revenue per patient compared with conventional fractionation whole-breast irradiation (CF-WBI), especially for U.S. physicians under a fee-for-service reimbursement structure. This may explain the relatively slow uptake of HF-WBI utilization in the U.S.

The 2018 ASTRO guideline recommending HF-WBI to women with breast cancer regardless of age, tumor grade, or receptor status may accelerate the adoption of these practices.

### Implementation and utilization of hypofractionation for breast cancer [^114LU2z4]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

The patient cohort receiving hypofractionation (HF) was divided into two groups based on their treatment alignment with the selection criteria. One group followed the ASTRO 2011 guidelines, while the other adhered to our clinical directives, which were more inclusive. Our clinical directives allowed for more liberal treatment of patients with ductal carcinoma in situ and those who had received prior chemotherapy, based on retrospective data showing equivalence and no detriment compared to conventional fractionation.

We also included patients with left-sided disease, provided that cardiac exposure was minimal, and patients with large separations of more than 25 cm, as long as the hot spots were below 107%, based on the planning criteria outlined in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Study 1005, which was open at that time.

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trial A of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial [^115sArU2]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

The international standard radiotherapy schedule for breast cancer treatment delivers a high total dose in 25 small daily doses (fractions). However, a lower total dose delivered in fewer, larger fractions (hypofractionation) is hypothesized to be at least as safe and effective as the standard treatment. We tested two dose levels of a 13-fraction schedule against the standard regimen, aiming to measure the sensitivity of normal and malignant tissues to fraction size.

Between 1998 and 2002, 2236 women with early breast cancer (pT1–3a pN0–1 M0) at 17 centers in the UK were randomly assigned after primary surgery to receive 50 Gy in 25 fractions of 2.0 Gy versus 41.6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions of 3.2 Gy or 3.0 Gy over 5 weeks. Women were eligible if they were over 18 years old, did not have an immediate surgical reconstruction, and were available for follow-up. The randomization method was computer-generated and not blinded. The protocol-specified principal endpoints were local-regional tumor relapse, defined as the reappearance of cancer at irradiated sites, late normal tissue effects, and quality of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779.

- **Findings**: 749 women were assigned to the 50 Gy group, 750 to the 41.6 Gy group, and 737 to the 39 Gy group. After a median follow-up of 5.1 years (IQR 4.4–6.0), the rate of local-regional tumor relapse at 5 years was 3.6% (95% CI 2.2–5.1) after 50 Gy, 3.5% (95% CI 2.1–4.3) after 41.6 Gy, and 5.2%.

### Can the adoption of hypofractionation guidelines expand global radiotherapy access? An analysis for breast and prostate radiotherapy [^112T66W4]. JCO Global Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

The breast and prostate conventional fractionation (CF) schemes used in this study were clinically compared with hypofractionation (HF) schemes. Our whole breast radiotherapy (WBRT) HF scheme was based on the 2018 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) guideline. The 2018 ASTRO WBRT guideline was developed by the ASTRO Guidelines Subcommittee after evaluating new evidence and conducting a systematic literature review of existing WBRT guidelines. The preferred scheme for women with invasive breast cancer receiving WBRT is an HF dose of 40 Gy in 15 fractions or 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions. We selected the lower fraction scheme of 40 Gy in 15 fractions because radiotherapy (RT) cost was mostly contained by the reduction in fractions.

The same approach was applied for prostate RT. We obtained the optimum HF scheme for external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) of localized prostate cancer from the 2018 evidence-based consensus published by ASTRO, American Urological Association (AUA), and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Suggested optimum regimens for moderate prostate RT HF include the schedules used with the largest number of patients in randomized clinical trials: 60 Gy delivered in 20 fractions of 3 Gy over 4 weeks or 70 Gy delivered in 28 fractions of 2.5 Gy over 5.5 weeks. These moderate HF doses can be offered as an alternative to CF regardless of cancer risk group, patient age, comorbidity, anatomy, or baseline urinary function. The consensus could not determine one regimen to be superior to the other because they have not been compared in clinical trials. In this study, we used the lower fraction scheme of 20 fractions for the best possible cost minimization. It is noted that the cost of treatment preparation does not necessarily increase with the complexity.

### Definitive hypofractionated radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and proton beam therapy for intact breast tumors [^115bzC76]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Fennessy et al. reported late follow-up (median: 12.7 years) of 455 elderly patients aged over 70 years who were randomized to surgery plus tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone. The 5-year rates of local progression after treatment with mastectomy plus tamoxifen, breast conservation plus tamoxifen, and tamoxifen alone, were 8%, 18%, and 64%, respectively. These high rates of local recurrence in the tamoxifen-alone arm translated into significantly higher rates of breast cancer–related mortality and overall mortality. Elsewhere in the literature, the rates of local relapse with tamoxifen treatment alone have ranged from 40% to 81% with longer follow-up.

The elevated risk of local recurrence with tamoxifen alone and its lack of efficacy in hormone-receptor-negative tumors prompted an investigation into definitive radiation therapy as a possible treatment for inoperable patients. Thomas et al. report the results of a French retrospective review of 319 patients treated with definitive radiation therapy using 45 Gy delivered to the whole breast with a 20 to 45 Gy boost. When stratified by individual patient risk, patients with low-risk tumors achieved 80% to 90% 5-year local control. The authors also noted that tumor size and histological grade were intricately associated with local control after definitive radiation therapy. Unfortunately, patients treated to doses greater than 75 Gy in this era were observed to have very poor cosmetic results, including nipple displacement and breast retractions.

### Hypofractionation in breast cancer radiotherapy across World Bank income groups: Results of an international survey [^117VVxUp]. JCO Global Oncology (2023). Low credibility.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with the most rapid increases in incidence occurring in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Radiotherapy is an essential component of breast cancer treatment, but large global disparities in access have limited the extent to which women can benefit. Although these disparities are most pronounced in LMICs, they are also present in more well-resourced regions such as Europe. Hypofractionation, in which larger doses per day are delivered over shorter periods of time, has been identified as an important mechanism for improving access and reducing the cost of treatment without compromising outcomes. Yet, there is limited understanding of its adoption in the treatment of breast cancer across different resource settings and the factors affecting its use.

Use of moderate hypofractionation for breast cancer radiotherapy has been well established in the adjuvant setting based on several large randomized trials. More recently, the FAST and Fast-Forward trials have established the noninferiority of ultra-hypofractionation regimens involving five fractions for early-stage disease after breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and openly accruing trials are evaluating this regimen for node-positive disease. In the palliative setting, hypofractionation has been used to provide both effective symptom control and maintain quality of life. Economic analyses in different settings have also demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of these shortened fractionation schedules.

### Alleviating morbidity from locally advanced breast cancer using a practical and short radiation therapy regimen: Results of the HYPORT palliative studies [^115rnJvf]. International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics (2023). High credibility.

Palliative ultrahypofractionated radiation therapy to the breast is well tolerated, effective, and results in a durable response with improved quality of life (QOL). This could be considered a standard for locoregional treatment of locally advanced breast cancers commonly encountered in less resourced countries and backed up by these studies.

Hypofractionated palliative breast radiation therapy was evaluated for its safety and efficacy through the HYPORT and HYPORT B phase 1/2 studies. Two separate regimens were tested: the HYPORT study used 35 Gy in 10 fractions, while HYPORT B administered 26 Gy to the breast and a 32 Gy tumor boost in 5 fractions. These regimens were designed to save overall treatment time, reducing it from 10 to 5 days.

Fifty-eight patients, the majority of whom had been pretreated with systemic therapy, completed the treatment. Notably, no grade 3 toxicity was reported. Response assessments at 3 months revealed substantial improvements. In the HYPORT study, improvement in ulceration (58% vs. 22%, P = 0.013) and bleeding (22% vs. 0%, P = 0.074) was observed. In the HYPORT B study, reductions were noted in ulceration (64% vs. 39%, P = 0.2), fungating wounds (26% vs. 0%, P = 0.041), bleeding (26% vs. 4.3%, P = 0.074), and discharge (57% vs. 8.7%, P = 0.003).

In terms of metabolic response, rates of 90% and 83% were observed in the two studies, respectively. Improvements in QOL scores were apparent across both studies. Only 10% of the patients experienced local relapse within one year.

### Definitive hypofractionated radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer: Dosimetric feasibility of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy and proton beam therapy for intact breast tumors [^115higjo]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Each plan for all three radiotherapy types was created to deliver a prescription dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions to the PTV, with a biological effective dose (BED) of 175 Gy and an equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions (EQD2) of 116.7 Gy, using an alpha-beta ratio of 4 for breast cancer cells. Proton beam orientation was adjusted to maximize PTV coverage and minimize the maximum dose to the OARs, including the chest wall and skin. Notably, PTV coverage was reduced if the maximum dose to the skin and chest wall exceeded planning guidelines.

The prescription dose was chosen for its ablative potential in other cancer sites, such as non-small cell lung cancer, and for its higher BED relative to a previously reported 5-fraction schedule used in the adjuvant breast cancer setting. Additionally, prior clinical research on definitive radiation treatment for breast cancer identified that an EQD2 of 75 Gy is required to achieve clinical outcomes similar to those of surgery plus adjuvant radiation.

- **Dose constraints**: Used in this report were based on TG 101 and the recently reported phase 1 dose escalation trial for early-stage breast cancer using 5-fraction (maximum dose of 40 Gy) stereotactic body radiation therapy for partial-breast radiation. This phase 1 dose escalation trial reported excellent clinical outcomes, minimal toxicity, and good cosmesis using these OAR dose constraints. An additional chest wall dose constraint was applied based on Memorial Sloan Kettering data evaluating the risk of chest wall toxicity in patients treated with 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy.

### Implementation and utilization of hypofractionation for breast cancer [^117QjQft]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Although we focus on just one aspect of implementing both a clinical directive system with defaulted choices and prospective peer-review rounds, namely the impact on breast hypofractionation (HF), making the changes required ultimately reshapes an entire department. The committee that created and manages the directives involved elements from all clinical staff to ensure the continued buy-in and usefulness of these treatment approaches. Early on, there was acculturation of clinicians to the system as they exposed their contours and prescriptions not only to peer scrutiny but possibly the scrutiny of nonphysician staff who were present. As jarring as this may be at first, we believe it was essential to developing the culture necessary to make these changes quickly. As a bonus, it created an atmosphere in which the staff was encouraged to address issues and conflicts in the open, which we believe will ultimately decrease rates of medical errors.

This study's limitations are that it is a retrospective review with incomplete data available for full clinicopathologic analysis. As such, the study makes it difficult to define causal relationships between the increase in HF and use of clinical directives with default rules and peer-reviewed prospective contouring rounds. For example, a small but significant proportion of patients continued to receive conventional fractionation. At this time, the reasons for this are not clear. Previously, Jagsi et al. examined potential drivers within this patient population, and their analysis suggested that nonpathologic factors (e.g. age, treatment year, education).

### Hypofractionated versus conventional fractionated radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery in the modern treatment era: A multicenter, randomized controlled trial from China [^11255G6d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

No randomized trials have compared hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) with conventional fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) after breast-conserving surgery in the Asian population. This study aimed to determine whether a 3.5-week schedule of HFRT is noninferior to a standard 6-week schedule of CFRT in China.

Patients from four Chinese institutions who had undergone breast-conserving surgery and had T1–2N0–3 invasive breast cancers participated in this study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated central randomization schedule, without stratification, to receive whole-breast irradiation with or without nodal irradiation. This was followed by a tumor-bed boost, either at a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks with a boost of 10 Gy in five fractions over 1 week (CFRT) or 43.5 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks with a boost of 8.7 Gy in three daily fractions (HFRT). The primary endpoint was 5-year local recurrence (LR), and a 5% margin of 5-year LR was used to establish noninferiority.

Between August 2010 and November 2015, 734 patients were assigned to the HFRT (n = 368) or CFRT (n = 366) group. At a median follow-up of 73.5 months (interquartile range, 60.5–91.4 months), the 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 1.2% in the HFRT group and 2.0% in the CFRT group (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.20 to 1.88; p = 0.017 for noninferiority). There were no significant differences in acute and late toxicities, except that the HFRT group had less grade 2–3 acute skin toxicity than the CFRT group (P = 0.019).

### Benefits of adopting hypofractionated radiotherapy as a standard of care in low-and middle-income countries [^1151fSuw]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Access to radiotherapy in many regions is often limited because of an insufficient number of radiation oncology clinics, trained personnel, and treatment machines. The consequences of limited availability of radiotherapy are best illustrated by a report from Brazil in 2016, which found that limited access to radiotherapy was estimated to result in more than 5,000 deaths among patients with prostate, breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical cancer. In a 2020 analysis of 46 countries, it was estimated that radiotherapy is only accessible to approximately 62% of the patients who could benefit from it and that an additional 5,987 treatment machines would be needed in LMICs to fully meet the radiotherapy demand. Accessibility varies by region, with one report indicating that access to radiation was lowest in Africa (34%), followed by Asia-Pacific (61%) and Latin America (88%).

Clearly, additional investment in infrastructure is needed, but the required investment can be reduced with optimal utilization of radiotherapy through hypofractionation. Adopting hypofractionated treatment approaches alone was estimated to improve access to radiotherapy in Asia from 62% to 78% and decrease the number of treatment machines needed in LMICs from 5,987 to 4,284, significantly reducing the investment required to improve access to radiotherapy. Another published report estimated that implementing universal hypofractionated treatments for breast and prostate cancer would increase access to radiotherapy in Africa by up to 25% for breast cancer.

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trial A of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: a randomised trial [^114JEa8z]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). High credibility.

A median follow-up of 5 years is too short to allow assessment of all the potential late normal tissue effects, such as cardiac damage. Follow-up of all women within the trial is continuing in order to assess the long-term effects of the fractionation schedules. However, the RMH/GOC pilot data (median follow-up of 10 years) showed that the relative effects of different fractionation schedules remain unchanged over time. A 15–20 years follow-up will be needed to reliably measure cardiac effects. The short-term priority is to protect the heart from exposure to radiotherapy, something that is now possible with advanced radiotherapy technologies.

In conclusion, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancer shows similar responsiveness to fraction size as the late responding normal tissues of the breast, as indicated by the α/β estimates. A 13-fraction regimen is unlikely to represent the limits of hypofractionation. The ongoing NCRN FAST Trial is testing five fractions of 5.7 Gy and 6.0 Gy, treating one fraction per week, with a long-term aim to reduce overall treatment time, not just for the convenience to patients, but to minimise the potential effect of rapid tumour growth during radiotherapy.

### Accelerated fractionation with a concurrent boost for early stage breast cancer [^114zQLun]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Hypofractionated radiation refers to treatment with greater than 2 Gy per fraction, usually in fewer sessions and over a shorter period compared to conventional radiation fractionation. Randomized prospective trials of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) have demonstrated comparable outcomes to conventional fractionation in early stage post-lumpectomy radiation for selected patient groups. These data have changed the traditional radiobiology estimation of the alpha/beta ratio that predicted fractionation sensitivity for breast cancer, suggesting that further increases in dose per fraction are possible for early stage breast cancer without significantly increasing late effects.

Many questions remain regarding hypofractionated WBI, spanning from optimal patient selection to radiation techniques, including dose planning optimization and the incorporation of a tumor bed boost. A concurrent radiation boost has been studied in a number of single-institution studies and has shown to be feasible with acceptable acute and short-term late toxicity. A Phase III trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG 1005) in North America and other trials in Europe are currently studying in-breast cancer control from hypofractionated WBI with a concurrent tumor bed boost. Results from these trials could improve the acceptance and broaden the applicability of hypofractionation treatment courses for patients with early stage breast cancer.

### Randomised controlled trials on radiation dose fractionation in breast cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis with emphasis on side effects and cosmesis [^112QViWR]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

Use of ultra-hypofractionation as per the FAST-Forward trial garners differing levels of endorsement across major guidelines, reflecting ongoing debates. The European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) and the Italian Association for Radiotherapy and Clinical Oncology endorse 26 Gy in five fractions for both whole breast and chest wall irradiation without reconstruction as standard of care. For chest wall irradiation after breast reconstruction, ESTRO advises its use only within clinical trials. Similarly, in the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends 26 Gy in five fractions over one week for patients with invasive breast cancer undergoing partial breast, whole breast, or chest wall radiation therapy, excluding those requiring regional lymph node irradiation, following breast conserving therapy or mastectomy. For implant based reconstruction, NICE recommends moderate hypofractionation using 40 Gy in 15 fractions. By contrast, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommends that the FAST-Forward regimen of 26 Gy in five fractions should be offered as an alternative to the FAST regimen (28.5 Gy in five weekly fractions) for selected early stage disease, noting that the efficacy and safety results of the former are not yet available beyond five years. The German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) recommends cautious use of postoperative whole breast radiation therapy in five fractions (FAST and FAST-Forward regimens), especially in patients with good long term prognosis.DEGRO also advises against ultra-hypofracti

### The UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trials of radiotherapy hypofractionation for treatment of early breast cancer: 10-year follow-up results of two randomised controlled trials [^116owq5d]. The Lancet Oncology (2013). High credibility.

Five-year results of the UK standardisation of breast radiotherapy (START) trials suggested that lower total doses of radiotherapy delivered in fewer, larger doses (fractions) are at least as safe and effective as the historical standard regimen (50 Gy in 25 fractions) for women after primary surgery for early breast cancer. In this prespecified analysis, we report the 10-year follow-up of the START trials testing 13 fraction and 15 fraction regimens.

- **Methods**: From 1999 to 2002, women with completely excised invasive breast cancer (pT1–3a, pN0–1, M0) were enrolled from 35 UK radiotherapy centres. Patients were randomly assigned to a treatment regimen after primary surgery, followed by chemotherapy and endocrine treatment (where prescribed). Randomisation was computer-generated and stratified by centre, type of primary surgery (breast-conservation surgery or mastectomy), and tumour bed boost radiotherapy. In START-A, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 41.6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks. In START-B, a regimen of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks was compared with 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks. Eligibility criteria included age older than 18 years and no immediate surgical reconstruction. Primary endpoints were local-regional tumour relapse and late normal tissue effects. Analysis was by intention to treat. Follow-up data are still being collected. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial, number ISRCTN59368779.

- **Findings**: START-A enrolled 2236 women. Median follow-up was 9.3 years.
