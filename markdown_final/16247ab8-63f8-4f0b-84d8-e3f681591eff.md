## Question

The patient reports neck pain as the primary complaint, rated at 8 in severity, with an insidious onset and constant course for more than 3 months, radiating to both arms; associated symptoms include numbness and tingling.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate and manage a patient with severe chronic neck pain radiating bilaterally to the arms with paresthesias, i.e., suspected cervical radiculopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about synthesizing the presenting features and pretest probabilities. Then, I should urgently screen for red flags and myelopathy. Next, I will plan the focused physical examination. After that, I will refine the differential diagnosis. Then, I need to decide on optimal imaging and its timing. Next, I will initiate evidence-based conservative therapy while imaging is pending. Then, I should define follow-up and escalation criteria. After that, I will consider surgical indications and options. Finally, I will address long-term monitoring, outcomes, and prognostic factors [^113rMUix] [^112bMHmB] [^113mU6WU] [^114bRJTi].

> Let me first synthesize the clinical picture: chronic severe neck pain with bilateral arm radiation and paresthesias strongly suggests cervical radiculopathy, and the bilateral involvement raises suspicion for multilevel pathology; however, I need to keep cervical myelopathy on the radar given the chronicity and sensory symptoms, because missing cord involvement would be consequential, so I should not overcommit to radiculopathy before ruling out myelopathy [^116S3TCb] [^114bRJTi] [^112ChgZq].

> Wait, let me verify the immediate priorities before treatment: I must screen for myelopathy red flags such as progressive limb weakness, gait imbalance, falls, hyperreflexia, clonus, pathologic Babinski, hand clumsiness, and any bowel or bladder dysfunction, plus systemic red flags like fever, weight loss, known malignancy, or recent significant trauma; if any are present, I should arrange urgent cervical MRI and prompt neurosurgical evaluation because delayed management worsens neurological outcomes, and guidelines emphasize prioritizing suspected myelopathy in the initial neck pain assessment [^113rMUix] [^116F8ccs] [^112ChgZq].

> Next, I should review the focused examination methodically: I will assess deep tendon reflexes (diminished suggests radiculopathy, hyperreflexia suggests myelopathy), perform myotomal strength testing C5–T1 and dermatomal sensation mapping, and use provocative maneuvers such as Spurling, upper limb tension testing, and the shoulder abduction sign to reproduce or relieve radicular symptoms; I also need to evaluate gait and hand dexterity to unmask subtle cord dysfunction, and I should confirm any upper motor neuron signs before proceeding with traction or manipulation [^116S3TCb] [^111tqt5H] [^115P5mao].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — my differential should remain broad: leading considerations are cervical radiculopathy from disc herniation or spondylosis, cervical myelopathy that must be actively excluded, cervical facet joint pain that can mimic axial or referred symptoms, and peripheral mimics including entrapment neuropathies and thoracic outlet syndrome; I need to match neuroanatomic patterns on exam and avoid anchoring bias, especially when bilateral symptoms could reflect multilevel foraminal stenosis or early cord disease [^116S3TCb] [^112ChgZq] [^1142daVD] [^117SEr4B].

> I will now examine the imaging strategy and timing: in nontraumatic radiculopathy without red flags, first-line imaging is a cervical spine MRI without contrast to delineate disc herniation, foraminal stenosis, and potential cord compression; if there is known malignancy or infection concern, MRI with or without contrast is appropriate, and with suspected infection specifically, MRI with IV contrast is preferred; if there is prior cervical surgery or suspicion for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament on radiographs, CT or radiographs may be the initial adjunct, and if MRI is contraindicated, CT myelography can be considered; given severe symptoms with bilateral sensory involvement, I should obtain MRI on an urgent basis rather than defer, but I should double-check there are no contraindications to MRI first [^112bMHmB] [^114TU3YD] [^117MvHAM] [^112uz4a7] [^1156VQ3e].

> Let me think about immediate conservative measures while imaging is pending, provided no myelopathy is suspected: evidence-based nonpharmacologic care includes supervised physical therapy with cervical and thoracic mobilization/manipulation, stretching and strengthening, neurodynamic techniques, and optional intermittent traction for radicular pain; I need to ensure traction is avoided if myelopathy is suspected, and any cervical collar use should be short-term only to prevent deconditioning; for medications, short courses of NSAIDs can reduce pain and improve function in acute musculoskeletal pain, and I will avoid routine opioids; importantly, I should reassure the patient that many cases improve over weeks to a few months with conservative care, though I will caution that chronicity and bilateral symptoms may temper expectations [^113mU6WU] [^115DZLNq] [^114zeqPE] [^114bRJTi].

> I should confirm a structured reassessment window: at 4–6 weeks, I will re-evaluate pain trajectory, functional status using validated tools like the Neck Disability Index, and a repeat neurological exam for any new weakness or sensory changes; if symptoms are improving meaningfully, I will progress rehabilitation, but if there is no improvement or deterioration, I should ensure the MRI has been obtained to guide next steps; if myelopathic signs emerge at any point, I must arrange urgent surgical evaluation without delay, and I should document outcomes with validated measures to ensure decision-making is objective and reproducible [^116S3TCb] [^116qbmCY] [^112ChgZq].

> Hmm, wait a minute — if conservative therapy fails or deficits progress, I need to outline surgical decision-making clearly: absolute indications include progressive myelopathy or motor weakness, and relative indications include persistent, function-limiting radicular pain beyond 6–12 weeks despite appropriate nonoperative care; surgical options include anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, cervical disc arthroplasty in selected cases to preserve motion, and posterior foraminotomy for lateral soft disc herniations; arm pain relief rates of 80–90% are typical, but earlier decompression for myelopathy is associated with better outcomes, so I should verify symptom timelines carefully before recommending surgery [^114bRJTi] [^112GyuyJ] [^112FDevW] [^113BNdEk] [^116F8ccs].

> I need to ensure long-term planning is in place: for patients improving nonoperatively, I will emphasize maintenance exercise, ergonomics, posture training, and activity modification with periodic follow-up; for postoperative patients, structured rehabilitation and activity precautions are standard, and long-term registry data suggest patient-reported outcomes remain stable from 1 year to long-term follow-up, though there is a small risk of reoperation and adjacent segment disease; I should also account for prognostic factors such as baseline disability, symptom duration, smoking, and workers' compensation status when counseling on expectations and monitoring [^116M2Qab] [^116SUMJk] [^112z19n1].

> But wait, what if I missed special scenarios earlier? If there is a history of prior cervical surgery with new radiculopathy, I should remember that radiographs or CT might be the better initial imaging to assess hardware and alignment before MRI; conversely, if infection or malignancy is suspected based on clinical cues, I should pivot to contrast-enhanced MRI and expedite laboratory workup and oncology or infectious disease input, which corrects my initial assumption of routine noncontrast MRI for all-comers [^112uz4a7] [^117MvHAM] [^114TU3YD].

> Final check and summary: this patient's chronic severe bilateral arm symptoms are most consistent with multilevel cervical radiculopathy, but my priority remains ruling out cervical myelopathy via targeted history, focused neurological examination, and appropriately urgent MRI; in the absence of red flags, I will initiate guideline-concordant conservative care with active rehabilitation and NSAIDs, reassess rigorously at 4–6 weeks with validated measures, and refer for surgical evaluation if deficits progress, pain remains disabling, or myelopathy is identified, as timely decompression improves neurological outcomes [^113rMUix] [^112bMHmB] [^113mU6WU] [^114bRJTi] [^116F8ccs].

The most likely diagnosis is **cervical radiculopathy** [^114bRJTi] due to chronic nerve root compression from degenerative cervical spondylosis or disc herniation [^117GwPNu], given the insidious onset, constant severe neck pain radiating to both arms, and numbness/tingling. MRI [^112bMHmB] is the initial **imaging of choice** to confirm nerve root compression and exclude myelopathy or other serious pathology [^111vkoEz]. Management should start with NSAIDs, neuropathic agents [^112GyuyJ], and a multimodal physical therapy program [^113mU6WU]; consider epidural steroid injections if symptoms persist [^116S3TCb], and refer for surgical evaluation if there is progressive neurological deficit or refractory pain [^112FDevW].

---

## Differential diagnosis

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Relevance to patient** |
|-|-|-|
| Cervical radiculopathy | - Neck pain radiating to arms <br/> - Numbness/tingling <br/> - Motor weakness <br/> - Reflex changes [^112JjCVH] | Highly consistent |
| Cervical myelopathy | - Neck pain <br/> - Bilateral arm symptoms <br/> - Gait disturbance <br/> - Hand clumsiness <br/> - Hyperreflexia <br/> - Bowel/bladder dysfunction [^111vkoEz] | Possible, but no clear myelopathic signs reported |
| Peripheral neuropathy | - Distal symmetric numbness <br/> - Tingling <br/> - Weakness | Less likely due to proximal radiation pattern |
| Brachial plexopathy | - Arm pain <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Sensory changes | Less likely due to bilateral involvement and neck pain |
| Thoracic outlet syndrome | - Arm pain <br/> - Numbness <br/> - Weakness <br/> - Positional symptoms | Less likely due to constant symptoms and neck pain |
| Myofascial pain syndrome | - Neck pain <br/> - Referred arm pain <br/> - Trigger points | Less likely due to neurological symptoms |

---

Given the chronicity, severity, bilateral radiation, and neurological symptoms, **cervical radiculopathy** is most likely [^114bRJTi].

## Pathophysiology of cervical radiculopathy

Cervical radiculopathy results from **compression or irritation of the cervical nerve roots**, most often due to degenerative changes (disc herniation or spondylosis) [^112JjCVH]. Compression leads to inflammation, ischemia, and demyelination, causing pain, sensory disturbances, and motor weakness [^114bRJTi].

---

## Clinical evaluation

- **History**: Detailed characterization of pain, neurological symptoms, functional impairment, and red flags (e.g. myelopathy, malignancy, infection) [^113rMUix].
- **Physical examination**: Neurological examination assessing motor strength, sensory deficits, reflex changes, and provocative tests (Spurling's, distraction, Valsalva) [^116S3TCb] [^115P5mao].
- **Functional assessment**: Neck Disability Index (NDI) to quantify disability and monitor treatment response [^116qbmCY].

---

## Diagnostic imaging

- **MRI**: Initial imaging modality of choice to visualize nerve root compression, disc herniation, and exclude myelopathy or other serious pathology [^112bMHmB].
- **CT**: Useful if MRI is contraindicated or to assess bony structures [^1156VQ3e].
- **X-ray**: Limited utility but may show degenerative changes.

---

## Conservative management

- **Medications**: NSAIDs, neuropathic agents (gabapentin, pregabalin), muscle relaxants [^116S3TCb] [^112GyuyJ].
- **Physical therapy**: Multimodal approach including mechanical intermittent cervical traction [^113mU6WU], stretching, strengthening exercises, cervical and thoracic mobilization/manipulation.
- **Epidural steroid injections**: Consider if symptoms persist despite conservative measures [^116S3TCb].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

Surgical intervention is indicated for **progressive neurological deficit** — manifested by motor weakness, reflex changes, or sensory loss — or for refractory pain that persists despite conservative therapy [^112FDevW]. It is also indicated when **myelopathy** is present with evidence of spinal cord compression or dysfunction [^116F8ccs].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis for cervical radiculopathy is **generally favorable** [^114bRJTi], with most patients improving with conservative management, though chronic symptoms may persist and surgical intervention may be necessary in refractory cases [^112GyuyJ].

---

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **cervical radiculopathy** due to chronic nerve root compression. MRI is the initial **imaging modality of choice** [^112bMHmB], and conservative management should be initiated [^113mU6WU]. Surgical intervention may be necessary if neurological deficits progress or symptoms persist despite conservative treatment [^112FDevW].

Cervical radiculopathy is a common condition that usually results from compression and inflammation of the cervical nerve root or roots in the region of the neural foramen. It is frequently caused by cervical disc herniation and cervical spondylosis. The diagnosis can be established by history and physical examination; however, care should be taken, as diagnoses can mimic or coexist with cervical radiculopathy, such as entrapment neuropathies.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for neck pain, specifically in relation to physical therapy and neck pain with radiating pain, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend offering mechanical intermittent cervical traction. This should be combined with other interventions such as stretching and strengthening exercises, as well as cervical and thoracic mobilization/manipulation, for patients with chronic neck pain with radiating pain. Additionally, provide education and counseling to encourage participation in occupational and exercise activities.

### Nonoperative management of cervical radiculopathy [^116S3TCb]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy describes pain in one or both of the upper extremities, often in the setting of neck pain, secondary to compression or irritation of nerve roots in the cervical spine. It can be accompanied by motor, sensory, or reflex deficits and is most prevalent in persons 50 to 54 years of age. Cervical radiculopathy most often stems from degenerative disease in the cervical spine.

The most common examination findings are painful neck movements and muscle spasm. Diminished deep tendon reflexes, particularly of the triceps, are the most common neurologic finding. The Spurling test, shoulder abduction test, and upper limb tension test can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Imaging is not required unless there is a history of trauma, persistent symptoms, or red flags for malignancy, myelopathy, or abscess. Electrodiagnostic testing is not needed if the diagnosis is clear but has clinical utility when peripheral neuropathy of the upper extremity is a likely alternate diagnosis.

Patients should be reassured that most cases will resolve regardless of the type of treatment. Nonoperative treatment includes physical therapy involving strengthening, stretching, and potentially traction, as well as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, and massage. Epidural steroid injections may be helpful but have higher risks of serious complications. In patients with red flag symptoms or persistent symptoms after four to six weeks of treatment, magnetic resonance imaging can identify pathology amenable to epidural steroid injections or surgery.

### Cervical radiculopathy [^114bRJTi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disorder involving dysfunction of cervical nerve roots that commonly manifests as pain radiating from the neck into the distribution of the affected root. Acute cervical radiculopathy generally has a self-limited clinical course, with up to a 75% rate of spontaneous improvement. Thus, nonsurgical treatment is the appropriate initial approach for most patients. When nonsurgical treatment fails to relieve symptoms or if a significant neurologic deficit exists, surgical decompression may be necessary. Surgical outcomes for relief of arm pain range from 80% to 90% with either anterior or posterior approaches.

- **Question 2: Can history and physical examination be used to identify a painful facet joint, or to select people for prognostic blocks?**
	- Cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most commonly implicated clinically in neck pain, while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration. Injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain, particularly in cases of whiplash. Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥ 4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least 6 weeks in the absence of focal neurological findings.

	- The targeted facet joints are usually decided based on patient reports and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy. In postsurgical patients, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty. Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain, such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis.

	- In a study by Cohen et al, historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes revealed that pain radiating to the occiput and a history…

Spinal or cervical cord compression with resultant myelopathy is a known and serious complication of MPS VI. SCC is expected to occur in the natural history of the disease, including in patients on Naglazyme. There have been postmarketing reports of patients treated with Naglazyme who experienced the onset or worsening of SCC, requiring decompression surgery. Patients with MPS VI should be monitored for signs and symptoms of spinal or cervical cord compression, including back pain, paralysis of limbs below the level of compression, and urinary and fecal incontinence, and should be given appropriate clinical care.

### A systematic review of definitions for neurological complications and disease progression in patients treated surgically for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111AGu8N]. Spine (2019). Low credibility.

This systematic review aims to (1) outline how neurological complications and disease progression are defined in the literature and (2) evaluate the quality of definitions using a novel four-point rating system.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a progressive, degenerative spine disease that is often treated surgically. Although uncommon, surgical decompression can be associated with neurological complications, such as C5 nerve root palsy, perioperative worsening of myelopathy, and longer-term deterioration. Unfortunately, important questions surrounding these complications cannot be fully addressed due to the heterogeneity in definitions used across studies. Given this variability, there is a pressing need to develop guidelines for the reporting of surgical complications in order to accurately evaluate the safety of surgical procedures.

An electronic database search was conducted in MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies that reported on complications related to DCM surgery and included at least 10 surgically treated patients. Data extracted included study design, surgical details, as well as definitions and rates of surgical complications. A four-point rating scale was developed to assess definition quality for each complication.

Our search yielded 2673 unique citations, 42 of which met eligibility criteria and were summarized in this review. Defined complications included neurological deterioration and late-onset deterioration.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^117SEr4B]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

With regard to criteria for the inclusion of patients, many authors stress the value of elaborate history taking. However, except for pain, we found no specific mention of history taking being included in the diagnostic criteria of studies.

Neck pain radiating into the arm or cervicobrachial pain is a common feature in cervical radiculopathy (CR), but is not distinguishable per se, as it could have other causes such as thoracic outlet syndrome or referred pain. Nerve root compression is supposed to result in both neuropathic and nociceptive pain. Possibly, future selection criteria should also consider these different natures of pain. A more specific definition of CR should therefore include an ability to distinguish the nerve root pain present in CR from other musculoskeletal disorders and neurological conditions, such as brachial plexus pathology, pseudo-radicular pain, peripheral nerve entrapment, or even non-specific neck pain.

There was no mention of using validated questionnaires for distinguishing neuropathic from nociceptive pain, such as the Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ), ID Pain, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS), Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN-4), or painDETECT. Because neuropathic pain has a worse prognosis than nociceptive pain and treatments specifically target neuropathic pain, future studies could consider using these questionnaires to select and tailor participants to different treatment strategies.

Diagnostic labeling could well include results from physical examination. Only five studies mentioned this aspect.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111hJa24]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal disorders are common in patients referred to electrodiagnostic medicine specialists. Not all pain that radiates to the buttock, thigh, leg, or foot arises from compression of one or more lumbosacral spinal nerve roots. Recognition of musculoskeletal disorders that may mimic radiculopathy is important to avoid unnecessary diagnostic testing, potentially inappropriate invasive procedures, and to improve patient care and satisfaction.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^116FRTXw]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Reasons for discordance**: Due to the distinct nature of MBB and RFA from a procedural standpoint, it should be acknowledged that pain relief is likely going to be greater for MBB than for RFA. In the cervical and lumbar spinal regions, respectively, Cohen et al. and Dreyfuss et al. found that the injectate in MBB frequently spreads to other pain-generating structures such as muscles, spinal nerve roots, and adjacent facet joints, which is not the case for the smaller controlled lesions affected by RFA. MBBs will also invariably block the dorsal ramus and its other branches, thereby alleviating pain arising from paraspinal musculature. Pain relief after MBB is measured in hours so, unlike RFA outcomes which should endure for months, the placebo effect may extinguish in some people who undergo denervation. This would result in better short-term outcomes for facet blocks than long-term outcomes for neurotomy. However, it should be noted that the placebo effect is generally stronger for more invasive procedures (i.e. it may be greater for RFA than facet blocks), may last for months, and be repeated with similar results.

- **Non-pain measures**: Pain should always be evaluated in context, as a change in activity levels, anxiety, or analgesic usage can significantly affect pain intensity. In patients with chronic pain, improving function may be a more meaningful and realistic benchmark than pain relief, with several high-impact spinal intervention studies using disability as their primary endpoint. For relief of acute pain, many experts advocate using the utilization of rescue analgesic methods.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^111tqt5H]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend using motion limitations in the cervical and upper thoracic regions, presence of cervicogenic headache, history of trauma, and referred or radiating pain into an upper extremity for classifying neck pain into the following categories:

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Classifying symptoms based on observed motion limitations can aid in categorizing neck pain effectively.

- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments**: This includes conditions such as whiplash-associated disorder, where coordination is affected.

- **Neck pain with headaches (cervicogenic headache)**: Identifying cervicogenic headaches is crucial for accurate classification and treatment.

- **Neck pain with radiating pain (radicular)**: Consideration of radiating pain can help diagnose and manage radicular issues effectively.

Using these categories can guide initial assessment and help in the development of an appropriate treatment plan.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^111REXsC]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Data extracted from studies designed for other objectives show that more procedures were performed on one to two joints than on multiple joints, and a large majority of procedures were unilateral. No sustained complications or side effects were reported that can be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or radiofrequency ablation, even in cases in which the third occipital nerve was ablated bilaterally alone or in combination with other medial branches.

- **Studies reporting bilateral and/or multi-level cervical medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation**: Studies by the same group of investigators have sought to determine, through controlled blocks performed one level at a time, the number and distribution of affected joints in patients with chronic neck pain after whiplash. In the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement. Although elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis often have multiple levels concomitantly affected, the clinical significance of this in the context of other degenerative changes (e.g. uncovertebral joints, cervical discs) is unclear. Performing medial branch blocks at multiple segments may lead to unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial radiofrequency ablation but for subsequent procedures as well.

- **Case reports**: There are two published case reports of dropped head syndrome after cervical medial branch radiofrequency ablation.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^1112o1Y7]. Pain Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The C2–3 joint pathology is considered a valid etiology of cervicogenic headaches. The C2–3 facet joint is innervated by the third occipital nerve (TON); hence, headaches arising from C2–3 pathology were called third occipital headache in the past. Lord and colleagues evaluated the prevalence of TON headache among 100 patients with neck pain for at least 3 months following whiplash using history, physical examination, and diagnostic cervical medial branch block (MBB) with local anesthetics (LA). The prevalence of TON headache in this cohort was 27% (95% CI 18% to 36%), and as high as 53% (95% CI 37% to 68%) among those with headache as the dominant symptom. No unique features on history or examination correlated with positive MBB results. Patients with a positive block were significantly more likely to be tender over the C2–3 facet joint, with a sensitivity of 85%.

Reports in the literature suggest available evidence is not definitive on any symptoms or signs being specific for the cervical facet joints as the cause of pain. The generally accepted reference standard for diagnosing the cervical facet joints as the primary cause of pain is relief of the pain following cervical MBB with LA of nerves that supply the putative painful joint(s). Diagnostic blocks are performed at segments suggested by matching the distribution of the patient's pain with known referral patterns or by identifying tender areas under fluoroscopy.

- **Referral patterns of pain for pain arising from cervical facet joints**: The referral patterns of pain arising from the cervical facet joints have been evaluated in the context of different diagnostic scenarios.

### Qalsody [^115hS8rC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: The following clinically significant adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: myelitis and/or radiculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]; papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]; aseptic meningitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% of patients treated with Qalsody and greater than placebo) were pain, fatigue, arthralgia, increased cerebrospinal fluid white blood cells, and myalgia [section 6.1].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of Qalsody cannot be directly compared to rates in clinical trials of other drugs and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The safety of Qalsody 100 mg was evaluated in 147 patients with SOD1-ALS. The median patient exposure was 119.4 weeks (ranging from 4 to 212 weeks). Qalsody was evaluated in the placebo-controlled Study 1 and in the open-label extension Study 2. In Study 1 Part C, approximately 43% were female, 57% were male, 64% were White, and 8% were Asian. The mean age at entry in Study 1 Part C was 49.8 years (range 23 to 78 years).

The most common adverse reactions (≥ 10% of patients treated with Qalsody and greater than placebo) were pain, fatigue, arthralgia, increased CSF white blood cells, and myalgia.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111WgvrR]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Many of the mimics of L1 radiculopathy are pathologies of the hip joint. In general, when trying to distinguish radiculopathy from hip joint pathology, a diagnostic hip joint injection can be helpful to clarify whether the etiology of the pain is from the hip joint with over 90% accuracy.

### Cervical myelopathy caused by posttraumatic osteophytes resulting from long-standing neglected posterior atlanto-occipital dislocation more than 30 years: A case report [^112qNcou]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

A 75-year-old man presented with neck pain, with a neck visual analog scale score of 4; bilateral radiating arm pain, with an arm visual analog scale score of 5/6; and gait disturbance for 3 months (Supplemental Digital Content 1). On admission, neurologic examination revealed a spastic gait, hand clumsiness, and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in the bilateral upper and lower extremities. The presence of a pathologic Babinski sign and ankle clonus was noted. Muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities was decreased. The grip and release test was performed 12 times for 20 seconds each. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score was 8. However, the patient reported no dysuria or constipation.

An evaluation of the patient's trauma history revealed that he experienced severe trauma to the neck following a fall from 5 meters, 31 years ago, without any neurologic deficit or sign of spinal cord injury. He had been admitted to a local private hospital for 1 week and underwent a radiographic examination. Posterior atlanto-occipital dislocation (AOD) was suspected then from axial CT scans, but he was discharged without any surgery as his pain improved after using a brace and taking pain medications. Since that time, he has been working as a farmer for 30 years without any significant problems but found daily activities almost impossible at the time of admission.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^112bvBZZ]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: Can history and physical examination be used to identify a painful facet joint, or to select people for prognostic blocks?

Cervical facet joints are proposed as the primary source of pain in 25–67% of patients with chronic neck pain. The C2–3 and C5–6 joints are the most commonly implicated in neck pain, while C2–3, C3–4, and C4–5 joints are the most likely to display radiological features of degeneration. Injury to the neck increases the probability of the facet joints being the source of chronic neck pain, particularly in cases of whiplash.

Frequently used criteria for considering patients for prognostic blocks include neck pain of moderate-to-severe intensity (score ≥ 4 out of 10 on a pain intensity scale) radiating to the head, shoulder, or upper arm for at least six weeks in the absence of focal neurological findings. The targeted facet joints are usually decided upon based on patient reports and tenderness on examination, sometimes performed under fluoroscopy.

In postsurgical patients, adjacent segments are often affected after arthrodesis, and treated levels bear more force during extension following disc arthroplasty. Factors that decrease the probability of the cervical facet joints being pain generators include prominent pathology of other likely sources of neck pain, such as markedly degenerated or herniated intervertebral discs and symptomatic spinal stenosis.

In a study by Cohen et al. that evaluated historical and physical examination features associated with successful cervical medial branch RFA outcomes, pain radiating to the occiput and a history of…

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^111vkoEz]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Detecting early degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) can be challenging. A high index of suspicion, alongside a comprehensive neurological examination, is advised. Commonly reported symptoms and examination findings in DCM include the following:

- **Clinical**: Pain is a common reason to seek treatment. Musculoskeletal pain might be present in the neck, while neuropathic pain can affect upper and lower limbs and occasionally the trunk. Patients often report neck stiffness, at times without pain. A textbook case would describe gait dysfunction and bilateral hand impairment. Frequently, not all symptoms are present; for example, pain might be absent, and symptoms can be unilateral and vary in severity, even on a daily basis. Atypical symptoms such as headaches and muscle cramps are also reported.

The more consistent feature of DCM is the evolution of symptoms. Most patients describe symptoms that have been ongoing for months and getting worse. The rate of progression varies; in some individuals, symptoms remain mild over extended periods, while in others, disease progression accelerates. Functional decline can be insidious, and patients might mistakenly attribute these symptoms to "getting older". Typical features include loss of dexterity, such as difficulty doing up buttons, using keys, mobile phones, or writing, and loss of mobility, including the use of walking aids or frequent falls.

Symptoms might precede objective examination findings. As in focal central nervous system disorders, examination features in DCM have a low sensitivity — that is, a normal finding does not rule out the disease.

### The effect of an anterior cervical operation for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy on associated headaches [^111GgFzC]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2009). Low credibility.

Headaches related to the cervical spine have been reported by various authors, and modalities of treatment are as varied as their speculated causes. The purpose of this study was to determine if anterior cervical reconstructive surgery (cervical arthrodesis and disc arthroplasty) for the treatment of radiculopathy or myelopathy also helps to alleviate associated headaches.

- **Methods**: We conducted a post hoc analysis of study cohorts combined from prospective studies comparing the results of Prestige and Bryan cervical arthroplasty devices and those of anterior cervical arthrodesis with allograft and anterior instrumentation. A total of 1004 patients (51.6% were male) were evaluated using the Neck Disability Index questionnaire preoperatively and at five points postoperatively, with the latest evaluation at twenty-four months, resulting in a follow-up of 803 patients.

- **Results**: At the twenty-four-month follow-up, the improvement from baseline regarding headache was significant in both groups (p < 0.0001), with patients who underwent arthroplasty reporting numerically better pain scores. Most arthroplasty and arthrodesis patients (64% and 58.5%, respectively) had improvement in the pain score of at least one grade. Conversely, the pain scores for 8.4% of those who had an arthroplasty and 13.7% of those who had arthrodesis worsened by at least one grade. For the remainder, the score was unchanged. Overall, the patients who had an arthroplasty had significant improvement more frequently than did the patients who had arthrodesis (p = 0.011).

### Cervical spondylotic myelopathy and radiculopathy treated by oblique corpectomies without fusion [^112xKKBH]. Neurosurgical Review (2004). Low credibility.

Oblique corpectomy (OC) is an alternative technique for the resection of spondylotic spurs ventral to the cervical spinal cord, contributing to cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and cervical spondylotic radiculopathy (CSR). To evaluate the efficacy of OC for the treatment of cervical spondylotic myeloradiculopathy, we reviewed our experience with OC.

Twenty-six patients, 18 males and 8 females, were studied. They averaged 51.3 years of age (range 30–72). Thirteen had myelopathy and 13 had radiculopathy. Both magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT) were performed preoperatively to define the extent of pathology. The Modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score was used to grade the quality of the outcome.

Neurologic and radiologic results were assessed. Good and excellent results were observed in 76.9% of the cases with myelopathy. Improvement of radicular symptoms was noted in 84.6% of the cases with radiculopathy. Neuroimaging studies confirmed satisfactory anatomical decompression in all patients. Sagittal alignment decreased from 13 degrees to 12 degrees.

The degree of postoperative recovery seemed to be directly related to the age and severity of the preoperative myelopathy. This surgical technique has shown excellent clinical outcomes with fast recovery and adequate anatomical decompression in patients with CSM and CSR.

### Neurological manifestations of cervical spondylosis: An overview of signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology [^113ePv4e]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

The neurological manifestations of cervical spondylosis include symptomatic compression of the spinal cord (myelopathy), nerve roots (radiculopathy), or a combination of the two (myeloradiculopathy). The term myeloradiculopathy herein defines these often indistinct and inseparable entities. The pathophysiology of myeloradiculopathy is multifactorial in nature, and the natural history of untreated myeloradiculopathy is not clearly defined. We review the signs, symptoms, and clinical findings of cervical myelopathy, radiculopathy, and myeloradiculopathy, and standard grading techniques are also reviewed.

### Eligibility criteria of participants in randomized controlled trials assessing conservative management of cervical radiculopathy: A systematic review [^112KjAEo]. Spine (2023). Low credibility.

This study is a systematic review with the objective of evaluating the inclusion and exclusion criteria for participants in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing conservative management for cervical radiculopathy (CR) to determine if any consensus exists within the literature.

A previous 2012 systematic review identified a lack of uniformity for the eligibility criteria of participants in RCTs evaluating conservative interventions for CR. Since then, a large number of RCTs have been published, signaling the need for an updated evaluation of this topic.

We electronically searched databases including MEDLINE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, and PsycINFO from inception to June 15, 2022, to identify RCTs assessing conservative management of CR. Information extracted was analyzed to determine the level of homogeneity and/or heterogeneity of the inclusion and exclusion criteria across studies.

Seventy-six RCTs met our inclusion criteria with 68 distinct trials identified.

- **Inclusion criteria**: The inclusion of arm pain with or without another symptom (e.g. numbness, paresthesia, or weakness) was required in 69.12% of trials. Additionally, 50% of trials required participants to exhibit neck symptoms, and 73.53% of studies required some form of clinical examination findings, although inconsistencies existed for the number and type of tests used.

- **Exclusion criteria**: Furthermore, 41.18% of trials included imaging, with 33.82% of trials requiring magnetic resonance imaging findings. The most common exclusion criteria included were the presence of red flags and cervical myelopathy in 66.18%.

### Quantifying neurodegeneration of the cervical cord and brain in degenerative cervical myelopathy: A multicentre study using quantitative magnetic resonance imaging [^111srsvn]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

This study explores the neurodegeneration associated with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) through the use of quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) across multiple centers. The research highlights the innovative use of qMRI to assess both the cervical cord and the brain in patients with DCM, providing new insights into the progression of the disease and its impact on neurological health. Findings from this study support the potential of qMRI as a valuable tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of DCM.

### Results of halter cervical traction for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy: Retrospective review of 81 patients [^1117hDyc]. Neurosurgical Focus (2002). Low credibility.

The percentage of patients responding to conservative treatment for cervical radiculopathy secondary to nerve root compression is not well quantified. To clarify this question, the authors retrospectively reviewed the records obtained over a 4-year period in patients with cervical radiculopathy to determine their response to conservative measures such as cervical collar therapy and halter cervical traction.

- **Methods**: Cervical radiculopathy was diagnosed in patients if they suffered from radiating arm pain exacerbated by neck movement and at least one of the following: reflex loss, dermatomal numbness, and/or myotomal weakness. Patients with neck pain alone or arm pain without neurological deficit were excluded from analysis. Those without excruciating pain, severe weakness, or evidence of myelopathy were offered a course of halter traction before considering surgery.

Ninety-six patients met the inclusion criteria; there were 61 males and 35 females, with a mean age of 47 years. Fifty-five patients presented with C-7, 37 with C-6, two with C-5, and two with C-8 radiculopathy. Eighty-one patients underwent a trial of traction consisting of wearing a cervical collar and performing home-based halter cervical traction with 8 to 12 pounds of force, applied for 15 minutes, three times a day for 3 to 6 weeks. The mean duration of symptoms prior to neurosurgical evaluation was 43 days (± 8.3 days standard deviation). Sixty-three (78%) of 81 patients responded to therapeutic traction, experiencing significant or total pain relief. Three could not tolerate the traction.

### Cervical myelopathy: Diagnosis, contemporary treatment, and outcomes [^112ChgZq]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Cervical myelopathy is a clinical syndrome caused by compression of the spinal cord between the levels of the C1 and T1 vertebrae. Its clinical presentation can mimic other degenerative and neurological pathologies, making diagnosis challenging. Diagnosis is confirmed with appropriate imaging studies carefully correlated with patient history and physical examination.

Treatment options focus on decompression of the spinal canal and may involve an anterior, posterior, or combined anterior and posterior surgical approach depending on the location of compression and patient factors. Outcomes are favorable if treatment is performed prior to severe symptom onset.

### Long-term results after surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116M2Qab]. Neurosurgery (2024). High credibility.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a frequent cause of spinal cord dysfunction, and surgical treatment is considered safe and effective. However, there is limited data on long-term results after surgery. This study investigated long-term clinical outcomes using data from the Norwegian registry for spine surgery. Patients who were operated on at the university hospitals serving Central and Northern Norway were approached for long-term follow-up after 3 to 8 years. The primary outcome was the change in the Neck Disability Index, while secondary outcomes included changes in the European Myelopathy Scale score, quality of life measured by EuroQoL EQ-5D, numeric rating scales (NRS) for headache, neck pain, and arm pain, and the perceived benefit of surgery assessed by the Global Perceived Effect scale from 1 year to long-term follow-up.

We included 144 patients operated on between January 2013 and June 2018. In total, 123 participants (85.4%) provided patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at long-term follow-up. The findings indicated no significant change in PROMs from 1 year to long-term follow-up, including the Neck Disability Index (mean 1.0, 95% CI −2.1 to 4.1, P = .53), European Myelopathy Scale score (mean −0.3, 95% CI −0.7 to 0.1, P = .09), EQ-5D index score (mean −0.02, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.05, P = .51), NRS neck pain (mean 0.3, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.9, P = .22), NRS arm pain (mean −0.1, 95% CI −0.8 to 0.5, P = .70), and NRS headache (mean 0.4, 95% CI −0.1 to 0.9, P = .11). According to Global Perceived Effect assessments, 106 out of 121 patients (87.6%) reported being stable or improved, noting "complete recovery" or "much better" outcomes.

### Temporal trends and projections in the global burden of neck pain: Findings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^114X8r5q]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

The annual number of incident cases, prevalent cases, and years lived with disability (YLDs) count, including corresponding rates — non–age-standardized and age-standardized incidence, prevalence, and YLDs rates — by sex, age, region, and country were obtained from the GBD 2019 study. This study is a public resource provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The DisMod-MR 2.1 model, a Bayesian mixed-effects meta-regression tool, was applied to estimate incidence, prevalence, mortality, years of life lost, YLDs, and disability-adjusted life-years for 369 diseases and injuries across 2 sexes, 87 risk factors, and 204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2019. The data details, methodology for data quality and comparability, and statistical modeling for GBD 2019 have been previously explained.

In addition, the sociodemographic index (SDI) was obtained from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation website. The SDI is a summary measure of the total fertility rate for females younger than 25 years, mean years of schooling for those aged 15 years and older, and lag-distributed income per capita, which models changes in consumption because of a change in disposable income. Based on country/territory-level estimates of SDI in 2019, 204 countries and territories in GBD 2019 were grouped into quintiles: high SDI (> 0.805), high–middle SDI (0.689–0.805), middle SDI (0.608–0.689), low–middle SDI (0.455–0.608), and low SDI (< 0.455). GBD 2019 divided the world into 21 regions based on epidemiological and geographical factors. The principal objective of this regionalization was to ensure appropriate analysis across different areas.

### Development and validation of cervical prediction models for patient-reported outcomes at 1 year after cervical spine surgery for radiculopathy and myelopathy [^112z19n1]. Spine (2020). Low credibility.

This study was designed as a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected registry data. Its objective was to develop and validate prediction models for 12-month patient-reported outcomes, including disability, pain, and myelopathy, in patients undergoing elective cervical spine surgery.

Predictive models can be potentially utilized preoperatively to set expectations, adjust modifiable characteristics, and provide a patient-centered model of care. Data from the cervical module of the Quality Outcomes Database was used, focusing on outcomes such as disability (Neck Disability Index), pain (Numeric Rating Scale), and modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for myelopathy. Multivariable proportional odds ordinal regression models were developed for patients with cervical radiculopathy and myelopathy. Included in all models were patient demographic, clinical, and surgical covariates, along with baseline patient-reported outcomes scores. The models were internally validated using bootstrap resampling to estimate the likely performance on a new sample of patients.

A total of 4,988 patients underwent surgery for radiculopathy and 2,641 for myelopathy. For these patients, the most important predictor of poor postoperative outcomes at 12 months was the baseline Neck Disability Index score for those with radiculopathy and the modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association score for those with myelopathy. Additionally, factors such as symptom duration, workers' compensation, age, employment, and ambulatory and smoking status were significant predictors.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cervical pain or cervical radiculopathy: 2024 update [^111HBUxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, ranking in the top five causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging plays a central role in diagnosing cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require different initial imaging to maximize the diagnostic usefulness of imaging.

In this document, we address different cervical pain variants with a detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for addressing each specific variant. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles, such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: A systematic review [^116QF8is]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

All but three studies explicitly stated exclusion criteria. Eight studies excluded patients with specific pathology or medical "red flags", although the examples mentioned differed. Planned imminent treatments (surgery or injection), previous injuries or surgery of the spine, use of medication, clinical signs of cord compression, abnormal neurological signs, or the inability to tolerate the planned intervention were also mentioned as exclusion criteria across the different studies.

Overall, many studies mentioned exclusion criteria, but we found no uniformity in the criteria used to exclude patients with symptoms of cervical radiculopathy (CR). No criteria were considered to be contradictory.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with cervical myelopathy and lumbar radiculopathy [^117DqyBw]. European Spine Journal (2009). Low credibility.

There have been few reports describing cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with spinal degenerative disorders. This study investigated whether interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) could be detected in the CSF of patients with cervical myelopathy or lumbar radiculopathy and whether the concentrations of those cytokines correlated with the severity of disease conditions.

CSF samples were obtained from 21 patients with cervical myelopathy (Group M) and 19 patients with lumbar radiculopathy (Group R), as well as six volunteers (control). The concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in Groups M and R than in the control, possibly demonstrating spinal cord and nerve root damage, respectively. However, TNF-alpha was lower than the detection limit. IL-1beta was detected in only five samples from three patients in Group M and two volunteers in the control. The concentrations of IL-6 did not show any correlation with symptom duration, the scoring system by the Japanese Orthopaedic Association, or the duration of nerve root block. There is a possibility that the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in CSF can indicate certain pathological aspects of cervical myelopathy or lumbar radiculopathy.

### Posterior cervical spine surgery for radiculopathy [^112FDevW]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is now common knowledge that cervical radiculopathy, frequently caused by disc herniation and/or degeneration, will often improve without surgical intervention. Only a small percentage of patients with severe symptoms necessitate surgical treatment. Surgery for radiculopathy is indicated for motor weakness, progressive neurological deficits, and symptoms that do not improve with nonoperative treatment. Advantages and disadvantages exist for both ventral and dorsal approaches in the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Indications and results for dorsal nerve root decompression are discussed, and a review of our preferred techniques, including the use of minimally invasive technology, is presented.

### Degenerative spondylolisthesis of the cervical spine: Symptoms and surgical strategies depending on disease progress [^116XLSWd]. European Spine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Degenerative spondylolisthesis of the cervical spine is rare. Patients typically exhibit signs of progressive myelopathy, radiculopathy, and pain. Treatment strategies include ventral, dorsal, and combined fusion techniques, with or without repositioning and decompression.

- **Methods**: In this study, we present 16 patients with degenerative cervical spondylolisthesis. The leading symptom was severe myelopathy in 8 patients, radiculomyelopathy in 5 patients, and neck pain in 3 patients. Notably, neck pain was the initial symptom in all the patients and decreased when neurological symptoms became more evident. Radiographic examinations included plain radiography, MRI, CT, myelography, and lateral tomography.

- **Results**: Spondylolisthesis was located five times at levels C3/4, C4/5, and C5/6. In three cases, spondylolisthesis was located at level C7/T1. There were two patients with spondylolisthesis at two levels. Instability was demonstrated by flexion/extension radiography in five cases. Patients were divided into three groups according to a newly introduced classification system. The surgical approach corresponded to this classification. In ten patients, the spondylolisthesis could be corrected by extension and positioning, so discectomy and fusion on one or two levels with cage, plate, and screws were sufficient. In five cases, a corpectomy was necessary due to severe spondylosis. In one case, a combined approach with dorsal decompression and release followed by ventral fusion was applied due to additional dorsal spinal cord compression. The follow-up period was 6–52 months.

### Reoperation rates after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and myelopathy: A national population-based study [^116SUMJk]. Spine (2016). Low credibility.

This study is a national population-based cohort study. The objective was to compare the reoperation rates between cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and myelopathy in a national population of patients. There is an inherently low incidence of reoperation after surgery for cervical degenerative disease. Therefore, it is difficult to sufficiently power studies to detect differences between reoperation rates of different cervical diagnoses. National population-based databases provide large, longitudinally followed cohorts that may help overcome this challenge.

The methods involved using the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service national database to select the study population. Patients with the diagnosis of cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion from January 2009 to June 2014 were included. Patients were separated into two groups based on diagnosis codes: cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Age, sex, presence of diabetes, osteoporosis, associated comorbidities, number of operated cervical disc levels, and hospital types were considered potential confounding factors.

The results showed that the overall reoperation rate was 2.45%. The reoperation rate was significantly higher in patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy than in patients with cervical radiculopathy (myelopathy: P = 0.0293, hazard ratio = 1.433, 95% confidence interval 1.037–1.981). Male sex, presence of diabetes or associated comorbidities, and hospital type were noted to be risk factors for reoperation.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^116F8ccs]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Spinal cord compression results in progressive neurological decline and affects quality of life. Left untreated, it can lead to tetraplegia and wheelchair dependence. Data on how many patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) progress this way are unavailable. Surgical decompression can halt disease progression; however, the regenerative capacity of the spinal cord is limited, and any damage is often permanent. Delayed treatment leads to poorer outcomes and lifelong disability. Findings from the AOSpine series (746 patients with DCM) indicate that treatment within six months of symptoms offers the best chance of recovery, but this time frame is some way from average diagnosis times.

### Impact of predominant symptom location among patients undergoing cervical spine surgery on 12-month outcomes: an analysis from the Quality Outcomes Database [^117M2b5Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2021). Low credibility.

The impact of the type of pain presentation on outcomes of spine surgery remains elusive. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of predominant symptom location (predominant arm pain vs. predominant neck pain vs. equal neck and arm pain) on postoperative improvement in patient-reported outcomes.

- **Methods**: The Quality Outcomes Database cervical spine module was queried for patients undergoing 1- or 2-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative spine disease.

- **Results**: A total of 9,277 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these patients, 18.4% presented with predominant arm pain, 32.3% presented with predominant neck pain, and 49.3% presented with equal neck and arm pain. Patients with predominant neck pain were found to have higher (worse) 12-month Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores (coefficient 0.24, 95% CI 0.15–0.33; p < 0.0001). The three groups did not differ significantly in odds of return to work and achieving minimal clinically important difference in NDI score at the 12-month follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: Analysis from a national spine registry showed significantly lower odds of patient satisfaction and worse NDI score at one year after surgery for patients with predominant neck pain when compared with patients with predominant arm pain and those with equal neck and arm pain after 1- or 2-level ACDF. With regard to return to work, all three groups (arm pain, neck pain, and equal arm and neck pain) were found to be similar after multivariable analysis. The authors' results suggest that predominant pain location, especially for patients with neck pain, impacts postoperative outcomes significantly.

### Cervical radiculopathy: Nonoperative management of neck pain and radicular symptoms [^112GyuyJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disease process marked by nerve compression from herniated disk material or arthritic bone spurs. This impingement typically produces neck pain and radiating arm pain or numbness, as well as sensory deficits or motor dysfunction in the neck and upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic myelography can confirm neurologic compression.

The overall prognosis for individuals with cervical radiculopathy is favorable. Most patients improve over time with a focused, nonoperative treatment course. There is little high-quality evidence on the best nonoperative therapy for cervical radiculopathy. Cervical collars may be used for a short period of immobilization, and traction may temporarily decompress nerve impingement. Medications can help alleviate pain and neuropathic symptoms. Physical therapy and manipulation may improve neck discomfort, and selective nerve blocks target nerve root pain. Although the effectiveness of individual treatments is controversial, a multimodal approach may benefit patients with cervical radiculopathy and associated neck pain.

### Pulsed radiofrequency adjacent to the cervical dorsal root ganglion in chronic cervical radicular pain: a double blind sham controlled randomized clinical trial [^111DXHby]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Cervical radicular pain affects approximately 1 in 1000 adults per year. Although many treatment modalities are described in the literature, the available evidence for efficacy is not sufficient to allow definitive conclusions on the optimal therapy. The effect of pulsed radiofrequency treatment for these patients was evaluated in a prospective audit, which showed satisfactory pain relief for a mean period of 9.2 months, justifying a randomized sham-controlled trial.

Twenty-three patients, out of 256 screened, met the inclusion criteria and were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive either pulsed radiofrequency or sham intervention. The evaluation was done by an independent observer. At 3 months, the pulsed radiofrequency group showed a significantly better outcome with regard to the global perceived effect (> 50% improvement) and the visual analogue scale (20-point pain reduction). The quality of life scales also showed a positive trend in favor of the pulsed radiofrequency group, but significance was only reached in the SF-36 domain vitality at 3 months.

The need for pain medication was significantly reduced in the pulsed radiofrequency group after six months. No complications were observed during the study period. These study results align with the findings of our previous clinical audit that pulsed radiofrequency treatment of the cervical dorsal root ganglion may provide pain relief for a limited number of carefully selected patients with chronic cervical radicular pain as assessed by clinical and neurological examination.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: A systematic review [^111vxUhM]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical symptoms

- **Pain**: Eleven studies reported pain as a selection criterion. One study specified that pain intensity should exceed 40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS). Another study adopted inclusion criteria from a different study. The pain location, whether in the arm and/or neck, was described in eleven studies as a criterion, though two studies did not further clarify the terms 'cervicobrachial pain' and 'neck pain'. Two studies focused solely on arm pain; one of these specified that arm pain, with radiation distal to the elbow and provocation by neck movements, should be positive as a selection criterion. Six studies included patients with both neck and arm pain. In three studies, inclusion additionally required pain distribution corresponding to a nerve root.

Five studies described the duration of pain as a selection criterion, involving patients with pain durations ranging from 1 month to 2 years. Consensus was found in 11 out of 13 studies (85%) on pain as a selection criterion, but not on the specific location, intensity, or duration. Only six out of thirteen studies (46%) required simultaneous neck and arm pain.

- **Sensory symptoms**: Five studies used sensory symptoms as selection criteria. One study mentioned using reflex disturbances, motor and sensory deficits, together with distribution.

### Presymptomatic spondylotic cervical cord compression [^114KGvZP]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

We conducted a cohort study of clinically asymptomatic spondylotic cervical cord compression cases, with the primary endpoint being the development of clinical signs of cervical myelopathy. The objective was to investigate whether various demographic, clinical, radiologic, and electrophysiological parameters could predict progression from clinically asymptomatic (preclinical) spondylotic cervical cord compression to symptomatic myelopathy.

The data available on the prediction of the outcome in surgical and conservative treatment of spondylotic cervical myelopathy are controversial. Little is known about the clinical natural history of asymptomatic magnetic resonance image-detected spondylotic cervical cord compression and/or changes of signal intensity.

A group of 66 patients (32 women, 34 men, median age 50 years) with magnetic resonance signs of spondylotic cervical cord compression but without clear clinical signs of myelopathy was followed prospectively for at least 2 years (range, 2–8 years; median, 4 years). Various demographic, clinical, imaging, and electrophysiological parameters were correlated with clinical outcomes.

Clinical signs of myelopathy during the follow-up period were detected in 13 patients (19.7%). The only variables significantly associated with the development of clinically symptomatic spondylotic cervical myelopathy (SCM) were the presence of symptomatic cervical radiculopathy, electromyographic signs of anterior horn lesion, and abnormal somatosensory-evoked potentials.

### Low-back and neck pain diagnosis and treatment [^1162KjRZ]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Back and neck pain are symptoms, often complaints, and sometimes causes of disability, but they are not diseases. These distinctions are critical to understanding the personal and societal impact of back and neck pain and our opportunities to discover new ways to reduce their impact. This article briefly describes the diagnosis and treatment of spinal pain, the relationship between pain and disability, and the challenges in prioritizing our resource allocations between curing pain problems and reducing disability.

### Consensus practice guidelines on interventions for cervical spine (facet) joint pain from a multispecialty international working group [^11565qXj]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Data extracted from studies designed for other objectives reveals the following:

Table 15, which has been referenced, shows studies denoting the number of facet joints and the laterality of treated patients. More procedures were performed on one to two joints than on multiple joints, with a large majority of procedures being unilateral. Importantly, no sustained complications or side effects have been reported that could be attributed to bilateral and/or multi-level facet nerve blocks or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), even in cases where the ton was ablated bilaterally alone or in combination with other medial branches.

- **Studies reporting bilateral and/or multi-level cervical medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation**: Studies by the same group of investigators have sought to determine, through controlled blocks performed one level at a time, the number and distribution of affected joints in patients with chronic neck pain after whiplash. In the most comprehensive of these studies, 31 of 52 patients were diagnosed with cervical facet joint pain, with four patients having two-joint involvement and only one having three-joint involvement. Although elderly patients with advanced osteoarthritis often have multiple levels concomitantly affected, the clinical significance of this in the context of other degenerative changes (e.g. uncovertebral joints, cervical discs) is unclear. Performing medial branch blocks (MBB) at multiple segments may lead to unnecessary treatment of unaffected levels, not only for the initial RFA but for subsequent procedures as well.

- **Case reports**: There are two published case reports of dropped head syndrome after cervical medial branch RFA. In one instance, specific details were reported, illustrating the complexities and potential risks involved in such procedures.

### The cutaneous silent period is preserved in cervical radiculopathy: Significance for the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy [^111B5823]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Electromyographic (EMG) activity from voluntarily contracting hand muscles undergoes transient suppression following nociceptive fingertip stimulation. This suppression is mediated by a spinal inhibitory reflex designated the cutaneous silent period (CSP). The CSP is abolished or altered in a variety of myelopathic conditions. However, before the CSP can gain acceptance as an aid in the diagnosis of myelopathy, the contribution of non-myelopathic conditions that can interrupt the afferent pathways responsible for the CSP needs to be considered. Accordingly, we examined the effect of radiculopathy on the CSP.

Nociceptive stimulation was applied to the thumb (C6 dermatome), middle (C7), and little (C8) fingers of 23 patients with cervical radiculopathy. Four or more CSP responses were recorded in the abductor pollicis brevis muscle following digital stimulation. The patients had C6 (n = 10), C7 (n = 7), or C8 (n = 6) radiculopathy documented by EMG. A complete CSP was elicited in 21 of 23 patients with comparable latencies and durations irrespective of the digit stimulated.

We conclude that the CSP is preserved in radiculopathy, probably because afferent impulses are carried by smaller, slower conducting 'injury-resistant' A-delta fibers. These results provide important missing evidence that ensures the specificity of CSP alterations in the diagnosis of cervical myelopathy. The finding that the CSP is spared in radiculopathy should open the door for investigators and clinicians to adopt this simple spinal inhibitory reflex as a physiologic aid in the diagnosis of spinal cord dysfunction.

### Diagnosis and nonoperative management of cervical radiculopathy [^111FnPs7]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2000). Low credibility.

Qualitative, comprehensive literature review was conducted to discuss and summarize the peer-reviewed literature related to the management of patients with cervical radiculopathy. Cervical radiculopathy is a lesion of the cervical spinal nerve root, with a reported prevalence of 3.3 cases per 1000 people; peak annual incidence is 2.1 cases per 1000 and occurs in the fourth and fifth decades of life. Nerve root injury has the potential to produce significant functional limitations and disability.

A search of the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases for the periods 1966, 1982, and 1996, respectively, to December 1999 was conducted using selected keywords and MeSH headings. The bibliography of all retrieved articles was searched and pertinent articles were obtained. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was also searched. Literature related to the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cervical radiculopathy was thoroughly reviewed and summarized using a critical appraisal approach.

Although cervical radiculopathy remains largely a clinical diagnosis, the true diagnostic accuracy of the clinical examination for cervical radiculopathy is unknown. Imaging and electrophysiologic tests are capable of detecting clinically significant problems in many patients, and each modality has inherent strengths and weaknesses. Technical as well as practical factors affect the choice of procedure. The natural course of cervical radiculopathy appears to be generally favorable, but no prognostic or risk factors have been clearly identified.

### Degenerative cervical myelopathy [^115ieCpK]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Ask patients to report any worsening or new symptoms or signs, as untreated levels of the cervical spine might further degenerate and cause spinal cord compression.

- **Education into practice**: What features would prompt you to suspect DCM in a patient? How would you explain a diagnosis of DCM to your patient? Are you aware of the appropriate local pathways for arranging an urgent MRI scan for patients with suspected DCM? After reading this article, are there any aspects of imaging or referral that you would approach differently?

- **How patients were involved in the creation of this article**: This article was reviewed and endorsed by individuals experiencing DCM who were part of a committee at Myelopathy.org. The committee was keen to emphasize the possible prevalence of DCM and its long-term effects, even after surgery. More specifically, it was involved in shaping the paragraph "What is DCM?"

Myelopathy.org is the first organization dedicated to raising awareness, providing information, and supporting research for DCM. It provides a forum for individuals to communicate their experiences of DCM and offers peer-to-peer support to patients. Reports of delayed and/or misdiagnosis are common, resulting from a lack of awareness among frontline medical specialties, particularly primary care. The committee proposed an educational initiative, which included this article.

### Ambulatory care vs overnight hospitalization after anterior surgery for cervical radiculopathy: The FACADE randomized clinical trial [^112t3MYU]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

The study FACADE, published by Kimmo Lönnrot and colleagues in 2024 in the journal JAMA Network Open, focuses on neck pain. The trial's question was whether ambulatory care is noninferior to overnight hospital surveillance in patients after anterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical radiculopathy. The study design was a multi-center, open-label, randomized clinical trial (RCT). The study population consisted of 105 patients (54 female, 51 male) aged 18–62 years who underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical radiculopathy.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Adult patients aged 18–62 years who underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical radiculopathy.
- **Key exclusion criteria**: Cervical myelopathy, unemployment, comorbidities necessitating extended sick leave or previous cervical operation, active malignancy, pregnancy, and use of alcohol, drugs, or narcotics.

- **Interventions**:
	- Ambulatory care group (n = 52): Care with discharge 6–8 hours after anterior cervical decompression and fusion for cervical radiculopathy.
	- Overnight hospital surveillance group (n = 53): Surveillance for ≥ 24 hours after the procedure.

- **Primary outcome**: The difference did not exceed the non-inferiority margin in the Neck Disability Index at 6 months (13.3% vs. 12.2%; MD 1.1, 95% CI -4.6 to 6.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- No significant difference in arm pain at 6 months (1.7% vs. 1.6%; MD 0.1, 95% CI -0.8 to 1).
	- No significant difference in neck pain at 6 months (2.1% vs. 1.8%; MD 0.3, 95% CI -0.7 to 1).

### Cervical radiculopathy: Is a prosthesis preferred over fusion surgery? A systematic review [^113BNdEk]. European Spine Journal (2020). Low credibility.

Meta-analyses on the comparison between fusion and prosthesis in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy mainly analyze studies including mixed patient populations: patients with radiculopathy with and without myelopathy. The outcome for patients with myelopathy is different compared to those without. Furthermore, apart from decompression of the spinal cord, restriction of motion is one of the cornerstones of the surgical treatment of spondylotic myelopathy. From this point of view, the results for arthroplasty might be suboptimal for this category of patients. Comparing clinical outcomes in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy is therefore a more valid method to compare the true clinical effect of the prosthesis to that of fusion surgery.

- **Aim**: The objective of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of cervical arthroplasty (ACDA) to the clinical outcomes of fusion (ACDF) after anterior cervical discectomy in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy, and to evaluate differences with mixed patient populations.

- **Methods**: A literature search was completed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, COCHRANE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL using a sensitive search strategy. Studies were selected by predefined selection criteria (including patients exclusively suffering from cervical radiculopathy), and risk of bias was assessed using a validated Cochrane Checklist adjusted for this purpose. An additional overview of results was added from articles considering a mix of patients suffering from myelopathy with or without radiculopathy.

- **Results**: Eight studies were included in the analysis.

### Qalsody [^117Ripob]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Serious events of myelitis, radiculitis, papilledema, and elevated intracranial pressure have been reported. It is essential to monitor patients for symptoms and initiate diagnostic workup and treatment according to the standard of care. This includes:

	- **Myelitis and/or radiculitis**: Serious adverse reactions have been noted in patients treated with Qalsody. In clinical studies, six patients experienced myelitis or radiculitis, two of whom discontinued treatment and required symptomatic management, resulting in full resolution of symptoms. For the other four patients, symptoms resolved without discontinuation of Qalsody. If symptoms indicative of myelitis or radiculitis develop, diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated per standard care, which may include the interruption or discontinuation of Qalsody.

	- **Papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure**: Adverse reactions involving papilledema and elevated intracranial pressure have occurred in patients treated with Qalsody. Four patients developed elevated intracranial pressure and/or papilledema.

Close and continuous monitoring, along with appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures, is recommended to manage these potential adverse events effectively.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^112JjCVH]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy (CR) is a widespread diagnosis. Typically, CR is associated with symptoms of neck, shoulder, and upper limb pain, as well as upper limb paraesthesia and weakness, which are attributed to cervical nerve root irritation. The clinical diagnosis of CR relies mainly on the outcome of history taking and a physical examination in which diminished muscle tendon reflexes, sensory disturbances, or motor weakness with dermatomal/myotomal distribution can be found.

Epidemiological data on CR are sparse. A population-based study indicated that CR had an annual incidence rate of 107.3 per 100,000 for men and 63.5 per 100,000 for women, while the age-specific annual incidence rate reached a peak of 202.9 for the age group 50–54 years. Another study reported a prevalence of 3.5 per 1,000 people and a peak annual incidence of 2.1 cases per 1,000 people, which increased to a peak at age 50–59 years.

The aetiology in 70–75% of cases is a foraminal compression of the spinal nerve. This can be due to several factors, including reduction in disc height and anterior and posterior degenerative changes of the uncovertebral and zygapophyseal joints. The most common level of nerve root compression is C7, followed by C6; compression of roots C5 and C8 are less frequent. A herniated disc in the cervical spine accounts for only 20–25% of the cases of CR. CR as a direct result of cervical trauma or metastases is infrequent. Although CR is a common diagnosis, there is still no consensus on the definition. The differential diagnosis of CR can be extensive and includes

### Occupation-related cervical spine disease in orthopaedic surgeons [^1142f5q7]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal injury can substantially affect orthopaedic surgeons and their productivity. The objective of this study was to assess occupation-related neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy among orthopaedic surgeons and to identify potential risk factors for injury.

- **Methods**: An online survey was sent to orthopaedic surgeons via their state orthopaedic society. The survey consisted of items related to orthopaedic practices, such as the number of arthroscopic procedures performed and the use of microscopes or loupes. The prevalence, potential causes, and reporting practices of neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy among orthopaedic surgeons were also assessed.

- **Results**: There were 685 responses from surgeons representing 27 states. A total of 59.3% of respondents reported neck pain, and 22.8% reported cervical radiculopathy. After adjusting for age and sex, surgeons performing arthroscopy had an odds ratio of 3.3 (95% confidence interval: 1.4 to 8.3, P = 0.007) for neck pain. Only five of the surgeons with neck pain and one of the surgeons with cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy had ergonomic evaluations.

- **Conclusion**: Neck pain and cervical radiculopathy/myelopathy are common among orthopaedic surgeons. Associated factors included older age, higher stress levels, and performing arthroscopy. Cervical injuries are rarely reported, and ergonomic workplace evaluations are infrequent.

### Neck pain with radiculopathy [^1127g5xx]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Non-specific neck pain has a postural or mechanical basis and affects about two-thirds of people at some stage, especially in middle age. Acute neck pain resolves within days or weeks but may become chronic in about 10% of people. Whiplash injuries occur due to sudden acceleration-deceleration of the neck, such as in road traffic or sporting accidents. Up to 40% of people continue to report symptoms 15 years after the accident, although this varies between countries.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? What are the effects of injection treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? What are the effects of drug treatments for neck pain with radiculopathy? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

- **Results**: At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 368 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 226 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 142 studies and the further review of 41 full publications. Of the 41 full articles evaluated, four systematic reviews and one RCT were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy.

### Cervical sagittal alignment and related factor analysis and prediction model in patients undergoing revision surgery after anterior cervical fusion [^1176UW6J]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2024). High credibility.

Patients with myelopathy or radiculopathy commonly undergo anterior cervical fusion surgery (ACFS), which occasionally has a notable failure rate. The goal of this study was to compare revision and non-revision surgery patients in cervical sagittal alignment (CSA) subsequent to ACFS. Additionally, it aimed to identify the best CSA parameters for predicting clinical outcomes after ACFS and to create an equation model to assist surgeons in making decisions for patients undergoing ACFS.

- **Methods**: The data of 99 patients with symptomatic cervical myelopathy/radiculopathy who underwent ACFS were analyzed. Patients were divided into group A (underwent revision surgery after the first surgery failed) and group B (underwent only the first surgery). Both preoperative and postoperative CSA parameters were measured and analyzed, including C2 slope, T1 slope, cervical lordosis C2-C7 (CL), C2-C7 sagittal vertical axis (C2C7 SVA), occiput-C2 lordosis angle (C0-C2), and chin brow vertical angle. We further computed the correlation between the CSA parameters and created a prediction model.

- **Results**: The (T1S-CL)-C2S mismatch differed significantly between groups A and B [9.95 ± 9.95, 3.79 ± 6.58, P < 0.05, respectively]. A significant correlation was observed between C2 slope and T1CL in group B relative to group A postoperatively (R² = 0.42 versus R² = 0.09, respectively). Compared with group B, patients in group A had significantly higher C2C7SVA values, more levels of fusion, and more smokers.

### Neck pain: Revision 2017 [^115P5mao]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neck pain, specifically with respect to initial assessment, the APTA 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining assessments of impairments of body function when evaluating a patient with neck pain over an episode of care. This is to establish baselines, monitor changes over time, and assist in clinical decision-making to rule in or rule out the following conditions:

- **Neck pain with mobility deficits**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, cervical and thoracic segmental mobility tests.

- **Neck pain with headache**: Cervical active ROM, cervical flexion-rotation test, upper cervical segmental mobility testing.

- **Neck pain with radiating pain**: Neurodynamic testing, Spurling's test, distraction test, Valsalva test.

- **Neck pain with movement coordination impairments**: Cranial cervical flexion and neck flexor muscle endurance tests.

### Functional outcomes assessment for cervical degenerative disease [^116qbmCY]. Journal of neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to identify valid, reliable, and responsive measures of functional outcome after treatment for cervical degenerative disease.

- **Methods**: The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to functional outcomes. Abstracts were reviewed, after which studies meeting inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations with degrees of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

- **Results**: The Myelopathy Disability Index, Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, and gait analysis were found to be valid and reliable measures (Class II) for assessing cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale, the North American Spine Society scale, and the Neck Disability Index were reliable, valid, and responsive (Class II) for assessing radiculopathy for nonoperative therapy. The Cervical Spine Outcomes Questionnaire was a reliable and valid method (Class II) to assess operative therapy for cervical radiculopathy.

Several functional outcome measures are available.
