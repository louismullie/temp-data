management of covid-19

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of COVID-19. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify disease severity and risk of progression. Then, I should verify outpatient management and antiviral choices, including timing and dosing. Next, I will review inpatient supportive care, steroids, and escalation with immunomodulators. After that, I need to check special populations and what to avoid. Finally, I will consider pre-exposure prophylaxis, long COVID, and how to keep recommendations current with living guidelines and variant susceptibility data.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework because treatment hinges on it. Non-severe is typically SpO2 greater than 94% on room air without supplemental oxygen, severe is SpO2 94% or less on room air or requiring supplemental oxygen, and critical is mechanical ventilation or ECMO or with end-organ dysfunction such as ARDS. I should double-check that these thresholds align with IDSA and WHO, and yes, they do, which will anchor downstream decisions on steroids and antivirals [^116S3QX5] [^112fNGpQ].

> Next, I should review risk stratification for progression, since outpatient antivirals are targeted to those at highest risk. Age over 65, immunocompromise, chronic lung, cardiovascular, renal, liver disease, diabetes, obesity, and pregnancy are key risks; I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from adult data to pediatrics, so I will flag that pediatric risk factors are less well defined and decisions should be individualized, with pediatric-specific guidance informing care in children and adolescents [^117VYvEK].

> For non-severe outpatient disease, I should confirm first-line antivirals and timing. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir within 5 days of symptom onset is preferred when drug–drug interactions can be managed. If not feasible, a 3-day remdesivir course started within 7 days is reasonable, and molnupiravir is an alternative when preferred agents are unavailable or contraindicated. I initially thought remdesivir was only for hospitalized patients, but wait, let me verify — IDSA and ACP support outpatient remdesivir for high-risk patients, so I should correct that assumption and include it as an option in ambulatory care [^1156wpva] [^112NWuFf] [^117U1YnP].

> I need to check dosing details to avoid errors. Remdesivir outpatient dosing is 200 mg IV on day 1, then 100 mg IV on days 2 and 3. Pediatric dosing is 5 mg/kg on day 1, then 2.5 mg/kg on days 2 and 3. I should confirm that this pediatric regimen matches IDSA, and yes, it does, which supports safe extrapolation in children meeting criteria [^1174AFSe] [^1156wpva].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of convalescent plasma in ambulatory patients with limited options. IDSA suggests FDA-qualified high-titer convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset for high-risk outpatients who have no other treatment options, but I must emphasize that the EUA in the U.S. restricts use largely to immunocompromised patients, so shared decision-making is essential given uncertain benefit and potential risks [^113dkRuU] [^113Qe3sD].

> Let me consider what to avoid in non-severe disease. I should confirm that inhaled corticosteroids are not recommended for routine ambulatory treatment; IDSA advises against ICS in mild-to-moderate COVID-19, so I need to ensure I don't inadvertently suggest it outside of a trial or exceptional circumstance [^115PFVAP].

> For severe but non-critical inpatients, I should confirm the foundation: supportive care and oxygen, and dexamethasone 6 mg daily IV or PO for up to 10 days or until discharge. I need to ensure I'm not overextending steroids to those without hypoxemia, and IDSA explicitly recommends against steroids in non-severe disease, which reinforces appropriate targeting here [^116TGNbX] [^1149pHED].

> Next, I should review antivirals in severe disease. Remdesivir is suggested for hospitalized severe COVID-19, with a 5-day course preferred over 10 days when not on mechanical ventilation or ECMO. I should double-check the mortality signal, and the Cochrane review indicates little to no mortality benefit but probable improvements in clinical recovery and reduced progression, which supports a conditional recommendation rather than a strong one [^112EK1LW] [^111LdhpF] [^115W1TR5].

> For escalation in progressive severe or critical illness with systemic inflammation, I need to check immunomodulator choices. Tocilizumab added to steroids is suggested when CRP is at least 75 mg/L or there are other signs of hyperinflammation. Baricitinib 4 mg daily up to 14 days with corticosteroids is also suggested for severe disease. If both are unavailable or contraindicated, abatacept or infliximab can be considered as alternatives, recognizing lower certainty and the need to avoid stacking multiple immunomodulators without evidence [^1138MxEE] [^112xrjbr] [^114cnNpM] [^112eK2Aw].

> But wait, what about tofacitinib. I initially thought to include it broadly, but I should verify the nuance: IDSA suggests tofacitinib in hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 who are not on non-invasive or invasive ventilation, with anticoagulation and avoidance of concurrent IL-6 blockade; given boxed warnings and limited COVID-19 data, it is a conditional option after considering risks and contraindications [^112Y4aVT].

> For critical illness, I need to ensure supportive care aligns with ICU best practices. Lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning for moderate to severe ARDS, cautious fluids, and thromboprophylaxis are core; vilobelimab has a new conditional recommendation in critical COVID-19 as an adjunct when available, though I should emphasize shared decision-making given limited certainty and evolving evidence [^113SNDxk] [^1116qy1v] [^117Qdj46].

> I should confirm what to avoid across settings. Strong recommendations exist against hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and routine use of colchicine; ivermectin is recommended against in ambulatory patients and only suggested against in hospitalized patients due to very low certainty; these should not be prescribed for COVID-19 outside trials [^111hJz8y] [^112EzLDp] [^1116bpoF] [^111qfeAE].

> For pediatrics, let me reconsider key differences. Most children have mild disease managed supportively; risk factors for severe disease are less well defined, and neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are generally unavailable in the U.S. due to variant resistance; remdesivir can be considered in hospitalized children with severe disease, and pediatric-specific critical care guidance should be followed when ICU care is needed [^117VYvEK] [^1147feYc] [^115Tku1E].

> For pregnancy, I should double-check that the same severity-based approach applies, with antivirals such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir considered when benefits outweigh risks, and steroids used for severe or critical illness. Given physiologic changes and teratogenicity concerns, shared decision-making and maternal–fetal consultation are essential [^notfound].

> For immunocompromised patients, I need to ensure I cover prophylaxis and early treatment. Pemivibart is authorized for pre-exposure prophylaxis in those unlikely to mount an adequate vaccine response, with dosing every 3 months and administration at least 2 weeks after vaccination; for breakthrough infection, early antivirals remain critical, and convalescent plasma may be considered when other options are unavailable, acknowledging evolving variant susceptibility [^116j79oW] [^116ccnii] [^116RYWmB].

> Next, I should review long COVID management. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach targeting cardiopulmonary, neurologic, and psychiatric sequelae is recommended, with attention to rehabilitation, symptom control, and mental health. I need to ensure I emphasize that evidence is still evolving and care should be individualized and guideline-concordant as recommendations mature [^114DpucZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan stays current. COVID-19 guidance is living, with IDSA, WHO, and ACP updating as new evidence and variants emerge. Clinicians should check for updates regularly, monitor variant susceptibility to monoclonal antibodies, and adapt institutional protocols accordingly to avoid outdated practices that persist from early pandemic eras [^113P1VF3] [^116wqQBJ] [^113gY6cf].

COVID-19 management is **severity-based** and guided by living guidelines from IDSA, NIH, and WHO [^113P1VF3] [^112YJtzt] [^116wqQBJ]. For **mild-to-moderate disease**, use nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir in high-risk patients within 5–7 days of symptom onset; consider molnupiravir if options are limited [^111m9dL5] [^1135DQTh] [^1156wpva]. For **severe/critical illness**, give dexamethasone plus remdesivir; add tocilizumab or baricitinib if inflammation is high or progression occurs [^1149pHED] [^112EK1LW] [^1138MxEE] [^112xrjbr]. Supportive care includes oxygen, prone positioning, and thromboprophylaxis; avoid ineffective therapies such as hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, and lopinavir/ritonavir [^111hJz8y] [^111qfeAE] [^112EzLDp]. Monitor for complications, including thrombosis, secondary infections, and long COVID, and adjust care to patient-specific factors and evolving evidence [^111m9dL5] [^114DpucZ].

## Clinical classification of disease severity

Accurate classification guides therapy; the **IDSA and WHO** define severity as follows:

| **Severity level** | **Clinical criteria** |
|-|-|
| Mild | - No pneumonia or hypoxia <br/> - SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air |
| Moderate | - Pneumonia <br/> - SpO2 ≥ 94% on room air |
| Severe | - SpO2 < 94% on room air <br/> - Respiratory rate ≥ 30/min <br/> - PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg |
| Critical | - Respiratory failure <br/> - Septic shock <br/> - Multi-organ dysfunction |

## Management of mild-to-moderate COVID-19

### Outpatient management

- **Supportive care**: Antipyretics, analgesics, hydration, and isolation [^111m9dL5].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) within 5 days of symptom onset for high-risk patients; remdesivir 3-day outpatient course if started within 7 days [^1135DQTh] [^1156wpva].
- **Alternative therapy**: Molnupiravir if first-line agents are unavailable or contraindicated [^113V38ve].
- **Monitoring**: Track symptoms, oxygen saturation, and warning signs for deterioration [^111m9dL5].

---

## Management of severe and critical COVID-19

### Hospitalized patients

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, prone positioning, and thromboprophylaxis [^notfound].
- **Corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days or until discharge [^112fNGpQ].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Remdesivir for severe cases, especially early in the disease course [^112EK1LW].
- **Immunomodulators**: Tocilizumab or baricitinib for rapid progression or high inflammatory markers [^1138MxEE] [^112xrjbr].
- **Critical care**: Mechanical ventilation, ECMO, and hemodynamic support as indicated [^117G2Rra].

---

## Management of special populations

### Pediatric patients

In pediatric patients, **supportive care** is the mainstay, as most cases are mild [^117VYvEK]. Antivirals such as remdesivir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be considered in severe cases or in children at high risk [^1174AFSe]. Immunomodulators are generally not recommended due to limited pediatric data [^1119g1eT].

---

### Pregnant patients

In pregnancy, **supportive care** remains standard, with oxygen and supportive measures prioritized [^notfound]. Antivirals such as remdesivir or nirmatrelvir/ritonavir may be considered when benefits outweigh risks. Immunomodulators are generally avoided unless clearly indicated.

---

### Immunocompromised patients

In immunocompromised patients, **antivirals** should be initiated early, with close monitoring for progression [^111hSd3q]. Immunomodulators may be considered in severe cases, balancing infection risk. Prophylaxis with monoclonal antibodies may be considered when available and active against circulating variants [^116j79oW].

---

## Management of complications

### Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

For ARDS, **supportive care** includes lung-protective ventilation, prone positioning, and ECMO when indicated [^notfound]. Corticosteroids remain a standard component of care [^1149pHED].

---

### Thrombotic complications

For thrombotic complications, **thromboprophylaxis** with low-dose anticoagulation is recommended for hospitalized patients, with therapeutic anticoagulation reserved for confirmed thrombosis [^notfound].

---

### Secondary infections

For secondary infections, **antibiotics** should be used only when bacterial or fungal co-infection is suspected or confirmed [^112Atids].

---

## Long COVID management

For long COVID, **multidisciplinary care** addresses persistent symptoms with rehabilitation, mental health support, and symptom-specific therapies [^notfound]. Ongoing research continues to define optimal management strategies [^notfound].

---

## Preventive measures

- **Vaccination**: Primary strategy to prevent severe disease and hospitalization [^notfound].
- **Public health measures**: Masking, social distancing, and hand hygiene [^notfound].
- **Prophylaxis**: Monoclonal antibodies for high-risk individuals when available and effective against circulating variants [^111tQ3mc].

---

## Therapies not recommended

Avoid **hydroxychloroquine**, **ivermectin**, **lopinavir/ritonavir**, and **colchicine** due to lack of benefit or potential harm [^111hJz8y] [^111qfeAE] [^112EzLDp] [^1116bpoF].

---

## Emerging therapies and ongoing research

Ongoing research evaluates **novel antivirals**, immunomodulators, and combination therapies [^1136hMkc]. Living guidelines are updated regularly as new evidence emerges [^114n6nW1].

---

COVID-19 management is **severity-based**, with supportive care, antivirals, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators as indicated. Care should be individualized, with attention to special populations and evolving evidence [^113P1VF3].

INTRODUCTION

In December 2019, several Health Centers in Wuhan, in the Hubei Province of China, reported a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology. Their clinical presentations were similar to those of SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003. – COVID-19 is the third coronavirus disease to cause public health outbreaks and has spread more rapidly and widely than SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). COVID-19 is now pandemic, with millions of confirmed cases and several thousands of deaths associated with the disease in 210 countries and territories. This review provides a discussion of the disease transmission, clinical presentations, variability of case definitions, and review of the clinical management.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — methods and scope for ICU coronavirus disease 2019 guidance state that the panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU and used the World Health Organization's definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials, and when appropriate performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. The panel assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.

FDA EUA criteria for the use of molnupiravir — use restrictions and conditional panel judgment are as follows: "Molnupiravir may only be used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults who are at high-risk for progression to severe COVID, including hospitalization or death, and for whom alternative COVID-19 treatment options authorized by FDA are not accessible or clinically appropriate". It is "not authorized under the FDA EUA for use in patients < 18 years because it may affect bone and cartilage growth", is "not recommended under the FDA EUA for use during pregnancy", and is "not authorized under the FDA EUA for pre-exposure or post-exposure prevention of COVID-19 or for initiation of treatment in patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 because benefit of treatment has not been observed in individuals when treatment is started after hospitalization due to COVID-19". The guideline panel concluded that "the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not".

Pemivibart — dosing, timing after vaccination, and harm–benefit considerations are specified as follows: Per the FDA EUA, pemivibart is authorized to be given at 4,500 mg IV every 3 months, and per the FDA EUA, in individuals who have recently received a COVID-19 vaccine, pemivibart should be administered at least 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients who place a higher value on potential harms, specifically, the observed 0.6% risk of anaphylaxis, and a lower value on the uncertain benefits of prevention of severe COVID-19 would reasonably decline pemivibart. Because susceptibility is evolving, additional clinical and laboratory data may impact this recommendation. Conditional recommendations are made when the suggested course of action would apply to the majority of people with many exceptions, and shared decision-making is important.

### Update in COVID-19 2020 [^113htLP8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

As 2020 evolved, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presented the greatest global health crisis in a century, affecting medical, social, and economic systems (Figure 1). Despite challenging society with new ways of living, working, and communicating, its significant clinical, research, and public health impact was admirably managed by clinicians and scientists worldwide against a backdrop of continually evolving evidence. In this update, we review important publications from the American Thoracic Society journals and others that provide insight into pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment advances of COVID-19 disease while also considering broader societal effects. Throughout the update, we use "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)" when referencing the virus and use "COVID-19" in relation to the associated illness.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — convalescent plasma: Section last reviewed and updated on 2/22/2023. Last literature search conducted 1/31/2023. Recommendation 13 (UPDATED 2/22/2023): Among immunocompetent patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel recommends against COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty of evidence). Recommendation 14 (NEW 2/22/2023): Among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the IDSA guideline panel suggests against the routine use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who do not qualify for other treatments, who place a higher value on the uncertain mortality reduction and a lower value on the potential adverse effects of convalescent plasma would reasonably select convalescent plasma.

### The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^111gNGJR]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Medium credibility.

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory disease occurred in Wuhan, China. It is an emerging infectious disease with widespread and rapid infectiousness. The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern on 31 January 2020. Severe COVID-19 patients should be managed and treated in a critical care unit. Performing a chest X-ray/CT can judge the severity of the disease. The management of COVID-19 patients includes epidemiological risk and patient isolation; treatment entails general supportive care, respiratory support, symptomatic treatment, nutritional support, psychological intervention, etc. The prognosis of the patients depends upon the severity of the disease, the patient's age, the underlying diseases of the patients, and the patient's overall medical condition. The management of COVID-19 should focus on early diagnosis, immediate isolation, general and optimized supportive care, and infection prevention and control.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — Tofacitinib in hospitalized adults with severe illness: Recommendation 23 states the IDSA panel suggests tofacitinib rather than no tofacitinib for hospitalized adults with severe COVID-19 who are not on non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Severe illness is defined as patients with SpO2 ≤ 94% on room air, including those on supplemental oxygen or oxygen through a high-flow device. Remarks note that tofacitinib appears to demonstrate the most benefit in those with severe COVID-19 on supplemental or high-flow oxygen, that patients treated with tofacitinib should be on at least prophylactic dose anticoagulant, that patients who receive tofacitinib should not receive tocilizumab or other IL-6 inhibitor for treatment of COVID-19, and that the STOP-COVID Trial did not include immunocompromised patients. The guideline panel concluded that the desirable effects outweigh the undesirable effects, though uncertainty still exists, and most informed people would choose the suggested course of action, while a substantial number would not.

### Clinical course: progression, management, and treatment… [^111m9dL5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

What to know
- COVID-19 can vary from asymptomatic infection to critical illness. Symptoms and severity can change during illness.
- Information about clinical management and treatment of COVID-19 is categorized by severity of illness.
- Most patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 can be managed in an outpatient setting with authorized treatment for those at risk of severe illness.
- Most patients with severe or critical COVID-19 require hospitalization. Management Patients with no risk factors for severe COVID-19 may benefit from supportive care and symptomatic treatment including antipyretics, analgesics, and antitussives. Clinicians can also instruct patients on preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 symptoms that indicate additional medical attention. For patients at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19, clinicians should offer antivirals to significantly decrease the risk of hospitalization and death.

Antivirals should be started within the first 5–7 days of symptom onset. If declined, patients should be closely monitored. Treatment The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends Nirmatrelvir with ritonavir and Remdesivir for treatment of mild or moderate COVID-19 in people at risk for severe illness. Management Clinical treatment recommendations for people with severe to critical COVID-19 are based on the severity of illness. Management often includes care of complications, including:

- Hypoxemic respiratory failure/ARDS
- Sepsis and septic shock
- Elevation in inflammatory cytokines
- **Complications from prolonged hospitalization, including**:

- Thromboembolism
- Hospital-acquired pneumonia
- Hospital-acquired bacterial and fungal infections
- Thromboembolism.

Additionally, patients with COVID-19 may experience an exacerbation of underlying comorbidities or onset of cardiac, vascular, endocrine, hepatic, renal, gastrointestinal, or central nervous system illness. Treatment FDA has authorized or approved the use of several medications for patients with severe or critical illness due to COVID-19. Clinicians can find general considerations and recommendations for their care along with the rationale for the recommendations in the IDSA Guidelines on the Treatment and Management of Patients with COVID-19 and the ACP Clinical Guidelines and Recommendations on COVID-19.

IDSA COVID-19 guidelines — ambulatory patients and neutralizing antibody–containing products — note that the product used contains high titers of neutralizing antibodies and is used early in clinical presentation or in subpopulations of patients who do not have an adequate humoral immune response even at later stages of disease. The existing evidence in this specific population of patients remains sparse, and future studies in ambulatory patients should continue to target these populations.

COVID-19 convalescent plasma — evidence from expanded access program (EAP) analyses, randomized trial subgroups, and FDA actions is as follows: In the EAP, higher levels of antibodies were associated with significant improvements in mortality compared to receipt of convalescent plasma with lower concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, but there was no placebo group, and the intervention has been used in over 100,000 patients. In one open-label randomized controlled trial subgroup using a high antibody titer cutoff, mortality showed a non-significant relative risk reduction of 5% (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.73, 1.25), whereas another subgroup analysis suggested unselected convalescent plasma may increase the relative risk for mortality by 49% (RR: 1.42; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.69). Timing may be important, as the EAP suggested greatest benefit when given within three days from diagnosis. The FDA issued an EUA for investigational convalescent plasma in August 2020 and revised it in early February 2021 to limit authorization to high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma for treatment of hospitalized patients early in the disease course. The evidence base referenced includes 23 RCTs and a large single-arm registry study (n = 20,000).

Infectious Diseases Society of America COVID-19 guidelines — conclusions and research needs indicate that head-to-head comparisons of baricitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept, and infliximab in patients with severe, rapidly progressing COVID-19 and critical COVID-19 would be informative. It is also uncertain whether a combination of two or more immunomodulatory agents (i.e., baricitinib, tocilizumab, abatacept, infliximab) offers additional mortality or recovery benefits. In theory, infliximab (a TNF-α inhibitor) targets a different inflammatory pathway than tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor blocker) or baricitinib (a JAK-STAT pathway inhibitor) and hence, may have a complementary benefit. Additionally, the efficacy of infliximab has not been evaluated in children or adolescents with severe or critical COVID-19. Future studies evaluating infliximab for COVID-19 should consider enrolling children and adolescents, particularly given the extensive pediatric experience with infliximab and available pediatric dosing recommendations for non-COVID-19 indications. The guideline panel suggests infliximab in hospitalized adults receiving systemic glucocorticoids who are experiencing severe, rapidly progressing COVID-19 or critical COVID-19, when baricitinib and tocilizumab are not available.

### Public health benefits of applying evidence-based best practices in managing patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^116zuh6H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has shifted from pandemic to endemic status and there is generally reduced interest regarding COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-related mortality among vulnerable populations remains a concern. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that there were ∼75 000 COVID-19–related deaths in the United States in 2023 and one of the top 10 causes of mortality in the United States. The recent rise in number of SARS-CoV-2 infections driven by KP.2, KP.2.3, KP.3, LB.1, and KP.3.1.1 variants in the United States and BA.2.86 and JN.1 globally highlights the need for continued management of patients with COVID-19 in a manner consistent with the latest treatment guidelines, especially in the most vulnerable hospitalized patients, as well as an opportunity to continue improving institutional treatment protocols to reflect the latest evidence.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^112YJtzt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### Guidance for prevention and management of COVID-19 in children and adolescents: a consensus statement from the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society pediatric COVID-19 therapies taskforce [^117VYvEK]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Since November 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has created challenges for preventing and managing COVID-19 in children and adolescents. Most research to develop new therapeutic interventions or to repurpose existing ones has been undertaken in adults, and although most cases of infection in pediatric populations are mild, there have been many cases of critical and fatal infection. Understanding the risk factors for severe illness and the evidence for safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of therapies for COVID-19 in children is necessary to optimize therapy.

Methods

A panel of experts in pediatric infectious diseases, pediatric infectious diseases pharmacology, and pediatric intensive care medicine from 21 geographically diverse North American institutions was re-convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys and a systematic review with meta-analysis of data for risk factors, a guidance statement comprising a series of recommendations for risk stratification, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19 was developed and refined based on expert consensus.

Results

There are identifiable clinical characteristics that enable risk stratification for patients at risk for severe COVID-19. These risk factors can be used to guide the treatment of hospitalized and non-hospitalized children and adolescents with COVID-19 and to guide preventative therapy where options remain available.

### Remdesivir for severe COVID-19: a clinical practice guideline [^112bZhmP]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What is the role of remdesivir in the treatment of severe covid-19? This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020.

Current Practice

Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice.

Recommendations

The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems.

The Evidence

The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay.

Understanding The Recommendation

Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: guidelines on the management of critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [^113SNDxk]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of a rapidly spreading illness, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), affecting thousands of people around the world. Urgent guidance for clinicians caring for the sickest of these patients is needed.

Methods

We formed a panel of 36 experts from 12 countries. All panel members completed the World Health Organization conflict of interest disclosure form. The panel proposed 53 questions that are relevant to the management of COVID-19 in the ICU. We searched the literature for direct and indirect evidence on the management of COVID-19 in critically ill patients in the ICU. We identified relevant and recent systematic reviews on most questions relating to supportive care. We assessed the certainty in the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, then generated recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of best practice recommendations.

Results

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued 54 statements, of which 4 are best practice statements, 9 are strong recommendations, and 35 are weak recommendations. No recommendation was provided for 6 questions. The topics were: (1) infection control, (2) laboratory diagnosis and specimens, (3) hemodynamic support, (4) ventilatory support, and (5) COVID-19 therapy.

Conclusion

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign COVID-19 panel issued several recommendations to help support healthcare workers caring for critically ill ICU patients with COVID-19. When available, we will provide new recommendations in further releases of these guidelines.

The panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with severe COVID-19 as moderate due to concerns with indirectness since the evidence was from dexamethasone, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence for patients without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen as low due to concerns with risk of bias (post hoc analysis) and imprecision. Additional research is needed to inform the generalizability of treatment with different glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic. Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — outcomes and adverse event definitions prioritize patient-important outcomes including mortality, hospitalization, development of severe disease (e.g., need for non-invasive or invasive ventilation), clinical improvement (disease-oriented outcomes inferred by radiological findings or virologic cure), and severe adverse events leading to discontinuation; serious adverse events are death, life threatening reactions, those that require hospitalization, result in disability or permanent damage or require an intervention to prevent permanent impairment. Critical outcomes varied by population: among hospitalized patients (at any disease severity), critical outcomes included mortality, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, failure of clinical improvement, adverse events, and serious adverse events; among ambulatory populations with COVID-19 infection, hospitalization replaced duration of hospitalization; among persons receiving pre- or post-exposure prophylaxis, outcomes included measures of symptomatic COVID-19 infection.

### Comparison of WHO versus national COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines across the world: not exactly a perfect match [^111eHqYb]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

As a consequence, there has been substantial variation between countries in their COVID-19 treatment recommendations. Different conclusions derived from the same evidence, different timing of treatment guideline development, lack of evidence in early infections, lack of pharmacometric evaluation, lack of comparative information, the high cost of new therapeutics and political pressures have all contributed to the heterogeneity in guidance observed between countries.

WHO has regularly updated its 'living' COVID-19 therapeutic guidelines, making this recommendation on the basis of a standardised review of the latest evidence. With some exceptions, its recommendations have been delineated by disease severity.

Many countries, particularly in low-resource settings, rely on guidance from WHO to develop and update their infectious diseases national treatment guidelines. We reviewed WHO member state national guidelines (NGs) for COVID-19 treatment and compared them to the WHO therapeutic guidelines.

### Epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and management of long COVID: an update [^114DpucZ]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The increasing number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections have highlighted the long-term consequences of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection called long COVID. Although the concept and definition of long COVID are described differently across countries and institutions, there is general agreement that it affects multiple systems, including the immune, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neuropsychological, musculoskeletal, and other systems. This review aims to provide a synthesis of published epidemiology, symptoms, and risk factors of long COVID. We also summarize potential pathophysiological mechanisms and biomarkers for precise prevention, early diagnosis, and accurate treatment of long COVID. Furthermore, we suggest evidence-based guidelines for the comprehensive evaluation and management of long COVID, involving treatment, health systems, health finance, public attitudes, and international cooperation, which is proposed to improve the treatment strategies, preventive measures, and public health policy making of long COVID.

Convalescent plasma — ambulatory mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk with no other options: Among ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at high risk for progression to severe disease who have no other treatment options, the IDSA guideline panel suggests FDA-qualified high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma within 8 days of symptom onset rather than no high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Remarks include that in the United States, FDA emergency use authorization (EUA) only authorizes use in patients with immunosuppressive disease or receiving immunosuppressive treatment; that patients who are not immunocompromised and who place a low value on the uncertain benefits and a high value on avoiding possible adverse events would reasonably decline convalescent plasma; and that other options for treatment and management of ambulatory patients include nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and three-day treatment with remdesivir, with patient-specific factors and logistical challenges guiding choice of agent, and that data for combination treatment do not exist in this setting.

### The role of immunomodulatory medications in the treatment of COVID-19 [^117AXWMs]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Given the role of inflammation in severe forms of COVID-19, glucocorticoids and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have been assessed as potential COVID-19 therapies.

Recent Findings

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that glucocorticoids reduce mortality in severe COVID-19. RCTs of DMARDs have shown mixed results varying on intervention and inclusion criteria. DMARDs, including colchicine or biologic agents, may improve COVID-19 outcomes in specific patient populations.

Summary

Glucocorticoids are an effective treatment for the management of severe COVID-19. Further studies are needed to better define the patient populations who could benefit from DMARD use, as well as provide guidance regarding the timing of these interventions.

Conclusion

Publicly available COVID-19 National Guidelines vary substantially in their therapeutic recommendations. Ineffective, unaffordable and unavailable therapies are widely recommended, particularly in low-resource settings. The formalisation of processes in the development of NGs for COVID-19 and other infectious diseases is essential for ensuring that these guidelines are grounded in the best available evidence. A systematic and structured approach would not only enhance the credibility of the guidelines but could also contribute to their effectiveness in guiding public health interventions, especially in a pandemic setting.

### Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 [^115W1TR5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Remdesivir is an antiviral medicine approved for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This led to widespread implementation, although the available evidence remains inconsistent. This update aims to fill current knowledge gaps by identifying, describing, evaluating, and synthesising all evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of remdesivir on clinical outcomes in COVID-19.

Objectives

To assess the effects of remdesivir and standard care compared to standard care plus/minus placebo on clinical outcomes in patients treated for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which comprises the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and medRxiv) as well as Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded and Emerging Sources Citation Index) and WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies, without language restrictions. We conducted the searches on 31 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. We included RCTs evaluating remdesivir and standard care for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to standard care plus/minus placebo irrespective of disease severity, gender, ethnicity, or setting. We excluded studies that evaluated remdesivir for the treatment of other coronavirus diseases.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach for outcomes that were reported according to our prioritised categories: all-cause mortality, in-hospital mortality, clinical improvement (being alive and ready for discharge up to day 28) or worsening (new need for invasive mechanical ventilation or death up to day 28), quality of life, serious adverse events, and adverse events (any grade). We differentiated between non-hospitalised individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or mild COVID-19 and hospitalised individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs with 11,218 participants diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and a mean age of 53.6 years, of whom 5982 participants were randomised to receive remdesivir. Most participants required low-flow oxygen at baseline. Studies were mainly conducted in high- and upper-middle-income countries. We identified two studies that are awaiting classification and five ongoing studies. Effects of remdesivir in hospitalised individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19 With moderate-certainty evidence, remdesivir probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.06; risk difference (RD) 8 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 21 fewer to 6 more; 4 studies, 7142 participants), day 60 (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.05; RD 35 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 73 fewer to 12 more; 1 study, 1281 participants), or in-hospital mortality at up to day 150 (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; RD 11 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 25 fewer to 5 more; 1 study, 8275 participants). Remdesivir probably increases the chance of clinical improvement at up to day 28 slightly (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.17; RD 68 more per 1000, 95% CI 37 more to 105 more; 4 studies, 2514 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). It probably decreases the risk of clinical worsening within 28 days (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.82; RD 135 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 198 fewer to 69 fewer; 2 studies, 1734 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Remdesivir may make little or no difference to the rate of adverse events of any grade (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.18; RD 23 more per 1000, 95% CI 46 fewer to 104 more; 4 studies, 2498 participants; low-certainty evidence), or serious adverse events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.07; RD 44 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 96 fewer to 19 more; 4 studies, 2498 participants; low-certainty evidence). We considered risk of bias to be low, with some concerns for mortality and clinical course. We had some concerns for safety outcomes because participants who had died did not contribute information. Without adjustment, this leads to an uncertain amount of missing values and the potential for bias due to missing data. Effects of remdesivir in non-hospitalised individuals with mild COVID-19 One of the nine RCTs was conducted in the outpatient setting and included symptomatic people with a risk of progression. No deaths occurred within the 28 days observation period. We are uncertain about clinical improvement due to very low-certainty evidence. Remdesivir probably decreases the risk of clinical worsening (hospitalisation) at up to day 28 (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.75; RD 46 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 57 fewer to 16 fewer; 562 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We did not find any data for quality of life. Remdesivir may decrease the rate of serious adverse events at up to 28 days (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.70; RD 49 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 60 fewer to 20 fewer; 562 participants; low-certainty evidence), but it probably makes little or no difference to the risk of adverse events of any grade (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.10; RD 42 fewer per 1000, 95% CI 111 fewer to 46 more; 562 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We considered risk of bias to be low for mortality, clinical improvement, and safety outcomes. We identified a high risk of bias for clinical worsening.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available evidence up to 31 May 2022, remdesivir probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality of individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19. The hospitalisation rate was reduced with remdesivir in one study including participants with mild to moderate COVID-19. It may be beneficial in the clinical course for both hospitalised and non-hospitalised patients, but certainty remains limited. The applicability of the evidence to current practice may be limited by the recruitment of participants from mostly unvaccinated populations exposed to early variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus at the time the studies were undertaken. Future studies should provide additional data on the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for defined core outcomes in COVID-19 research, especially for different population subgroups.

### COVID-19 PICU guidelines: for high-and limited-resource settings [^115Tku1E]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript was developed to provide guidelines for managing COVID-19-infected critically ill pediatric patients in both high- and limited-resource settings. We also discuss the available regional pediatric data, which may be of particular interest given the limited pediatric COVID-19 data at present. SARS-CoV-2 has had a devastating impact on the adult population. Children comprise a small fraction of those impacted by this disease. We propose a set of initial guidelines to manage critically ill pediatric patients with COVID-19. These guidelines were based on the best available evidence, extrapolation of clinical evidence from adults, and the best practices where the evidence is lacking. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, implementing the proposed guidelines will help to reduce morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients. Updating these guidelines will be necessary based on additional data and the new evidence from ongoing clinical trials.

### Consensus for prevention and management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for neurologists [^111CrJnE]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) has become a pandemic disease globally. Although COVID-19 directly invades lungs, it also involves the nervous system. Therefore, patients with nervous system involvement as the presenting symptoms in the early stage of infection may easily be misdiagnosed and their treatment delayed. They become silent contagious sources or 'virus spreaders'. In order to help neurologists to better understand the occurrence, development and prognosis, we have developed this consensus of prevention and management of COVID‐19. It can also assist other healthcare providers to be familiar with and recognise COVID-19 in their evaluation of patients in the clinic and hospital environment.

### Public health benefits of applying evidence-based best practices in managing patients hospitalized for COVID-19 [^116CHTTi]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The optimal management of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 continues to evolve as the virus itself does, requiring ongoing adaptation of clinical practice to reflect the latest evidence-based research. Recent real-world studies on the outcomes of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 have continued to strengthen the evidence on the effectiveness of early remdesivir treatment across a broad spectrum of patients. Although the NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ACTT-1 (Adaptive COVID Treatment Trial) demonstrated the efficacy of remdesivir in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, neither ACTT-1 nor other early-pandemic randomized controlled trials were designed or powered to measure treatment efficacy in all settings and subgroups of interest. The lack of subgroup-specific evidence may have led to clinical underutilization of remdesivir, which persists today in patients who might benefit from treatment with remdesivir.

Our research showed that approximately 49% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in the United States did not receive remdesivir as part of their treatment regimen upon admission in 2023. Furthermore, more than 16% of patients not receiving supplemental oxygen received DEX without concomitant remdesivir use upon admission, against NIH guideline recommendations. This pattern of treatment has persisted despite the wide availability of remdesivir in most hospitals and the recommendation for treatment in COVID-19 guidelines for NSOc, LFO, and HFO/NIV patients. Perhaps this is a reflection of the inherent complexities faced by clinicians in their choice of treatment for individual patients. It is also possible that legacy restrictions on remdesivir use in local institutional protocols or formulary guidelines based on early-pandemic evidence continue to remain in place. Regardless of the underlying reason, our analysis showed that nearly one-third of patients who did not receive remdesivir upon admission were substantially similar in their characteristics and clinical presentation to those who did receive remdesivir. Initiating treatment in this population is estimated to result in 1 life saved for every 58 patients treated overall and for the most vulnerable populations such as elderly and immunocompromised, 1 life could be saved for every 45 and 48 patients, respectively, treated with remdesivir. At the national level, this translates to a conservative estimate of 469 to 1126 lives saved in 2023, but it is possible that more patients would be appropriate for remdesivir treatment leading to a higher potential lives saved beyond our model projections.

COVID-19 — Tofacitinib randomized controlled trial evidence: One RCT compared tofacitinib 10 mg every 12 hours for up to 14 days versus placebo in hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and imaging evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia who were hospitalized for less than 72 hours; patients could not be receiving non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO at baseline, and the primary outcome was a composite of death at day 28 or respiratory failure defined as progression to NIAID ordinal scale 6, 7, or 8. Tofacitinib resulted in a lower risk of the composite outcome compared to no tofacitinib (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.97; low CoE), while results failed to show or to exclude an effect on mortality alone (RR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.63; low CoE) or on progression to mechanical ventilation or ECMO by day 28 (RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.03, 2.20; low CoE). Patients who received tofacitinib experienced more serious adverse events; however, this may not be meaningfully different from placebo (RR: 1.18; 95%CI: 0.64, 2.15; low CoE); use for other indications has shown an increase in thrombotic events prompting a black box warning by the FDA, and patients studied were either on prophylactic or full dose anticoagulation; tofacitinib carries four black boxed warnings for its labeled indications.

IDSA COVID-19 treatment guideline recommendation 22 — among hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who cannot receive a corticosteroid (which is standard of care) because of a contraindication, the guideline panel suggests use of baricitinib with remdesivir rather than remdesivir alone (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). The remark specifies baricitinib 4 mg daily dose for 14 days or until hospital discharge, and notes that the benefits of baricitinib plus remdesivir for persons on mechanical ventilation are uncertain.

Interleukin-6 inhibitors — tocilizumab in hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19: Among hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 who have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests tocilizumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone. (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab. In the largest trial on the treatment of tocilizumab, criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥ 75 mg/L.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline — scope and update process — states that IDSA has recognized the necessity of developing a rapid guideline for the treatment of COVID-19 and that the guideline panel is using a methodologically rigorous process for evaluating the best available evidence and providing treatment recommendations. These guidelines will be frequently updated and accessible online, and ongoing trials evaluating therapeutic agents are monitored; if a preponderance of evidence suggests the use of a therapeutic agent even in the context of clinical trials is no longer warranted it will be removed from future updates, and agents with emerging efficacy or safety evidence will be included in future updates. The recommendations are intended to inform patients, clinicians, and other health professionals by providing the latest available evidence.
