## Question

Treatment for kidney infarct

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment for kidney infarct. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and urgency. Then, I should verify the etiology to guide therapy. Next, I will assess renal function and hemodynamics. After that, I need to decide on conservative versus interventional management, including anticoagulation and thrombolysis. I will then consider supportive care, secondary prevention, and special populations, and finally synthesize a practical algorithm with monitoring and follow-up, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and the urgency, because delays worsen outcomes. Kidney infarction typically presents with sudden flank or abdominal pain, nausea, hematuria, and elevated LDH, and contrast-enhanced CT angiography is the diagnostic gold standard to identify wedge-shaped perfusion defects or arterial occlusion, so I should not rely on ultrasound alone given its poor sensitivity for early infarction [^40fb633b] [^1b832c0d]. Wait, let me verify the time window for salvageable tissue; while classic teaching emphasizes early reperfusion, case reports show meaningful renal recovery even with delayed interventions in selected patients, so I should avoid prematurely closing the door on revascularization if the clinical picture suggests viable parenchyma or collateral flow [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

> Next, I should review etiology to tailor therapy. Cardioembolic sources like atrial fibrillation are the most common, followed by renal artery injury, hypercoagulable states, and idiopathic cases, so I need to check for arrhythmia, valvular disease, and paradoxical embolism when appropriate, and I should remember that COVID-19 has been associated with renal infarction, which may shift anticoagulation decisions in that subgroup [^2bd41d17] [^0ac24874]. Hold on, I should verify that invasive renal arteriography with IVUS can uncover local arterial disease and change secondary prevention; yes, small series suggest IVUS can refine etiology and alter antithrombotic strategy, though this remains hypothesis-generating and should be individualized [^a847ccd4] [^08a29af2].

> I will now examine renal function and hemodynamics, because these drive management. Acute kidney injury occurs in roughly 20% of renal infarctions, and new-onset eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m² is not rare, so I need to check creatinine, electrolytes, and urine output, and I should assess volume status and blood pressure carefully since hypertension from renin-angiotensin activation is common and may be severe or even malignant in some cases [^2bd41d17] [^e323a257]. Let me consider the possibility of cardiorenal syndrome in unstable patients; if there is shock or refractory edema, I should plan for continuous renal replacement therapy rather than intermittent hemodialysis to minimize hemodynamic swings [^a2786cb5].

> Now, I should decide on conservative versus interventional therapy. Most patients are managed conservatively with anticoagulation, but I need to ensure I do not miss a salvageable main renal artery occlusion. Catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy is reasonable for complete occlusions, especially in solitary kidneys or bilateral disease, and even delayed presentations can occasionally benefit if collateral flow preserved viability, so I should involve interventional radiology early for imaging and potential intervention rather than assuming irreversibility [^a8ff1784] [^b6efbb4d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the window was strictly 12–24 hours; let me reconsider — case-based evidence supports attempts beyond 24 hours in selected patients with viable parenchyma, so I should individualize based on perfusion imaging and clinical trajectory rather than a rigid clock [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

> For anticoagulation, I should confirm the regimen and duration. Standard practice is intravenous heparin followed by oral anticoagulation, typically warfarin, for at least 3–6 months if a cardioembolic source is identified, with longer courses for recurrent events or persistent risk factors; direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly used off-label, but I need to check renal dosing and bleeding risk, and I should remember dabigatran is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, so agent selection matters [^2bd41d17] [^e442e743]. Hold on, I should verify that antiplatelet therapy alone is insufficient for embolic renal infarction; yes, antiplatelet therapy is generally reserved for non-embolic mechanisms or as adjuncts, not as a replacement for anticoagulation in embolic disease [^2e5ecd69].

> Supportive care is essential and should not be overlooked. I need to ensure aggressive pain control, strict blood pressure management with ACE inhibitors or ARBs once hemodynamically stable, and careful fluid balance to avoid both hypovolemia and overload; if AKI progresses or complications arise, I should escalate to renal replacement therapy using a continuous modality in unstable patients to preserve perfusion while correcting acid-base and volume derangements [^a2786cb5]. Let me double-check that ACE inhibitors are acceptable after renal infarction; observational data after myocardial infarction show survival benefit across kidney function strata, and while that is indirect, it supports RAAS blockade for cardioprotection and blood pressure control unless contraindicated, with close monitoring of creatinine and potassium after initiation [^87ae0e23].

> Secondary prevention must be comprehensive because mortality after renal infarction is driven by cardiovascular events rather than progression to ESRD. I should confirm that statin therapy is indicated for atherosclerotic disease or high-risk profiles, and I should screen for and treat traditional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking; in patients with CKD, KDIGO recommends statins or statin/ezetimibe for adults 50 years or older with eGFR less than 60, and for younger adults with diabetes, known coronary disease, prior ischemic stroke, or high cardiovascular risk, which fits this population [^97f4eee0] [^7ca81772]. I need to ensure antiplatelet therapy is not used in place of anticoagulation when the mechanism is embolic, but I may add antiplatelet therapy if there is concurrent arterial disease or after coronary stenting, balancing bleeding risk carefully [^2e5ecd4].

> Special populations require tailored decisions. In transplant recipients, I should suspect calcineurin inhibitor–mediated vasoconstriction and consider drug interactions, and I must remember that IVIG can precipitate thrombosis and renal infarction in this group, so prevention protocols and vigilance are key; if infarction occurs, management principles are similar but immunosuppression adjustments may be necessary [^8457bea6] [^a4544917]. In COVID-19, I should maintain a high index of suspicion for thrombotic renal infarction and favor therapeutic anticoagulation when suspected, given the prothrombotic milieu and case-level evidence of benefit [^0ac24874]. For patients with a single functioning kidney or bilateral disease, I should lower the threshold for endovascular rescue because the consequences of nonrecovery are dialysis dependence, and I should actively look for collateral perfusion that may extend the therapeutic window [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and double-check it aligns with the evidence. First, confirm diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT angiography and assess etiology with ECG, echocardiography, and targeted labs. Second, stabilize with fluids, analgesia, and blood pressure control, and start heparin if no contraindication. Third, consult interventional radiology for main renal artery occlusion or bilateral disease to consider catheter-directed therapy, recognizing that delays may still be acceptable if viability is present. Fourth, transition to oral anticoagulation for 3–6 months or longer based on embolic source, and add statin and risk-factor modification. Fifth, monitor renal function, blood pressure, and electrolytes closely, and initiate CRRT if hemodynamically unstable with AKI. Finally, arrange follow-up imaging to document infarct evolution and reassess for recurrent events or chronic hypertension [^a8ff1784] [^2bd41d17] [^a2786cb5].

> In summary, I need to ensure a rapid, etiology-driven approach that balances the risks and benefits of anticoagulation, interventional therapy, and supportive care, and I should avoid prematurely abandoning salvage options in delayed presentations when collateral flow suggests viability. The evidence base is largely observational and case-based, so multidisciplinary judgment and individualized decisions are essential to optimize renal salvage and long-term outcomes [^2bd41d17] [^a8ff1784] [^b6efbb4d].

---

Kidney infarction is managed with **urgent anticoagulation** (heparin to warfarin or DOAC) for embolic cases, and **catheter-directed thrombolysis or thrombectomy** for main renal artery occlusion within 24–48 hours when feasible [^a8ff1784] [^b6efbb4d]. Supportive care includes **strict blood pressure control** (ACEi/ARB preferred), analgesia, and fluids to avoid volume overload [^e323a257] [^a2786cb5]. Most patients are managed conservatively; **endovascular therapy is reserved for select cases** given limited evidence and risks [^a8ff1784]. Early diagnosis and intervention improve outcomes, but delayed presentations may still benefit if collateral flow preserves viability [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and initial assessment

- **Contrast-enhanced CT angiography**: gold standard to confirm renal infarction and identify occlusions [^notfound].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, renal function, electrolytes, LDH, and coagulation profile to assess severity and guide therapy [^notfound].

- **Etiology workup**: ECG, echocardiography, and hypercoagulable screening to identify embolic sources [^notfound].

---

## Conservative medical management

Conservative management is appropriate for **most patients**, particularly with segmental infarcts or stable renal function [^a8ff1784].

---

### Anticoagulation therapy

- **Initial anticoagulation**: unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) [^c65a0049].

- **Long-term anticoagulation**: warfarin or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for 3–6 months, or indefinitely if embolic source persists [^2bd41d17].

- **Renal considerations**: dose-adjust DOACs for eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²; avoid dabigatran if CrCl < 30 mL/min [^e442e743].

---

### Blood pressure control

Use **ACE inhibitors or ARBs as first-line** for hypertension control and renal protection [^87ae0e23]. Add beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or diuretics as needed to achieve target blood pressure [^03b88d9f].

---

### Supportive care

Provide **analgesia** for pain control, and use **intravenous fluids** cautiously to avoid volume overload, especially in acute kidney injury [^a2786cb5].

---

## Interventional management

Intervention is indicated for **main renal artery occlusion**, bilateral involvement, or deteriorating renal function [^a8ff1784].

---

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)

- **Indication**: acute main renal artery occlusion within 24–48 hours [^notfound].

- **Technique**: intra-arterial tPA or urokinase via catheter [^a8ff1784].

- **Outcomes**: high success in restoring perfusion; renal function may recover even after delays if collaterals exist [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

---

### Percutaneous thrombectomy

Percutaneous thrombectomy is indicated for **large thrombus burdens** or when CDT is contraindicated. Mechanical devices aspirate or remove thrombus to restore flow [^b6efbb4d].

---

### Surgical revascularization

Surgical revascularization is reserved for **failed endovascular therapy** or when it is unavailable. Options include open thrombectomy or bypass, but this approach carries higher morbidity and is rarely first-line [^b6efbb4d].

---

## Special considerations

- **Single kidney or transplant**: lower threshold for intervention due to risk of permanent renal failure [^b6efbb4d].

- **COVID-19**: consider anticoagulation even without traditional embolic sources [^0ac24874].

- **Contrast nephropathy**: hydrate and use lowest contrast dose; consider bicarbonate or N-acetylcysteine in high-risk patients [^a2786cb5].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

- **Anticoagulation**: continue if embolic source persists or recurrence risk is high [^notfound].

- **Blood pressure control**: lifelong ACEi/ARB and risk-factor modification [^87ae0e23].

- **Imaging**: periodic renal ultrasound or CT to monitor renal size and perfusion [^a8ff1784].

- **Lifestyle**: smoking cessation, statin therapy, and diabetes control to reduce cardiovascular risk [^97f4eee0].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis depends on **infarct size**, **timeliness of therapy**, and **comorbidities**. Early anticoagulation and intervention improve renal recovery and reduce recurrence; even delayed cases can recover if collateral flow preserves viability [^b6efbb4d] [^ee0218c0].

---

Kidney infarction treatment centers on **urgent anticoagulation** for embolic disease, with **selective use of endovascular therapy** for main renal artery occlusion. Conservative care with strict blood pressure control and supportive measures suffices for most, and early intervention improves outcomes.

Conclusions and future directions

There has been a significant decline in the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure over the past 20 years, yet these rates remain substantially elevated compared with the general population. The reasons for this are unclear, and therefore future work should focus on exploring the changing burden of both traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors in these high-risk patients. Despite improvements in patient outcomes during the study period, the prognosis of patients with kidney failure who experience a myocardial infarction or stroke remains poor. In part, these poor outcomes may be driven by the therapeutic disenfranchisement of patients with kidney failure, which is likely to be a consequence of the systematic exclusion of patients with kidney failure from cardiovascular trials. In summary, our contemporaneous findings provide a crucial framework to inform public health policy for patients with kidney failure, and set the scene for clinical trials that robustly evaluate the efficacy and safety of cardiovascular therapies specifically in this high-risk patient population.

### Kidney replacement therapy: trends in incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in a nationwide Scottish study [^77910a69]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an increasingly important non-communicable disease which now affects 15%–20% of the world's population. Cardiovascular disease is the most common complication of CKD. Cardiovascular risk increases as kidney function declines and is highest in patients with kidney failure. Globally, the number of patients living with kidney failure is ∼4–9 million, whilst the number of patients receiving kidney replacement therapy (KRT) (i.e. haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or kidney transplantation) continues to rise as a consequence of improved patient survival. By 2030, it is expected that almost 5.5 million people with kidney failure will be receiving KRT worldwide, with the greatest increases observed in Asia.

In the general population, there have been significant reductions in the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke over the past 25 years, mostly as a consequence of improvements in the management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. Outcomes following myocardial infarction and stroke have also improved in the general population during this period, in part due to advances in the diagnosis and management of these conditions, including the introduction of more sensitive diagnostic tests and more effective therapies.

Accurate and contemporaneous data describing temporal trends in myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure are essential to provide an evidence base for public health policy and to inform planning of healthcare resource allocation for all patients with kidney disease. Previous studies have focused only on the incidence, or outcomes, of either myocardial infarction or stroke in patients with kidney failure, whilst very few have additionally reported national, individual patient-level prescribing data. Currently, it is unclear which cardiovascular treatments and interventions have been implemented into clinical practice, or how prescribing trends have changed over time in patients with kidney failure. In the coming years, these high-fidelity prescribing data will also provide an exciting opportunity to assess the real-world implementation and impact of recent, novel evidence-based therapies including sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists on temporal trends of cardiovascular disease in patients with kidney failure. In this national, population-based data linkage study, we aimed to investigate temporal trends in the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure on dialysis or with a kidney transplant over the last 20 years.

### Acute myocardial infarction in patients with chronic kidney disease: how are the most vulnerable patients doing? [^4b105d0c]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with advanced chronic kidney disease sustain extremely high mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction. Nauta et al. evaluated temporal trends in 12,087 patients with acute myocardial infarction from a single institution over 24 years and report a reduction in 30-day mortality in the most recent decade for all patients, including patients with chronic kidney disease. This trend is optimistic, but understanding contributory factors would be critical in future studies to further improve survival.

### Acute renal artery occlusion: presentation, treatment, and outcome [^a8ff1784]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute renal artery occlusion is an uncommon disease requiring rapid diagnosis for prevention of kidney loss or permanent kidney damage. The purpose of this study was to identify patients with acute kidney infarction; to characterize their presentation, imaging, and treatment; and to compare the subgroup of patients who underwent catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with those who were treated without intervention.

Methods

Hospital records between 2005 and 2015 were queried for keywords suggestive of kidney infarction. Patients were divided into two groups: the CDT group and the noninterventional group. Data collected included demographics, comorbidities, methods of diagnosis, and time from presentation to diagnosis. For patients treated with CDT, additional data collected included details of thrombolytic therapy and follow-up studies. The two groups were compared regarding their clinical characteristics and outcome.

Results

Forty-two patients were diagnosed with acute kidney infarction; 13 (31%) were treated with CDT and 29 (69%) were treated conservatively. Median time from presentation to diagnosis was 42 hours in the CDT group and 32 hours in the untreated group. Among the CDT group, complete or partial resolution of the thrombus was seen in all patients. Two required permanent dialysis, both renal transplant patients. Median follow-up was 30 months (interquartile range, 2.7–46.2) in the CDT group and 13 months (interquartile range, 0.11–16) in the noninterventional group. Mean creatinine clearance at diagnosis and at last follow-up was 74.3 and 54.6 mL/min, respectively, in the CDT group (a decrease of 27%; P = 0.032) and 66.1 and 60 mL/min in the conservatively treated group (a decrease of 9%; P = 0.04). Follow-up imaging was available in nine patients treated with CDT. Mean interval from treatment to follow-up imaging was 13 months (range, 1–35 months) and consistently showed a functional but smaller treated kidney. (Mean pole-to-pole kidney length at baseline and late follow-up: 10.4 cm and 8.5 cm, respectively).

Conclusions

Most patients presenting with acute kidney infarction are managed conservatively. A subset of patients with complete occlusion of the renal artery undergo CDT with good angiographic results. The treated kidney is expected to decrease in size over time, and overall kidney function is expected to decrease compared with baseline. Deterioration in renal function appears to stabilize and does not continue over time. CDT for acute renal artery occlusion is a safe modality of therapy and should be attempted for the purpose of kidney salvage, even in the setting of prolonged ischemia.

### Invasive management for non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction and chronic kidney disease: does one size fit all? [^fa637b2d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

During the past 2 decades, there has been considerable advancement in the pharmacological and invasive management of patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). A number of pivotal randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the merits of an early invasive strategy in reducing the risk of mortality or reinfarction, Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is prevalent among patients with NSTEMI. In fact, patients with CKD present with NSTEMI rather than ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction. Such predilection for presentations with NSTEMI has been attributed to commonly existing supply–demand mismatch conditions, ischemic preconditioning, and collateralized circulation among patients with CKD. Not only is CKD considered a risk enhancer for coronary artery disease, impaired estimated glomerular filtration rate correlates with worse outcomes. Studies have consistently demonstrated that patients with CKD who experience acute myocardial infarction (MI) have worse short‐ and long‐term survival compared with patients without CKD. In particular, patients with CKD are at higher risk for certain complications after an acute MI, including acute kidney injury (AKI), bleeding, stroke, and vascular complications.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients with CKD presenting with NSTEMI are less likely to receive an invasive approach compared with those without CKD. This is partly because patients with CKD have been underrepresented or excluded in pivotal trials comparing early invasive versus selective invasive strategies for NSTEMI. There are also concerns regarding the risk of worsening renal function (ie, contrast‐induced nephropathy [CIN]) as well as bleeding complications. An earlier meta‐analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials conducted between 1989 and 2003 showed that among patients with NSTEMI and CKD, an early invasive strategy was associated with a reduction in the risk of rehospitalization and a nonsignificant reduction in the risk of mortality or MI, compared with a selective invasive strategy. Data from the SWEDEHEART (Swedish Web‐System for Enhancement and Development of Evidence‐Based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to Recommended Therapies) study including 23 362 patients demonstrated a survival benefit at 1 year after an invasive approach among patients with NSTEMI and mild–moderate renal insufficiency; however, such benefit declined with lower renal function and there was no survival benefit among patients with stage 5 CKD or those undergoing dialysis. Indeed, the lack of strong evidence supporting an early invasive strategy among patients with NSTEMI and CKD has been acknowledged by the latest American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines.

### Kidney infarction in patients with COVID-19 [^0ac24874]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious life-threatening infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent findings indicate an increased risk for acute kidney injury during COVID-19 infection. The pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to acute kidney injury in COVID-19 infection are unclear but may include direct cytopathic effects of the virus on kidney tubular and endothelial cells, indirect damage caused by virus-induced cytokine release, and kidney hypoperfusion due to a restrictive fluid strategy. In this report of 2 cases, we propose an additional pathophysiologic mechanism. We describe 2 cases in which patients with COVID-19 infection developed a decrease in kidney function due to kidney infarction. These patients did not have atrial fibrillation. One of these patients was treated with therapeutic doses of low-molecular-weight heparin, after which no further deterioration in kidney function was observed. Our findings implicate that the differential diagnosis of acute kidney injury in COVID-19-infected patients should include kidney infarction, which may have important preventive and therapeutic implications.

### Management and outcomes of myocardial infarction in people with impaired kidney function in england [^94df2a1f]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prevalence of moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) is 11–13% in the general population, but 40% in those with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The increased risk of AMI with CKD results from higher prevalence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in addition to risk factors specific to CKD pathophysiology. In the United States of America (USA) and Europe, in-hospital and post-discharge mortality following AMI is higher in the CKD population. Progressively worse outcomes are seen with increasing CKD severity.

Knowledge of the optimal management of AMI in people with CKD lags behind our understanding within the general population. People with CKD have been excluded from most randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) that have driven forward advances in AMI management over the past 50 years. Evidence in this population is limited to observational data and small subgroup analyses of people with mild to moderate CKD who were included within relevant RCTs. The accumulating evidence suggests that people with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) do benefit from invasive management of AMI, despite increased risk of complications and poorer outcomes compared to those with normal kidney function. Current USA and European cardiology guidelines now recommend invasive management for high-risk non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and all ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) events independent of eGFR.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of renal infarction [^2bd41d17]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Renal infarction is a rare condition resulting from an acute disruption of renal blood flow, and the cause and outcome of renal infarction are not well established.

Study Design

Case series.

Setting & Participants

438 patients with renal infarction in January 1993 to December 2013 at 9 hospitals in Korea were included. Renal infarction was defined by radiologic findings that included single or multiple wedge-shaped parenchymal perfusion defects in the kidney.

Predictor

Causes of renal infarction included cardiogenic (n = 244 [55.7%]), renal artery injury (n = 33 [7.5%]), hypercoagulable (n = 29 [6.6%]), and idiopathic (n = 132 [30.1%]) factors.

Outcomes

We used recurrence, acute kidney injury (AKI; defined as creatinine level increase ≥ 0.3mg/dL within 48 hours or an increase to 150% of baseline level within 7 days during the sentinel hospitalization), new-onset estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60mL/min/1.73m(2) (for > 3 months after renal infarction in the absence of a history of decreased eGFR), end-stage renal disease (ESRD; receiving hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis because of irreversible kidney damage), and mortality as outcome metrics.

Results

Treatment included urokinase (n = 19), heparin (n = 342), warfarin (n = 330), and antiplatelet agents (n = 157). 5% of patients died during the initial hospitalization. During the median 20.0 (range, 1–223) months of follow-up, 2.8% of patients had recurrent infarction, 20.1% of patients developed AKI, 10.9% of patients developed new-onset eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m(2), and 2.1% of patients progressed to ESRD.

Limitations

This was a retrospective study; it cannot clearly determine the specific causal mechanism for certain patients or provide information about the causes of mortality. 16 patients were excluded from the prognostic analysis.

Conclusions

Cardiogenic origins were the most important causes of renal infarction. Despite aggressive treatment, renal infarction can lead to AKI, new-onset eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m(2), ESRD, and death.

### Kidney replacement therapy: trends in incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in a nationwide Scottish study [^dca8836b]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We performed a national population-based data linkage study to evaluate trends in the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure over the last 20 years. We make several important observations that could inform future healthcare provision for this high-risk population. First, although the incidence rates of both myocardial infarction and stroke have halved in patients with kidney failure, these remain substantially higher compared with the general population. When stratified by KRT modality, the biggest reductions in the incidence of both events were observed in patients on haemodialysis, whilst incidence rates in those with a kidney transplant were lower and stable. Second, there was an ∼1.5-fold increase in the prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy following a myocardial infarction and an ∼3-fold increase in the prescription of antiplatelet therapy following a stroke over the study period. Third, although cardiovascular death following myocardial infarction and stroke has reduced substantially over the past 20 years in both men and women with kidney failure and across all KRT modalities, overall outcomes remain poor (Structured Graphical Abstract).

### Remote ischaemic conditioning-therapeutic opportunities in renal medicine [^78a1d75b]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2013). Medium credibility.

Following ischaemic insult, tissue damage is extended after reperfusion, known as an ischaemia reperfusion injury. Ischaemic conditioning-the application of transient, non-lethal, episodes of ischaemia-reduces the effect of a larger ischaemic insult, and limits the reperfusion injury. How this phenomenon might be exploited as a therapeutic treatment is now the subject of a number of clinical trials. From initial trials focusing on the mitigation of cardiac injury, interest has expanded to examine the potential for its use as an adjunctive therapy in different clinical scenarios, including renal medicine. In this Review, we discuss different forms of conditioning, potential molecular mechanisms underpinning its effect, and potential applications in the setting of acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.

### Secondary analysis of the EMPACT-MI trial reveals cardiovascular-kidney efficacy and safety of empagliflozin after acute myocardial infarction [^6c512c41]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Data on the cardiovascular-kidney effects and safety of empagliflozin among patients with acute myocardial infarction are limited. EMPACT-MI (Study to Evaluate the Effect of Empagliflozin on Hospitalization for Heart Failure and Mortality in Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction) was a double-blind, multicenter clinical trial that randomized 6,522 patients with acute myocardial infarction and risk for heart failure to empagliflozin or placebo. Here we show in this secondary analysis that the mean estimated glomerular filtration rate at baseline was 76.1mlmin -1 1.73m - 2 (s.d. = 19.9mlmin -1 1.73m - 2), with longitudinal kidney function data available for 1,152 (17.7%) treated patients from select countries. By 24 months, compared with baseline, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was similar in the empagliflozin group but declined in the placebo group (P = 0.01). Empagliflozin reduced the total adverse events of heart failure or all-cause mortality irrespective of kidney function (P interaction = 0.30). Thirty-day adverse event rates were similar by treatment group and consistent across baseline kidney function. Empagliflozin had kidney-protective effects, reduced heart failure outcomes and was safe to initiate soon after acute myocardial infarction across baseline kidney function.

### Successful rescue from kidney failure with delayed catheter-directed intervention after catastrophic bilateral kidney paradoxical thromboembolism [^e4442b4c]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Renal infarction is uncommon, but acute bilateral infarction can result in immediate kidney failure and permanent dialysis requirement. Any chance at rescue therapy should be immediately assessed and offered if possible. Endovascular catheter-directed treatment is preferred to systemic thrombolysis, but there is uncertainty as to the acceptable treatment time window. This case report highlights the clues at presentation which indicates renal infarction so clinicians may better recognise this syndrome. It also demonstrated that some patients still benefit from delayed intervention. Paradoxical embolism is also a very rare cause of renal infarction which was worth considering if a primary cardiac source cannot be found.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^79de8dc9]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Reperfusion and revascularization for coronary heart disease — acute ischemic syndromes: Management of acute myocardial infarction is similar for patients with and without diabetes, and reperfusion therapies for acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction are the standard of care because major adverse cardiovascular events and deaths are reduced. Coronary artery reperfusion may use either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy; where acute PCI is readily available with expert prompt intervention (within 90 minutes of first medical contact) it provides superior results versus fibrinolysis. When acute PCI is not available, fibrinolysis should be used as the initial treatment strategy (within 12 hours of symptom onset) if contraindications do not exist, including history of intracranial hemorrhage, closed head or facial trauma, or ischemic stroke within the past 3 months; uncontrolled hypertension; bleeding diathesis; or aortic dissection. For acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina or non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction), medical management including aspirin, heparin, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, β-blockers, and ACE inhibition are indicated, usually along with coronary angiography and PCI. Evidence to guide treatment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is sparse; despite high risk, those with CKD are less likely to receive reperfusion or other recommended therapies, but when recommended therapies have been given to people with CKD, risk of death was decreased in observational studies; data for the subset with both diabetes and CKD do not exist.

### Kidney replacement therapy: trends in incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in a nationwide Scottish study [^176f10ef]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background and Aims

Patients with kidney failure have a higher risk of cardiovascular disease compared with the general population. Whilst temporal trends of myocardial infarction and stroke are declining in the general population, these have not been evaluated in patients with kidney failure. This study aimed to describe national trends in the incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure (i.e. on dialysis or with a kidney transplant) over a 20-year period, stratified by age and sex.

Methods

In this retrospective national data linkage study, all patients with kidney failure in Scotland (UK) receiving kidney replacement therapy between January 1996 and December 2016 were linked to national hospitalization, prescribing, and death records. The primary outcomes were the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke, and subsequent cardiovascular death. Generalized additive models were constructed to estimate age-standardized, sex-stratified incidence rates and trends in cardiovascular and all-cause death.

Results

Amongst 16 050 patients with kidney failure [52 (SD 15) years; 41.5% women], there were 1992 [66 (SD 12) years; 34.8% women] and 996 [65 (SD 13) years; 45.1% women] incident myocardial infarctions and strokes, respectively, between January 1996 and December 2016. During this period, the age-standardized incidence of myocardial infarction per 100 000 decreased in men {from 4376 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3998–4785] to 1835 (95% CI 1692–1988)} and women [from 3268 (95% CI 2982–3593) to 1369 (95% CI 1257–1491)]. Similarly, the age-standardized incidence of stroke per 100 000 also decreased in men [from 1978 (95% CI 1795–2175) to 799 (95% CI 729–875)] and women [from 2234 (95% CI 2031–2468) to 903 (95% CI 824–990)]. Compared with the general population, the incidence of myocardial infarction was four- to eight-fold higher in patients with kidney failure, whilst for stroke it was two- to four-fold higher. The use of evidence-based cardioprotective treatment increased over the study period, and the predicted probability of cardiovascular death within 1 year of myocardial infarction for a 66-year-old patient with kidney failure (mean age of the cohort) fell in men (76.6% to 38.6%) and women (76.8% to 38.8%), and also decreased in both sexes following stroke (men, from 63.5% to 41.4%; women, from 67.6% to 45.8%).

Conclusions

The incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke has halved in patients with kidney failure over the past 20 years but remains significantly higher than in the general population. Despite improvements in treatment and outcomes, the prognosis of these patients following myocardial infarction and stroke remains poor.

Patients who have kidney disease receive aspirin, beta blockers, lipid-lowering therapy, thrombolytic agents, and coronary interventions less often than patients who have normal kidney function. The odds of dying during hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction were significantly higher among patients who had kidney disease than among those who did not have kidney disease after adjusting for several demographic and clinical confounders and year of hospitalization.

### Myocardial ischaemic syndromes in chronic kidney disease: risky pathways from non-acute to acute events [^30c34e95]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has emerged as a critical global public health concern. This condition is strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and acute coronary syndromes (ACS) which have been recently renamed as acute myocardial ischemic syndromes (AMIS). In CKD patients, the atypical presentation of symptoms complicates the diagnosis and management of angina, a condition that can, if not promptly addressed, rapidly progress to myocardial infarction. Traditional diagnostic tools, such as the electrocardiogram and cardiac biomarkers, are less reliable in this population due to CKD-related baseline alterations, necessitating advanced imaging techniques for accurate assessment. Management strategies for transient myocardial ischaemia in CKD must also carefully balance the risk related to myocardial ischemia against potential complications from invasive procedures, such as further renal impairment and bleeding. Tailored therapeutic approaches, including adjusted medication regimens and innovative revascularization techniques, are crucial to improve outcomes in this high-risk population. Additionally, asymptomatic myocardial infarction is notably prevalent in CKD, often remaining undetected and posing significant prognostic implications. The interplay of traditional and non-traditional risk factors, such as uremia-induced toxicity and chronic inflammation, further exacerbates the risk for plaque instability in CKD patients. This review highlights the necessity of a multidisciplinary approach to managing myocardial ischemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD), incorporating meticulous risk stratification and personalized treatment plans.

### Less use of standard guideline-based treatment of myocardial infarction in patients with chronic kidney disease: a Danish nation-wide cohort study [^8a186655]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

The aim of this Danish nationwide study was to evaluate the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with non-end-stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). Upgraded guidelines for the management of MI were implemented around 2004; hence, the treatment of MI in the time periods before and after 2004 was compared in order to evaluate the impact for patients with CKD.

Methods and Results

By linking nationwide registries by the personal registration number, we identified patients admitted to Danish hospitals with first time MI in the period 2000–09 (79 585 with no renal disease, 3144 with non-end-stage CKD, and 725 requiring RRT). Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the chance of invasive treatment within 60 days after MI and the chance of filling prescriptions on recommended post-MI drugs within 90 days before and after 2004. Significantly less use of relevant MI treatment in patients with non-end-stage CKD and patients requiring RRT compared with patients with no renal disease were seen; however, the absolute frequencies of invasive procedures and filled prescriptions on post-MI drugs increased after 2004 in all patients.

Conclusions

After 2004, invasive and pharmacological treatment of first-time MI improved in patients with non-end-stage CKD and patients requiring RRT; however, all CKD patients were less treated with standard MI care compared with patients with no renal disease.

### Cocaine-induced renal infarction: report of a case and review of the literature [^a050715a]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Cocaine intoxication is associated with multiple cases of vascular injury. Renal infarction as a result of cocaine use, however, is uncommon. In a patient with a history of cocaine abuse presenting with fevers and flank pain suggestive of urinary tract infection or nephrolithiasis, cocaine-induced renal infarction must be considered in the differential diagnosis. The vasoconstrictive and thrombotic effects of cocaine are most likely the dominant factors in cocaine-induced renal infarction. The possible atherogenic effect of cocaine and the relationship of this effect to renal infarct is likely to be a long term, rather than an acute factor. The diagnosis of CIRI is based on exclusion of other entities that cause renal infarct (e.g. hypercoagulable states due to factor deficiency, autoimmune diseases and thromboembolic events), in conjunction with documented cocaine use and appropriate radiographic studies. We highly recommend non-invasive evaluation of the renal arterial supply in patients with CIRI in order to broaden our knowledge of this disorder, and conceivably better understand its selectivity for one kidney. Thus far, there is no agreement on the management of patients with this disease. In fact, it is difficult to suggest a uniform therapeutic approach to this disorder because one cannot predict whether the infarct will be due to vasospasm, thrombosis or both. In addition, the extent of the renal infarct will likely influence clinical management and outcome. Although anticoagulation, antithrombotic, conservative managements as well as surgical approaches have been attempted with variable success, perhaps the most plausible treatment would be to prevent this misfortune by patient education.

### Use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin in patients with kidney impairment: a randomized clinical trial [^a13be6b1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

While the frequency of elevated hs-cTnI concentrations increased 6-fold as kidney function declined from an eGFR of 90 or greater to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, the proportion attributable to type 1 myocardial infarction halved. Although hs-cTnI is effective at enabling the early rule out of myocardial infarction in patients with kidney impairment, use did not improve outcomes in patients with elevated levels whether they had kidney impairment or not. The reasons for this are complex. Two-thirds of patients with kidney impairment and elevated hs-cTnI concentrations had a diagnosis other than type 1 myocardial infarction. In the absence of evidence from randomized trials, there is little guidance to inform clinical decisions for this heterogeneous group. Moreover, for those with kidney impairment and type 1 myocardial infarction, the available evidence is largely extrapolated from clinical trials in patients with broadly normal kidney function. Further research is therefore needed to convince clinicians of the safety and efficacy of these treatments in patients with kidney impairment. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to discriminate between acute and chronic kidney injury. While both are associated with cardiovascular risk, these conditions are distinct. Following the use of hs-cTnI testing in clinical practice, 1 in 2 patients with kidney impairment had an elevated troponin concentration, but these were less likely due to myocardial infarction, and outcomes did not improve.

### Renal arteriography with endovascular ultrasound for the management of renal infarction patients [^2e5ecd69]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal infarction (RI) is a rare disease that can be of multiple causes. It may result from an embolic mechanism, or from an abnormality of the renal arterial wall.

To date, there is no guideline regarding the antithrombotic treatment of RI either at the early phase or at long-term. The lack of guideline is an issue, considering the high recurrence of cardiovascular events and the poor prognosis of the disease. In retrospective studies, patients with RI have an all-cause mortality rate of 19.7% at 40 months, despite a rare evolution to dialysis or end-stage renal disease (2% at 41 months). This means that the poor prognosis is not due to the severity of the kidney injury, but mainly to cardiovascular events and patients' comorbidities with an outcome rate of 12% at 48 months, highlighting the need of an appropriate secondary prevention treatment. Following the same logic as in cerebrovascular accident, anticoagulant treatment is generally given in case of suspected embolic mechanism. On the contrary, antiplatelet therapy is preferred in case of arterial disease.

The classic investigations for renal artery abnormalities are however poorly informative. Renal artery doppler can only assess the presence and severity of a renal artery stenosis, and thus is not appropriate to detect non severe atherosclerosis and to identify the etiological mechanism of a narrowing. Enhanced computed tomography scan or MRI are useful to diagnose renal artery stenosis but are also insufficient to detect non-severe atherosclerotic plaque. Knowing this, an exhaustive etiological assessment of RI might include an invasive exploration of renal arteries. Angiography is considered the gold standard procedure for the diagnosis of artery disease, but it only visualizes the lumen of vessels, while atherosclerosis is a disease of the arterial wall. Atheroma may then be underdiagnosed despite several angiographic views. Unlike angiography, intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) can directly assess atherosclerosis and the remodelling of arterial wall. For instance, coronary IVUS in very young cardiac transplant donors (less than 20 years old) showed atherosclerosis in 17% of cases, with an apparently normal coronary angiography. Hence, IVUS is more sensitive than angiography for detecting vascular lesions, provided that the diseased artery is accessible to invasive catheterization.

The purpose of the present proof-of-concept study was to investigate whether renal artery invasive exploration could improve the diagnostic process and change the secondary prevention treatment strategy in a monocentric RI cohort.

### Treatment to reduce risk of acute kidney injury… [^07fe5de7]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Interventions Patients were assigned to take aspirin or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery and then aspirin or placebo daily up to 30 days after surgery, and were assigned to take oral clonidine or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery, and then a transdermal clonidine patch or placebo patch that remained until 72 hours after surgery. Early promising animal, human, and randomized clinical trial data suggest a commonly used antiplatelet or the centrally acting α2-adrenergic agonist clonidine, administered during the perioperative period, may reduce the risk of acute kidney injury. 5–16 However, these effects are uncertain and. Patients were also assigned to take oral clonidine or placebo 2 to 4 hours before surgery, and then a transdermal clonidine patch or placebo patch that remained until 72 hours after surgery.

The protocol instructed study personnel to measure blood pressure and heart rate 1 hour after the first dose of clonidine or placebo, and then every 4 hours for the first 96 hours after surgery. The effects of aspirin were also consistent with multiple secondary categorical definitions of acute kidney injury, which included a composite outcome of acute kidney injury or death. Within 30 days of surgery, 19 of 3443 patients assigned to aspirin were treated with dialysis for severe acute kidney injury, with a corresponding number of 9 of 3462 patients assigned to placebo. In this 2 × 2 factorial randomized clinical trial in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, neither perioperative assignment to aspirin nor clonidine altered the risk of the primary definition of acute kidney injury.

We designed and conducted this study because early promising data suggested these interventions may reduce the risk of perioperative acute kidney injury. The putative major mechanism of perioperative acute kidney injury is a decrease in kidney perfusion and ischemia, with activation of inflammatory mediators, adhesion molecules, platelets, and thromboxane. 9, 10 Aspirin reduces platelet aggregation and microembolization, potentially improving GFR at a time of poor kidney perfusion.

### Role of invasive strategy for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in patients with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cf95d279]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have traditionally been excluded from randomized trials. We aimed to compare percutaneous coronary intervention versus conservative management, and early intervention (EI; within 24 hours of admission) versus delayed intervention (DI; after 24 to 72 hours of admission) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and concomitant CKD. An electronic literature search was performed to search for studies comparing invasive management to conservative management or EI versus DI in patients with NSTEMI with CKD. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality; secondary outcomes were acute kidney injury (AKI) or dialysis, major bleeding, and recurrent MI. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the primary outcome and odds ratios for secondary outcomes were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. Eleven studies (140,544 patients) were analyzed. Invasive management was associated with lower mortality than conservative management (HR 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.67, p < 0.001, I² = 47%), with consistent benefit across all CKD stages, except CKD 5. There was no significant mortality difference between EI and DI, but subgroup analyses showed significant benefit for EI in stage 1 to 2 CKD (HR 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.97, p = 0.03, I² = 0%), with no significant difference in stage 3 and 4 to 5 CKD. Invasive strategy was associated with higher odds of AKI or dialysis and major bleeding, but lower odds of recurrent MI compared with conservative management. In conclusion, in patients with NSTEMI and CKD, an invasive strategy is associated with significant mortality benefit over conservative management in most patients with CKD, but at the expense of higher risk of AKI and bleeding. EI appears to benefit those with early stages of CKD. Trial Registration: PROSPERO CRD42023405491.

Atrial fibrillation after ischemic stroke or TIA — timing, bridging, and renal cautions are outlined as follows: "Patients should be treated (ie, bridged) with aspirin until anticoagulation has reached a therapeutic level", and "Before anticoagulation is initiated and during the time that anticoagulation is started but has not yet reached therapeutic levels (INR < 2.0), treatment with aspirin is recommended". Timing statements include "Oral anticoagulation should generally be initiated within 1 to 2 weeks after stroke onset" and "We therefore recommend initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy within 2 weeks of a cardioembolic stroke; however, for patients with large infarcts or other risk factors for hemorrhage, additional delays are appropriate", with "Earlier anticoagulation can be considered for patients at low risk of bleeding complications" and "Delaying anticoagulation should be considered for patients at high risk of hemorrhagic complications". For dabigatran, renal safety is specified: "Dabigatran is excreted primarily by the kidney. It has not been studied and is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance of 30 mL/min or less)".

### Kidney replacement therapy: trends in incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in a nationwide Scottish study [^4055b54b]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Trends in cardiovascular therapies following incident myocardial infarction and stroke

Individual patient-level prescribing data were available from 2009 until 2016 (see Supplementary data online, Table S4 and Supplementary data online, Figure S8). Common preventative therapies were prescribed in around half of patients with kidney failure at the time of their incident event. For example, aspirin was prescribed in 58.3% and 53.8% of all patients at the time of myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. The proportion of patients prescribed preventative therapies was stable between 2009 and 2016, except for beta-blockers, the prescription of which increased from 52.5% to 64.2% for patients who went on to have a myocardial infarction, and from 42.3% to 58.2% for patients who went on to have a stroke. Following non-fatal incident myocardial infarction, the overall proportion of patients prescribed aspirin or clopidogrel increased. In addition, the proportion of patients prescribed dual antiplatelet therapy increased over time, from 40.7% to 61.4%, with most patients (94.1%; 337/358) prescribed aspirin and clopidogrel. Following incident non-fatal stroke, the proportion of patients prescribed aspirin decreased during this period from 49.0% to 26.4%, whilst the proportion prescribed clopidogrel increased from 14.6% to 53.8% (see Supplementary data online, Table S4; Supplementary data online, Figure S8).

Patient outcomes following incident myocardial infarction and stroke

Crude outcomes following incident myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with kidney failure between 1996 and 2016 are summarized in Table 2. During this period, both short- and longer term outcomes for these patients were poor. The primary outcome of cardiovascular death at 1 year occurred in 61.1% (1217/1992) and 52.5% (523/996) of patients with myocardial infarction and stroke, respectively. There was a decline in mortality over this 20-year period for both conditions. However, for those with myocardial infarction, this was accompanied by an increase in subsequent non-fatal cardiovascular events, including heart failure, bleeding hospitalizations, and recurrent myocardial infarction (Table 2). Compared with myocardial infarction, those with stroke remained hospital inpatients for longer.

### Suboptimal medical care of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and renal insufficiency: results from the Korea acute myocardial infarction registry [^3488d1c5]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, patients with STEMI and renal insufficiency had significantly less chance of receiving optimal medical care throughout the entire process of MI management. Despite recent advances in emergency systems and evidence-based therapy, these advances have been applied less frequently in patients with renal insufficiency than in patients with normal renal function. Therefore, patients with renal insufficiency require an aggressive approach to diagnosis, intervention, and medical treatment for improved clinical outcomes.

### Management and outcomes of renal disease and acute myocardial infarction [^b5c580d9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Contemporary trends in the management and outcomes of chronic kidney disease patients who develop an acute myocardial infarction have not been adequately described, particularly from the more generalizable perspective of a population-based investigation.

Methods

The study population consisted of 6219 residents of the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area who were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction in 6 annual periods between 1995 and 2005. Patients were categorized as having preserved kidney function (n = 3154), mild to moderate chronic kidney disease (n = 2313), or severe chronic kidney disease (n = 752) at the time of hospital admission.

Results

Patients with chronic kidney disease were more likely to be older, to have a greater prevalence of comorbidities, and to experience significant in-hospital complications or die during hospitalization in comparison with patients with preserved kidney function. Although patients with chronic kidney disease were less likely to receive effective cardiac medications or undergo coronary interventional procedures than patients without kidney disease, we observed a marked increase in the use of effective cardiac medications and coronary interventional procedures in patients with chronic kidney disease during the period under study. In-hospital death rates declined over time among patients with chronic kidney disease, whereas these death rates remained unchanged among persons with normal kidney function.

Conclusion

The results of this study in residents of a large New England metropolitan area provide insights into changing trends in the treatment and impact of chronic kidney disease in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction.

### Case report: full recovery from dialysis-requiring renal failure after surgical repair of a completely occluded renal artery in a patient with a single kidney [^4ffb92fd]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute renal infarction is an extremely rare but potentially devastating emergency. Partial or complete occlusion of the renal artery or its branches leads to reduced renal perfusion, resulting in ischemia and, ultimately, irreversible tissue necrosis. Depending on the size of the area with loss of perfusion, a wide variation of clinical symptoms has been reported. Most often patients report sudden flank or back pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, high blood pressure and/or reduced urine production. Nonspecific nature of these symptoms can delay diagnosis, often resulting in misidentification such as pyelonephritis or nephrolithiasis, thereby compromising outcomes. With a prevalence of approximately 1% and even lower incidence, data on the treatment of acute renal infarction remain limited. Additionally, there are no clear clinical or biochemical predictors of treatment success. We report the case of a 41-year-old male patient presenting with acute oligo-anuric renal failure due to occlusion of an aortic-renal bypass supplying his solitary left kidney.

### Successful rescue from kidney failure with delayed catheter-directed intervention after catastrophic bilateral kidney paradoxical thromboembolism [^9e7a8201]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Case reports of bilateral renal infarction from paradoxical emboli are rare. Carey et al reported a patient with bilateral renal artery occlusion in the setting of a deep vein thrombosis and PFO who remained dialysis dependent. In the case by Herbaut et al, the infarcted kidney was not salvageable after a significant delay in diagnosis and treatment. Our patient was fortunate to have salvaged enough kidney to cease dialysis. Only one other case by Goueffic et al reported a similar situation, where a patient with bilateral renal infarct following paradoxical embolism recovered enough renal function to cease dialysis after successful endovascular treatment. In the longer term, it is unclear if closure of the PFO is recommended as studies have mostly been for secondary stroke prevention. In a meta-analysis of randomised trials by Shah et al in 2018, PFO closure compared with medical therapy alone reduced the rate of recurrent stroke from 5.1% to 1.8%. In an observational study of patients with paradoxical embolism and PFO, the average annual recurrence of transient ischaemic attacks and peripheral embolism despite PFO closure was 2.5% and 0.9%, respectively. While there are many reported case studies of PFO closure after non-cerebral paradoxical embolism in the literature, it is difficult to conclusively demonstrate a benefit in the absence of randomised trials. However, given the catastrophic embolism in our patient and the indirect evidence for preventing peripheral embolism, percutaneous transcatheter PFO closure is under consideration for our patient.

### Renal cortical infarction following treatment with sumatriptan in a kidney allograft recipient [^80a32630]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Renal cortical infarction is a rare cause of acute kidney injury that results from inadequate blood flow to the kidney, most commonly as a consequence of thrombotic or embolic occlusion of the renal artery or profound hypoperfusion. We report the case of a 78-year-old female kidney transplant recipient who developed a migraine headache, took sumatriptan, and soon after developed pain over the allograft and oligoanuric acute kidney injury. Kidney allograft biopsy showed renal cortical infarction. The mechanism of action of sumatriptan involves vasoconstriction, which counters the vasodilatation that is central to the pathogenesis of migraines. This case raises important questions regarding the safety of triptans with calcineurin inhibitors (which also act to vasoconstrict), particularly in elderly patients.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^0f415e78]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) — renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition for coronary heart disease (CHD) management is supported as follows: In people with diabetes and CKD, RAS inhibition is beneficial for the management of CHD and associated complications and for treatment of hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction, and when used alone or in combination these agents are equally beneficial for improving survival and reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) events after myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction, with patients with diabetes benefiting at least as much as those without diabetes. Similarly, in people with diabetes with chronic CHD and without left ventricular dysfunction, ACE inhibition reduces CVD death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and therefore RAS inhibition is recommended for treatment of acute myocardial infarction and for chronic CHD in patients with diabetes.

### Unilateral global renal infarction in a patient with ischemic stroke and hypertensive heart disease in a resource limited setting: a case report [^570f4caa]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The optimal treatment for renal infarction is controversial. Some recommend anticoagulation alone, particularly for unilateral embolisms with limited potential for renal salvage. This usually starts with a heparin bolus followed by continuous infusion and long-term coumadin administration. Open surgical revascularization is advised for embolic occlusions but is generally restricted to trauma scenarios. While surgical embolectomy can help reduce hypertension, it often fails to restore renal function and is primarily used for acute occlusions of significant renal arteries or branches. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) was also employed as the primary revascularization modality in select cases involving acute occlusion of the main renal artery trunk, provided patients had no contraindications to thrombolytics (e.g. active bleeding, recent surgery) and were medically stable to undergo the procedure. The thrombolytic regimen consisted of a bolus dose of tPA followed by continuous urokinase infusion. In this case, due to resource constraints, thrombolysis or thrombectomy was not pursued; treatment focused on anticoagulants consisting of unfractionated heparin and warfarin in addition to aspirin and atorvastatin, and blood pressure monitoring along with analgesics, and supportive therapies. Despite therapeutic anticoagulation, the patient progressed to stage 3 AKI with oliguric renal failure, manifesting as generalized edema, confusion, gross hematuria, and hypotension requiring diuretics, fluid restriction, and vasopressor. Although complete unilateral renal infarction rarely leads to oliguric AKI in patients with prior normal renal function (due to compensatory hyperfiltration in the contralateral kidney), this patient's rapid progression to stage 3 AKI reflects the compounding effects of acute hemodynamic collapse and systemic inflammation. Despite the absence of baseline CKD (normal pre-admission creatinine) or sepsis (negative cultures, no fever), two synergistic mechanisms likely drove the fulminant course: type 1 cardiorenal syndrome from refractory hypotension and hypertensive cardiomyopathy, causing critical renal hypoperfusion, and infarction-induced systemic inflammation (elevated CRP 15.8 mg/dL, LDH 1904 U/L) that may have exacerbated tubular injury independent of infection. The concurrence of complete vascular occlusion with globally reduced perfusion pressure created a unique 'two-hit' scenario, where compensatory mechanisms were overwhelmed despite unilateral involvement. The rapid AKI progression observed in this hemodynamically unstable patient, despite absent sepsis or baseline renal impairment, implies that the confluence of vascular occlusion and circulatory collapse may constitute a unique clinical entity warranting heightened surveillance. This patient developed clear indications for renal replacement therapy (RRT), including volume overload refractory to diuretics and uremic encephalopathy with altered mental status. Her clinical course was further complicated by persistent hemodynamic instability requiring multiple vasopressors, ultimately progressing to cardiogenic shock. In this critical context, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) represented the most physiologically appropriate renal support modality, as it permits gradual fluid removal and solute clearance while minimizing hemodynamic perturbations - a particular advantage in vasopressor-dependent acute kidney injury (AKI). Current critical care guidelines strongly recommend CRRT for such cases of circulatory instability in the ICU setting. Despite these compelling indications and after multidisciplinary consultation, CRRT could not be initiated due to unavailability of the required setup. The patient's clinical trajectory reflected progressive multiorgan failure stemming from three interrelated pathological processes: a primary vascular insult from renal artery thrombosis causing complete parenchymal infarction, a secondary systemic inflammatory response evidenced by markedly elevated C-reactive protein (15.8 mg/dL) and LDH (peak 1904 U/L), and tertiary cardiorenal syndrome due to exacerbation of underlying hypertensive heart disease. This pathophysiological cascade culminated in refractory circulatory collapse despite maximal intensive care measures, including dual vasopressor therapy with norepinephrine and vasopressin. The patient's refractory hypotension arose from two primary mechanisms: cardiogenic shock due to decompensated hypertensive heart disease, independent of the renal artery thrombosis causing infarction; inflammatory-mediated vasodilation evidenced by elevated CRP (15.8 mg/dL), potentially exacerbated by ischemic tissue injury from the infarction. While renal infarction secondary to thromboembolism typically induces hypertension via renin-angiotensin activation, the coexisting cardio renal syndrome and systemic inflammation instead drove refractory circulatory failure. This dichotomy between structural occlusion (thrombosis) and functional hemodynamic collapse (cardiogenic/inflammatory) illustrates how competing pathologies can distort classical clinical paradigms.

### Renal arteriography with endovascular ultrasound for the management of renal infarction patients [^a847ccd4]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Renal infarction (RI) is a rare disease with poor prognosis. Appropriate secondary prevention treatment is essential and requires an exhaustive etiological assessment. We aimed to determine whether invasive endovascular explorations may improve the diagnostic process and change the secondary prevention treatment strategy in RI patients.

Methods

We report a retrospective observational study of 25 RI patients referred to Tours University Hospital between 2011 and 2018 for etiological investigation including renal arteriography and intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). We sought for antithrombotic treatment regimen, vital status, bleeding and ischemic outcomes during the median follow-up of 59months.

Results

Invasive explorations showed local arterial disease in 14 patients (56%). This led to a diagnosis or change in diagnosis in 9 patients (36%) and to a change in antithrombotic strategy in 56% of cases, with an increased prescription of antiplatelet therapy. No patient died, only two patients (8%) had persistent mild renal insufficiency. One IVUS complication was reported and treated without any significant long-term consequences.

Conclusion

Invasive endovascular investigations of RI may modify the secondary prevention treatment through a better assessment of the aetiology of RI. Multicentric randomized studies are necessary to advocate the hypothesis that invasive exploration of renal artery can improve long-term prognosis.

### Invasive versus medical management in patients with chronic kidney disease and non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction [^482d5946]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity, cardiovascular mortality, and all‐cause mortality. Advanced CKD in patients with non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is associated with worse morbidity and mortality. This can be attributed to accelerated atherosclerosis/calcification and more severe comorbidities like hypertension and diabetes, other than CKD itself. Patients with CKD are not routinely included in randomized clinical trials of invasive treatment of acute coronary syndrome, given the theoretical risk of accelerating the need for renal replacement therapy because of concern for contrast‐induced nephropathy in patients undergoing coronary angiography (CA). However, these patients have significantly higher rates of major bleeding and poorer outcomes regardless of CA.

There is a reluctance to offer early invasive management to patients with NSTEMI‐CKD in clinical practice, because there is an increased risk of contrast‐induced nephropathy, bleeding, and mortalitycompared with patients without CKD. Patients with CKD may benefit from an invasive approach despite the risk of adverse outcomes. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2021 and European Society of Cardiology 2020 guidelines acknowledged the limited evidence on the beneficial role and safety of invasive management in patients with NSTEMI‐CKD compared with medical management.

Here, we performed a propensity‐score matched analysis using the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) and examined the safety and efficacy of invasive approach in patients with NSTEMI and CKD stages 3, 4, 5, and end‐stage renal disease (ESRD).

### Acute myocardial infarction and renal dysfunction: a high-risk combination [^277050da]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Survival is poor in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) who also have severe renal disease. Less is known about the outcome of acute MI in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency.

Objective

To compare outcomes after acute MI in patients with varying levels of renal disease and in patients without renal failure.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Academic medical center.

Patients

3106 total patients admitted with acute MI and end-stage renal disease (n = 44), severe renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 0.59 mL/s [< 35 mL/min]) (n = 391), moderate renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance ≥ 0.59 mL/s [< 35 mL/min] but ≤ 0.84 mL/s [≤ 50 mL/min]) (n = 491), mild chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance > 0.84 mL/s [> 50 mL/min] but ≤ 1.25 mL/s [≤ 75 mL/min]) (n = 860), or no renal disease (n = 1320).

Measurements

Clinical characteristics, treatment strategies, and short- and long-term survival were compared after patients were stratified by creatinine clearance.

Results

In-hospital mortality rates were 2% in patients with normal renal function, 6% in those with mild renal failure, 14% in those with moderate renal failure, 21% in those with severe renal failure, and 30% in those with end-stage renal disease (P < 0.001). Compared with patients without renal disease, similar adjusted trends were present for postdischarge death in patients with end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio, 5.4 [95% CI, 3.0 to 9.7]; P < 0.001), severe renal insufficiency (hazard ratio, 1.9 [CI, 1.2 to 3.0]; P = 0.006), moderate renal dysfunction (hazard ratio, 2.2 [CI, 1.5 to 3.3]; P < 0.001), and mild chronic renal insufficiency (hazard ratio, 2.4 [CI, 1.7 to 3.3]; P < 0.001). Patients with renal failure received adjunctive and reperfusion therapies less frequently than those with normal renal function (P < 0.001). Postdischarge death was less likely in patients who received acute reperfusion therapy (odds ratio, 0.7 [CI, 0.6 to 0.9]), aspirin (odds ratio, 0.7 [CI, 0.5 to 0.8]), and beta-blocker therapy (odds ratio, 0.7 [CI, 0.6 to 0.9]).

Conclusion

Patients with renal failure are at increased risk for death after acute MI and receive less aggressive treatment than patients with normal renal function.

### Temporal trends in utilization of cardiac therapies and outcomes for Myocardial infarction by degree of chronic kidney disease: a Report from the NCDR chest pain-MI registry [^8c012877]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Aspirin and β‐blockers after MI have been shown to improve outcomes in patients with underlying kidney disease. 3, 27 In a meta‐analysis of 27 139 patients with CKD who participated in 50 randomized trials of antiplatelet agents (mostly aspirin), antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced the incidence of fatal or nonfatal MI compared with either placebo or no therapy. Antiplatelet therapy had no effect on mortality or stroke, and increased rates of major bleeding. 28 Post hoc and meta‐analyses have noted improvements in cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy in patients with mild to moderate renal dysfunction, with attenuated or no effects in patients with ESRD on dialysis. 29, 30, 31 Consistent reductions in ischemic end points have been noted with potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors ticagrelor and prasugrel compared with clopidogrel among PCI‐treated acute coronary syndrome patients with CKD, 14, 32 with no increase in major or fatal bleeding observed with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel among patients with CKD. Although controlled data for evidence‐based MI therapies has grown for patients with mild to moderate CKD, dialysis patients remain understudied. Nevertheless, the National Kidney Foundation guidelines recommend that all dialysis patients presenting with acute MI should be treated as nondialysis patients, with the exception of specific attention to drugs that have altered clearances in kidney failure. 33.

### Chronic kidney disease and acute myocardial infarction: the story after 1 year [^74055c1c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

The results are somewhat contradictory to what has been reported previously. In the American Heart Journal article "The prognostic importance of worsening renal function during an acute myocardial infarction on long‐term mortality" by Amin and colleagues, 6 worsening renal function was found to be independently associated with an adverse long‐term prognosis. These patients were followed for 4 years and they followed patients with worsening of renal failure during the acute event. Worsening of renal failure was found to be independently associated with a higher risk of death.

In the study by Navarro, CKD does not seem to impact the ultimate quality of life 1 year removed from the myocardial infarction. Specifically, angina was not more frequent in the CKD patients, mental functioning was similar regardless of whether CKD existed, and the difference in physical functioning was not statistically significant. 3

In the studied cohort, there is some positive data regarding CKD patients 1 year removed from their myocardial infarction. The study is important clinically because these patients should not be denied such proven interventions as cardiac rehabilitation, cardiac support groups, and dietary counseling. The CKD patient now should not be considered "too sick" to benefit from these critical interventions. The authors are to be applauded for changing, we hope, how the patient with CKD is approached post myocardial infarction!

Now for the bad news. Why would this patient cohort have lower discharge medication rates of aspirin, statin medications, and angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors? Previous studies have shown the underuse of guideline‐directed therapy in the CKD patient 7, 8; sadly, this was confirmed. The concern of the elevated creatinine being caused by the acute event comes into play again. Physicians may be hesitant to start the angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor if they perceive the renal injury is acute. The high‐dose statin is recommended for secondary prevention with no caveat regarding CKD. In a meta‐analysis by Nikolic, 9 a conclusion was proposed that statins may actually be protective to the renal function in CKD patients not receiving dialysis, but the benefit seemed to depend on duration of treatment. Finally, the lack of use of aspirin is truly a bewilderment. Platelet dysfunction in the uremic patient is a well‐known clinical syndrome but should not be a contributor to the lack of aspirin use in a post–myocardial infarction patient. Many of these patients should actually be taking dual antiplatelet therapy with no contraindications in the CKD patients. 10 To all who read this, medical students, residents, fellows, and attending physicians, the message is clear. Follow the guidelines! 1

### The new biology of diabetic kidney disease-mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^558d1e38]. Endocrine Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Diabetic kidney disease remains the most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the world. Despite reductions in incidence rates of myocardial infarction and stroke in people with diabetes over the past 3 decades, the risk of diabetic kidney disease has remained unchanged, and may even be increasing in younger individuals afflicted with this disease. Accordingly, changes in public health policy have to be implemented to address the root causes of diabetic kidney disease, including the rise of obesity and diabetes, in addition to the use of safe and effective pharmacological agents to prevent cardiorenal complications in people with diabetes. The aim of this article is to review the mechanisms of pathogenesis and therapies that are either in clinical practice or that are emerging in clinical development programs for potential use to treat diabetic kidney disease.

### Preferences of patients with chronic kidney disease for invasive versus conservative treatment of acute coronary syndrome: a Discrete choice experiment [^53c1603d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Latent Class Analysis

Latent class analysis with 2 subgroups of patients provided the best fit to the data based on the model fit statistics. One hundred fifteen (83%) patients had the highest probability (average probability of group membership: 97.7%) of belonging to a group that placed the most value on treatment benefit, assigning the highest importance on lower risk of death, with lower risk of ESKD being of secondary importance. However, 25 (17%) patients had the highest probability of belonging to a second group (average probability of group membership: 87.1%) that were more procedure averse, with a strong preference for conservative management, followed by high importance for minimizing the risk of AKI requiring dialysis (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Among the 25 patients in the second group, 8 showed dominated preferences with 6 choosing the option with conservative treatment in at least 7 of 8 tasks and 2 choosing the option with the lower risk of AKI requiring dialysis in 7 of 8 tasks.

Figure 2

### Management and outcomes of myocardial infarction in people with impaired kidney function in england [^81b5fef4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

This study adds evidence from England to existing international research demonstrating disparities in AMI care and outcomes between those with and without reduced eGFR. Further research is needed to understand why eGFR influences receipt of AMI management and explore whether differences in AMI care represent appropriate risk stratification of people with reduced eGFR, or inequitable access to effective management. Understanding these treatment disparities will enable interventions to be appropriately allocated to optimize care and outcomes for the growing global CKD population.

### Underrepresentation of renal disease in randomized controlled trials of cardiovascular disease [^87320c6a]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Patients with renal disease are at high risk for cardiovascular mortality. Determining which interventions best offset this risk remains a health priority.

Objective

To quantify the representation of patients with renal disease in randomized controlled trials for interventions proven efficacious for cardiovascular disease.

Data Sources

We searched MEDLINE for trials published from 1985 through 2005 in 11 major medical and subspecialty journals.

Study Selection

Randomized controlled trials for chronic congestive heart failure and acute myocardial infarction of treatments that are currently listed as class I or II recommendations in the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines were included.

Data Extraction

Two reviewers independently abstracted data on study and patient characteristics, renal measurements, outcomes, and prognostic features.

Data Synthesis

A total of 153 trials were reviewed. Patients with renal disease were reported as excluded in 86 (56%) trials. Patients with renal disease were more likely to be excluded from trials that were multicenter; of moderate enrollment size; North American; that tested renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system antagonists and anticoagulants; and that tested chronic congestive heart failure. Only 8 (5%) original articles reported the proportion of enrolled patients with renal disease, and only 15 (10%) reported mean baseline renal function. While 81 (53%) trials performed subgroup analyses of some baseline characteristic in the original article, only 4 (3%) subgroup analyses of treatment stratified by renal disease were performed.

Conclusion

Major cardiovascular disease trials frequently exclude patients with renal disease and do not provide adequate information on the renal function of enrollees or the effect of interventions on patients with renal disease.

### Effects of antiplatelet therapy on mortality and cardiovascular and bleeding outcomes in persons with chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^9e2e2dcc]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are used to prevent cardiovascular events; however, treatment effects may differ in persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD) because atherosclerotic disease is less prevalent, whereas bleeding hazards may be increased in this population.

Purpose

To summarize the effects of antiplatelet treatment on cardiovascular events, mortality, and bleeding in persons with CKD.

Data Sources

Embase and Cochrane databases through November 2011 without language restriction.

Study Selection

Randomized trials that included adults with CKD and compared antiplatelet agents with standard care, placebo, or no treatment.

Data Extraction

Data for populations, interventions, outcomes, and risk for bias were extracted. Quality of evidence for treatment effects on myocardial infarction, death, and bleeding was summarized by using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation guidelines.

Data Synthesis

Nine trials (all post hoc subgroup analyses for CKD) involving 9969 persons who had acute coronary syndromes or were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and 31 trials involving 11,701 persons with stable or no cardiovascular disease were identified. Low-quality evidence has found that in persons with acute coronary syndromes, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors or clopidogrel plus standard care compared with standard care alone had little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or on myocardial infarction but increased serious bleeding. Compared with placebo or no treatment in persons with stable or no cardiovascular disease, antiplatelet agents prevented myocardial infarction but had uncertain effects on mortality and increased minor bleeding according to generally low-quality evidence.

Limitations

Data for antiplatelet agents in persons with CKD are frequently derived from post hoc analyses of trials of broader populations. Definitions for bleeding outcomes and trial duration were heterogeneous.

Conclusion

Benefits for antiplatelet therapy among persons with CKD are uncertain and are potentially outweighed by bleeding hazards.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Case report: full recovery from dialysis-requiring renal failure after surgical repair of a completely occluded renal artery in a patient with a single kidney [^ee0218c0]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our case highlights the compensatory role of collateral vasculature in acute renal infarction. Despite the complete occlusion of the bypass, collateral vasculature sustained renal tissue viability for two weeks. These findings suggest that collateral development may occur beyond the context of atherosclerotic artery disease and should be carefully evaluated during the work-up of acute renal infarction cases, as it may extend the therapeutic window for successful intervention.

### Management of non-ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction in patients with chronic kidney disease (from the Korea acute myocardial infarction registry) [^ef9c2d46]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to compare clinical outcomes among early invasive (EI), deferred invasive (DI), and conservative strategies in patients with acute non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). High-risk patients with NSTEMI are believed to fare better with an EI strategy, but the optimal treatment for patients with NSTEMI and CKD is not known. In total 5,185 patients with acute NSTEMI were enrolled from the Korea Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry and followed for 1 year. Patients were divided into EI, DI, and conservative treatment groups and classified into 4 stages using references from the National Kidney Foundation. The invasive EI and DI groups were compared to the conservative groups, and the EI and DI groups were compared according to each renal function stage. At 1-year follow-up, mortality rates in the conservative group were significantly higher than in the invasive groups except for the severe CKD group. The benefit of the EI over the DI strategy, although there were no significant differences between the 2 groups, tended to decrease as renal function decreased. In conclusion, in the management of NSTEMI, an invasive strategy decreased mortality compared to a conservative strategy except for severe CKD. In the timing of an invasive strategy, the EI strategy was observed to be superior to the DI strategy in patients with mild CKD; however, this tendency reversed as renal function decreased. When patients with NSTEMI have severe CKD, a conservative or DI strategy with prescription of cardioprotective medications and prevention of further deterioration in renal function should be considered.

### Antiplatelet agents for chronic kidney disease [^cc8dd10c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet agents are widely used to prevent cardiovascular events. The risks and benefits of antiplatelet treatment may be different in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for whom occlusive atherosclerotic events are less prevalent, and bleeding hazards might be increased.

Objectives

To summarise the effects of antiplatelet treatment (antiplatelet agent versus control or other antiplatelet agent) for the prevention of cardiovascular and adverse kidney outcomes in individuals with CKD.

Search Methods

In January 2011 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

We selected randomised controlled trials of any antiplatelet treatment versus placebo or no treatment, or direct head-to-head antiplatelet agent studies in people with CKD. Studies were included if they enrolled participants with CKD, or included people in broader at-risk populations in which data for subgroups with CKD could be disaggregated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from primary study reports and any available supplementary information for study population, interventions, outcomes, and risks of bias. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from numbers of events and numbers of participants at risk which were extracted from each included study. The reported RRs were extracted where crude event rates were not provided. Data was pooled using the random-effects model.

Main Results

We included 50 studies, enrolling 27,139 participants; 44 studies (21,460 participants) compared an antiplatelet agent with placebo or no treatment, and six studies (5679 participants) directly compared one antiplatelet agent with another. Compared to placebo or no treatment, antiplatelet agents reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (17 studies; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.99), but not all-cause mortality (30 studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.06), cardiovascular mortality (19 studies; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.12) or stroke (11 studies; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.72). Antiplatelet agents increased the risk of major (27 studies; RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.65) and minor bleeding (18 studies; RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.97). In terms of dialysis access outcomes, antiplatelet agents reduced access thrombosis or patency failure but had no effect on suitability for dialysis. Meta-regression analysis indicated no differences in the relative benefit or harms of treatment (risk of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or major bleeding) by type of antiplatelet agent or stage of CKD. Limited data were available for direct head-to-head comparisons of antiplatelet drugs, treatment in kidney transplant recipients, primary prevention, or risk of ESKD.

Authors' Conclusions

Antiplatelet agents reduce myocardial infarction but increase major bleeding. Risks may outweigh harms among people with low annual risks of cardiovascular events, including those with early stages of CKD who do not have clinically-evident occlusive cardiovascular disease.

### Renal function and its time-sensitive influence on survival rates of acute myocardial infarction [^8d62f374]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

In patients with AMI with severe CKD, the proactive revascularization without concern for worsening renal function, even with the aggressive use of mechanical support, may potentially improve short‐term clinical outcomes. However, the proactive revascularization during the acute phase appears to eventually have no substantial effect on long‐term survival rates. This distinction suggests that while such support can be critical for managing acute hemodynamic status in AMI and patients with CKD, its benefits do not alter the overall progression of underlying chronic conditions. Therefore, although temporary mechanical support is valuable for immediate patient stabilization, it should not be viewed as a solution for long‐term disease management. This insight is essential for guiding clinical decision‐making, emphasizing the necessity for further investigative trials to explore additional therapeutic options that may enhance long‐term survival and quality of life.

### Chemotherapy-related complications in the kidneys and collecting system: an imaging perspective [^40fb633b]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Renal infarction

Renal infarction presents with persistent pain often resistant to analgesia, nausea and vomiting, proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. In the literature, it has been reported with use of methotrexate and combination regimens of cisplatin and gemcitabine. In a case series with 44 patients with long-term follow-up for renal infarction, 61% of patients regained normal renal function while the remaining patients alive at follow-up had progressed to irreversible kidney dysfunction.

Imaging findings

Urography findings for renal infarction vary according to the severity. Small infarcts often present with normal urograms. With more severe lesions, there can be an absence of contrast material in the ischemic renal parenchyma with local failure of calyceal filling of the affected tissue during the pyelographic phase. Renal infarction may also result in vasospasm which presents as complete nonvisualization of the kidney. On US, acute renal infarcts may be non-specific in appearance, with heterogeneity of the parenchyma. Chronic infarcts may be wedge shaped and hypoechoic with cortical scarring. On CT, renal infarcts appear as low attenuation, wedge shaped areas in the cortex (Fig. 5a, b). Sometimes the "rim sign" is present, which is a higher-attenuation subcapsular rim surrounding lower-attenuation infarcted renal parenchyma representing subcapsular perfusion through collateral flow. However, as the "rim sign" is a universal and highly specific indicator of renovascular compromise, it can also be present in acute tubular necrosis and renal vein thrombosis. Hydronephrosis similarly is characterized by a "rim sign"; however, this rim sign can be distinguished from that of vascular compromise by its variable thickness, medial concavity, and location surrounding the dilated calices in communication with the central pelvis.

This study sought to investigate whether ACEI/ARB treatment after AMI is associated with better outcomes across different risk profiles, including the entire spectrum of estimated glomerular filtration rates.

Methods

This study evaluated discharge and continuous follow-up data on ACEI/ARB use among AMI survivors (2006 to 2009) included in a large Swedish registry. The association between ACEI/ARB treatment and outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury [AKI]) was studied using Cox proportional hazards models (intention-to-treat and as treated).

Results

In total, 45,697 patients (71%) were treated with ACEI/ARB. The 3-year mortality was 19.8% (17.4% of ACEI/ARB users and 25.4% of nonusers). In adjusted analysis, significantly better survival was observed for patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3-year hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.83). The survival benefit was consistent through all kidney function strata, including dialysis patients. Overall, those treated with ACEI/ARB also had lower 3-year risk for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 0.95), whereas treatment had no significant effect on stroke risk. The crude risk for AKI was in general low (2.5% and 2.0% for treated and nontreated, respectively) and similar across estimated glomerular filtration rate categories but was significantly higher with ACEI/ARB treatment. However, the composite outcome of AKI and mortality favored ACEI/ARB treatment.

Conclusions

Treatment with ACEI/ARB after AMI was associated with improved long-term survival, regardless of underlying renal function, and was accompanied by low rates of adverse renal events.

### The effect of carvacrol on kidney injury caused by isopreterenol-induced myocardial infarction [^7bc531c5]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ischemic heart diseases are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality both in our country and globally every year. Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to heart failure due to the inability to supply enough blood to the periphery and meet the oxygen demands of the heart tissue. Today, although interventional cardiology techniques and pharmacological treatments have been developed to reduce the risk of MI, morbidity and mortality rates due to MI remain high due to the limitations of current treatment methods. Therefore, the development of new approaches to the prevention and effective treatment of MI is urgently needed.

Different organs of the body maintain healthy physiological balance by working together. Interactions between organs are essential elements for the healthy physiological functioning of the body; pathological damage to one organ can lead to acute or chronic dysfunction of another organ. The heart and kidney mutually influence each other through various hemodynamic and non-hemodynamic pathways necessary for the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Physiological dysfunction between the heart and kidney has been described as cardiorenal syndrome (CRS). It is not well known how the pathophysiological mechanisms between kidney failure and heart failure affect each other, many of which may contribute to a vicious cyclic heart/kidney cycle. In this case, hypotension and renal hypoperfusion due to falling cardiac output lead to increased sympathetic activity. In addition, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and arginine-vasopressin increase the release of peripheral vasoconstriction, organ conjugation and increase the workload of the heart again. One of the complications of having undergone MI is heart failure. Therefore, a better understanding of the changes that occur in kidney function after MI is of great importance in terms of identifying new therapeutic targets that will improve the prognosis of the disease.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and antiplatelet therapy — among people with CKD included in antiplatelet trials, a Cochrane collaboration meta-analysis of 40,597 in antiplatelet versus placebo trials and 11,805 in antiplatelet agent comparison trials found that allocation to antiplatelet therapy may reduce the RR of myocardial infarction by approximately 12% (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79–0.99), with an expected increased risk of major bleeding.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1098d3e5]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — stable stress-test confirmed ischemic heart disease initial management states that intensive medical therapy is a suitable initial strategy. This recommendation should not apply to those with severe angina symptoms, left ventricular dysfunction (e.g., ejection fraction < 35%), or left main stem disease. Comparisons between aggressive medical therapy alone and invasive interventions do not support invasive strategies to reduce death or prevent myocardial infarction, although those with frequent angina symptoms (at least weekly) gained improvement with the invasive strategy. Although antianginal benefits of an invasive strategy are apparent in the general populations, people with symptoms may still elect for an initially invasive approach after being counseled about the risks, and invasive strategies will have higher cost implications to healthcare systems, people with CKD, or both.

### Acute kidney injury: diagnosis and management… [^a2786cb5]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

FLUID RESUSCITATION An assessment of volume status and hemodynamic stability is a key component in the management of patients with acute kidney injury because fluid overload is associated with increased mortality. 25 Consequently, a delicate balance exists between optimizing renal perfusion and avoiding fluid overload. 26 If fluid resuscitation is indicated, isotonic crystalloids are recommended over colloids as the initial therapy. 30 Subsequently, two trials comparing balanced crystalloids with 0. 9% sodium chloride demonstrated improved composite renal outcomes in the balanced crystalloid group for both critically ill patients and non– critically ill patients. 31, 32.

If metabolic derangements from acute kidney injury do not respond to conservative treatment, renal replacement therapy, in consultation with a nephrologist, may be required. Table 7 includes indications for initiating renal replacement therapy. 7, 35–37 A multicenter RCT of 488 patients with acute kidney injury and septic shock compared early initiation of renal replacement therapy with delayed initiation and found no difference in 90-day mortality.
38. FOLLOW-UP The transition from the hospital to the outpatient setting presents an opportunity to improve the care of patients with acute kidney injury. Follow-up three months after hospitalization is reasonable if renal function is recovered, with earlier follow-up intervals for patients with a slower recovery. 49 Sodium bicarbonate–based intravenous fluids are not superior to normal saline in preventing acute kidney injury.

50 A meta-analysis of 15 RCTs showed that in patients undergoing coronary angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention, high-dose statins reduced the incidence of contrast media–induced acute kidney injury when compared with low-dose statins or placebo.

### Management and outcomes of myocardial infarction in people with impaired kidney function in england [^ca4681d8]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) causes significant mortality and morbidity in people with impaired kidney function. Previous observational research has demonstrated reduced use of invasive management strategies and inferior outcomes in this population. Studies from the USA have suggested that disparities in care have reduced over time. It is unclear whether these findings extend to Europe and the UK.

Methods

Linked data from four national healthcare datasets were used to investigate management and outcomes of AMI by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) category in England. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models compared management strategies and outcomes by eGFR category among people with kidney impairment hospitalised for AMI between 2015–2017.

Results

In a cohort of 5 835 people, we found reduced odds of invasive management in people with eGFR < 60mls/min/1.73m 2 compared with people with eGFR ≥ 60 when hospitalised for non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI). The association between eGFR and odds of invasive management for ST-elevation MI (STEMI) varied depending on the availability of percutaneous coronary intervention. A graded association between mortality and eGFR category was demonstrated both in-hospital and after discharge for all people.

Conclusions

In England, patients with reduced eGFR are less likely to receive invasive management compared to those with preserved eGFR. Disparities in care may however be decreasing over time, with the least difference seen in patients with STEMI managed via the primary percutaneous coronary intervention pathway. Reduced eGFR continues to be associated with worse outcomes after AMI.

### 2011 ACCF / AHA focused update of the guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina / non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (updating the 2007 guideline): highlights for the clinician [^be7eebfe]. Clinical Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

The 2011 Update to the Unstable Angina/Non-ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (UA/NSTEMI) Guideline is based in evolving data or expert opinion and incorporates information from late-breaking clinical trials presented at the 2008–2009 Scientific Sessions of the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the European Society of Cardiology, among others, as well as selected data through April 2010. The 5 key issues highlighted in this summary are: (1) the timing of acute interventional therapy in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction; (2) emphasis on the timing, duration, and application of dual and triple antiplatelet therapy; (3) specific recommendations for patients with diabetes mellitus; (4) the role and potential benefit of invasive therapy in patients with advanced renal dysfunction; and (5) issues of quality improvement for acute coronary syndromes.

### Suboptimal medical care of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and renal insufficiency: results from the Korea acute myocardial infarction registry [^c1b799c0]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is the leading cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The severity of renal insufficiency, including mild to moderate renal insufficiency is directly associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Several factors may be related to poorer outcomes of ACS in patients with renal insufficiency. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM) are common among patients with renal insufficiency and are often inadequately treated in this population. In addition, the accumulation of uremic toxins can stimulate oxidative stress and inflammation, and hence, contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis progression.

Primary management in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) includes timely restoration of flow in the stenosed artery — either by fibrinolysis or by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — to limit the extent of infarction in the myocardium. In addition, medications (anti-platelet agent, β-blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker [ARB] and statin) form an important component of evidence-based management. These management strategies have contributed to improved survival in patients with STEMI. However, only a few studies have evaluated how renal function affects the likelihood of receiving optimal medical care throughout the entire treatment period in patients with STEMI.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether renal insufficiency is associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving optimal medical care in patients with STEMI. The entire medical treatment process for patients with STEMI was comprehensively analyzed, and the relationship between optimal management and clinical outcomes in patients with renal insufficiency was investigated.

### Incidence and risk factors for new and recurrent infarcts in adults with sickle cell disease [^618c9960]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

While hypertension was a risk factor for infarct progression in SCD, the measured blood pressure at baseline did not differ between those with and without infarcts. The retrospective nature of this study did not allow for serial, standardized BP measurements. Thus, a diagnosis of hypertension was accepted when coded in the medical chart. However, not all participants identified as having hypertension had an antihypertensive drug on their medication list. BPs are generally believed to be lower in SCD than in the non‐SCD population, and our data support this with relatively low measured baseline BP values. Future studies could help develop BP treatment guidelines in SCD to determine whether hypertension treatment prevents stroke and SCI. All 9 participants with chronic kidney disease had an SCI at study entry; the most likely mechanism of SCI in this scenario is relative hypertension. In SCD, hypertension has been associated with SCI but compared with the general population, BPs in SCD are lower. Thus, hypertension may go unrecognized or be attributed to pain; as a result, treatment may be delayed. Another possible mechanism for infarcts related to chronic kidney disease is more substantial anemia related to the combination of SCD and kidney disease. Our sample size is not large enough to assess whether hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and other risk factors interact to hasten SCI progression, but attention to screening and treatment is warranted.

The rate of new cerebral infarcts in our study, 11.95 events per 100 patient‐years for adults with SCI at baseline versus 3.74 per 100 patient‐years for those without SCI at baseline, is consistent with prior studies and emphasizes that stroke prevention studies and new treatments are needed for adults with SCD, particularly those with SCI. The lack of a treatment effect for participants on transfusion compared with hydroxyurea was interesting. In children with sickle cell anemia and SCI, the incidence of progressive infarcts is 4.8 per 100 person‐years if untreated,2.9 per 100 patient years when treated with hydroxyurea, and 2.0 per 100 person‐years when treated with regular blood transfusions. Small sample size and the observational nature of the study must be taken into consideration. Treatments were reported, but compliance was not monitored closely as part of the study. Additionally, our study spanned the COVID‐19 pandemic when regular transfusions were challenging to complete, and some patients with SCD on transfusion were started on low‐dose hydroxyurea to allow for longer time frames between transfusions.

### Blood pressure and renal outcomes in patients with kidney infarction and hypertension [^e323a257]. Journal of Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the causes and frequency of kidney infarction associated with hypertension, and the blood pressure and renal function outcomes.

Methods

We analyzed the records of patients with kidney infarction documented by angiography and referred to a hypertension unit.

Results

Spontaneous kidney infarction was documented in 55 of 18,287 patients and was associated with renal artery disease in 41 cases. Twenty-five patients had a longstanding history of hypertension at referral, and 30 patients presented with acute hypertension. Patients with acute hypertension were more likely to report a history of lumbar pain and to develop malignant hypertension than patients with longstanding hypertension; they also had higher plasma renin concentrations. Data for long-term follow-up after referral were available for 36 patients, including 15 patients who underwent surgery or renal artery angioplasty. From referral to most recent follow-up, the blood pressure decreased from 176/111 to 143/89 mmHg in patients with longstanding hypertension, and from 183/111 to 127/80 mmHg in those with acute hypertension (P = 0.007/0.041 for between-group differences). Three patients with acute hypertension had normal blood pressure without treatment at follow-up. Patients with long-term follow-up displayed no change in the glomerular filtration rate.

Conclusion

Kidney infarction is a rare cause of hypertension, usually associated with renal artery lesions. In cases of kidney infarction with acute hypertension, the blood pressure outcome is favorable following intervention and/or medication, and hypertension may resolve spontaneously.

### Cocaine-induced renal infarction: report of a case and review of the literature [^1b832c0d]. BMC Nephrology (2005). Low credibility.

Various imaging techniques including CT scan, Magnetic Resonant Imaging (MRI), angiography, Ultrasound and Nuclear Scintigraphy Scans have been used to make the diagnosis. However, MRI, angiography and nuclear scintigraphy are expensive, system-specific and time-consuming, and they may not be readily available at all institutions. Ultrasound lacks sensitivity and specificity for renal infarction. Therefore, CT scan has been recommended for the diagnosis of this challenging disease. CT scan, however, becomes less reliable when the infarct is global and there is loss of viable cortical rim, or when the infarct simulates a tumefactive process.

There is no consensus on the treatment of renal infarction due to cocaine use. Prior treatment modalities in the literature range from no treatment to anticoagulation, thrombolytic use, aspirin therapy and surgical nephrectomy. Given that no evidence of underlying coagulopathy or thromboembolic events were identified in our patient, we opted to conservatively manage him with supportive therapy and pain management. He was successfully discharged on hospital day six with a serum creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (106.1 umol/L).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^7ca81772]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — lipid management in adults: In adults aged ≥ 50 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a–G5), we recommend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A), and in adults aged ≥ 50 years with CKD and eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (GFR categories G1–G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B). In adults aged 18–49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the following (2A): known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), diabetes mellitus, prior ischemic stroke, or estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction > 10%. Practice points include: estimate 10-year cardiovascular risk using a validated risk tool; in people with CKD, choose statin-based regimens to maximize the absolute reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to achieve the largest treatment benefits; in adults with CKD aged 18–49, a lower (i.e., < 10%) estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction may also be appropriate thresholds for initiation of statin-based therapy; consider prescribing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors to people with CKD who have an indication for their use; and consider a plant-based "Mediterranean-style" diet in addition to lipid-modifying therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.

### Renal arteriography with endovascular ultrasound for the management of renal infarction patients [^08a29af2]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study is the first to suggest the usefulness of renal artery invasive exploration to complete the etiological investigation in patients with RI. This strategy, including renal artery angiography with/without IVUS, appears to be safe, improves the diagnosis process and efficiently guides the secondary prevention treatment in order to reduce thromboembolic recurrence, which is the main cause of mortality after RI. Considering the rarity of this disease, multicentric randomized studies are necessary to advocate the hypothesis that invasive exploration of renal artery can improve long-term prognosis.

### The impact of renal dysfunction on outcomes in the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial [^d8b27d2a]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

The ExTRACT-TIMI 25 (Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 25) trial provided the opportunity to evaluate the impact of renal dysfunction on outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and compare enoxaparin (ENOX) and unfractionated heparin (UFH).

Background

It is unclear how renal dysfunction influences the balance between benefit and risk of antithrombotic therapy.

Methods

In the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial, 20,479 patients were randomized to UFH or ENOX. A reduced ENOX dose was administered to patients age ≥ 75 years and those with an estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 ml/min.

Results

A powerful relationship was observed between the severity of renal dysfunction (per 10 ml/min decrement in CrCl) and death, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and major and minor bleeding (p < 0.001 for each). There was a progressive increase in the treatment benefit with ENOX on death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (p < 0.01) with better renal function. Net clinical benefit (death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal major bleeding) was significantly superior with ENOX (p < 0.001) for patients with a CrCl > 60 ml/min (79.1% of the study population). Major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage did not differ for patients with preserved renal function (CrCl > 90 ml/min), but in those with renal dysfunction there was a progressively greater increase in the risk of major and minor bleeding with ENOX.

Conclusions

Enoxaparin was superior to UFH for the majority of subjects. With more severe renal dysfunction, the net clinical benefit between ENOX and UFH did not differ, despite the rise in adverse events in both treatment groups. Future studies should take renal dysfunction into account when assessing antithrombotic regimens.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^1d906a94]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — statin therapy by age and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is recommended as follows: In adults aged ≥ 50 years with eGFR < 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and not on chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation (GFR categories G3a–G5), we recommend treatment with a statin or statin/ezetimibe combination (1A); in adults aged ≥ 50 years with CKD and eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (GFR categories G1–G2), we recommend treatment with a statin (1B); and in adults aged 18–49 years with CKD but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation, we suggest statin treatment in people with one or more of the following (2A): known coronary disease (myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization), diabetes mellitus, prior ischemic stroke, or an estimated 10-year incidence of coronary death or nonfatal myocardial infarction > 10%.

### Effects of ischaemic conditioning on major clinical outcomes in people undergoing invasive procedures: systematic review and meta-analysis [^87c890d4]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review examined the effects of ischaemic conditioning on clinical outcomes in the many settings in which it has been studied. Ischaemic conditioning had no effect on mortality. Suggestions of benefit were identified for the outcomes of stroke and acute kidney injury. Doubt remains, however, about the clinical validity of these results, arising from the incongruous lack of benefit seen for the better powered combined cardiovascular events endpoint, the restriction of benefit for acute kidney injury to mild cases, and the restriction of the stroke and acute kidney injury effects to non-operative settings. In addition, few large studies have been conducted, the follow-up of participants was generally short, and the findings were only moderately precise, suggesting that insufficient evidence exists to recommend that ischaemic conditioning should be used routinely and that guideline support for the intervention may be premature.

Implications of findings

These results are novel in the aggregation of data from many clinical settings, but the importance of this approach is seen in the effective ruling out of the possibility of a detectable mortality benefit from ischaemic conditioning. In addition, it highlights the remaining uncertainty about the potential benefit for the outcomes of myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury, such that these outcomes clearly need to be the focus of future work. The ongoing 61 recruiting trials of ischaemic conditioning registered on the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform will increase the number of study participants by 4270 if completed as planned. Our trial sequential analysis shows that, assuming these ongoing trials record the same event rates as the published trials, they will recruit only two thirds of the additional participants needed to provide future meta-analyses with the power to confirm the benefit observed for acute kidney injury and an even smaller proportion of the number required to confirm a benefit for stroke or myocardial infarction.

### Kidney replacement therapy: trends in incidence, treatment, and outcomes of myocardial infarction and stroke in a nationwide Scottish study [^ed9addcd]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

An additional exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of new treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy following incident myocardial infarction. To overcome the influence of immortal time bias introduced by the use of community prescription records, exposure to dual antiplatelet therapy was included in the multivariable Cox regression model as a time-dependent covariate, with exposure occurring only after the first community prescription was dispensed. In brief, immortal time bias occurs due to the erroneous misclassification of exposure status when estimating the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. In the current study, we compared the hazard of experiencing cardiovascular death following incident myocardial infarction in those with kidney failure who received new treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy vs. those who did not (the primary exposure). Confounders were specified a priori and included age, sex, social deprivation status (SIMD quintile), comorbidities (prior heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke), primary kidney disease diagnosis, KRT modality at the time of the event, and concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitors/ARBs, beta-blockers, and statins post-discharge. All statistical analysis was performed in R, Version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Study approvals

The study was performed in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki. The NHS Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care and the Scottish Renal Registry steering committee independently approved the study and access to the data (Reference: 1819–0323). We did not seek individual patient consent as the study utilized fully anonymized data. Patient-level data can be requested following direct application to the NHS Public Health Scotland team.

### Crystal clots as therapeutic target in cholesterol crystal embolism [^12ce3e66]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Cholesterol crystal embolism can be a life-threatening complication of advanced atherosclerosis. Pathophysiology and molecular targets for treatment are largely unknown.

Objective

We aimed to develop a new animal model of cholesterol crystal embolism to dissect the molecular mechanisms of cholesterol crystal (CC)-driven arterial occlusion, tissue infarction, and organ failure.

Methods and Results

C57BL/6J mice were injected with CC into the left kidney artery. Primary end point was glomerular filtration rate (GFR). CC caused crystal clots occluding intrarenal arteries and a dose-dependent drop in GFR, followed by GFR recovery within 4 weeks, that is, acute kidney disease. In contrast, the extent of kidney infarction was more variable. Blocking necroptosis using mixed lineage kinase domain-like deficient mice or necrostatin-1s treatment protected from kidney infarction but not from GFR loss because arterial obstructions persisted, identifying crystal clots as a primary target to prevent organ failure. CC involved platelets, neutrophils, fibrin, and extracellular DNA. Neutrophil depletion or inhibition of the release of neutrophil extracellular traps had little effects, but platelet P2Y12 receptor antagonism with clopidogrel, fibrinolysis with urokinase, or DNA digestion with recombinant DNase I all prevented arterial occlusions, GFR loss, and kidney infarction. The window-of-opportunity was < 3 hours after CC injection. However, combining Nec-1s (necrostatin-1s) prophylaxis given 1 hour before and DNase I 3 hours after CC injection completely prevented kidney failure and infarcts. In vitro, CC did not directly induce plasmatic coagulation but induced neutrophil extracellular trap formation and DNA release mainly from kidney endothelial cells, neutrophils, and few from platelets. CC induced ATP release from aggregating platelets, which increased fibrin formation in a DNase-dependent manner.

Conclusions

CC embolism causes arterial obstructions and organ failure via the formation of crystal clots with fibrin, platelets, and extracellular DNA as critical components. Therefore, our model enables to unravel the pathogenesis of the CC embolism syndrome as a basis for both prophylaxis and targeted therapy.

### Angiogenesis in the kidney: a new therapeutic target? [^f05f0255]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The prevalence of chronic kidney disease has been growing consistently for the past decades. Renal failure is often associated with defective angiogenesis, and recognition of the contribution of the renal microcirculation to the progression of chronic renal disease may aid in the development of therapeutic interventions.

Recent Findings

Intra-renal proliferation, remodeling, and/or rarefaction of microvessels in response to injury can all aggravate nephron damage, and experimental evidence suggests that they may constitute the early steps in the complex pathways involved in progressive renal injury. Recent studies showed the benefits of targeted interventions deemed to promote neovascularization (e.g. progenitor cells, growth factors) on the ischemic myocardium and brain and in a few models of renal disease.

Summary

Evidence of aberrant renal microvascular architecture in various forms of renal disease provides the impetus to attempt modulating the renal microcirculation to interfere with the disease process. Targeted interventions to preserve the renal microcirculation may not only decrease the evolving injury in renal vascular disease but also potentially constitute a coadjuvant intervention to become part of a comprehensive management plan to improve the success of parallel strategies to preserve renal function, such as revascularization.

### Successful rescue from kidney failure with delayed catheter-directed intervention after catastrophic bilateral kidney paradoxical thromboembolism [^b6efbb4d]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Bilateral renal artery occlusion can lead to permanent kidney failure. Open surgical thrombo-embolectomy has largely been replaced by percutaneous endovascular treatment as it is associated with lower morbidity, mortality and recovery time. To our knowledge, surgery has not been first-line treatment for renal artery thromboembolism since the 1980s, and it is not superior to endovascular treatment for the salvage of renal function. The window for reperfusion with intra-arterial thrombolysis and thromboaspiration has traditionally been considered to be small. Previous case reports of successful catheter-directed thromboaspiration after an acute renal artery occlusion had usually performed them within 12–24 hours from the onset of pain. However, these procedures are not commonly performed due to the uncommon occurrence of renal artery occlusion, so there is insufficient data to adequately define the treatment time window. Our case demonstrated a benefit of endovascular reperfusion even after a significant delay of 88 hours from the onset of pain. The success rate of endovascular treatment is unknown due to selection bias, publication bias and heterogeneity between cases. In a case series, 33 of 94 patients with acute renal infarction underwent interventional angiography following initial CT diagnosis, but only five patients were deemed suitable for curative treatment. Of these, four patients demonstrated improved renal function while one patient with bilateral involvement failed treatment and remained dialysis dependent. However, the timing of the procedures relative to the onset of symptoms was not reported.

Patient's perspective

Hi, I'm [anonymised], the Drs at [anonymised] have requested me to write a few lines about what happened to me and how I lost my kidney function pretty much overnight.

After much procrastination I decided to have a septoplasty and rhinoplasty operation. The operation was a success but 2 days later, I started having severe abdominal cramps and pain, and ended up in hospital. With all the pain meds the hospital was giving me, I was still in a lot of pain. The surgical team did several scans and tests but couldn't find the cause of the pain. I was becoming increasingly ill, the hospital at [anonymised] decided to transfer me to [anonymised].

Contrast enhanced axial CT demonstrates retroperitoneal haematoma associated with a ruptured right kidney and evidence of active contrast extravasaion (arrow). b) Selective catheterisation of the right kidney showed a bleeding focus in the upper pole. c) The branch to the upper pole was selectively catheterised and embolised using a single platinum coil (arrow). Post procedure renal arteriogram demonstrated cessation of haemorrhage.

In haemodynamically stable patients with vascular injury the treatment of choice is percutaneous selective embolisation which is directed to the site of injury by a previously performed CT examination. Sofocleus et al. performed selective or superselective embolisation in patients following blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma with immediate technical success in 91%. The indications were CT examination consistent with arterial injury, intraoperative findings such as haematoma with possibility for angiographically assisted renal salvage, and signs/symptoms suggestive of vascular renal injury.

Renal pedicle vascular injuries are rare and occur in 1 to 4% of renal injuries. They are usually managed surgically though patients with traumatic renal artery dissection may be treated with endovascular stent placement, made possible with early CT diagnosis. Patients with high grade injuries not involving the vascular pedicle but with CT findings consistent with active haemorrhage have been successfully managed with embolisation. A recent 10- year review of the use of intervention in renal vascular injury demonstrated a success rate of over 94% in patients undergoing angiography and embolisation as primary management (34.4% of patients). A further 23% of patients were managed conservatively and all those that required primary laparotomy did so for life-threatening haemorrhage or associated injuries.

Technical failures requiring repeat angiography and embolisation can occur in up to 9.5%, and renal abscess in up to 5%. Other rare but potential complications of renal embolisation include contrast nephropathy, renal infarction and haemorrhagic shock induced acute renal injury. With selective embolisation, the extent of a renal infarct can be significantly reduced resulting in excellent preservation of functioning renal tissue. The choice of treatment depends on the condition of the patient and their injury, and the availability of interventional services. Superselective embolisation of renal artery branches is also the treatment of choice following iatrogenic trauma to the kidney.

### Effects of ischaemic conditioning on major clinical outcomes in people undergoing invasive procedures: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1b1b8420]. BMJ (2016). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two independent investigators (LS and DH) extracted data on baseline characteristics of participants, characteristics of studies, and outcomes. Disagreements were resolved through discussions or referral to a third investigator (MJ).

The pre-specified main endpoint was all cause mortality, and other pre-specified outcomes included combined cardiovascular events (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death, or as defined by study authors), myocardial infarction, stroke, new onset arrhythmia, and acute kidney injury (including need for renal replacement therapy and transplant graft function). Because of the variation in definitions used for myocardial infarction and acute kidney injury, we analysed both according to the authors' definition and according to an accepted classification system. We classified acute kidney injury according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) system (supplementary table B) and myocardial infarction by diagnostic criteria (single biochemical or electrocardiographic criterion "myocardial injury", diagnostic criteria not reported "unspecified myocardial ischaemia", and clinical diagnosis defined as a minimum of two diagnostic criteria including biochemical, electrocardiographic, and/or clinical syndrome "myocardial infarction") in line with the principles outlined in accepted definitions.

We assessed the methodological quality of each study by using the Cochrane Bias Methods Group tool. We summarised confidence in the evidence by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system using GRADEpro GDT (supplementary table C). The GRADE system assesses risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness of study results, and publication bias (assessing each as high, moderate, low, or very low) across the body of evidence to derive an overall summary of the quality of evidence.

### Renal infarction associated with low dose intravenous immunoglobulin in a kidney transplant recipient with sepsis: a case report and literature review [^8457bea6]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

The patient survived from severe infection, but her grafted kidney was failure. Prevention is the most important because the occurrence of these side effects causes irreversible complications. To reduce the risk of thrombosis when using IVIG, it is essential to identify the risk factors. The daily use of IVIG should be limited to 400–500 mg/kg, and hydration should be considered before and after administration. The use of premedications, such as aspirin or low-molecular-weight heparin, may be considered in high-risk patients if it is not contraindicated to use them. Slow infusion is also effective in preventing thrombosis. The use of a protocol that includes hydration, premedication, and slow infusion in renal transplantation patients reduces the risk of thrombosis. Furthermore, in kidney transplant recipients prone to developing thromboembolic events, proper imaging surveillance should be considered to diagnose renal infarction during suitable times, especially if laboratory or clinical findings show any suspicious findings associated with renal infarction. Doppler ultrasonography or contrast CT should also be performed in patients with high risk of thromboembolic events rather than conventional ultrasonography or non-contrast CT due to their limitations in detecting renal blood flow.

There were inconsistent results regarding the association determined between the use of IVIG and clinical outcomes in septic patients. Although the meta-analysis using high quality trials alone did not show a significant effect on survival, the meta-analysis using all randomized trials showed a reduction in mortality. A recent trial has shown that high-dose IVIG (1.5–2.0 g/kg) is associated with favorable outcomes. Considering these, the current guidelines state that the use of IVIG in septic patients is supported by weak recommendations or weak evidence. However, the use of IVIG can be considered in septic patients who are also immunodeficient. In our study, the patient received three immunosuppressants and could not withdraw any of her medications. Although these medications preferentially work on T-cells, previous studies have shown that they can directly or indirectly attenuate humoral immunity. There were few data regarding the efficacy of IVIG in septic patients who were kidney transplant recipients; the patient would have an acquired immunodeficient status compared to the general population. Our case shows that IVIG can be considered as a possible option of treatment in septic patients.

In conclusion, infarction of transplant kidney can be caused by IVIG use in a patient with sepsis, even with low-dose administration. Transplant kidney may be more susceptible to thromboembolic events following IVIG use. Thus, when using IVIG for kidney transplant patients with high risk of thromboembolic events, we may be careful to prevent the thromboembolic events.

### 0 / 1-hour triage algorithm for myocardial infarction in patients with renal dysfunction [^082db6fb]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Editorial, see p

Clinical Perspective

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Its rapid and accurate diagnosis is critical for the initiation of effective evidence-based medical management and treatment. – In addition, its rapid and reliable rule-out has the potential to reduce the time spent in the emergency department (ED), accelerate the identification and treatment of the actual cause of chest pain, reduce patients' anxiety, and avoid substantial costs for the healthcare system.

For several reasons, patients with renal dysfunction merit particular attention. First, the incidence of AMI is increased in this vulnerable subgroup. – Second, atypical clinical presentation of AMI may be more frequent. Third, left ventricular hypertrophy is common and often results in ECG changes that may mimic or obscure AMI. Fourth, patients with renal dysfunction are more prone to adverse events related to cardiovascular medication (eg, anticoagulation) as well as cardiovascular procedures, including coronary angiography and coronary intervention. Fifth, levels of cardiac troponin (cTn) are frequently chronically elevated even in the absence of AMI. Recently, sensitive and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays (hs-cTn) were demonstrated to be accurate tools in diagnosing AMI in patients with renal dysfunction, particularly when adjusted slightly higher cutoff levels are used for clinical decision making.

The latest guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients presenting without persistent ST-segment elevation recommend the use of a 0/1-hour algorithm to rapidly rule out and rule in non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) based on hs-cTn concentrations at presentation and their absolute 1-hour changes. Assay-specific cutoff values are recommended for uniform application irrespective of renal function. High safety and efficacy of the 0/1-hour algorithm were demonstrated in unselected patients, of which the vast majority had normal renal function. It is unknown whether these results also apply to patients with renal dysfunction (RD).– Because patients with RD frequently present with increased hs-cTn concentrations even in the absence of NSTEMI, concern has been raised regarding the performance of the 0/1-hour algorithm in RD.

We therefore aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of the ESC 0/1-hour algorithm in patients with RD in a large prospective multicenter diagnostic study.

### Management of acute myocardial infarction in chronic kidney disease in Germany: an observational study [^83499fff]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt and appropriate medical intervention. The management of AMI in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) with dialysis dependency (renal replacement therapy, RRT) poses substantial challenges due to the increased risk of complications and concerns regarding adverse events associated with the use of contrast media in these patients. While contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is thought to promote progressive kidney dysfunction, a causal relationship between contrast use and increases in serum creatinine thereafter remains unproven. Evidence mounts that clinically indicated, potentially lifesaving radiographic procedures are underutilized in patients with CKD. European Guidelines acknowledge the underuse of myocardial revascularization of CKD patients and recommend a similar diagnostic or interventional approach as in non-CKD patients. Nevertheless, recent studies have revealed a persistent trend of underutilization of coronary angiography (CA) or PCI in patients with CKD or ESRD. The purpose of this study is to investigate differences in the care of CKD patients with AMI compared with patients without CKD in Germany.

### Renal infarction associated with low dose intravenous immunoglobulin in a kidney transplant recipient with sepsis: a case report and literature review [^a4544917]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Human intravenous immunoglobulin gamma (IVIG) is used to immunological and anti-inflammatory treatment. IVIG has been used in primary and secondary immunodeficiency disorders, neuromuscular, infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory disease treatment. In recent decades, the use of IVIG has been extended to the role of organ transplantation. IVIG therapy is generally considered safe, but the reported side effect rate of IVIG is 10–30%. Adverse effects include anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, renal and pulmonary complications, thrombosis/embolism, colitis, and bloodborne infectious disease. Thromboembolic events, a late and severe side effect of IVIG, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease, are life-threatening. Other thrombotic adverse events have been reported in the use of IVIG. However, renal infarction due to IVIG use has not been reported and grafted kidney infarction following use of IVIG has only been reported in one case, following desensitization in kidney transplantation. However, there are no reports about graft infarction after use of low-dose IVIG. In this report, we present a case of grafted kidney infarction after IVIG infusion in a kidney transplant patient with severe sepsis.

### Enoxaparin sodium [^c65a0049]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with enoxaparin sodium for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of enoxaparin sodium is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer enoxaparin sodium between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of enoxaparin sodium therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last enoxaparin sodium subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.3	Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

### Review of antithrombotic agents used for acute coronary syndromes in renal patients [^decb52aa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

Management issues in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) with regard to patients with renal insufficiency or failure are complex. Renal patients have a greater risk for bleeding compared with those with normal renal function because of prolonged bleeding time and platelet dysfunction. Some of the drugs used have significant renal excretion, such as the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists. Additionally, thrombolytics are underused, which contributes to the delay in instituting immediate treatment of acute myocardial infarction. Clinical data regarding the optimum management of ACSs in renal patients are still lacking. In this article, we review the available data on the use of antithrombotic agents, particularly in patients with renal impairment.

DISCUSSION

Mounting evidence reports a close link between acute cardiac diseases and AKI development and progression. The main objective of this study was to investigate the impact of NR treatment on MI‐induced AKI at an early stage post‐MI. MI was induced in male mice by ligating the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by euthanasia at either 4 or 7 days post‐MI. NR, a NAD precursor, was delivered by intraperitoneal injection (400 mg/kg of body weight per day), during a therapeutic window starting 30 minutes after infarction up to the day of euthanasia (4 and 7 days post‐MI).

Strong evidence demonstrates a crucial role of NAD + and NAD + biosynthetic and dependent enzymes in protecting against aggravated oxidative stress and cell death, mitochondrial dysfunction, and enhanced inflammatory response. In this study, we reported enhanced kidney dysfunction and morphological alterations and cell death at an early stage post‐MI. Post‐MI administration of NR, the substrate of NMRK‐2 in cardiac tissues and NMRK‐1 in the kidneys, nearly doubled kidney NAD levels, improved kidney function, decreased kidney morphological alterations, and protected against fibrosis and cell death. Because ejection fraction and cardiac output were not improved in this MI model following NR treatment for 4 and 7 days, we therefore assumed that the decrease in kidney injury could be due to a direct effect of NR on the kidneys.

### Delayed angioplasty after renal thrombosis [^3d26091e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

When renal arterial thrombosis occurs, the etiologic process plays an important role in the impact of ischemia on renal tissue. If the occlusion is caused by trauma, infarction rapidly occurs. However, when renal arterial thrombosis results from other processes, collateral vessels may develop and thus enables a prolonged ischemia without necrosis. The following is a case report of an acute renal failure caused by renal arterial thrombosis of a single functional kidney, which had a favorable outcome despite delayed treatment by percutaneous angioplasty. This report suggests that detection by ultrasonography of a venous renal flow could be of significant value to assess a collateral vascularization and thus should require an arteriography with angioplasty even after a delayed presentation.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin and the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with kidney impairment [^4e44c2fa]. Kidney International (2022). Medium credibility.

The benefit and utility of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hs-cTn) in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in patients with kidney impairment is unclear. Here, we describe implementation of hs-cTnI testing on the diagnosis, management, and outcomes of myocardial infarction in patients with and without kidney impairment. Consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome enrolled in a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized controlled trial were included in this pre-specified secondary analysis. Kidney impairment was defined as an eGFR under 60mL/min/1.73m 2. The index diagnosis and primary outcome of type 1 and type 4b myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death at one year were compared in patients with and without kidney impairment following implementation of hs-cTnI assay with 99th centile sex-specific diagnostic thresholds. Serum creatinine concentrations were available in 46,927 patients (mean age 61 years; 47% women), of whom 9,080 (19%) had kidney impairment. hs-cTnIs were over 99th centile in 46% and 16% of patients with and without kidney impairment. Implementation increased the diagnosis of type 1 infarction from 12.4% to 17.8%, and from 7.5% to 9.4% in patients with and without kidney impairment (both significant). Patients with kidney impairment and type 1 myocardial infarction were less likely to undergo coronary revascularization (26% versus 53%) or receive dual anti-platelets (40% versus 68%) than those without kidney impairment, and this did not change post-implementation. In patients with hs-cTnI above the 99th centile, the primary outcome occurred twice as often in those with kidney impairment compared to those without (24% versus 12%, hazard ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 1.78). Thus, hs-cTnI testing increased the identification of myocardial injury and infarction but failed to address disparities in management and outcomes between those with and without kidney impairment.

### Pitfalls of embolic protection [^fbdca18f]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Some degree of distal embolization likely occurs during all transcatheter interventional procedures. The clinical sequela is defined by the sensitivity of the target organ to segmental ischemia and the burden of embolic load. The spectrum of clinical consequences varies from the extremes of stroke and no-reflow phenomena in the carotid and coronaries, respectively, to silent renal insult following renal stenting. The clinical sequela of stroke and myocardial infarction in these most sensitive end-organ distributions led to the birth of embolic protection science. Over the past 2 decades embolic protection has matured and we now have a menu of devices to consider based on our specific patient clinical and anatomic needs. The goal of this narrative is to provide an update on protection device science and, more importantly, a very practical informal guide to the currently available technologies with emphasis on the pitfalls common to specific device families.

### Captorpil (Captopril) [^03b88d9f]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

Therapy may be initiated as early as three days following a myocardial infarction. After a single dose of 6.25 mg, captopril tablets therapy should be initiated at 12.5 mg t.i.d. Captopril tablets should then be increased to 25 mg t.i.d. during the next several days and to a target dose of 50 mg t.i.d. over the next several weeks as tolerated (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Captopril tablets may be used in patients treated with other post-myocardial infarction therapies, e.g. thrombolytics, aspirin, beta blockers.

Diabetic Nephropathy: The recommended dose of captopril tablets for long term use to treat diabetic nephropathy is 25 mg t.i.d.

Other antihypertensives such as diuretics, beta blockers, centrally acting agents or vasodilators may be used in conjuction with captopril tablets if additional therapy is required to further lower blood pressure.

Dosage Adjustment in Renal Impairment: Because captopril is excreted primarily by the kidneys, excretion rates are reduced in patients with impaired renal function. These patients will take longer to reach steady-state captopril levels and will reach higher steady-state levels for a given daily dose than patients with normal renal function. Therefore, these patients may respond to smaller or less frequent doses.

Accordingly, for patients with significant renal impairment, initial daily dosage of captopril should be reduced, and smaller increments utilized for titration, which should be quite slow (one- to two-week intervals). After the desired therapeutic effect has been achieved, the dose should be slowly back titrated to determine the minimal effective dose. When concomitant diuretic therapy is required, a loop diuretic (e.g., furosemide), rather than a thiazide diuretic, is preferred in patients with severe renal impairment. (See WARNINGS: Anaphylactoid reactions during membrane exposure and PRECAUTIONS: Hemodialysis .)

Unstable Angina and Non–Q-Wave Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of Lovenox is 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours in conjunction with oral aspirin therapy (100 to 325 mg once daily) in patients with unstable angina or non–Q-wave myocardial infarction. Treat with Lovenox for a minimum of 2 days and continue until clinical stabilization. The usual duration of treatment is 2 to 8 days [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.5)].

Treatment of Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction

The recommended dose of Lovenox is a single intravenous bolus of 30 mg plus a 1 mg/kg subcutaneous dose followed by 1 mg/kg administered subcutaneously every 12 hours (maximum 100 mg for the first two doses only, followed by 1 mg/kg dosing for the remaining doses) in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Reduce the dosage in patients ≥ 75 years of age [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Unless contraindicated, administer aspirin to all patients as soon as they are identified as having STEMI and continue dosing with 75 to 325 mg once daily.

When administered in conjunction with a thrombolytic (fibrin specific or non–fibrin specific), administer Lovenox between 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after the start of fibrinolytic therapy. The usual duration of Lovenox therapy is 8 days or until hospital discharge.

For patients managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), if the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given less than 8 hours before balloon inflation, no additional dosing is needed. If the last Lovenox subcutaneous administration was given more than 8 hours before balloon inflation, administer an intravenous bolus of 0.3 mg/kg of Lovenox [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

2.3	Dose Reduction for Patients with Severe Renal Impairment

The recommended prophylaxis and treatment dosage regimens for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are described in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Although no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min and creatinine clearance 50 to 80 mL/min, observe these patients frequently for signs and symptoms of bleeding.

### Case report: full recovery from dialysis-requiring renal failure after surgical repair of a completely occluded renal artery in a patient with a single kidney [^f162673d]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned, the symptoms of acute renal infarction are unspecific and vary from case to case. During both renal infarction episodes our patient had hypertension and acute kidney injury. Due to the decrease in renal artery diameter or total artery occlusion, a rapid drop in renal perfusion pressure occurs. As a result, natrium sieving at the glomerulus is reduced which leads to renin release and through the activation of renin-aldosterone-system to increase in blood pressure. Moreover, acute drop in renal perfusion leads to acute kidney injury, which is a common symptom of renal infarction, present in almost 50% of cases. Notably, no other typical findings such as LDH elevation as an indicator for acute ischemia were observed. Initial ultrasound showed post-stenotic waveforms within the renal tissue, described with prolonged acceleration time and low resistive indices, and no blood flow via main supplying artery. Further imaging, CT-angiography respectively, has shown that the aorto-renal bypass was occluded. In addition, discrete perfusion of the kidney, through the highly developed collateral circulation was observed. Apparently, collateral blood flow was not enough to produce sufficient pressure needed for diuresis. Though, it was enough to sustain sufficient oxygenation of renal tissue. This was proven, as renal function recovered, and blood pressure normalized promptly after aorto-renal bypass two weeks after admission of the patient. This supports the role of collateral perfusion in maintaining tissue viability and suggesting predictive value for treatment success.

While many acute renal infarctions are managed conservatively, main artery occlusions often require intervention. Minimally invasive approaches are preferred. Thrombolysis, thrombectomy, ballon angioplasty with or without the stent placement can be offered. Such treatment options are related to high success rates and low complication risk compared to surgical approach. The use of minimally invasive procedures in the presence of aortic-renal bypass occlusion are limited to case reports. Our patient previously failed thrombectomy, necessitating surgical bypass. According to studies on patients who underwent renal revascularization surgeries, graft patency ranged from 88–97% at 3–5 years. Vein grafts have slightly lower patency, possibly due to venous valves causing acute thrombosis. They are also prone to stenosis and aneurysm formation. Even though in our case the venous graft displayed long patency, the presence of extremely well-developed collateral vasculature suggests chronic ischemia. The long graft history and the delayed diagnosis of acute renal infarction were critical factors that influenced the decision against minimally invasive procedure in this case.
