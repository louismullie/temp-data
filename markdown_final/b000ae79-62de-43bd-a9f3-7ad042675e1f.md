## Question

poison oak or ivy treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat poison ivy/oak dermatitis, preserving the stepwise thinking and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate decontamination and timing. Then, I should verify the expected clinical course and severity markers. Next, I will review topical therapies and their evidence. After that, I need to check when systemic steroids are indicated and how to dose and taper them. I will then examine antihistamines and other symptomatic measures. I should also consider special presentations like black-spot dermatitis and erythema multiforme-like reactions. Finally, I will integrate prevention, follow-up, and a concise algorithm, making sure each point aligns with guideline strength and evidence quality [^112hBGDX] [^114gtMdB].

> Let me first confirm the priority: immediate decontamination is the cornerstone because urushiol penetrates quickly and becomes harder to remove over time; washing with soap and water as soon as possible can remove up to 100% of oil if done immediately, dropping to about 50% by 10 minutes, 25% by 15 minutes, and 10% by 30 minutes, so time is critical here [^1173s21T]. Wait, let me verify alternatives if water isn't available; the AHA/Red Cross first aid guideline also supports commercial decontamination products, and NIOSH notes that rubbing alcohol or degreasing soap can be effective, with repeated rinsing to avoid letting wash solutions dry on the skin and spread oil, so I should emphasize both speed and technique, including scrubbing under nails and laundering contaminated clothing separately in hot soapy water [^112hBGDX] [^1141siA7] [^1149LCQk].

> Next, I should review the clinical course to set expectations and guide escalation; in sensitized individuals, the rash typically appears within 24–48 hours, peaks in 1–14 days, and resolves in 1–3 weeks, though first exposures can be delayed up to 3 weeks, so I need to ensure patients know the natural history to avoid premature alarm or overtreatment [^114gtMdB] [^1149LCQk]. Hold on, I should verify severity markers that warrant urgent care: fever, purulence or yellow crusting, rapidly progressive or severe pruritus, involvement of eyes, mouth, genitals, or more than about 20% of body surface area, and any respiratory symptoms from smoke exposure; these are consistent with FDA and first-aid guidance and should trigger referral for systemic therapy or emergency evaluation [^116ysaxp] [^1141siA7].

> I will now examine topical therapies; cool compresses and oatmeal baths are reasonable for symptomatic relief, though evidence is limited and graded as COR 2b by AHA/Red Cross, so I should frame them as optional comfort measures rather than disease-modifying therapy [^112hBGDX] [^1176KLzb]. Let me consider topical corticosteroids; the AHA/Red Cross guideline rates OTC topical steroids as uncertain benefit (COR 2b), but practice parameters and primary care guidance support mid- to high-potency topical steroids for localized disease, with caution on thin skin areas and in children, so I should reconcile this by noting that while evidence quality is modest, clinical consensus favors medium-potency agents like triamcinolone 0.1% for limited rashes, avoiding the face, groin, and eyelids unless using low-potency options and short courses [^116j8BWv] [^111bWdrS] [^112hBGDX]. Wait, I should double-check a common misconception: topical antihistamines and local anesthetics can increase sensitization and are generally discouraged for poison ivy dermatitis, so I should advise against them despite their OTC availability [^112ZK2gt].

> Now, systemic therapy; I need to ensure I'm precise about indications and dosing. For extensive disease (> 20% BSA), severe pruritus, or involvement of face, hands, or genitals, oral corticosteroids are indicated, and the standard regimen is prednisone about 1 mg/kg/day (typically 40–60 mg/day) with a slow taper over 2–3 weeks to prevent rebound, which is a well-documented risk with shorter courses; relief often begins within 12–24 hours, aligning with practice parameters and primary care guidance [^116j8BWv] [^111bWdrS]. Hold on, I should verify IM options; the FDA labeling for methylprednisolone acetate supports 80–120 mg IM for acute severe dermatitis with onset of relief in 8–12 hours, which can be useful when adherence to an oral taper is uncertain, though clinical judgment and follow-up remain essential [^116SYra7] [^1124nPxa]. I need to ensure I caution about rapid discontinuation and rebound, as this is a common pitfall in urgent care settings [^111bWdrS].

> Let me consider antihistamines; I initially thought they directly reduce pruritus from allergic contact dermatitis, but wait, I should verify that assumption because it may be incorrect. The AHA/Red Cross guideline notes uncertainty for oral antihistamines in relieving local symptoms, and patient education sources indicate they do not reliably relieve itch from urushiol dermatitis, though sedating antihistamines may help with sleep, so I should correct my earlier inclination and position them as adjuncts for sedation and sleep rather than primary antipruritics [^112hBGDX] [^1149LCQk] [^1176KLzb]. I should confirm that this nuance is communicated clearly to avoid overpromising benefit [^1176KLzb].

> Next, I should review other symptomatic measures; calamine and zinc-containing protectants can dry weeping lesions and provide mild relief, and aluminum acetate (Burow's solution) is a traditional astringent that can help with oozing, though evidence is largely experiential; NSAIDs like ibuprofen can be used for discomfort, and acetaminophen is reasonable if NSAIDs are contraindicated, keeping in mind it lacks anti-inflammatory action and hepatotoxicity risk in overdose or liver disease [^116ysaxp] [^112ZK2gt] [^115FE9uj]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not implying disease modification with these measures; they are supportive only and do not shorten the immunologic course of Toxicodendron dermatitis [^114gtMdB].

> I will now examine special presentations; black-spot poison ivy reflects oxidized urushiol forming a dark lacquer on skin within hours and may precede or accompany allergic contact dermatitis, typically resolving in 2–3 weeks; immediate washing still helps, but the black resin itself is not easily removed and should not be forcefully abraded, so reassurance and routine care are appropriate unless allergic dermatitis emerges [^111FtELz] [^114yAK4c]. But wait, what if the patient develops targetoid lesions after severe urushiol dermatitis; erythema multiforme-like reactions, while uncommon, are reported, particularly in children and adolescents, and should prompt consideration of systemic steroids if the dermatitis is severe and close follow-up for mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms [^112Uqpx9] [^114atyJ2] [^115vxsRK].

> Prevention and follow-up are crucial; I need to ensure patients learn plant identification, use protective clothing, and clean tools, clothing, and pets because urushiol can persist on surfaces for months to years; barrier creams like bentoquatam may reduce exposure if applied before contact and reapplied every few hours during prolonged exposure, and burning these plants is dangerous due to airborne urushiol causing severe respiratory reactions, so it should be avoided [^1141siA7] [^116ysaxp]. Hold on, I should verify that patients understand persistence; yes, urushiol can remain active on objects for years, reinforcing the need to clean gear and pets after exposure [^1141siA7].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm; within 10–30 minutes of exposure, perform thorough decontamination with soap and water or alcohol-based cleanser, scrub under nails, and launder clothing separately; for localized mild disease, use medium-potency topical corticosteroid and consider cool compresses or oatmeal baths; for extensive, severe, or high-risk involvement, prescribe oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with a 2–3 week taper or consider IM methylprednisolone 80–120 mg if adherence is a concern; add sedating antihistamines at night for sleep if needed, and arrange follow-up to monitor for secondary infection, rebound, or atypical reactions, escalating care if fever, purulence, mucosal involvement, or respiratory symptoms develop [^112hBGDX] [^116j8BWv] [^111bWdrS] [^1149LCQk]. I should double-check that this aligns with both first-aid guidance and specialty parameters; yes, the steps integrate decontamination, localized vs systemic therapy thresholds, and safety monitoring consistent with current recommendations [^112hBGDX] [^116j8BWv].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and counseling are explicit; record the exposure history, distribution, severity, and treatment plan, and counsel on expected course, warning signs, and prevention, including the importance of tapering steroids and avoiding topical antihistamines or anesthetics that can sensitize, as well as the futility of desensitization for Toxicodendron dermatitis in routine practice [^112ZK2gt] [^116ysaxp]. If uncertainty arises or the presentation is atypical, I should confirm the diagnosis and consider alternative plant dermatitides that mimic urushiol reactions, adjusting management accordingly while maintaining supportive care and avoidance of the offending plant [^115okZ2t].

Effective treatment of poison oak or ivy dermatitis centers on **immediate decontamination** [^112hBGDX] with soap and water or a commercial cleanser within 10–30 minutes [^1173s21T] to remove urushiol and reduce severity. For mild cases, use **topical corticosteroids** [^116j8BWv] and cool compresses or oatmeal baths [^112hBGDX]; for moderate to severe or extensive rashes, prescribe oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day [^112ZK2gt] with a 2–3 week taper to prevent rebound. Oral antihistamines help with **itch and sleep** [^112ZK2gt], and topical antihistamines or anesthetics should be avoided due to sensitization risk [^112ZK2gt]. Educate on prevention, plant identification, and prompt washing after exposure [^116ysaxp]; refer if the rash is severe, involves the face/genitals, or fails to improve in 1–2 weeks [^1149LCQk].

---

## Immediate decontamination

Immediate decontamination is the most critical step to prevent or lessen the severity of the reaction [^112hBGDX]. Wash the affected area with **soap and water** [^1173s21T] or a commercial cleanser as soon as possible — ideally within 10–30 minutes of exposure [^1141siA7]. If soap is unavailable, use **isopropyl alcohol** or a specialized poison ivy cleanser, then rinse thoroughly with water [^1141siA7]. Clean contaminated clothing, tools, and pets with soap and water or alcohol to prevent secondary exposure [^116ysaxp].

---

## Topical treatments

Topical treatments provide symptomatic relief and reduce inflammation in mild cases:

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Medium- to high-potency corticosteroids (e.g. triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%) are effective for localized rashes [^111bWdrS]. Avoid prolonged use, especially on thin skin areas (face, groin, axillae) [^116j8BWv].

- **Cool compresses**: Apply cool compresses or soak in cool water to relieve itching and inflammation [^112hBGDX].

- **Oatmeal baths**: Colloidal oatmeal baths can soothe itching and irritation [^112hBGDX].

- **Calamine lotion**: Useful for drying oozing lesions and relieving itching [^116ysaxp].

- **Avoid topical antihistamines and anesthetics**: These can cause sensitization and worsen dermatitis [^112ZK2gt].

---

## Systemic treatments

Systemic corticosteroids are indicated for **moderate to severe or extensive rashes** (greater than 20% of body surface area), involvement of the face, hands, or genitals, or when topical treatments fail [^1149LCQk]. Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (typically 40–60 mg/day) for 7–14 days, then taper over 2–3 weeks to prevent rebound dermatitis [^111bWdrS]. Alternatively, **intramuscular methylprednisolone acetate** 80–120 mg provides rapid relief within 8–12 hours and lasts several days to two weeks [^116SYra7].

---

## Antihistamines

Oral antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine) help control **pruritus** [^1149LCQk] and improve sleep, though their efficacy in allergic contact dermatitis is limited [^1176KLzb]. Sedating antihistamines are preferred for nighttime use due to their sedative effects [^1176KLzb].

---

## Patient education and prevention

Education on plant identification and avoidance is essential to prevent **recurrence** [^116ysaxp]. Wear protective clothing (long sleeves, pants, gloves) when outdoors [^1141siA7], and wash exposed skin with soap and water as soon as possible after potential exposure [^112hBGDX]. Clean contaminated clothing, tools, and pets to prevent secondary exposure [^116ysaxp].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Referral to a dermatologist or allergist is indicated for **severe or atypical cases**, including:

- Severe reactions involving the face, eyes, or genitals [^1149LCQk].

- Extensive body surface area involvement [^116j8BWv].

- Failure to respond to standard treatment within 1–2 weeks [^notfound].

- Recurrent or chronic dermatitis [^111XkRTg].

- Suspected occupational exposure requiring patch testing [^113WrcbU].

---

## Potential complications

Secondary bacterial infection may occur due to scratching and skin barrier disruption [^116ysaxp]. Rarely, **erythema multiforme-like reactions** [^115vxsRK] can develop, particularly in children [^notfound].

---

## Treatment recommendations

| **Severity** | **Treatment** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild | - Topical corticosteroids <br/> - Cool compresses <br/> - Oatmeal baths <br/> - Calamine lotion | Avoid topical antihistamines/anesthetics |
| Moderate | - Oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day <br/> - Oral antihistamines | Taper over 2–3 weeks |
| Severe | - Intramuscular methylprednisolone acetate <br/> - Oral prednisone | Rapid relief within 8–12 hours |
| All severities | - Patient education <br/> - Prevention | Essential to prevent recurrence |

---

Effective management of poison oak or ivy dermatitis requires **prompt decontamination** [^112hBGDX], appropriate topical or systemic corticosteroids, and patient education to prevent recurrence. Specialist referral is indicated for severe, atypical, or refractory cases [^111FtELz].

Allergic contact dermatitis caused by the Toxicodendron (formerly Rhus) species-poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac-affects millions of North Americans every year. In certain outdoor occupations, for example, agriculture and forestry, as well as among many outdoor enthusiasts, Toxicodendron dermatitis presents a significant hazard. This review considers the epidemiology, identification, immunochemistry, pathophysiology, clinical features, treatment, and prevention of this common dermatologic problem. Recent research in prevention is emphasized, and resources to help in the identification of plants are provided in the bibliography. The literature was searched using a MEDLINE query for "Toxicodendron dermatitis", and the identified article bibliographies were searched as well.

### Plant dermatitis [^112fhCiQ]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Plant dermatitis is a common pathology that plagues those who work and recreate in the North American outdoors. The most common plant family to cause dermatitis is the Toxicodendron genus, which includes the plants known by the common names of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. While mortality is usually quite low for this pathology, the incidence and prevalence of the disease leads to substantial healthcare burden and financial implications across the population. The mainstays of treatment have focused on prevention, corticosteroids, and antihistamines.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^114gtMdB]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Background — Toxicodendron dermatitis epidemiology and course: Contact dermatitis from Toxicodendron species, including poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, affects millions of Americans annually, resulting in millions of visits to health care facilities each year. Approximately 50% to 75% of individuals react to urushiol, and skin effects including redness, papules and vesicles, and itching typically start within days of exposure and can last up to 3 weeks. Therefore, initial treatment is aimed at preventing or removing exposure to urushiol, with later first aid aimed at management of symptoms, and data on treatment effectiveness are limited, with few clinical trials.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — decontamination efficacy: Washing with soap and water can remove up to 100% of poison ivy oils if done immediately after contact, falling to 50% at 10 minutes, 25% at 15 minutes, and 10% at 30 minutes. In 1 study of healthy volunteers exposed to crushed poison ivy leaves, washing with a commercial decontamination product, commercial hand cleaner, or dishwashing soap and water produced 55% to 70% reductions in local symptoms compared with control when used 2 hours after urushiol application, with no significant difference among the 3 treatments.

Occupational contact dermatitis epidemiology, exposures, and cautions — Contact dermatitis is one of the most common occupational illnesses, with estimated annual costs exceeding $1 billion; irritant contact dermatitis represents approximately 80% of all cases of occupational contact dermatitis and most commonly involves the hands. Common irritant agents include wet work, solvents and alcohols, cutting oils, coolants, degreasers, soaps, detergents, and other cleaning agents and disinfectants, while major allergen groups include metals, rubber-related materials, epoxies, resins and acrylics, organic dyes, plants, foods, medications, biocides, and germicides. The most common causes of plant dermatitis in outdoor workers include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, and patch testing is not recommended to poison ivy because it can cause sensitization or large bullous reactions.

### Dermatology precautions and slower titration yield low incidence of lamotrigine treatment-emergent rash [^111fxKA2]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess treatment-emergent rash incidence when using dermatology precautions (limited antigen exposure) and slower titration during lamotrigine initiation.

Method

We assessed rash incidence in 100 patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder instructed, for their first 3 months taking lamotrigine, to avoid other new medicines and new foods, cosmetics, conditioners, deodorants, detergents, and fabric softeners, as well as sunburn and exposure to poison ivy/oak. Lamotrigine was not started within 2 weeks of a rash, viral syndrome, or vaccination. In addition, lamotrigine was titrated more slowly than in the prescribing information. Patients were monitored for rash and clinical phenomena using the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder Clinical Monitoring Form. Descriptive statistics were compiled.

Results

No patient had serious rash. Benign rash occurred in 5 patients (5%) and resolved uneventfully in 3 patients discontinuing and 2 patients continuing lamotrigine. Two patients with rash were found to be not adherent to dermatology precautions. Therefore, among the remaining patients, only 3/98 (3.1%) had benign rashes.

Conclusion

The observed rate of benign rash was lower than the 10% incidence in other clinical studies. The design of this study confounds efforts to determine the relative contributions of slower titration versus dermatology precautions to the low rate of rash. Systematic studies are needed to confirm these preliminary findings, which suggest that adhering to dermatology precautions with slower titration may yield a low incidence of rash with lamotrigine.

### Mast cell-derived interleukin 10 limits skin pathology in contact dermatitis and chronic irradiation with ultraviolet B [^11714bfG]. Nature Immunology (2007). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis, such as in response to poison ivy or poison oak, and chronic low-dose ultraviolet B irradiation can damage the skin. Mast cells produce proinflammatory mediators that are thought to exacerbate these prevalent acquired immune or innate responses. Here we found that, unexpectedly, mast cells substantially limited the pathology associated with these responses, including infiltrates of leukocytes, epidermal hyperplasia and epidermal necrosis. Production of interleukin 10 by mast cells contributed to the anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive effects of mast cells in these conditions. Our findings identify a previously unrecognized function for mast cells and mast cell-derived interleukin 10 in limiting leukocyte infiltration, inflammation and tissue damage associated with immunological or innate responses that can injure the skin.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^111XkRTg]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis (CD) — epidemiology and clinical presentation indicate that CD is common, with 5.7 million physician visits per year, and the acute clinical expression is characterized by redness, edema, papules, vesiculation, weeping, crusting, and pruritus. The severity ranges from a mild, short-lived condition to a severe, persistent, but rarely life-threatening, disease; thinner skin sites such as the eyelids, ear lobes, and genital areas are most vulnerable, whereas the thicker palms and soles are more resistant. Exposure time to allergenic contactants varies from being brief (eg, poison ivy) to protracted (eg, nickel in jewelry or work chemicals).

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^1145vGLp]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) patch testing — test outcomes and risks include that negative reactions may occur despite using correct sensitizing materials when test conditions fail to duplicate those under which dermatitis developed. Systemic ACD after patch testing is rare, as is reactivation of patch test reactions after oral ingestion of related allergens or by inhalation of budesonide in patients sensitized to topical corticosteroids, and it is possible to sensitize a previously nonsensitized patient during testing, particularly with plant contactants such as poison ivy or oak and aniline dyes.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^115fRs2G]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Patch testing safety — systemic reactions and sensitization are addressed as follows: Systemic allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) after patch testing is rare, and re-activation can occur after inhalation or ingestion of related allergens; there is also the possibility of sensitizing a previously non‑sensitized patient, particularly with plant allergens such as poison ivy or oak and aniline dyes. Exaggerated local reactivities may occur if the concentration of the test substance is too strong, and the possibility of active sensitization can be minimized by testing with dilute concentrations. Foods that can cause ACD and systemic contact dermatitis include flavoring agents (oil of cinnamon, vanilla, balsam of Peru), various spices, garlic, and raw cashew nuts.

### Exploring the mango-poison ivy connection: the riddle of discriminative plant dermatitis [^115V6n3L]. Contact Dermatitis (2005). Low credibility.

A relationship between sensitivity to poison oak or poison ivy and mango dermatitis has been suggested by previous publications. The observation that acute allergic contact dermatitis can arise on first exposure to mango in patients who have been sensitized beforehand by contact with other urushiol-containing plants has been documented previously. We report 17 American patients employed in mango picking at a summer camp in Israel, who developed a rash of varying severity. All patients were either in contact with poison ivy/oak in the past or lived in areas where these plants are endemic. None recalled previous contact with mango. In contrast, none of their Israeli companions who had never been exposed to poison ivy/oak developed mango dermatitis. These observations suggest that individuals with known history of poison ivy/oak allergy, or those residing in area where these plants are common, may develop allergic contact dermatitis from mango on first exposure. We hypothesize that previous oral exposure to urushiol in the local Israeli population might establish immune tolerance to these plants.

### Updates in the general approach to the pediatric poisoned patient [^111nwSRM]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Poison prevention remains essential to prevent the most vulnerable population from becoming exposed to potentially lethal toxins. The evaluation of a child presumed to have been exposed to a toxic substance should include a precise history of the exposure, a physical examination, and knowledge of current ingestions and recreational practices. New treatments and research guiding therapy continue to evolve. Poison centers and medical toxicologists can be consulted to assist with the diagnosis of medicinal/drug overdoses, for advice about the pitfalls inherent in stabilizing children who have been exposed to toxic compounds, and for treatment recommendations based on the latest research.

### Occupational skin disease [^113WrcbU]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis, the most common occupational skin disease, is characterized by clearly demarcated areas of rash at sites of exposure. The rash improves on removal of the offending agent. In allergic contact dermatitis, even minute exposures to antigenic substances can lead to a skin rash. Common sensitizing agents include nickel and members of the Rhus genus (e.g., poison ivy, poison oak). Severe skin irritants tend to cause immediate red blisters or burns, whereas weaker irritants produce eczematous skin changes over time. An occupational cause should be suspected when rash occurs in areas that are in contact with oil, grease, or other substances. Direct skin testing (patch or scratch) or radioallergosorbent testing may help to identify a specific trigger. Skin cancer can have an occupational link in workers with prolonged exposure to sunlight and certain chemicals, although it can take decades for lesions to develop. In workers with occupational skin disease, workplace changes and protective measures are important to prevent future exposure.

### Allergy diagnostic testing: an updated practice parameter [^112pMzbE]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Medium credibility.

Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) from plants — Summary Statement 245 — states that plant-related ACD is due to specific sensitization; toxicodendron dermatitis is the most common presentation with characteristic linear vesicles, and plant allergens are typically in oleoresins requiring crushing for release. Specifically, it is described that ACD from plant exposure is "the result of specific cell-mediated hypersensitivity induced by previous contact with that family of plants", that "Toxicodendron dermatitis (poison ivy) is the most common form of ACD" with "streak-like or linear papulovesicular" lesions, that "the poison ivy group of plants (Anacardiaceae) causes most cases of plant dermatitis", and that "The sensitizing substances in most plants are present mainly in the oleoresin fraction… Most plants must be crushed to release the antigenic chemicals".

Cooling is an effective temporary remedy for itch, bringing welcome relief to itchy insect bites, nettle stings, poison ivy, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis. Menthol, causing a cooling sensation, has similar itch-relieving effects. Palkar et al. demonstrate that TRPM8, a menthol- and cold-activated ion channel, is essential for cooling to relieve itch, suggesting that pharmacologic TRPM8 activation should be explored further as an antipruritic strategy.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^112fZBb2]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Cyanide exposure — assessment, documentation, and performance measures include that early and repeated assessment is essential. Key documentation elements specify repeat evaluation and documentation of signs and symptoms as the patient's clinical condition may deteriorate rapidly, identification of possible etiology of poisoning, time of symptom onset and time of initiation of exposure-specific treatments, and therapy and response to therapy. Performance measures call for early airway management in the rapidly deteriorating patient, accurate exposure history with time of ingestion/exposure, route of exposure, quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible medications or agents), and alcohol or other intoxicant taken, along with appropriate protocol selection and management and multiple frequent documented reassessments.

Chemical exposure to the eye — background and decontamination principles emphasize prevalence and key first aid priorities. Chemical injury to the eye represents between 10% to 22% of all eye injuries. The extent of the eye injury from caustic materials is related to the chemical involved and how long the exposure lasts; therefore, rapid removal of the caustic agent is the key to first aid. Although some chemicals may have specific decontamination techniques, running water is a readily available resource that has been demonstrated to be an effective decontamination agent, and regional poison centers or local protocols can provide further information on additional treatment recommendations, including duration of irrigation or other decontamination strategies.

Discussion

All toxicodendron plants have resin channels throughout the plant that contain urushiol oleoresins that vary in composition and concentration. When the plant is injured, the sap is extruded and, within minutes of exposure to air, the sap hardens by oxidation into a black resin to seal the injury. It is often visible on previously injured sections of the plant. This black lacquer can also form on clothing, tools, paper, and skin. The finding of the black lacquer on multiple substrates supports the conclusion that on the skin the black lacquer is not an eschar but the oleoresin itself. The oleoresin also accounts for the yellowish amorphous material often present in the stratum corneum seen on hematoxylin-eosin stained biopsy sections. The high concentration of the urushiol needed to produce the black resin accounts for the irritant contact dermatitis, which can mask pathologic features of allergic contact dermatitis in sensitized individuals.

This characteristic oleoresin reaction forms the basis of the black spot test, which involves blotting an injured leaf or other plant material on a piece of white paper and waiting for black lacquer formation (a way to confirm the identity of the toxicodendron plants when the botanical identification is in question). Black-spot poison ivy is mostly reported after contact with Toxicodendron radicans and T. rydbergii. Mallory et al demonstrated the formation of the black lacquer on skin of volunteers within an hour of application of the plant. Notably, the lacquer cannot be washed off with soap and water and typically falls off in 1–2 weeks. This lacquer is similar to the lacquer created from Japanese lacquer trees, which are also within the Anacardiaceae family. That lacquer has been demonstrated to be allergenic for hundreds of years.

To prevent either black-spot poison ivy or toxicodendron dermatitis after contact with the plant, the patient should wash immediately with soap and water. If available, isopropyl alcohol applied liberally followed by copious rinsing with water after contact is more effective than soap for preventing allergic contact dermatitis. Bleach rapidly inactivates urushiol on clothing and tools, and organic solvents (alcohol, gasoline, acetone) can extract it from contaminated surfaces.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme-like reaction secondary to recurrent poison ivy exposure [^112Uqpx9]. Pediatric Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

A 14-year-old boy developed an erythema multiforme-like reaction following Toxicodendron radicans (poison ivy) allergic contact dermatitis three separate times over the course of 3years. The severity of each erythema multiforme-like reaction corresponded to the severity of the allergic contact dermatitis which preceded it.

### Black-spot toxicodendron dermatitis with varied presentation [^111FtELz]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article describes the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and treatment of 2 unrelated cases with different presentations of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis. In the first case, a healthy 7-y-old male presented with a rash consisting of black dots with localized surrounding erythema on the left arm. The rash then progressed to a vesicular, pinpoint, raised rash spreading to the face, arms, and neck. In the second case, a 4-y-old male presented with non-pruritic, black, flat, non-erythematous lesions that did not progress. This patient's older sibling had been diagnosed with poison ivy 1 wk prior, and they attended the same child care where the poison ivy was thought to be acquired. In both cases, diagnosis of black-spot Toxicodendron dermatitis was made. The black spot of Toxicodendron dermatitis is caused by urushiol oxidation on exposure to air. The subject may or may not go on to develop allergic contact dermatitis after the exposure. Diagnosis of this dermatitis is made on clinical presentation, with careful consideration of history, distribution, and lesion morphology. When allergic dermatitis does develop as in the first case, systemic treatment with oral steroids is recommended. In both of these cases the black dots completely resolved in 2 to 3 wk. Dermatologic referral for dermoscopy and biopsy may be necessary if the dermatosis does not resolve as anticipated.

### Activated charcoal for acute poisoning: one toxicologist's journey [^1136cDdJ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

In this brief review, I will attempt to answer the following questions about activated charcoal: what is it and what does it bind to? What do animal studies and human volunteer studies reveal about its efficacy in simulated overdose? What evidence is there from case reports and controlled trials for its benefit in humans? What are the potential risks of administering activated charcoal? And finally, how can we put our knowledge about charcoal to use in managing specific patients?

### Black-spot poison ivy, a report of 3 cases with clinicopathologic correlation [^113D3TQC]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Black-spot poison ivy is an uncommon clinical manifestation of contact with Toxicodendron plants. Unlike allergic contact dermatitis, which typically manifests in sensitized individuals within 24–48 hours, the black lacquer that results from oxidation of the oleoresin after contact with the plant develops within hours of exposure and precedes allergic contact dermatitis, in some cases by weeks. Black-spots are usually accompanied by an irritant dermatitis reaction of varying severity. The appearance of an irregular black macule is often alarming to patients and prompts clinical evaluation. Because the diagnosis is straightforward and based on clinical appearance and history alone, biopsy is rarely done; thus, few descriptions of the pathologic findings exist in the literature. We herein report 3 characteristic cases of black-spot poison ivy with clinicopathologic correlation and review the pathophysiology of this uncommon condition.

### Safety and tolerability of sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes: a pooled analysis [^116cuTQK]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The overall incidence rate of adverse experiences in the "Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders" SOC was not meaningfully different between groups (Table 4). Two adverse experiences (acne and contact dermatitis [with approximately half of the events being "poison ivy/oak"]) were reported more frequently in the sitagliptin group compared with the non-exposed group, whereas hyperkeratosis was reported more frequently in the non-exposed group (Table 5). Rash was the only skin-related adverse experience reported by at least 1% of the patients in either group (Table 6), with an incidence rate of 1.0% in the sitagliptin group and 0.9% in the non-exposed group. No adverse experiences of Stevens-Johnson syndrome were reported in patients in the clinical trials that were pooled for this report; one event of erythema multiforme was reported for a patient in the non-exposed group. No adverse experiences consistent with the lesions observed during the preclinical development of some other (non-sitagliptin) DPP-4 inhibitors were reported.

For the analysis of angioedema-related events and the relationship of these events to concurrent treatment with ACE inhibitors, approximately 33% of patients were on an ACE inhibitor at baseline and approximately 36% were on an ACE inhibitor at any time during the studies (for a total of 1,023 and 779 patient-years on an ACE inhibitor for the sitagliptin and non-exposed groups, respectively). Among the 6139 patients included in this pooled analysis, there were 54 incident angioedema-related events, 16 of which occurred in patients concurrently taking an ACE inhibitor. The number of incident angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years while a patient was on an ACE inhibitor was the same (0.9) in both groups. The total numbers of angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years while a patient was on an ACE inhibitor were also similar in the sitagliptin (1.1) and non-exposed (0.9) groups. For patients not on an ACE inhibitor, the numbers of incident angioedema-related events per 100 patient-years were 1.1 in the sitagliptin group and 1.3 in the non-exposed group.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^117RzUvk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

### Diagnosis and management of contact dermatitis [^111bWdrS]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by erythematous and pruritic skin lesions that occur after contact with a foreign substance. There are two forms of contact dermatitis: irritant and allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis is caused by the non-immune-modulated irritation of the skin by a substance, leading to skin changes. Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed hypersensitivity reaction in which a foreign substance comes into contact with the skin; skin changes occur after reexposure to the substance. The most common substances that cause contact dermatitis include poison ivy, nickel, and fragrances. Contact dermatitis usually leads to erythema and scaling with visible borders. Itching and discomfort may also occur. Acute cases may involve a dramatic flare with erythema, vesicles, and bullae; chronic cases may involve lichen with cracks and fissures. When a possible causative substance is known, the first step in confirming the diagnosis is determining whether the problem resolves with avoidance of the substance. Localized acute allergic contact dermatitis lesions are successfully treated with mid- or high-potency topical steroids, such as triamcinolone 0.1% or clobetasol 0.05%. If allergic contact dermatitis involves an extensive area of skin (greater than 20 percent), systemic steroid therapy is often required and offers relief within 12 to 24 hours. In patients with severe rhus dermatitis, oral prednisone should be tapered over two to three weeks because rapid discontinuation of steroids can cause rebound dermatitis. If treatment fails and the diagnosis or specific allergen remains unknown, patch testing should be performed.

### Buprenorphine prescribing practices and exposures reported to a poison center – Utah, 2002–2011 [^11634cQz]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Buprenorphine is an effective medication for the treatment of opioid dependence. Its use has increased in the United States as a result of the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000, which allowed physicians to prescribe certain medications as part of office-based treatment for opioid addiction. In France, widespread use of medication-assisted therapy, primarily buprenorphine treatment, was associated with an 80% decrease in overdose deaths from heroin or cocaine from 465 in 1996 to 89 in 2003. With the expanded use of buprenorphine, an increase in exposures among children and adults has been reported in the United States. These exposures (including unintentional and intentional, therapeutic and nontherapeutic) have resulted in adverse effects and, in a small number of cases, death. To assess statewide increases in buprenorphine use and the number of reported exposures, the Utah Department of Health analyzed data from the Utah Controlled Substance Database (CSD) and the Utah Poison Control Center (PCC). The results of that analysis indicated a statewide increase in the annual number of patients prescribed buprenorphine from 22 in 2002 to 9,793 in 2011, and a concurrent increase in the annual number of prescribers writing buprenorphine prescriptions from 16 to 1,088. Over the same period, the number of exposures to buprenorphine reported annually to the PCC increased from six to 81. However, comparison of the ratios of buprenorphine exposures to patients and prescribers in 2002 with data for 2011 indicated substantial decreases from 6/22 for patients and 6/16 for prescribers in 2002 to 81/9,793 for patients and 81/1,088 for prescribers in 2011. Three of the total 462 buprenorphine exposures reported during 2002–2011 in Utah, in a teen and two adults, were associated with fatal outcomes. Increased buprenorphine prescribing in Utah during 2002–2011 likely represents expanded access to critically needed opioid addiction treatment; however, safeguards should be in place to prevent adverse effects. Prescribers and pharmacists are encouraged to counsel patients carefully regarding the safe use, storage, and disposal of buprenorphine.

### Arsenic exposure, assessment, toxicity, diagnosis, and management: guidance for occupational and environmental physicians [^116CPs52]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Arsenic toxicity — chelation and supportive care are outlined as follows: Chelation therapy is typically reserved for patients with severe acute toxicity and is most effective when initiated within minutes to hours; chelation therapy is rarely indicated with less severe acute toxicity, or with chronic toxicity. DMPS and DMSA have a higher therapeutic index than BAL and do not redistribute arsenic to the brain, and an FDA advisory committee has recommended that intravenous DMPS be available for compounding in hospital settings for the treatment of severe acute poisoning by arsenic. Supportive measures for arsenic gas poisoning should focus on maintaining fluid balance with intravenous hydration, and osmotic diuresis with mannitol may be helpful to maintain urine output and decrease the risk of renal failure. Removal from further arsenic exposures, if possible, is important.

### The clinical toxicology recommendations collaborative: purpose, organization, and methodology [^114EHAGa]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Scientific societies aim to provide a collective voice and unified stance on important issues. The Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative was formed in 2016 to develop evidence- and consensus-based recommendations for the management of patients exposed to common and/or serious poisonings for which the management is unclear or controversial.

Organization

The Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative is led jointly by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology, the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Toxicology, and the European Association of Poison Centres and Clinical Toxicologists. The Governance Committee is chaired by a Past-President of one of these Societies and comprised of the six Presidents and Immediate Past-Presidents of the three Societies. A Steering Committee oversees the process of each project workgroup.

Methodology

The overall process is guided by standards set forth by the Institute of Medicine for developing trustworthy guidelines and the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument. Systematic reviews are produced using the framework set in the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology. Workgroup members jointly review the evidence and prepare statements on which they vote anonymously using a 9-point Likert scale. A two-round modified Delphi method is used to reach a consensus on clinical recommendations using the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method. Final recommendations are approved by unanimous consent of the workgroup and are expressed as both levels of evidence and strength of recommendations.

Limitations

The major limitations of the Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative process centre around the amount and quality of evidence, the assessment of that evidence, and the voting of the panel.

Conclusions

By using a transparent evidence- and consensus-based approach to produce systematic reviews and clinical recommendations, the Clinical Toxicology Recommendations Collaborative aims to create an international framework for clinical toxicology education and decision-making and foster positive change for the benefit of poisoned patients.

### Allergic contact dermatitis frommasquerading as toxicodendron dermatitis [^111r3pwz]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Given its attractive appearance and its practical uses for shade and timber, Grevillea species have grown in popularity in the United States. In Australia, ACD secondary to Grevillea robusta exposure is often referred to as "Australia's poison ivy" and is a common cause of occupational dermatitis among woodworkers, including landscapers, carpenters, and saw-mill workers, and possibly the most common cause of phytodermatitis in the region. There are few reported cases of ACD developing from exposure to Grevillea species outside of Australia. To our knowledge, the most recent reports of Grevillea -related ACD in the United States, besides the case presented here, were in Hawaii in 1992 as described by Knight and Whitesell. In their report, they described 3 cases of dermatitis, including 1 patient who recently used silk-oak timber for woodworking and 2 patients, who were exposed to sawdust in the home after their spouses worked directly with the plant.

Grevillea dermatitis closely mimics Toxicodendron dermatitis, presenting with linear papulovesicular plaques at the sites of exposure to one of several plant-specific resorcinol derivatives with long-side chains that structurally resemble and may indeed cross-react with urushiol — a concerning prospect given the high prevalence of Toxicodendron sensitization in the United States. In addition to Grevillea robusta and the hybrid 'Robyn Gordon', other less popular Grevillea species, including Grevillea banskii, Grevillea hookeriana, and the "Mason's hybrid" are also known phytoallergens.

One other plant, the poodle-dog bush (Eriodictyon parryi), has also been described to elicit a dermatitis that closely mimics that of the Toxicodendron family. This is a perennial woody bush in the Hydrophyllacea family native to California that thrives in soil that has been disrupted by fires or landslides. In the setting of the worsening wild fires plaguing the west coast, it is positioned to become a potentially important source of phytodermatitis of which dermatologists should also be aware. The treatment in both cases includes strict avoidance of the plant, which may necessitate the removal of the plant from home gardens.

### Plant poisoning [^117B1iue]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Each year over 100,000 exposures to toxic plants are reported to poison centers throughout the United States. Most of these exposures are of minimal toxicity largely because of the fact that they involve pediatric ingestions, which are of low quantity. The more serious poisonings usually involve adults who have either mistaken a plant as edible or have deliberately ingested the plant to derive perceived medicinal or toxic properties. The plants within this manuscript have been chosen because they have been documented to cause fatalities or account for emergency medicine visits. In this discussion, plants are grouped by their toxins rather than on the basis of their taxonomy.

### Camphor poisoning: an evidence-based practice guideline for out-of-hospital management [^117Pr5vq]. Clinical Toxicology (2006). Low credibility.

A review of national poison center data from 1990 through 2003 showed approximately 10,000 annual ingestion exposures to camphor-containing products. A guideline that determines the threshold dose for emergency department referral and need for pre-hospital decontamination could potentially avoid unnecessary emergency department visits, reduce health care costs, optimize patient outcome, and reduce life disruption for patients and caregivers. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create the guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft of the guideline was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with suspected exposures to camphor-containing products by 1) describing the manner in which an exposure to camphor might be managed, 2) identifying the key decision elements in managing cases of camphor exposure, 3) providing clear and practical recommendations that reflect the current state of knowledge, and 4) identifying needs for research. This guideline applies to camphor exposure alone. Co-ingestion of additional substances, such as in commercial products of camphor combined with other ingredients, could require different referral and management recommendations depending on the combined toxicities of the substances. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline, and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. Recommendations are in chronological order of likely clinical use. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with stated or suspected self-harm or who are the recipients of malicious administration of a camphor-containing product should be referred to an emergency department immediately, regardless of the amount ingested (Grade D). 2) Patients who have ingested more than 30 mg/kg of a camphor-containing product or who are exhibiting symptoms of moderate to severe toxicity (e.g., convulsions, lethargy, ataxia, severe nausea and vomiting) by any route of exposure should be referred to an emergency department for observation and treatment (Grade D). 3) Patients exhibiting convulsions following a camphor exposure should be transported to an emergency department by pre-hospital emergency medical care providers (Grade D). A benzodiazepine should be used to control convulsions (Grade C). 4) Patients who have been exposed to a camphor product and who remain asymptomatic after 4 hours can be safely observed at home (Grade C). 5) Induction of emesis with ipecac syrup should not be performed in patients who have ingested camphor products (Grade C). 6) Activated charcoal administration should not be used for the ingestion of camphor products. However, it could be considered if there are other ingredients in the product that are effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal or if other substances have been co-ingested. (Grade C). 7) For asymptomatic patients with topical exposures to camphor products, the skin should be thoroughly washed with soap and water and the patient can be observed at home for development of symptoms (Grade C). 8) For patients with topical splash exposures of camphor to the eye(s), the eye(s) should be irrigated in accordance with usual poison center procedures and that referral take place based on the presence and severity of symptoms (Grade D). 9) Patients with camphor inhalation exposures should be moved to a fresh air environment and referred for medical care based on the presence and severity of symptoms. It is unlikely that symptoms will progress once the patient is removed from the exposure environment (Grade D).

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines on anaphylaxis [^11521twJ]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Treatment — general considerations and decontamination: As with any potentially serious illness or injury in the field, care begins with an assessment of scene safety followed by a primary evaluation of the patient with interventions as needed to support airway, breathing, and circulation, and epinephrine should be given as soon as possible once anaphylaxis has been identified. Removal of the inciting allergen is appropriate in certain circumstances, such as immediately removing an insect stinger from the skin to prevent additional injection of venom (avoiding pressure, if possible, on the venom sac). Exposure to aerosolized, food-based allergens should be stopped by discontinuing on-site cooking of the associated food and, if feasible, distancing of the patient, and inducing vomiting for food-based allergens has not been proven effective and may delay treatment with epinephrine.

### Toxicology: pearls and pitfalls in the use of antidotes [^112nD7tK]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although most poisonings require only supportive care, the emergency physician must recognize when the use of an antidote is required, and understand the risks and benefits of the treatment rendered. Although the more commonly instituted specific therapy in acute poisoning is the administration of intravenous fluids followed by the administration of oxygen, in certain circumstances prompt administration of a specific antidote may be required, and failure to identify these circumstances may lead to significant morbidity or mortality. This article describes select antidotes, and discusses their indications and potential pitfalls.

The relationship between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and erythema multiforme (EM) has been well described. Many authors contend that EM (excluding Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) occurs almost exclusively as a response to HSV infection. During the past year, however, we have observed several cases of EM complicating severe Rhus allergic contact dermatitis. Although this association has been previously documented, the paucity of cases in the literature, along with our experience, suggests that this is an underreported phenomenon. We describe 4 of our cases.

### Topical pimecrolimus in the treatment of human allergic contact dermatitis [^116esGG8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Contact dermatitis is a common clinical problem, with prevalent sensitizers being cosmetics, metals, medicines, and plants. Plants of the Toxicodendron species cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in 50% to 70% of the population. Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam developed for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for atopic dermatitis. There are studies supporting the effectiveness of macrolactams when administered before antigen challenge, but there are no studies describing the effectiveness of these drugs in the treatment of established human ACD.

Objective

To investigate the effect of topical pimecrolimus in the treatment of Toxicodendron-induced ACD once rash is evident.

Methods

Poison ivy tincture was applied to the bilateral anterior forearms of 12 subjects with Finn Chambers (Allerderm Diagnostic Products, Petaluma, CA). After dermatitis was evident, volunteers treated each arm twice daily with either 1% topical pimecrolimus cream or placebo in a blinded fashion. Outcomes measured were a dermatitis grading score and time to rash and itch resolution.

Results

The median ± SEM time for rash resolution was 16.55 ± 1.59 days in the treatment group and 16.27 ± 1.82 days in the placebo group (P = 0.601). The median time for itch resolution was 4.73 ± 1.56 days in the treatment group and 4.91 ± 1.59 days in the placebo group (P = 0.167). The average dermatitis score was 2.26 ± 0.17 in the treatment group and 2.32 ± 0.15 in the placebo group (P = 0.62).

Conclusions

The application of topical pimecrolimus is ineffective in the treatment of ongoing Toxicodendron-induced ACD.

### Evaluation and management of toxicodendron dermatitis in the emergency department: a review of current practices [^115okZ2t]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Toxicodendron dermatitis is an underappreciated disease seen in the emergency department. Although self-limiting, symptoms can be distressing and can last for weeks if untreated, particularly with re-exposure. Continuing research has improved our understanding of specific inflammatory markers that are associated with exposure to urushiol-the compound responsible for Toxicodendron dermatitis-although consensus for treatment remains varied and poorly supported. Owing to the lack of recent primary literature on the topic, many providers rely on historical precedent, expert opinion, and personal experience when treating this disease. This article provides a narrative review of the literature currently available on the effects of urushiol on key molecular and cellular functions and the prevention and treatment of Toxicodendron dermatitis.

Scenarios

Of the total 289,699 therapeutic errors, the most common scenarios for all ages included: inadvertent double dosing (28.2%), wrong medication taken or given (16.2%), other incorrect dose (13.6%), doses given/taken too close together (10.3%), and inadvertent exposure to someone else's medication (8.0%). The types of therapeutic errors observed are different for each age group and are summarized in Table 6B.

Table 6B.
Scenarios for Therapeutic Errors a by Age b.

Reason by Age

Intentional exposures accounted for 16.2% of human exposures. Suicidal intent was suspected in 10.5% of cases, intentional misuse in 2.5%, and intentional abuse in 2.2%. Unintentional exposures outnumbered intentional exposures in all age groups with the exception of ages 13–19 years (Table 7). Intentional exposures were more frequently reported than unintentional exposures in patients aged 13–19 years. In contrast, of the 1,218 reported fatalities with RCF 1–3, the major reason reported for children ≤ 5 years was unintentional while most fatalities in adults (> 20 years) were intentional (Table 8).

Route of Exposure

Ingestion was the route of exposure in 83.4% of cases (Table 9), followed in frequency by dermal (7.0%), inhalation/nasal (6.1%), and ocular routes (4.3%). For the 1,218 exposure-related fatalities, ingestion (80.9%), inhalation/nasal (10.2%), unknown (8.9%), and parenteral (5.1%) were the predominant exposure routes. Each exposure case may have more than one route.

### ACMT, AACT, AAPCC joint statement on the dangers of oleandrin toxicity [^114CSrVc]. ACMT (2020). High credibility.

ACMT, AACT, AAPCC joint statement — oleandrin toxicity and COVID-19 cautions that oleandrin is a cardioactive steroid extracted from the oleander plant (Nerium oleander) and that exposures to oleander and related compounds result in thousands of poisonings worldwide, with these drugs being cardiac poisons capable of causing bradycardia, dysrhythmias, and death. The organizations state they are aware of a preprint publication suggesting that oleandrin may inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, but this does not mean oleandrin is safe or effective for the treatment or prevention of coronavirus in humans; before any treatment can be seriously considered for any disease, it needs to be rigorously studied for both safety and efficacy, and if oleandrin is to be seriously considered as a potential coronavirus treatment, they expect to see peer-reviewed research for that use. Preparations made from oleander are available for purchase, but they caution consumers strongly against use of capsules, tablets, or teas, or any product made from this plant. People with suspected oleandrin toxicity should be managed in consultation with a clinical toxicologist, and patients and clinicians can reach their regional poison center at 1–800–222–1222, 24 hours/7 days a week/365 days a year. In the strongest terms possible, they recommend against the use of oleandrin outside of rigorous, medically-supervised clinical research with regulatory oversight. Although closely-related compounds such as digoxin are used to treat heart failure and atrial fibrillation, these medications are rigorously tested, FDA-approved, and pharmaceutically produced with an established place in therapy over decades of use; even when used appropriately, blood levels must be closely monitored to prevent toxicity, and treatment of toxicity from cardioactive steroids is expensive and, unfortunately, not always successful.

Long-term sequelae of exposure and training — In the absence of prolonged hypoxia, no persistent effects are expected following occupational fentanyl or fentanyl analog exposures, and those with small subclinical exposures will not experience long-term effects. Furthermore, we recommend the institution of an online training intervention for correcting false beliefs about the risk of fentanyl overdose under circumstances commonly encountered by first responders so that first responders not only feel safe, but to avoid treatment delays in the patients they serve.

### Methylprednisolone acetate [^116SYra7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of methylprednisolone tablets, USP is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient. The recommended dosage may be reduced for pediatric patients, but dosage should be governed by the severity of the condition rather than by strict adherence to the ratio indicated by age or body weight.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 mg to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 mg to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single-dose of 80 mg to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 mg to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dose of the various glucocorticoids:

These dose relationships apply only to oral or intravenous administration of these compounds. When these substances or their derivatives are injected intramuscularly or into joint spaces, their relative properties may be greatly altered.

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^11412ZMm]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

### Allergic contact dermatitis frommasquerading as toxicodendron dermatitis [^115uHYHV]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' is one of several hybrid Grevillea genus plants. This species is characterized by attractive, tall bushes with toothbrush-like flowers and leathery seed capsules. Despite the oak-like appearance of the tree's bark, the Grevillea species belongs to the Proteaceae family and is unrelated to the true-oak (Quercus) species. Native to Australia, Grevillea species are highly adaptable, and thus, have also been imported to the warmer and semitropical regions of the United States, including parts of Arizona, California, Florida, and Hawaii. They produce perennial flowers and are increasingly used as ornamental plants. The medium-to-large trees of the Grevillea species can also be used as shade trees for tea and coffee plantationsand as timber for furniture, flooring, and, less commonly, wooden jewelry.

Grevillea species contain long chain alkyl resorcinols, which are phenolic compounds that are structurally similar to the sensitizing urushiols from poison ivy. They are a known cause of occupational dermatitis among arborists in Australia, and along with the poodle-dog bush, one of 2 plant species known to cause eruptions that closely mimic Toxicodendron dermatitis. Despite its growing use as an ornamental shrub, Grevillea is not a well-recognized cause of phytodermatitis in the United States. Herein, we present a case of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in the setting of Grevillea 'Robyn Gordon' exposure in Oakland, California.

### Poisonings and overdoses in the intensive care unit: general and specific management issues [^113bWA1D]. Critical Care Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide current information on general and specific interventions for overdoses likely to require intensive care.

Design

Review of literature relevant to selected interventions for general management of overdoses and specific poisons.

Results

The benefit of interventions to decrease absorption or enhance elimination of toxins is limited to a relatively small number of specific agents. Antidotes and certain interventions may be helpful in preventing or treating toxicity in specific poisonings when used appropriately. Intensive supportive care is also necessary to achieve good outcomes.

Conclusion

Knowledge of the indications and limitations of current interventions for poisonings and overdoses is important for care of the critically ill poisoned patient.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%) [^115KDSXL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Primary skin infections: Impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections: Infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial super-infections of fungal or viral infections. Please Note: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. Gentamicin Sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. If a water-washable preparation is desired, the cream is preferable. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream has been used successfully in infants over one year of age, as well as in adults and children.

Chemical exposure to the eye — first aid recommendations specify actions with class of recommendation (COR) and level of evidence (LOE). Decontamination by irrigation should be performed immediately after chemical exposure to the eyes (COR 1, LOE B-NR). Unless otherwise recommended by local guidelines, irrigation with a copious amount of tap water for 15 minutes should be performed (COR 1, LOE C-LD). When providing first aid for chemical eye injury, first aid providers should avoid contaminating other individuals, areas, or the other eye with the caustic substance (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Eye irrigation with normal saline, Ringer's lactate solution, or a commercial eye wash solution if immediately available is reasonable (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). It is reasonable for individuals with ocular exposure to industrial chemicals to adhere to local guidelines and recommendations from a poison center (COR 2a, LOE C-LD).

Decontamination and Therapeutic Interventions.

Table 15.
Therapy Provided in Human Exposures by Age.

Ipecac-induced emesis for poisoning continues to decline as shown in Tables 16A and 16B. Ipecac was administered in only 42 (0.0%) of pediatric exposures in 2013. The continued decrease in ipecac syrup use over the last 2 decades is likely a result of ipecac use guidelines issued in 1997 by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology and the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists and updated in 2004.(6,7) In a separate report, the American Academy of Pediatrics not only concluded that ipecac should no longer be used routinely as a home treatment strategy, but also recommended disposal of home ipecac stocks.(8) A decline was also observed since the early 1990s for reported use of activated charcoal. While not as dramatic as the decline in use of ipecac, reported use of activated charcoal decreased from 3.7% of pediatric cases in 1993 to just 0.9% in 2013.

### Extracorporeal removal of poisons and toxins [^112tBXMK]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal therapies have been used to remove toxins from the body for over 50 years and have a greater role than ever before in the treatment of poisonings. Improvements in technology have resulted in increased efficacy of removing drugs and other toxins with hemodialysis, and newer extracorporeal therapy modalities have expanded the role of extracorporeal supportive care of poisoned patients. However, despite these changes, for at least the past three decades the most frequently dialyzed poisons remain salicylates, toxic alcohols, and lithium; in addition, the extracorporeal treatment of choice for therapeutic removal of nearly all poisonings remains intermittent hemodialysis. For the clinician, consideration of extracorporeal therapy in the treatment of a poisoning depends upon the characteristics of toxins amenable to extracorporeal removal (e.g., molecular mass, volume of distribution, protein binding), choice of extracorporeal treatment modality for a given poisoning, and when the benefit of the procedure justifies additive risk. Given the relative rarity of poisonings treated with extracorporeal therapies, the level of evidence for extracorporeal treatment of poisoning is not robust; however, extracorporeal treatment of a number of individual toxins have been systematically reviewed within the current decade by the Extracorporeal Treatment in Poisoning workgroup, which has published treatment recommendations with an improved evidence base. Some of these recommendations are discussed, as well as management of a small number of relevant poisonings where extracorporeal therapy use may be considered.

Figure 2.
Circumferential erythema, edema, and vesicles over left ankle and lower leg of boy along with marking nut brought by the parents. This figure appears in color at.

The Indian marking nut (Semecarpus anacardium) has an important role in Indian traditional medicine and folklore. The brown-black juice of the nut has been used by dhobis (washermen) to leave an indelible mark on laundry. This had resulted in several cases of "dhobi-mark" or "marking-nut" dermatitis in British soldiers posted in India. This indigenous nut has been used in diverse situations including voodoo treatment, as an amulet, abortifacient, hair colorant, in the treatment of joint pains, alopecia areata, chronic skin conditions, and tattoo removal. It belongs to the genus Toxicodendron and the family Anacardiaceae. Several plants of this genus (such as poison ivy, poison sumac, poison oak, and the cashew nut tree) are infamous for contact dermatitis. The juice of the marking nut contains bhilawanol, a mixture of alkyl catechols, which is similar to other urushiols of the Toxicodendron genus. It can cause both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis. Ectopic contact dermatitis (transmitted through hands) in areas such as face and genitalia, airborne contact dermatitis, and spread through contaminated mail has also been reported. Clinical features can include pruritus, erythema, papules, urticaria, vesicles, bullae, periorbital edema, and erythema multiforme-like lesions. Nephrotoxicity may rarely occur because of systemic absorption. The history and awareness about the marking nut were crucial in diagnosing our patients. It is thus important to be aware of ethnobotany and cultural dermatoses in the tropics.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^115FE9uj]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acetaminophen (APAP) for pain management — APAP, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic agent whose analgesic and antipyretic actions appear limited to the central nervous system and, for this reason, APAP is ineffective as an anti-inflammatory; research suggests that APAP may also act as a cannabinoid system modulator. The most commonly reported side effect is GI discomfort, and the most common severe effects are hepatotoxicity from significant overdose with hepatocellular damage and death; toxicity from a single administration < 150 mg/kg for adults or 200 mg/kg for children is rare, and care should be taken in chronic alcoholics and other patients with hepatic dysfunction where the maximum safe daily dose may not be known. APAP has the advantage of being lightweight and low bulk, is available in PO, PR, and IV formulations, and multiple studies comparing IV against PO and PR administrations have found clinical equipoise.

### A US perspective of symptomatic latrodectus spp. envenomation and treatment: a national poison data system review [^115LMniZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Black widow spider (Latrodectus spp.) envenomation remains the most clinically significant spider envenomation in the US. The syndrome is characterized by painful muscle rigidity and autonomic disturbances. Treatment has ranged from symptomatic care to administration of specific antivenom. Declining antivenom availability and, possibly, the fear of hypersensitivity allergic reactions, has limited antivenom use in the US.

Objective

To describe Latrodectus spp. exposures and the subsequent treatment reported to US poison centers; the secondary objective was to identify factors associated with shorter duration of symptoms (< 24 hours).

Methods

All Latrodectus spp. exposures reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008, were reviewed. Cases with at least minor clinical effects due to Latrodectus spp. exposure were extracted. Descriptive statistics were generated. The probability that symptom duration was less than 24 hours was modeled, using logistic regression.

Results

From 2000 through 2008, a total of 23,409 Latrodectus spp. exposures were reported in 47 states; 9872 cases had at least minor clinical effects and were included in the subsequent analysis. Exposures peaked in September and fell to a nadir in January and February. Fifty-eight percent of the cases involved males, and the mean (SD) age was 31.5 (17.4) years. Sixty-five percent of the patients had minor clinical effects, 33.5% had moderate effects, 1.4% had major effects, and there were no deaths. Antivenom use was associated with symptom duration of less than 24 hours in moderate and major outcome groups. There was no evidence of shorter symptom duration in patients who received benzodiazepines or calcium. Adverse drug reactions were more common in patients receiving benzodiazepines and antivenom.

Conclusions

In the US, most symptomatic Latrodectus spp. exposures reported to the NPDS are minor. Few patients receive antivenom, although antivenom is associated with shorter symptom duration among moderate and major outcomes.

### Long-acting anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^114NpwEt]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with suspected exposure to long-acting anticoagulant rodenticides (LAAR). An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. It is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and health professionals providing care. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses. 1) Patients with exposure due to suspected self-harm, abuse, misuse, or potentially malicious administration should be referred to an emergency department immediately regardless of the doses reported (Grade D). 2) Patients with symptoms of LAAR poisoning (e.g., bleeding, bruising) should be referred immediately to an emergency department for evaluation regardless of the doses reported (Grade C). 3) Patients with chronic ingestion of LAAR should be referred immediately to an emergency department for evaluation of intent and potential coagulopathy (Grade B). 4) Patients taking anticoagulants therapeutically and who ingest any dose of a LAAR should have a baseline prothrombin time measured and then again at 48–72 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 5) Patients with unintentional ingestion of less than 1 mg of LAAR active ingredient can be safely observed at home without laboratory monitoring. This includes practically all unintentional ingestions in children less than 6 years of age (Grade C). 6) Pregnant patients with unintentional exposure to less than 1 mg of LAAR active ingredient should be evaluated by their obstetrician or primary care provider as an outpatient. Immediate referral to an ED or clinic is not required (Grade D). 7) Patients with unintentional ingestion of 1 mg or more of active ingredient and are asymptomatic should be evaluated for coagulopathy at 48–72 hours after exposure (Grade B). 8) Physicians' offices or outpatient clinics must be able to obtain coagulation study results in a timely manner, preferably in less than 24 hours, for patients who require outpatient monitoring (Grade D). 9) Gastrointestinal decontamination with ipecac syrup or gastric lavage is not recommended (Grade D). 10) Transportation to an emergency department should not be delayed for administration of activated charcoal (Grade D). 11) Patients with dermal exposures should be decontaminated by washing the skin with mild soap and water (Grade D). 12) The administration of vitamin K is not recommended prior to evaluation for coagulopathy (Grade D).

### Guidelines for reporting case studies on extracorporeal treatments in poisonings: methodology [^113z4K8V]. Seminars in Dialysis (2014). Low credibility.

There are limitations to our methodology; the group of panelists that were chosen ultimately dictated which final criteria were selected, which can be biased if certain specialities are overrepresented. However, the individuals were chosen for their content expertise and came from diverse backgrounds. All panelists had extensive prior experience in reviewing and criticizing case reports for the EXTRIP clinical guideline development; many were also experienced in other peer review activities. Furthermore, several conference calls and in-house meetings permitted group discussions on the ideal constituents of a robust case report. Adherence of these reporting guidelines will need to be prospectively evaluated over time and modified accordingly, if necessary.

The sequential steps undertaken by our group differed from those proposed by the Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines, due to the previous work performed by the EXTRIP workgroup. For example, significant discussion had already taken place prior to the Delphi rounds; there may therefore have been a priori consensus, which could theoretically have impeded critical thought, and this may be suggested by the relatively few Delphi rounds needed to obtain consensus. The addition of two external validation rounds permitted the reporting guideline development to remain dynamic and ascertain that all items remained clear and understandable without extensive explanations for an end user.

Because case reports are likely to remain a significant proportion of the available literature in many acute care specialties, such as emergency medicine, and clinical toxicology, the standardized reporting of case studies will enable better consistency between publications, aiding both authors and reviewers. Furthermore, clinicians who are assessing a patient poisoned with a rare or uncommon xenobiotic will have easy-to-follow steps for data and sampling acquisition as well as tools to facilitate and encourage dissemination of these cases.

When multidose vials are used, special care to prevent contamination of the contents is essential. (See WARNINGS .)

B. Administration for Systemic Effect

The intramuscular dosage will vary with the condition being treated. When employed as a temporary substitute for oral therapy, a single injection during each 24-hour period of a dose of the suspension equal to the total daily oral dose of MEDROL® Tablets (methylprednisolone tablets, USP) is usually sufficient. When a prolonged effect is desired, the weekly dose may be calculated by multiplying the daily oral dose by 7 and given as a single intramuscular injection.

In pediatric patients, the initial dose of methylprednisolone may vary depending upon the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.11 to 1.6 mg/kg/day. Dosage must be individualized according to the severity of the disease and response of the patient.

In patients with the adrenogenital syndrome, a single intramuscular injection of 40 mg every two weeks may be adequate. For maintenance of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the weekly intramuscular dose will vary from 40 to 120 mg. The usual dosage for patients with dermatologic lesions benefited by systemic corticoid therapy is 40 to 120 mg of methylprednisolone acetate administered intramuscularly at weekly intervals for one to four weeks. In acute severe dermatitis due to poison ivy, relief may result within 8 to 12 hours following intramuscular administration of a single dose of 80 to 120 mg. In chronic contact dermatitis, repeated injections at 5 to 10 day intervals may be necessary. In seborrheic dermatitis, a weekly dose of 80 mg may be adequate to control the condition.

Following intramuscular administration of 80 to 120 mg to asthmatic patients, relief may result within 6 to 48 hours and persist for several days to two weeks.

If signs of stress are associated with the condition being treated, the dosage of the suspension should be increased. If a rapid hormonal effect of maximum intensity is required, the intravenous administration of highly soluble methylprednisolone sodium succinate is indicated.

For the purpose of comparison, the following is the equivalent milligram dose of the various glucocorticoids:

### A retrospective review of supratherapeutic modafinil exposures [^117AMr8V]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Single-agent exposures to modafinil appear to occur infrequently. In this case series, effects in overdose were usually minor, and significant toxicity occurred only rarely. Specific treatment was required in a minority of patients. Our results are similar to those of the recent study by Spiller et al. which examined data from poison control centers of 11 states. As would be expected, increasing mean and median dosages were associated with more significant clinical effects.

Modafinil has been classified as a schedule IV drug by the Drug Enforcement Administration due to its potential to cause euphoria and alterations in mood, thought, and perception. Although a recent review concluded that modafinil has a low abuse potential, a recent volunteer study demonstrated that modafinil increases dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens area of the brain, an effect that has been associated with the potential for abuse. Additionally, reports abound in Internet drug use forums of modafinil's misuse among students in order to facilitate studying and improve grades. In our case series, one third (11/33) of intentional exposures were due to abuse or misuse. Given modafinil's increasingly widespread use, it is likely that cases of toxicity will continue to be reported to poison control centers.

Our study has several limitations. This was a retrospective study which limits the amount of data that we were able to retrieve from each case. Some symptoms may have been present but were not reported to CPCS, and our frequency of clinical effects may not represent actual frequency of effects. It is very likely that our study did not capture all cases of modafinil toxicity or exposure, given that reporting of such cases to CPCS is voluntary. Additionally, it is not possible to confirm exposure in all cases since assays for measurement of plasma concentrations of modafinil are not widely available.

Effects seen in our series of modafinil exposures were usually minor, with CNS symptoms and tachycardia most commonly seen. Clinically significant effects requiring treatment did occur in a small number of patients. No significant toxicity occurred with ingestions < 400 mg; this suggests that patients who ingest less than this amount may be managed safely at home. Additionally, accidental "double-dosing" of modafinil was not associated with clinical effects in the majority of cases, but did result in clinically significant effects requiring treatment in one patient.

10 OVERDOSAGE

General symptomatic and supportive measures should be used, along with immediate gastric lavage where appropriate. Intravenous fluids should be administered as needed. As in all cases of drug overdose, respiration, pulse, blood pressure, and other appropriate vital signs should be monitored, and general supportive measures employed.

Hemodialysis does not effectively reduce exposure to ramelteon. Therefore, the use of dialysis in the treatment of overdosage is not appropriate.

Poison Control Center

As with the management of all overdosage, the possibility of multiple drug ingestion should be considered. Contact a poison control center for current information on the management of overdosage.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^116j8BWv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Medium credibility.

Contact dermatitis adjunct medical treatment (Summary Statement 43) indicates that in addition to avoidance of exposure, the physician should prescribe appropriate adjunct medical treatment [Strength of recommendation: Strong B Evidence]. TCS are widely accepted as the treatment of acute and chronic dermatitis, and TCS may be sufficient for localized lesions, but acute extensive and severe dermatitis such as extensive Toxicodendron dermatitis may need systemic therapy. The clinician should avoid the prolonged use of systemic steroids for management of chronic dermatitis. Ointments and potent fluorinated CS should be avoided on areas of thinner skin such as the intertriginous areas, eyelids and face, and in young children. The use of TCS over prolonged periods of time should be avoided and should not be a substitute for defining the etiology of the dermatitis, and if symptoms worsen, the possibility of contact sensitization to the CS itself, the vehicle, or other ingredients in the TCS should be considered.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^1176KLzb]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Toxicodendron dermatitis — symptomatic care evidence notes limited benefit of some measures. One study found that the combination of systemic corticosteroids and high-potency topical corticosteroids reduced the duration of itching, while the use of low-potency corticosteroids was not associated with symptom improvement. Although supported by little evidence, cool compresses and oatmeal baths are frequently recommended for symptomatic relief of itching from Toxicodendron dermatitis. Although oral antihistamines have been recommended as a treatment for local itching, few data support their use; an expert consensus and 2 review articles suggested the use of oral antihistamines for help with sleep at night but questioned their efficacy for itching, and one observational study enrolling 89 participants did not find a statistically significant reduction in symptoms with the use of oral antihistamine.

### Evaluation of dabigatran exposures reported to poison control centers [^117KPoss]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Dabigatran is a novel oral anticoagulant for which a well-defined range of toxicity and proven antidote has not been established.

Objective

The primary objective of this study was to characterize dabigatran exposures reported to poison centers by dose ingested, clinical effects, treatments used, and managment sites to gain a better understanding of patient outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective database review was conducted for dabigatran exposures reported to the National Poison Data System for the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) over the period October 2010 to December 2012.

Results

There were 802 human dabigatran exposures involving adults predominantly (91% of cases). Exposure chronicity was acute in 43%, acute-on-chronic in 46%, and chronic in 11%, with the most common reason for an exposure call being an unintentional therapeutic error (70.6%). The most common management sites were on-site in 72% of cases and within a health care facility for 26%. Bleeding events and coagulopathies were the most commonly observed clinical effects. Treatments administered included activated charcoal, blood and coagulation products, hemodialysis, and supportive measures. Confirmed outcomes included death in 13 patients (1.6%), major effects in 23 (2.9%), and moderate effects in 50 (6.2%). More severe outcomes were significantly associated with adverse drug reactions, patients ≥ 65 years of age, those treated with blood and coagulation products and/or dialysis, and renal dysfunction (P < .05). Children experienced few moderate effects and no major effects or deaths.

Conclusions

Severe outcomes from dabigatran exposures were not common, occurring in approximately 5% of cases.

### Treatment for calcium channel blocker poisoning: a systematic review [^113Hex8H]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

American Poison Control Centers report cardiovascular drugs as the substance category with the third fastest rate of increase in terms of exposures. According to the National Poison Data System, calcium channel blockers (CCB) were responsible for at least 11,764 exposures and 78 deaths in 2011 in the United States. This underestimates the real burden of such poisoning. A Canadian study of CCB poisoningsfound that a poison control center was consulted in only 74% of cases. In order to help clinicians to best treat CCB poisoning, the development of practice guidelines on the treatment of CCB poisoning is warranted.

Therefore, the goal of this systematic review was to document and characterize the available evidence to facilitate development of guidelines following the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology)and the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation) II statement.

### Increasing severity of medical outcomes and associated substances in cases reported to United States poison centers [^115H3mqN]. Clinical Toxicology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Poison centers provide free expert recommendations on the treatment of a wide variety of toxicological emergencies. Prior studies have called attention to the increasing complexity of cases reported to poison centers. We aimed first, to evaluate the trends in medical outcome severity, over a 15-year period in both the adult and pediatric populations. Second, we described the most frequently reported substances associated with major effect or death.

Methods

This is a retrospective review of exposures reported to the National Poison Data System from 1 January 2007 through 31 December 2021. All closed cases, for human exposures, reported during the study period were included. We assessed trends in frequencies and rates of medical outcomes and level of care received, among the adult (age greater than 19years) and pediatric (age 19years and younger) populations by reason for exposure.

Results

During the study period, the number of adult unintentional exposures resulting in major effect (37.4 percent) and death (65.3 percent) increased. The number of adult intentional exposures resulting in death increased by 233.9 percent and those resulting in a major effect increased by 133.1 percent. The rates of exposures resulting in major effect and death increased among both intentional and unintentional adult exposures. The number of pediatric unintentional exposures resulting in a major effect increased by 76.6 percent and the number of pediatric intentional exposures resulting in death and major effect increased by 122.7 and 190.1 percent, respectively. Moderate, major effect, and death rates increased in pediatric unintentional exposures and moderate and major effect rates increased in pediatric intentional exposures.

Conclusions

We found a worsening severity of medical outcomes in adult and pediatric cases reported to poison centers. Poison centers are increasingly managing complex cases. Monitoring trends in which substances are associated with severe outcomes is imperative for future strategic prevention efforts.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: a practice parameter update 2016 [^113y1EZQ]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Medium credibility.

Large local reactions — clinical course and management — are usually IgE mediated, almost always self-limited, and rarely create serious health problems; patients with prior large local reactions often have recurrences, and up to 10% might eventually have a systemic reaction. For patients with large local reactions, it is optional to prescribe injectable epinephrine for use if a systemic reaction occurs in the future, most need only symptomatic care and are not candidates for testing for venom specific IgE or venom immunotherapy (VIT), although increasing evidence shows VIT significantly reduces the size and duration of large local reactions and might be useful in those with frequent unavoidable reactions and detectable venom specific IgE; the decision to give VIT must be weighed against added cost and potential inconvenience. Supportive care can include cold compresses, oral antihistamines, and oral analgesics; although many physicians use oral corticosteroids for large local reactions, definitive proof of efficacy is lacking, and antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection (eg, fever, chills, or sweats).

Microscopic findings

The most characteristic and consistent microscopic finding in all 3 cases was yellow-to-brown discoloration of the cornified layer. This ranged from golden brown granules to a yellowish brown-to-orange discoloration extending into the epidermis. No decoration of the pigment was seen with Fontana-Masson and Perl iron stains. The degree of associated inflammation varied in each case. In case 1, there was focal spongiosis accompanied by a mild, perivascular, largely lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with rare eosinophils. Cases 2 and 3 demonstrated varying degrees of epidermal necrosis, homogenization of papillary dermal collagen, and a largely lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrate with karyorrhexis (Figs 3 and 5).

### Pattern of clopidogrel exposures reported to Texas poison centers during 1998–2004 [^115krJMx]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Information on the management of potentially adverse exposures to clopidogrel is limited.

Methods

This study examined the distribution of 582 clopidogrel exposures reported to Texas poison control centers during 1998–2004.

Results

Eighty-four percent of cases with a reported dose having a dose ≤ 150 mg. Management of 65% of the exposures occurred on site. Of those exposures with a final medical outcome, 73% were classified as no effect. Of those exposures to clopidogrel alone, the most frequent adverse clinical effects were vomiting (2.4%) and dizziness (2.4%). The most frequent treatments were decontamination by dilution (30%), food (12%), and activated charcoal (7%).

Conclusion

In the majority of potentially adverse clopidogrel exposures reported to poison control centers the doses are twice the recommended dosage or less. The outcome of such exposures are generally favorable, with few adverse clinical effects occurring.

### Role of chelation in the treatment of lead poisoning: discussion of the treatment of lead-exposed children trial (TLC) [^114gkcK4]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Lead exposure in children is one component leading to cognitive impairment. The Treatment of Lead-Exposed Children Trial (1994–2004) studied the effect of succimer in treating low levels of lead exposure (20–44 mcg/dL) in children 12 to 33 months old. While succimer was effective in reducing blood lead concentrations in the short term, treatment of blood lead levels did not result in any detectable improvement in a wide variety of measurements of cognitive or behavioral function. Furthermore, blood lead concentrations were not distinguishable between chelated and non-chelated individuals at 1 year. The most important treatment strategy is identification and termination of major sources of lead exposure.

### Therapeutic and toxic blood concentrations of nearly 1, 000 drugs and other xenobiotics [^112hqZV4]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In case of intoxications, the concentration of the ingested substance and/or metabolite in blood plasma much better predicts the clinical severity of the case when compared to the assumed amount and time of ingestion. Comparing and contrasting the clinical case against the data provided, including the half-life, may support the decision for or against further intensive care. In addition, the data provided are useful for the therapeutic monitoring of pharmacotherapies, to facilitate the diagnostic assessment and monitoring of acute and chronic intoxications as well as to support forensic and clinical expert opinions.

### Pyridostigmine bromide [^111gWMMY]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Important Administration Information

For Military Medical Use Only.

Treatment and Protection for Soman Exposure

Pyridostigmine bromide is for use as a pretreatment for exposure to soman nerve agent (see Treatment Timing). Pyridostigmine bromide alone will not protect against exposure to soman.

Atropine and Pralidoxime

The efficacy of pyridostigmine bromide is dependent upon the rapid use of atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM) after soman exposure.

Primary Protection

The primary protection against exposure to chemical nerve agents consists of wearing protective garments including masks, hoods, and overgarments designed specifically for this use.

Do not rely solely upon pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide and the antidotes atropine and pralidoxime to provide complete protection from poisoning by soman nerve agent.

Treatment Timing

Pyridostigmine bromide is to be administered as pretreatment before exposure to soman nerve agent [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If pyridostigmine bromide is taken immediately before exposure (e.g., when the gas attack alarm is given) or at the same time as poisoning by soman, it is not expected to be effective and may exacerbate the effects of a sublethal exposure to soman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Do not take pyridostigmine bromide after exposure to soman.

Administration with Food

Take pyridostigmine bromide 105 mg extended-release tablets with either a medium fat, medium calorie or high fat, high calorie meal to maintain efficacious pyridostigmine levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Administration with Alcohol

Pyridostigmine bromide 105 mg extended-release tablets should not be taken with alcohol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Experts consensus recommendations for the management of calcium channel blocker poisoning in adults [^1132PBQY]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

In situations in which there is symptomatic bradycardia or conduction disturbances, the workgroup suggested using atropine at a dose regimen of 0.5 mg every 3–5 minutes for few doses if needed. This suggestion is supported based on considerations that the therapy may temporarily help, is easily accessible, is inexpensive, and is associated with few risks.

Although fluid resuscitation is commonly used, no formal recommendation was made because no fluid repletion studies were found specifically for CCB poisoning. Nonetheless, the workgroup considered fluid administration as a first-line therapy and continued administration as long as the patient demonstrates evidence of fluid responsiveness (e.g. hemodynamic improvement based on hemodynamic parameters and monitoring devices such as echocardiography after receiving 10–20 mL/kg of crystalloid over 10–15 min).

Therapy for Patients Refractory to First-Line Treatments

For the therapy of CCB-poisoned patients refractory to first-line treatments, the workgroup suggests the use of

Incremental doses of high-dose insulin therapy (up to 10 U/kg/hr) if evidence of myocardial dysfunction is present (2D),
Pacemaker in the presence of unstable bradycardia or high-grade AV block, without significant alteration in cardiac inotropism (2D),
IV lipid-emulsion therapy (2D).

### Outsmarting poison ivy and other poisonous plants… [^116ysaxp]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

First comes the itching, then a red rash, and then blisters. These symptoms of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac can emerge any time from a few hours to several days after exposure to the plant oil found in the sap of these poisonous plants. The culprit: the urushiol oil. Here are some tips to avoid it. Tips for Prevention
- Learn what poison ivy, oak, and sumac plants look like so you can avoid them.
- Wash your garden tools and gloves regularly. If you think you may be working around poison ivy, wear long sleeves, long pants tucked into boots, and impermeable gloves.
- Wash your pet if it may have brushed up against poison ivy, oak, or sumac. Use pet shampoo and water while wearing rubber gloves, such as dishwashing gloves. Most pets are not sensitive to poison ivy, but the oil can stick to their fur and cause a reaction in someone who pets them.
- Wash your skin in soap and cool water as soon as possible if you come in contact with a poisonous plant.

The sooner you cleanse the skin, the greater the chance that you can remove the plant oil or help prevent further spread. Tips for Treatment Don't scratch the blisters. Bacteria from under your fingernails can get into them and cause an infection. The rash, blisters, and itch normally disappear in several weeks without any treatment. You can relieve the itch by:

- Using wet compresses or soaking in cool water.
- Applying over-the-counter topical corticosteroid preparations or taking prescription oral corticosteroids.
- Applying topical OTC skin protectants, such as zinc acetate, zinc carbonate, zinc oxide, and calamine dry the oozing and weeping of poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Protectants such as baking soda or colloidal oatmeal relieve minor irritation and itching. Aluminum acetate is an astringent that relieves rash. See a doctor if:

- You have a temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
- There is pus, soft yellow scabs, or tenderness on the rash.
- The itching gets worse or keeps you awake at night.
- The rash spreads to your eyes, mouth, genital area, or covers more than one-fourth of your skin area.
- The rash is not improving within a few weeks.
- The rash is widespread and severe.
- You have difficulty breathing.

### NIOSH fast facts: protecting yourself from poisonous plants… [^1141siA7]. CDC (2020). Medium credibility.

NIOSH Fast Facts: Protecting Yourself from Poisonous Plants April 2010 DHHS Publication Number 2010–118 Any person working outdoors is at risk of exposure to poisonous plants, such as poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. When in contact with skin, the sap oil of these plants can cause an allergic reaction. Burning these poisonous plants produces smoke that, when inhaled, can cause lung irritation. Workers may become exposed through:

- Direct contact with the plant
- Indirect contact
- Inhalation of particles containing urushiol from burning plants. First Aid If you are exposed to a poisonous plant:

- Immediately rinse skin with rubbing alcohol, poison plant wash, or degreasing soap or detergent, and lots of water.
- Rinse frequently so that wash solutions do not dry on the skin and further spread the urushiol.
- Scrub under nails with a brush.
- Apply wet compresses, calamine lotion, or hydrocortisone cream to the skin to reduce itching and blistering.
- Oatmeal baths may relieve itching.
- An antihistamine may help relieve itching.
- NOTE: Drowsiness may occur.
- In severe cases or if the rash is on the face or genitals, seek professional medical attention.
- Call 911 or go to a hospital emergency room if you have a severe allergic reaction, such as swelling or difficulty breathing, or have had a severe reaction in the past. Poisonous plants, from left to right: poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac. Images courtesy of U. S. Department of Agriculture. Protect Yourself
- Wear long sleeves, long pants, boots, and gloves.
- Wash exposed clothing separately in hot water with detergent.
- Barrier skin creams, such as lotion containing bentoquatum, may offer some protection.
- After use, clean tools with rubbing alcohol or soap and lots of water. Urushiol can remain active on the surface of objects for up to 5 years.
- Wear disposable gloves during this process.
- Do not burn plants or brush piles that may contain poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac.
- Inhaling smoke from burning plants can cause severe allergic respiratory problems.

### Patient information: poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac… [^1149LCQk]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

These 3 plants contain sap oil in their leaves, stems, and roots, which is released on contact and penetrates the skin to cause an itchy, red rash. Once urushiol is on the skin, it can be spread to other areas of skin by touch. People can also come into contact with urushiol by petting an animal that has sap oil on its fur. Rarely, urushiol can spread to other people through contact with clothing or objects that has urushiol on it. The rash caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac is red and bumpy in appearance, often arranged in streaks, and is very itchy. In severe cases, fluid-filled blisters may develop. The rash typically appears 24 to 48 hours after contact in people who were exposed to one of these plants in the past, with peak severity 1 to 14 days later. The rash can take up to 3 weeks to develop in individuals with a first exposure to one of these plants.

The rash caused by poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac typically resolves within 1 to 3 weeks. After contact with one of these plants, the whole body should be washed with a mild soap as soon as possible, and a brush should be used to scrub under the nails to remove urushiol before it is absorbed. Clothes and other items that may have been exposed to the sap oil should also be washed with warm, soapy water. Because pets may carry urushiol on their coats, they should be bathed if contact with poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac is suspected. Topical treatments to help decrease symptoms include wet compresses, calamine lotion, oatmeal baths, and astringents to dry a weeping rash. Steroid skin creams may reduce itching and blistering. Oral or intramuscular steroids may be prescribed for patients with severe blistering; rash on the face, hands, or genitals; or involvement of more than 20% of the skin.

Although antihistamines do not relieve itching caused by allergic contact dermatitis from poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac, they may improve symptoms by causing sedation.

### Poison ivy, oak and sumac contact dermatitis… [^112ZK2gt]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

The rash associated with contact dermatitis typically appears 24 to 48 hours after exposure in a previously sensitized person. This rash is usually self-limiting and resolves one to two weeks after exposure. Redness and intense pruritus also develop, followed by papules, vesicles and sometimes bullae. Lesions can appear in streaks, suggesting plant contact. Fluid from the lesions is not sensitizing to others. Complications include secondary bacterial infections and, rarely, erythema multiforme and urticaria. Management should include thorough washing with soap and water, preferably within 10 minutes of exposure, as this may prevent dermatitis. All contaminated clothes should be removed as soon as possible and cleaned. Frequent baths, using colloidal oatmeal, also relieve symptoms. Treatment of mild to moderate rash includes application of cool compresses or diluted aluminum acetate solution, such as Burow's solution, or calamine lotion.

Use of topical antihistamines and anesthetics should be avoided because of the possibility of increased sensitization. Early application of topical steroids is useful to limit erythema and pruritus. However, occlusive dressings should be avoided on moist lesions. Refractory dermatitis can be treated with oral corticosteroids such as prednisone, with an initial dosage of 1 mg per kg per day, slowly tapering the dosage over two to three weeks. Shorter courses of steroids may be followed by severe rebound exacerbations shortly after drug therapy is discontinued. Oral antihistamines may help reduce pruritus and provide sedation, when needed. The authors conclude that prevention requires educating patients to recognize the offending plants and to wear protective clothing when engaging in outdoor activities. Desensitization efforts are of uncertain value.

The success of topical barrier preparations is variable, but some, such as organoclay preparation, can limit response in exposed susceptible persons when applied to the skin at least 15 minutes before anticipated exposure. Application should be repeated every four hours if exposure is prolonged.
