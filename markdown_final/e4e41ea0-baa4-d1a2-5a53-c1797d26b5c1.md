## Question

Glaucoma pathophysiology

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about glaucoma pathophysiology. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and classification of glaucoma. Then, I should verify the central role of intraocular pressure and its biomechanics. Next, I will examine IOP-independent mechanisms, including vascular, neurodegenerative, and genetic contributors. After that, I need to consider disease-specific mechanisms in open-angle versus angle-closure glaucoma. Finally, I will integrate these into a unified model and outline clinical implications and knowledge gaps, making sure I double-check key claims against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't build on a shaky premise. Glaucoma is best understood as a heterogeneous group of chronic, progressive optic neuropathies unified by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, optic nerve head remodeling, and irreversible visual field loss, with intraocular pressure (IOP) as the only proven modifiable risk factor, though not universally elevated in all patients [^c5e88bef] [^2002a05f] [^b69b419e].

> Wait, let me verify the classification before proceeding. The two major categories are open-angle glaucoma, where the trabecular meshwork appears open on gonioscopy but outflow resistance is increased, and angle-closure glaucoma, where iridotrabecular contact obstructs aqueous outflow; both can be primary or secondary, and POAG predominates in Western populations while PACG is more prevalent in East Asia, which shapes both screening and treatment algorithms [^b69b419e] [^e432706b] [^05ca95bb].

> I will now examine the IOP-dependent mechanical pathway, but I should confirm the biomechanics at the lamina cribrosa. Elevated IOP creates a pressure gradient across the optic nerve head, compressing and deforming the lamina cribrosa, impairing axonal transport, and triggering RGC apoptosis; this mechanical stress is amplified by individual susceptibility of connective tissues and is the rationale for IOP-lowering therapy across all stages of disease [^c5e88bef] [^e432706b] [^f719b2f6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about IOP being the sole driver. I need to check IOP-independent mechanisms, starting with vascular dysregulation and ocular perfusion pressure. Impaired autoregulation, nocturnal hypotension, and low ocular perfusion pressure can cause ischemia at the optic nerve head, and circadian IOP peaks coupled with nocturnal blood pressure dips may compound injury; this helps explain progression in normal-tension glaucoma and in some patients despite adequate IOP control [^51328ae4] [^4c2a0906] [^36eef2ed].

> Next, I should review neurodegenerative cascades within RGCs and the visual pathway. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, protein misfolding, and neurotrophin deprivation converge on apoptotic pathways; importantly, neuroinflammation with microglial activation and astrocyte reactivity appears upstream and may perpetuate damage, aligning glaucoma with other CNS neurodegenerative diseases and motivating neuroprotective strategies [^42b39f4e] [^c697e03f] [^6e988f46].

> I need to ensure I incorporate genetic susceptibility, because it modulates both IOP-dependent and IOP-independent risk. Large-scale GWAS have identified dozens of loci for POAG, including an IOP-independent genetic component enriched for retinal microvascular features, and separate meta-analyses have highlighted loci specific to normal-tension glaucoma, reinforcing that neurodegenerative vulnerability and vascular biology contribute beyond simple IOP elevation [^7d1492e7] [^1edb3002] [^865a9842].

> Let me consider disease-specific mechanisms in open-angle glaucoma. The predominant problem is increased outflow resistance at the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal, with contributions from extracellular matrix remodeling, Rho/Rho-kinase–mediated contractility, and TGF-β signaling; clinically, this translates to chronic, often asymmetric optic neuropathy with characteristic cupping and RNFL thinning, and explains why IOP-lowering drops, laser trabeculoplasty, and surgery target outflow [^c3f9ae5c] [^80560de5] [^741ab541].

> Now, I should review angle-closure mechanisms carefully. Pupil block, iris dynamics with reduced volume loss on dilation, and choroidal expansion contribute to iridotrabecular contact and synechiae; anatomic risk factors include shallow anterior chamber, short axial length, and thick, anteriorly positioned lens, and these mechanisms justify iridotomy/iridectomy to relieve pupillary block and alter angle geometry [^73d55f13] [^5d17b2e2] [^05ca95bb].

> But wait, what if the injury begins even earlier than the optic nerve head? I should double-check translaminar pressure dynamics. The optic nerve is exposed to both IOP and intracranial pressure, and a larger translaminar pressure difference may increase susceptibility to deformation and ischemia; while evidence is observational and heterogeneous, it offers a plausible bridge between IOP and vascular-mechanical interactions and warrants cautious interpretation pending prospective data [^1d4dc7ab].

> Let me synthesize a unified model so I don't oversimplify. Glaucoma reflects a multifactorial interplay wherein IOP-related mechanical stress at the lamina cribrosa acts on a background of genetic vulnerability, vascular dysregulation, and intrinsic neurodegenerative programs; triggers converge on common injury cascades including mitochondrial failure, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation, producing RGC apoptosis and axonal degeneration with structural and functional deficits that may persist despite IOP control, which is why some patients progress despite "adequate" treatment [^c5e88bef] [^6e988f46] [^42b39f4e].

> I should confirm the clinical implications so the pathophysiology translates to care. IOP remains the only proven modifiable target, and randomized data show that lowering IOP slows progression across disease stages; however, individualized target IOPs, attention to IOP fluctuation, and recognition of vascular risk factors are essential, and emerging neuroprotective strategies remain investigational pending robust clinical evidence and reliable biomarkers of RGC injury [^c5e88bef] [^2596c03b] [^4f58d475].

> Hold on, I should verify key knowledge gaps and future directions so I don't overstate certainties. We need better early biomarkers to detect RGC loss before visual field defects, clearer integration of vascular risk into treatment algorithms, and definitive clinical trials of neuroprotection; advances in imaging of aqueous outflow, lamina cribrosa biomechanics, and retinal microvasculature, alongside genetic stratification, are likely to enable more personalized, mechanism-based care in the near term [^c5e88bef] [^aad7be80] [^f719b2f6].

---

Glaucoma is a **multifactorial optic neuropathy** characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and optic nerve damage, with intraocular pressure (IOP) as the only proven modifiable risk factor [^c5e88bef] [^e432706b]. The core mechanism is **mechanical stress at the lamina cribrosa** from elevated IOP, causing axonal transport blockade, ischemia, and apoptosis of RGCs [^f719b2f6] [^a078d9af]. IOP-independent factors — vascular dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and genetic susceptibility — also contribute, especially in normal-tension glaucoma [^51328ae4] [^42b39f4e] [^c697e03f] [^7d1492e7]. Angle-closure glaucoma adds **pupillary block and iris apposition** to obstruct outflow, while open-angle glaucoma involves trabecular meshwork dysfunction and increased outflow resistance [^05ca95bb] [^ef2b2e7f]. Despite IOP control, some patients progress, underscoring the need for neuroprotective strategies and individualized care [^c5e88bef] [^2596c03b].

---

## Mechanical stress and axonal injury

- **Lamina cribrosa deformation**: Elevated IOP compresses the lamina cribrosa, disrupting axonal transport and causing RGC apoptosis [^f719b2f6] [^a078d9af].
- **Axonal transport blockade**: Impaired transport of neurotrophins and mitochondria leads to energy failure and cell death [^a078d9af].
- **Biomechanical susceptibility**: Individual differences in lamina cribrosa and scleral properties modulate damage risk [^f719b2f6].

---

## Vascular factors and ischemia

- **Ocular perfusion pressure**: Low perfusion pressure (from high IOP or low blood pressure) causes ischemia and RGC loss [^9c218fd2] [^36eef2ed].
- **Autoregulation failure**: Impaired autoregulation renders the optic nerve head vulnerable to ischemia [^61140bcc].
- **Circadian effects**: Nocturnal IOP peaks and blood pressure dips increase ischemic risk [^4c2a0906].

---

## Neurodegenerative processes

- **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: Age-related mitochondrial decline increases RGC susceptibility to stress and apoptosis [^6822a94f] [^42b39f4e].
- **Oxidative stress**: Excess ROS damages proteins, lipids, and DNA, accelerating neurodegeneration [^2d4ffc4e].
- **Neuroinflammation**: Microglial activation and cytokine release promote RGC death [^c697e03f] [^d0fbe461].

---

## Genetic susceptibility

Genetic susceptibility includes **heritability**, as POAG is highly heritable, with multiple loci conferring risk [^7d1492e7] [^865a9842]. IOP-independent genetics also contribute, with GWAS identifying loci linked to NTG and vascular phenotypes [^1edb3002] [^865a9842].

---

## Specific mechanisms by glaucoma subtype

| **Glaucoma subtype** | **Primary mechanism** | **Additional contributors** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) | Trabecular meshwork dysfunction and increased outflow resistance [^ef2b2e7f] | - Vascular dysregulation <br/> - Mitochondrial dysfunction <br/> - Neuroinflammation [^51328ae4] [^42b39f4e] [^c697e03f] |
| Normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) | IOP-independent mechanisms dominate [^51328ae4] | - Vascular dysregulation <br/> - Low ocular perfusion pressure <br/> - Genetic susceptibility [^51328ae4] [^9c218fd2] [^865a9842] |
| Angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) | Pupillary block and iris apposition obstructing trabecular meshwork [^05ca95bb] | - Anatomic predisposition <br/> - Choroidal expansion <br/> - Plateau iris [^73d55f13] |

---

## Clinical implications and therapeutic strategies

- **IOP lowering**: The only proven strategy to slow progression; target IOP should be individualized [^c5e88bef] [^2596c03b].
- **Neuroprotection**: Experimental strategies targeting mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation are under investigation [^2bca3819] [^d0fbe461].
- **Personalized medicine**: Genetic profiling and biomarkers may guide risk stratification and therapy selection [^7d1492e7] [^42b39f4e].

---

Glaucoma pathophysiology reflects a **complex interplay** of mechanical, vascular, neurodegenerative, and genetic factors, with IOP as the key modifiable driver. Effective management requires IOP control tailored to individual risk, with ongoing research into neuroprotection and precision medicine to address progression despite treatment [^c5e88bef] [^2596c03b].

## References

### The pathophysiology and treatment of glaucoma: a review [^ed2e8883]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glaucoma is a worldwide leading cause of irreversible vision loss. Because it may be asymptomatic until a relatively late stage, diagnosis is frequently delayed. A general understanding of the disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment may assist primary care physicians in referring high-risk patients for comprehensive ophthalmologic examination and in more actively participating in the care of patients affected by this condition.

Objective

To describe current evidence regarding the pathophysiology and treatment of open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma.

Evidence Review

A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and manuscript references for studies published in English between January 2000 and September 2013 on the topics open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma. From the 4334 abstracts screened, 210 articles were selected that contained information on pathophysiology and treatment with relevance to primary care physicians.

Findings

The glaucomas are a group of progressive optic neuropathies characterized by degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and resulting changes in the optic nerve head. Loss of ganglion cells is related to the level of intraocular pressure, but other factors may also play a role. Reduction of intraocular pressure is the only proven method to treat the disease. Although treatment is usually initiated with ocular hypotensive drops, laser trabeculoplasty and surgery may also be used to slow disease progression.

Conclusions and Relevance

Primary care physicians can play an important role in the diagnosis of glaucoma by referring patients with positive family history or with suspicious optic nerve head findings for complete ophthalmologic examination. They can improve treatment outcomes by reinforcing the importance of medication adherence and persistence and by recognizing adverse reactions from glaucoma medications and surgeries.

### A critical discussion of the rates of progression and causes of optic nerve damage in glaucoma: international glaucoma think tank II: July 25–26, 2008, florence, Italy [^106792f4]. Journal of Glaucoma (2009). Low credibility.

The International Glaucoma Think Tank II brought together glaucoma clinicians and researchers from all over the world to discuss current practices in glaucoma diagnosis and management, and the neurobiology of glaucoma. The meeting focused on several themes, including rates of deterioration in glaucoma patients, mechanisms of optic nerve damage, and implications for treatment. Issues such as how to measure and integrate progression information into clinical practice, screening protocols, or trials were discussed, as were promising new technologies and limitations of currently available measurement tools. Clinical applications for genetic testing were considered. Study of the neurobiology of glaucoma continues to inform our understanding of underlying degenerative processes, as well as to introduce possibilities for early detection or prevention. Many questions regarding glaucoma pathophysiology and best treatment practices remain unanswered, but with continued research and discussion, we will advance our understanding of this disease and ensure that patients receive optimal care.

### Screening for primary open-angle glaucoma: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^2002a05f]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) pathophysiology and diagnostic considerations — the exact cause of POAG is not known and diagnosis of glaucoma is usually based on several tests that, when combined, evaluate the structure and function of the optic nerve and measure IOP. Persons with POAG may not have increased IOP; and increased IOP may not result in nerve damage and visual impairment, and many persons with glaucoma do not have symptoms. Once vision loss occurs — usually slow loss of side vision or peripheral vision — the optic nerve is already damaged, and when damage is severe enough, loss of vision impairs function and quality of life. Treatments that reduce IOP prevent the decline in the structure and function of the optic nerve caused by glaucoma, thus slowing the worsening of visual field loss. However, there is limited evidence that improvements in intermediate outcomes after treatment of open-angle glaucoma improve visual impairment, vision-related function, or quality of life, and the slowly progressive nature of glaucoma makes it difficult to evaluate treatment effectiveness and may lead to detection and treatment of many persons who will remain asymptomatic throughout their life (overdiagnosis and overtreatment).

### New paradigms in the mechanisms and management of glaucoma [^9003b24a]. Eye (2005). Low credibility.

During the last 30 years, the definition of glaucoma as been revised to eliminate the inclusion of intraocular pressure. Open angle glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world, but the proportion of those with the disease who become blind is low. Diagnostic methods for glaucoma need improvement. The pathogenetic steps to loss of neurons in glaucoma are increasingly understood and non-pressure lowering therapies are on the horizon.

### Normal tension glaucoma: review of current understanding and mechanisms of the pathogenesis [^51328ae4]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is an exception in the "glaucoma family" where the major risk factor, increased intraocular pressure, is missing. If not increased intraocular pressure, then what other causes can then lead to glaucomatous optic disc change and visual field loss in NTG? Several possibilities will be discussed. Among them a higher sensitivity to normal pressure, vascular dysregulation, an abnormally high translaminar pressure gradient and a neurodegenerative process due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the optic nerve sheath compartment. There are many excellent review papers published on normal tension glaucoma (NTG). The aim of this paper is therefore not to add another extensive review on NTG but rather to focus on and to discuss some possible mechanisms that are thought to be involved in the pathophysiology of NTG and to discuss the stronger and weaker aspects of each concept. The fact that several concepts exist suggests that NTG is still not very well understood and that no single mechanism on its own might adequately explain NTG.

### Glaucoma in adults-screening, diagnosis, and management: a review [^b69b419e]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic early in the disease course. Primary care clinicians should know which patients to refer to an eye care professional for a complete eye examination to check for signs of glaucoma and to determine what systemic conditions or medications can increase a patient's risk of glaucoma. Open-angle and narrow-angle forms of glaucoma are reviewed, including a description of the pathophysiology, risk factors, screening, disease monitoring, and treatment options.

Observations

Glaucoma is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by damage to the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer, that can lead to permanent loss of peripheral or central vision. Intraocular pressure is the only known modifiable risk factor. Other important risk factors include older age, nonwhite race, and a family history of glaucoma. Several systemic medical conditions and medications including corticosteroids, anticholinergics, certain antidepressants, and topiramate may predispose patients to glaucoma. There are 2 broad categories of glaucoma, open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression includes measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment of glaucoma involves lowering intraocular pressure. This can be achieved with various classes of glaucoma medications as well as laser and incisional surgical procedures.

Conclusions and Relevance

Vision loss from glaucoma can be minimized by recognizing systemic conditions and medications that increase a patient's risk of glaucoma and referring high-risk patients for a complete ophthalmologic examination. Clinicians should ensure that patients remain adherent with taking glaucoma medications and should monitor for adverse events from medical or surgical interventions used to treat glaucoma.

### Models of neural injury [^21ea5b58]. Journal of Glaucoma (2001). Low credibility.

A variety of methods can be used experimentally to model neural injury, and thus study the process that represents the major pathophysiology underlying glaucomatous optic neuropathy. These methods vary in difficulty, relevance to human glaucoma, and time course. There is no perfect model, partly because our understanding of the glaucomas is still incomplete. Nonetheless, research into the mechanisms underlying the optic neuropathy of glaucoma (as well as possible new treatments) is advancing rapidly because of the availability of a wide variety of models of neural injury.

### Risk factors and open-angle glaucoma: classification and application [^fb28ba8d]. Journal of Glaucoma (2007). Low credibility.

Decades of epidemiologic research into open-angle glaucoma have elucidated several risk factors related in some way to the disease. As more and more risk factors are identified, however, assessing their individual and collective contributions in a particular patient is becoming increasingly complicated. To help organize our knowledge of risk in glaucoma we first review some concepts of risk and then propose a scheme that places known risk factors into categories (state of the individual, ocular anatomy and physiology, signs of disease, non-glaucoma medications, and personal behaviors) and also indicates how each factor interacts with disease (incidence, prevalence, progression, therapy.) We also describe methods for using risk factors in clinical practice and describe ways that a large and complex body of knowledge can be applied to individual patients.

### Glaucoma [^e432706b]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on glaucoma:

- **Definition**: Glaucoma is a heterogeneous group of diseases associated with optic nerve damage due to chronically elevated intraocular pressure.
- **Pathophysiology**: Glaucoma is due to optic nerve damage secondary to raised intraocular pressure, older age, and genetic factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The overall prevalence of glaucoma in the US is 2.1%.
- **Risk factors**: Elevated intraocular pressure, older age, sub-Saharan African ethnic background, high myopia, and positive family history increase the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma. Hyperopia, older age, female sex, and East Asian ethnic background increase the risk of primary angle-closure glaucoma.
- **Disease course**: The progressive optic nerve damage (loss of retinal ganglion cells, optic cup enlargement, thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer, optic disc hemorrhages) due to chronically raised intraocular pressure and other factors leading to open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma results in visual field damage and irreversible blindness.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Successful iridotomy following topical and systemic medications helps in aborting an acute primary angle-closure attack in 42–72% of cases.

### Circadian rhythm and glaucoma: what do we know? [^4c2a0906]. Journal of Glaucoma (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The current understanding of circadian regulation disorders and their involvement in glaucoma pathophysiology are poorly understood, yet they may have a substantial impact on the onset and progression of glaucoma. Herein, we review and summarize all the available literature on circadian rhythm disorder and glaucoma to uncover the impact on glaucoma risk, and we highlight future research and potential novel targets for glaucoma management.

Materials and Methods

A review of the relevant literature was performed through PubMed through August 1, 2019.

Results

Within a normal circadian rhythm, intraocular pressure (IOP) peaks at night, whereas blood pressure (BP) troughs at night. High nocturnal IOP coupled with low nocturnal systemic BP results in low ocular perfusion pressure and potential for unobserved damage to retinal tissues and the optic nerve. Circadian-related melatonin and sleep disorders also result in changes in IOP and ocular perfusion pressure that lead to the progression of glaucoma. In addition, impaired perception of light input due to glaucoma can subsequently lead to abnormal serum levels of melatonin, resulting in circadian rhythm misalignment. This disruption of the circadian rhythm also contributes to sleep and mood disorders, common in individuals with glaucoma. As regards treatment, glaucoma medications that lower nocturnal IOP without influencing nocturnal BP or diminishing circadian variation seem most effective.

Conclusions

Glaucoma progression is influenced by multiple physiological factors regulated by the circadian rhythm. Progression of the disease may also cause physiological changes that lead to circadian-related issues. Further research is warranted on the diurnal cycle, melatonin-mediated processes, and their influence on glaucoma management.

### Glaucoma: now and beyond [^c5e88bef]. Lancet (2023). Excellent credibility.

The glaucomas are a group of conditions leading to irreversible sight loss and characterised by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. Although not always elevated, intraocular pressure is the only modifiable risk factor demonstrated by large clinical trials. It remains the leading cause of irreversible blindness, but timely treatment to lower intraocular pressure is effective at slowing the rate of vision loss from glaucoma. Methods for lowering intraocular pressure include laser treatments, topical medications, and surgery. Although modern surgical innovations aim to be less invasive, many have been introduced with little supporting evidence from randomised controlled trials. Many cases remain undiagnosed until the advanced stages of disease due to the limitations of screening and poor access to opportunistic case finding. Future research aims to generate evidence for intraocular pressure-independent neuroprotective treatments, personalised treatment through genetic risk profiling, and exploration of potential advanced cellular and gene therapies.

### The genetics of primary open-angle glaucoma: a review [^80e4a5a6]. Experimental Eye Research (2009). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is the major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), as the most prevalent form of glaucoma, is a complex inherited disorder and affects more than 2 million individuals in the United States. It has become increasingly clear that a host of genetic as well as environmental factors are likely to contribute to the phenotype. A number of chromosomal and genetic associations have been reported for POAG. This review examines what is currently known about the underlying genetic structure, what remains to be learned, and how this may affect our medical management of this major blinding disease.

### Neuroprotection in glaucoma-is there a future role? [^2bca3819]. Experimental Eye Research (2010). Low credibility.

In glaucoma, the major cause of global irreversible blindness, there is an urgent need for treatment modalities that directly target the RGCs. The discovery of an alternative therapeutic approach, independent of IOP reduction, is highly sought after, due to the indirect nature and limited effectiveness of IOP lowering therapy in preventing RGC loss. Several mechanisms have been implicated in initiating the apoptotic cascade in glaucomatous retinopathy and numerous drugs have been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of glaucoma. These mechanisms and their potential treatment include excitotoxicity, protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation and neurotrophin deprivation. All of these mechanisms ultimately lead to programmed cell death with loss of RGCs. In this article we summarize the mechanisms involved in glaucomatous disease, highlight the rationale for neuroprotection in glaucoma management and review current potential neuroprotective strategies targeting RGCs from the laboratory to the clinic.

2.2.3 Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma

Definition:

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy with characteristic morphological changes at the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre layer in the absence of other ocular disease or congenital anomalies. Progressive retinal ganglion cell death and visual field loss are associated with these changes.

Etiology:

The etiology of primary open angle glaucoma remains unclear. Multiple genetic factors and the influence of co-morbidities are likely to play a role.

Pathophysiology:

The current concept of how damage is elicited includes deformation of the lamina cribrosa caused by IOP levels that are not tolerated by the individual eye. This is thought to result in axonal damage with consequent apoptotic death of the retinal ganglion cells. A substantial proportion of patients develop POAG at IOPs within the normal range. Any increase in IOP is caused by elevated outflow resistance in the trabecular meshwork outflow pathways.

Treatment:

POAG is treated by reducing intraocular pressure using medication, laser or incisional surgery (See Ch 3). So far, there is no evidence for other suggested treatment modalities, e.g. neuroprotection or modifying blood flow.

### Dysfunctional regulation of ocular blood flow: a risk factor for glaucoma? [^61140bcc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Primary open angle glaucoma (OAG) is a multifactorial optic neuropathy characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell death and associated visual field loss. OAG is an emerging disease with increasing costs and negative outcomes, yet its fundamental pathophysiology remains largely undetermined. A major treatable risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Despite the medical lowering of IOP, however, some glaucoma patients continue to experience disease progression and subsequent irreversible vision loss. The scientific community continues to accrue evidence suggesting that alterations in ocular blood flow play a prominent role in OAG disease processes. This article develops the thesis that dysfunctional regulation of ocular blood flow may contribute to glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Evidence suggests that impaired vascular autoregulation renders the optic nerve head susceptible to decreases in ocular perfusion pressure, increases in IOP, and/or increased local metabolic demands. Ischemic damage, which likely contributes to further impairment in autoregulation, results in changes to the optic nerve head consistent with glaucoma. Included in this review are discussions of conditions thought to contribute to vascular regulatory dysfunction in OAG, including atherosclerosis, vasospasm, and endothelial dysfunction.

### Clinical characteristics of glaucoma patients with various risk factors [^05382eba]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study identified subgroups of glaucoma patients with differing risk factors. These patients tended to have unique phenotypes, and we found that they have risk factors that were IOP-independent. Our findings suggest that there is at least one category of glaucoma patients for whom different risk factors contribute to the pathophysiology of glaucoma, and that these patients may benefit from treatments that target these risk factors. We consider that mechanism-dependent treatment is a reasonable approach to glaucoma care, and that our approach to the clinical measurement of risk factors may open new avenues for the individual treatment of glaucoma.

### Open-angle glaucoma | AAFP… [^8b3907b2]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Pathophysiologically, glaucoma is a progressive optic nerve disease often associated with elevated intraocular pressure and characterized by optic disc cupping and visual field loss. Vision loss from glaucoma is asymptomatic and irreversible. 1 Aqueous is a clear fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. Aqueous is produced by the ciliary body, passes through the pupil, and drains through the trabecular meshwork. Impaired outflow of aqueous humor causes elevated intraocular pressure. In open-angle glaucoma, impaired outflow results from dysfunction of the drainage system. 3 In angle-closure glaucoma, impaired outflow results from occlusion of the anterior chamber angle itself, impairing access of the aqueous to the drainage system 3. Open-Angle Glaucoma Open-angle glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by acquired loss of retinal ganglion cells and atrophy of the optic nerve.

8 The pathophysiology of open-angle glaucoma includes a progressive decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells when nerve fibers at the point where the optic nerve exits the eye become pinched and die. This condition leads to thinning of the neural rim and progressive enlargement of the optic nerve cup. The loss of nerve fibers causes a permanently decreased visual field.
9. The only known causative risk factors for open-angle glaucoma are elevated intraocular pressure and insults to the eye, including trauma, uveitis, and steroid therapy. While steroid therapy of any kind may contribute to elevated intraocular pressure, 4 topical eye and periocular steroids seem most likely to increase pressure. 3 Associated risk factors, in addition to age, include black race, which increases the prevalence of glaucoma by a factor of four, and a positive first-degree family history, which increases the prevalence by a factor of seven. 1, 2, 4, 10.

SYMPTOMS Rarely do patients with glaucoma have symptoms. 4, 11 After loss of more than 40 percent of the nerve fibers, patients may notice a gradual loss of peripheral vision, or "tunnel vision. " 2, 4, 9, 10 Open-angle glaucoma usually is an incidental finding during an adult eye evaluation performed for other indications.
2. MEDICAL TREATMENT Intraocular pressure is the only treatable risk factor for open-angle glaucoma.

### Non-invasive electrophysiology in glaucoma, structure and function-a review [^f2b5fc5b]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary and Conclusion

Electrophysiology functional measures of vision provide an integral pivotal role in glaucoma management along with state-of-the-art ophthalmology technologies, i.e. optical coherence tomography/angiography as evidenced by the detection of early glaucoma and elucidations of damage mechanisms. Future directions employing longitudinally designed studies might corroborate the utility of multimodal approaches in the current standards of glaucomatous care for the sake of early implementation of therapy and prevention of blindness. The translation of multimodal approaches into practice might potentially add a major diagnostic dimension to the currently established tests in glaucoma as well as provide insights to several unanswered inquiries about glaucoma pathogenesis.

### Endothelin: is it a contributor to glaucoma pathophysiology? [^25ae56e3]. Journal of Glaucoma (2002). Low credibility.

Endothelin is a vasoactive peptide that has been shown to play an important role in vascular homeostasis. Recently, endothelin and its receptors have been found in ocular tissues where it appears to have a regulatory function. Endothelin is found in both the aqueous and vitreous humors and its concentration is elevated in glaucoma patients and in animal models of glaucoma. In the current review, the authors present information about the distribution of endothelin and endothelin receptors in the eye and the ocular actions of endothelins. Specifically, endothelin/aqueous humor dynamics, endothelin/nitric oxide interactions, endothelin and ischemia, and endothelin/optic nerve head effects. Observations concerning the potential role of endothelin in glaucoma pathophysiology is presented and discussed relative to its effects on the optic nerve head and in relation to glaucoma theories.

### Glaucoma [^0c800f1c]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Most medical practitioners have regular contact with adults who have one of the two forms of glaucoma: open-angle glaucoma or angle-closure glaucoma. Data from population-based surveys indicate that one in 40 adults older than 40 years has glaucoma with loss of visual function, which equates to 60 million people worldwide being affected and 8.4 million being bilaterally blind. Even in developed countries, half of glaucoma cases are undiagnosed. Glaucoma is mostly asymptomatic until late in the disease when visual problems arise. Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be recovered, and improved case-detection methods for glaucoma are needed. Glaucoma is commonly treated with daily eye-drop drugs, but adherence to treatment is often unsatisfactory. As a usually asymptomatic and chronic disease, glaucoma has similar treatment challenges to chronic systemic diseases. Similarities to the pathogenesis of common CNS diseases mean that common neuroprotective strategies might exist. Successful gene therapy, which has been used for other eye diseases might be possible for the treatment of glaucoma in the future.

### All roads lead to glaucoma: induced retinal injury cascades contribute to a common neurodegenerative outcome [^6e988f46]. Experimental Eye Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma describes a distinct optic neuropathy with complex etiology and a variety of associated risk factors, but with similar pathological endpoints. Risk factors such as age, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), low mean arterial pressure, and autoimmune disease, can all be associated with death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve head remodeling. Today, IOP management remains the standard of care, even though IOP elevation is not pathognomonic of glaucoma, and patients can continue to lose vision despite effective IOP control. A contemporary view of glaucoma as a complex, neurodegenerative disease has developed, along with the recognition of a need for new disease modifying retinal treatment strategies and improved outcomes. However, the distinction between risk factors triggering the disease process and retinal injury responses is not always clear. In this review, we attempt to distinguish between the various triggers, and their association with subsequent key RGC injury mechanisms. We propose that distinct glaucomatous risk factors result in similar retinal and optic nerve injury cascades, including oxidative and metabolic stress, glial reactivity, and altered inflammatory responses, which induce common molecular signals to induce RGC apoptosis. This organization forms a coherent disease framework and presents conserved targets for therapeutic intervention that are not limited to specific risk factors.

### Future directions… [^4b3331b9]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Based on the configuration of the anterior chamber angle of the eye, glaucoma is classified as open angle or closed angle, with a number of possible subdivisions. 1 This article reviews topical therapies for primary open-angle glaucoma, the most common form of the disease. Detailed reviews of the classification and pathogenesis of glaucoma are available elsewhere. 1–5. Efforts to prevent visual field loss caused by glaucoma have been hampered by the limitations of screening techniques 7 and uncertainties about the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease. 8–13 Based on our present understanding of the optic nerve damage that leads to visual field loss characteristic of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure is the sole risk factor amenable to current medical and surgical treatments.

Several trials sponsored by the National Institutes of Health are currently investigating the ability of glaucoma medications to preserve visual function and are assessing the role of surgical intervention as initial or subsequent therapy.
14. Glaucoma and IOP elevation are often erroneously considered synonymous. In actuality, glaucoma is characterized by damage to the optic nerve that results in visual field loss regardless of the IOP level at which the damage occurs. IOP is within the statistically "normal" range in more than one of six patients with glaucoma. Family physicians should be familiar with the primary pathway for the systemic absorption of topical glaucoma medications and the potential for side effects. Drugs administered to the eye pass rapidly through the nasolacrimal duct into the nose and then through the highly vascular nasal mucosa. Thus, they enter the systemic circulation without benefit of first-pass metabolism in the liver.

Brimonidine is approved for maintenance glaucoma treatment and may be suitable as monotherapy. The development of a prostaglandin suitable for clinical use in the treatment of glaucoma was previously hampered by the prevalence of ocular side effects, primarily conjunctival hyperemia. Like dipivefrin, latanoprost is a prodrug that produces the desired clinical effect with a more tolerable degree of ocular side effects. A possible genetic basis for treatment is also being investigated. Researchers are studying the role that a trabecular meshwork protein may play in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma. 30.

### Angle-closure glaucoma-simpler answers to complex mechanisms: LXVI edward Jackson memorial lecture [^73d55f13]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To present evidence-based concepts that will explain mechanisms of angle-closure glaucoma.

Design

Review of published evidence and personal perspective.

Methods

Literature review and clinical research using imaging devices.

Results

When the pupil dilates, the iris typically decreases its volume by losing extracellular fluid. Eyes with angle-closure lose less iris volume with pupil dilation, contributing to obstruction of the trabecular meshwork. Expansion of choroidal volume is a dynamic phenomenon and is a major risk factor in angle-closure. The mechanism of malignant glaucoma seems likely to result from poor conductivity of fluid through the vitreous, and past suggestions that it results from "misdirected" aqueous are not consistent with physiological principles.

Conclusions

Angle-closure and angle-closure glaucoma result from disturbed physiological mechanisms more than from simple anatomic measures, and future predictive testing can exploit knowledge of these factors.

### Intraocular pressure fluctuation and glaucoma progression: what do we know? [^458d29fe]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

While mean intraocular pressure (IOP) has long been known to correlate with glaucomatous damage, the role of IOP fluctuation is less clearly defined. There is extensive evidence in the literature for and against the value of short-term and long-term IOP fluctuation in the evaluation and prognosis of patients with glaucoma. We present here the arguments made by both sides, as well as a discussion of the pitfalls of prior research and potential directions for future studies. Until a reliable method is developed that allows for constant IOP monitoring, many variables will continue to hinder us from drawing adequate conclusions regarding the significance of IOP variation.

### Glaucoma: the retina and beyond [^fd1ce56b]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Summary

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying RGC loss is essential to the development of novel therapeutic interventions to slow or prevent glaucomatous degeneration. The growing recognition that glaucoma is a disease of the whole visual pathway and not just the retina has led to a recent expansion in the number and variety of techniques with the potential to permit the diagnosis of disease before onset of visual field defects. The difficulty of direct visualisation of RGCs in the retina has limited the early diagnosis of glaucoma, as considerable loss of RGCs occurs before disease symptoms manifest. The expense of brain-imaging technologies, recent controversies regarding the validity of fMRI investigations, and suggestion that brain changes occur downstream of those in the optic nerve and retina suggest that while these technologies are likely to provide interesting mechanistic insights into the disease process, they are unlikely to be adopted for the purpose of early diagnosis or screening of disease in the population. Progress towards the clinical translation of RGC specific contrast agents, including the DARC technology, therefore provides the most likely early diagnostic screening tool for glaucoma in the clinic. Finally, the increasingly recognised overlap in the mechanisms of neuronal loss in neurodegenerative disease suggests that a better understanding of glaucoma could inform the development of novel treatment paradigms for other neurodegenerative disorders (and vice versa), with recent studies providing tantalising evidence to suggest that the future of glaucoma therapies lie beyond the retina as the primary site of action, instead targeting the whole visual pathway.

### Pathophysiology of human glaucomatous optic nerve damage: insights from rodent models of glaucoma [^7cb97e8e]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

Understanding mechanisms of glaucomatous optic nerve damage is essential for developing effective therapies to augment conventional pressure-lowering treatments. This requires that we understand not only the physical forces in play, but the cellular responses that translate these forces into axonal injury. The former are best understood by using primate models, in which a well-developed lamina cribrosa, peripapillary sclera and blood supply are most like that of the human optic nerve head. However, determining cellular responses to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and relating their contribution to axonal injury require cell biology techniques, using animals in numbers sufficient to perform reliable statistical analyses and draw meaningful conclusions. Over the years, models of chronically elevated IOP in laboratory rats and mice have proven increasingly useful for these purposes. While lacking a distinct collagenous lamina cribrosa, the rodent optic nerve head (ONH) possesses a cellular arrangement of astrocytes, or glial lamina, that ultrastructurally closely resembles that of the primate. Using these tools, major insights have been gained into ONH and the retinal cellular responses to elevated IOP that, in time, can be applied to the primate model and, ultimately, human glaucoma.

### Neuroinflammation in glaucoma: a new opportunity [^c697e03f]. Experimental Eye Research (2017). Low credibility.

Mounting evidence suggests neuroinflammation is a key process in glaucoma, yet the precise roles are not known. Understanding these complex processes, which may also be a key in other common neurodegenerations such as Alzheimer's disease, will lead to targeted therapeutics for a disease that affects as many as 80 million people worldwide. Here, we define neuroinflammation as any immune-relevant response by a variety of cell types including astrocytes, microglia, and peripherally derived cells occurring in the optic nerve head and/or retina. In this review article, we first discuss clinical evidence for neuroinflammation in glaucoma and define neuroinflammation in glaucoma. We then review the inflammatory pathways that have been associated with glaucoma. Finally, we set out key research directions that we believe will greatly advance our understanding of the role of neuroinflammation in glaucoma. This review arose from a discussion of neuroinflammation in glaucoma at the 2015 meeting of The Lasker/IRRF Initiative for Innovation in Vision Science. This manuscript sets out to summarize one of these sessions; "Inflammation and Glaucomatous Neurodegeneration", as well as to review the current state of the literature surrounding neuroinflammation in glaucoma.

### 21st century glaucoma care [^09cb2659]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma care has evolved dramatically over the past generation, with changes that have incorporated new technology and improved understanding of the disease process. A major need is to construct a useful definition of glaucomatous optic neuropathy that can be used to compare data across clinical research studies. The treatment of glaucoma should now be based on achievement of a goal target for intraocular pressure, unique to each patient. Adherence with eye drop treatment is far from ideal and can be improved using reminder systems. Sustained delivery of glaucoma medication is on the horizon. New surgical approaches to glaucoma are being actively studied but have not as yet found their place in its care, with rigorous testing against present treatments needed.

### Lessons for glaucoma from other neurodegenerative diseases: can one treatment suit them all? [^8b48db33]. Journal of Glaucoma (2005). Low credibility.

The past decade has seen growing acceptance that glaucoma should be viewed as a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease. According to this view, in glaucoma (as in other such diseases), whatever the primary risk factors, at any given time some neurons are still healthy but are threatened with destruction owing to the toxicity emanating from the degenerating neurons. It follows that any intervention that protects surviving neurons and rescues the marginally damaged ones should slow down progression of the disease. This novel view of glaucoma prompted scientists to compare glaucoma with other neurodegenerative diseases with respect to mediators of disease progression and ways in which the spread of damage, or 'secondary degeneration', can be attenuated. Studies of partial crush injury of the rat optic nerve, a model of secondary degeneration established in our laboratory, led us to conceptualize the 'enemy within' as a flood of neurotoxic self-compounds issuing from the degenerating nerve. With this model, pharmacological and molecular approaches were employed to identify and test potentially therapeutic neuroprotective compounds and methodologies, leading us ultimately to the serendipitous discovery of protective autoimmunity as the body's defense against destructive self-compounds. Mediators of self-perpetuating acute and chronic degeneration identified in the injured optic nerve were also detected in other sites of central nervous system (CNS) damage. This finding led scientists to screen drugs that had proven to be beneficial in other disease models for their use in glaucoma therapy. It also opened the way to studies of the direct effects of these toxic mediators on retinal ganglion cell survival and ways to prevent the degenerative outcome. Although no single model can fully simulate human glaucoma or any other neurodegenerative disease, the availability of different models of optic nerve damage and the similarity of findings in the optic nerve and in other parts of the CNS have led to significant progress toward development of a cure for glaucoma.

### Imaging of aqueous outflow in health and glaucoma. justifying the re-direction of aqueous [^ef213af8]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Despite glaucoma being the most common cause of irreversible blindness in the world, comparatively little is understood of its pathophysiology. Treatment therefore empirically targets IOP reduction. Treatment selections are based on individual clinician opinion or preference rather than distinct clinical features of each patient. Greater knowledge of the aqueous outflow system is likely to contribute to individualised and precise glaucoma management. Despite its limitations, the use of HVI in multiple clinic-based studies has demonstrated the potential benefits of AO analysis and laid the foundations for future work.

HVI has confirmed AO findings that were first detected over 70 years ago, the importance of which were not fully appreciated until the recent introduction of MIGS. Redirection of aqueous drainage resulting from TBS is unpredictable, and will remain so, until a deeper understanding of glaucoma pathophysiology can be achieved. The justification of optimal stent placement within the nasal hemisphere, or even case selection based on aqueous outflow findings, is not yet possible. A collaborative approach combining detailed knowledge of each component of the aqueous outflow system, aided by emerging imaging technology, is required to expedite glaucoma diagnosis and optimise surgical outcomes.

### Patient information: glaucoma… [^a7fb902b]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Voelker R. What Is Glaucoma. JAMA. 2023; 330:

1594. doi: 10.1001/jama.2023.16311 Glaucoma is an eye disease that can cause blindness. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive disease involving damage to nerve fibers in the eye and the optic nerve, which transmits visual signals to the brain. Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, affecting about 3 million people in the US. Risk factors for glaucoma include older age, having a family history of glaucoma, and having increased pressure inside the eye. Some medical conditions, some infectious diseases, and certain medications are linked with glaucoma. Open-angle glaucoma accounts for more than 90% of cases of glaucoma, and it occurs when fluid in the eye is unable to drain properly.

Most people with open-angle glaucoma have no symptoms initially. As the disease progresses, patients can develop problems with peripheral vision and, sometimes, central vision, causing difficulty with reading, walking, and driving. Chronic angle-closure glaucoma is characterized by slow, progressive obstruction of fluid drainage from the eye. Patients with this type of glaucoma can have periodic visual symptoms, but they are often asymptomatic until the condition worsens, and they develop visual symptoms similar to open-angle glaucoma. Acute angle-closure glaucoma is caused by acute obstruction of fluid drainage from the eye, leading to blurry vision, halos around lights, eye pain, nausea, vomiting, and rapid vision loss. This type of glaucoma requires emergency treatment to decrease intraocular pressure and prevent rapid onset of blindness. Glaucoma is treated with medications or procedures to lower intraocular pressure.

The most commonly used topical eye drops for glaucoma are prostaglandin analogues. Other eye drop medications for glaucoma include β-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, α-agonists, and rho kinase inhibitors. Laser trabeculoplasty, a procedure that helps drain fluid from the eye, is another common treatment for open-angle glaucoma. A different laser procedure is performed for angle-closure glaucoma. Occasionally, patients undergo surgery to prevent worsening of glaucoma.

### Glaucoma 2.0: neuroprotection, neuroregeneration, neuroenhancement [^f95b5a44]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) associated with characteristic axon degeneration in the optic nerve. Clinically, our only method of slowing glaucomatous loss of vision is to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP), but lowering IOP is only partially effective and does not address the underlying susceptibility of RGCs to degeneration. We review the recent steps forward in our understanding of the pathophysiology of glaucoma and discuss how this understanding has given us a next generation of therapeutic targets by which to maintain RGC survival, protect or rebuild RGC connections in the retina and brain, and enhance RGC function.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction and glaucoma [^6822a94f]. Journal of Glaucoma (2009). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is increasingly recognized as a neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by the accelerated loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Open angle glaucoma prevalence and incidence increase exponentially with increasing age, yet the pathophysiology underlying increasing age as a risk factor for glaucoma is not well understood. Accumulating evidence points to age-related mitochondrial dysfunction playing a key role in the etiology of other neurodegenerative disorders including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. The 2 major functions of mitochondria are the generation of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation and the regulation of cell death by apoptosis. This review details evidence to support our hypothesis that age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction renders RGCs susceptible to glaucomatous injury by reducing the energy available for repair processes and predisposing RGCs to apoptosis. Eliciting the role of mitochondria in glaucoma pathogenesis may uncover novel therapeutic targets for protecting the optic nerve and preventing vision loss in glaucoma.

### Identifying potential key metabolic pathways and biomarkers in glaucoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^42b39f4e]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is the most common cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. This group of neurodegenerative diseases is characterised by progressive dysfunction and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons in the optic nerve. In the early phase visual loss is functionally compensated for by the overlapping visual fields between the two eyes, and cortical infilling, leaving the patient unaware of the vision loss. Additionally, there is a lack of cost-effective screening methods for early diagnosis. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical tests, including intraocular pressure (IOP), perimetry, gonioscopy and optical coherence tomography. None of these parameters alone offers high sensitivity or specificity for detecting glaucoma and need to be combined. There are no definitive biomarkers, and by the time symptoms appear, significant RGC loss has usually occurred.

Glaucoma risk factors include ageing, genetics and elevated IOP. While preclinical studies and clinical trials on neuroprotective strategies show promise, no treatments are available yet. The only validated treatment is lowering IOP through medication, laser or surgery. Despite successful IOP reduction, some patients continue to experience progression despite having normal IOP, suggesting that neurodegeneration in glaucoma is multifactorial and influenced by other factors. There is a pressing need to better understand these mechanisms to develop new treatments.

Increasing data indicate metabolic dysfunction, particularly of the mitochondria, as a key factor in neurodegeneration in glaucoma. The unmyelinated axons of the RGCs at the lamina cribrosa in the optic nerve head (ONH) are a primary site of RGC damage in glaucoma. Mitochondrial density is highest at this region.RGCs are highly metabolically active, with the bulk of their ATP generated via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), making them susceptible to mitochondrial abnormalities. OXPHOS dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA damage are two hallmarks of mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma. The resulting decrease in ATP production and increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the oxidative stress that drives neuronal degeneration in glaucoma. Underscoring the importance of mitochondrial function to RGCs is the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in several other neurodegenerative diseases which primarily affect RGCs, such as in Leber hereditary optic neuropathyand autosomal dominant optic atrophy. Given the critical role of mitochondrial function for RGC survival, understanding metabolic alterations is important for revealing the mechanisms of glaucomatous neurodegeneration.

### Estrogen deficiency accelerates aging of the optic nerve [^fee641d8]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive review on hormone-based pathophysiology of aging of the optic nerve and glaucoma, including a literature review and expert opinions. Glaucoma, a group of intraocular pressure-related optic neuropathies, is characterized by the slow progressive neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in irreversible visual sensitivity loss and blindness. Increasing evidence suggests that glaucoma represents the accelerated aging of the optic nerve and is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. This review highlights the high burden of glaucoma in older women and the importance of understanding the hormone-related pathophysiology of optic nerve aging and glaucoma in women. Strong epidemiological, clinical, and experimental evidence supports the proposed hypothesis that early loss of estrogen leads to premature aging and increased susceptibility of the optic nerve to glaucomatous damage. Future investigations into the hormone-related mechanisms of aging and glaucoma will support the development of novel sex-specific preventive and therapeutic strategies in glaucoma.

Acute angle closure glaucoma is an ocular emergency that is treatable with prompt and appropriate intervention. Recognition of this disease entity is sometimes difficult. We report a case of bilateral acute angle closure glaucoma in a 55-year-old, otherwise healthy individual, and discuss the different ways the condition may present. The anatomic and pathophysiologic progression leading to an event of angle closure is discussed and treatment modalities available to the Emergency Physician are presented.

### Non-invasive electrophysiology in glaucoma, structure and function-a review [^59761e1a]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a globally leading cause of irreversible blindness and is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell (RGC) changes associated with visual field (VF) loss that might end up in functional disability. The overarching goal of glaucoma management is the prevention of visual disability through the early detection of glaucomatous damage and monitoring its progression. Several tools are at hand that allows for reproducible assessment of functional visual loss. Static automated perimetry (SAP) is routinely used clinically for this purpose albeit variable and subjective. Important complements are objective measures of vision, i.e. ocular coherence tomography (OCT) and non-invasive electrophysiology. They are widely adopted in glaucoma research to provide reproducible quantitative surrogate markers and insights into the underlying pathophysiology via structural and vascular assessments (OCT) and functional read-outs (electrophysiology). This review evaluates recent insights in electrophysiology in glaucoma and highlights how glaucoma research and diagnostics benefit from combined approaches of OCT and electrophysiological investigations. We address this in three steps: after concise overviews of (i) OCT and (ii) non-invasive electrophysiology in glaucoma, we evaluate (iii) commonalities and complementarities of OCT and electrophysiology to further our understanding of glaucoma.

### Biological properties of trabecular meshwork cells [^1b7a2a4b]. Experimental Eye Research (2009). Low credibility.

The molecular and physiological mechanisms that lead to the progression of glaucoma are poorly understood. Despite the fact that glaucoma afflicts millions of people worldwide, research on the disease is limited by the current animal models that do not translate well to human forms of the disease. However, recent advances in culturing and manipulating human trabecular meshwork cells may provide a means to elucidate some of the mechanisms that cause glaucoma. This review focuses on the properties of trabecular meshwork cells, from their characteristic expression profile in vivo to their responsiveness to biochemical and biophysical signals in vitro. Hopefully the study of cultured trabecular meshwork cells will provide a better understanding of glaucoma and lead to new, much needed therapies.

### Assessing retinal ganglion cell damage [^30f58153]. Eye (2017). Low credibility.

Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss is the hallmark of optic neuropathies, including glaucoma, where damage to RGC axons occurs at the level of the optic nerve head. In experimental glaucoma, damage is assessed at the axon level (in the retinal nerve fibre layer and optic nerve head) or at the soma level (in the retina). In clinical glaucoma where measurements are generally limited to non-invasive techniques, structural measurements of the retinal nerve fibre layer and optic nerve head, or functional measurements with perimetry provide surrogate estimates of RGC integrity. These surrogate measurements, while clinically useful, are several levels removed from estimating actual RGC loss. Advances in imaging, labelling techniques, and transgenic medicine are making enormous strides in experimental glaucoma, providing knowledge on the pathophysiology of glaucoma, its progression and testing new therapeutic avenues. Advances are also being made in functional imaging of RGCs. Future efforts will now be directed towards translating these advances to clinical care.

### Glaucoma: the retina and beyond [^30338d35]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Over 60 million people worldwide are diagnosed with glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which is estimated to be responsible for 8.4 million cases of irreversible blindness globally. Glaucoma is associated with characteristic damage to the optic nerve and patterns of visual field loss which principally involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). At present, intraocular pressure (IOP) presents the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, although RGC and vision loss can continue in patients despite well-controlled IOP. This, coupled with the present inability to diagnose glaucoma until relatively late in the disease process, has led to intense investigations towards the development of novel techniques for the early diagnosis of disease. This review outlines our current understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying RGC and axonal loss in glaucoma. Similarities between glaucoma and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system are drawn before an overview of recent developments in techniques for monitoring RGC health is provided, including recent progress towards the development of RGC specific contrast agents. The review concludes by discussing techniques to assess glaucomatous changes in the brain using MRI and the clinical relevance of glaucomatous-associated changes in the visual centres of the brain.

### Is there any role for the choroid in glaucoma? [^2f76b12a]. Journal of Glaucoma (2016). Low credibility.

The choroid is part of the uveal tract and is a heavily vascularized bed that also contains connective tissue and melanin pigment. Given the role of the choroidal vasculature in the blood supply of the anterior laminar and prelaminar regions of the optic nerve head, the peripapillary choroid might be a relevant target for investigation in patients with glaucoma. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the current understanding of potential role of the choroid in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous damage.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) genetics and management — given the multifactorial nature of glaucoma, clinical management should be individualized, and multiple genetic loci have been implicated, with about 20 genetic loci (perhaps up to 100) associated with glaucoma and > 15 loci suggested to play a role in POAG. The clinical management of the condition should be individualized based on the susceptibility of the optic nerve and surrounding tissues, and variables associated with the delivery of care.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma [^008c1a93]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy that is characterized by the progressive degeneration of the optic nerve, leading to visual impairment. Glaucoma is the main cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, but typically remains asymptomatic until very severe. Open-angle glaucoma comprises the majority of cases in the United States and western Europe, of which, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common type. By contrast, in China and other Asian countries, angle-closure glaucoma is highly prevalent. These two types of glaucoma are characterized based on the anatomic configuration of the aqueous humour outflow pathway. The pathophysiology of POAG is not well understood, but it is an optic neuropathy that is thought to be associated with intraocular pressure (IOP)-related damage to the optic nerve head and resultant loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). POAG is generally diagnosed during routine eye examination, which includes fundoscopic evaluation and visual field assessment (using perimetry). An increase in IOP, measured by tonometry, is not essential for diagnosis. Management of POAG includes topical drug therapies and surgery to reduce IOP, although new therapies targeting neuroprotection of RGCs and axonal regeneration are under development.

### Mechanisms of retinal ganglion cell injury and defense in glaucoma [^e9f1b7b0]. Experimental Eye Research (2010). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a disease in which retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) die leading ultimately to blindness. Over the past decade and a half, information has begun to emerge regarding specific molecular responses of the retina to conditions of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It is now clear that the state of the RGC in glaucoma depends on a balance of pro-survival and pro-death pathways in the retina and details of these responses are still being worked out. In this review, we will discuss the evidence supporting the involvement of specific apoptotic cascades as well as the insults that trigger RGC apoptosis. In addition, we will present evidence supporting the existence of endogenous protective mechanisms as well as exogenous neuroprotective strategies.

### The genetic mechanisms of primary angle closure glaucoma [^a3f2a007]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG) is one of the most common types of glaucoma affecting over 15 million individuals worldwide. Family history and ethnicity are strongly associated with the development of the disease, suggesting that one or more genetic factors contribute to PACG. Although strictly heritable disease-causing mutations have not been identified, a number of recent association studies have pointed out genetic factors that appear to contribute to an individual's risk to develop PACG. In addition, genetic factors have been identified that modify PACG endophenotypes for example, axial length. Herein we review the current literature on this important topic.

### Current perspective of neuroprotection and glaucoma [^2c37c2cb]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide and is most notably characterized by progressive optic nerve atrophy and advancing loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The main concomitant factor is the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). Existing treatments are focused generally on lowering IOP. However, both RGC loss and optic nerve atrophy can independently occur with IOP at normal levels. In recent years, there has been substantial progress in the development of neuroprotective therapies for glaucoma in order to restore vital visual function. The present review intends to offer a brief insight into conventional glaucoma treatments and discuss exciting current developments of mostly preclinical data in novel neuroprotective strategies for glaucoma that include recent advances in noninvasive diagnostics going beyond IOP maintenance for an enhanced global view. Such strategies now target RGC loss and optic nerve damage, opening a critical therapeutic window for preventative monitoring and treatment.

### Iris and its relevance to angle closure disease: a review [^5d17b2e2]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment, and primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) affects Asians disproportionately. Whereas advances in ocular imaging have identified several anatomical risk factors, our ability to predict PACG still requires considerable improvement. The iris plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of angle closure disease, either through a mechanical or vascular mechanism. Irises of closed-angle eyes inhibit vastly different structural constituents as compared with those of open-angle eyes, thereby effecting variations in biomechanical properties and iris fluid conductivity. The clinical consequences include a smaller change in iris volume on pupil dilation in closed-angle eyes, thereby bringing the iris and trabecular meshwork closer in apposition. In this review, we summarise the potential role of the iris in the pathogenesis of angle closure disease.

### Helicobacter pylori infection and primary open-angle glaucoma: is there a connection? [^1e502f5c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Glaucoma, the most common form of which is primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is a neurodegenerative disease which is the second most common cause of blindness worldwide. Among the factors that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of this disease is infection with Helicobacter pylori. This alleged association has caused a great deal of scientific discussion during the past decade, as the establishment of such a correlation might lead to therapeutic applications for all glaucoma patients. In this review, we assess all relevant major studies and trials in an effort to elucidate the issue.

### Role of the rho GTPase / rho kinase signaling pathway in pathogenesis and treatment of glaucoma: bench to bedside research [^c3f9ae5c]. Experimental Eye Research (2017). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be a predominant risk factor for primary open angle glaucoma, the most prevalent form of glaucoma. Although the etiological mechanisms responsible for increased IOP are not completely clear, impairment in aqueous humor (AH) drainage through the conventional or trabecular pathway is recognized to be a primary cause in glaucoma patients. Importantly, lowering of IOP has been demonstrated to reduce progression of vision loss and is a mainstay of treatment for all types of glaucoma. Currently however, there are limited therapeutic options available for lowering IOP especially as it relates to enhancement of AH outflow through the trabecular pathway. Towards addressing this challenge, bench and bedside research conducted over the course of the last decade and a half has identified the significance of inhibiting Rho kinase for lowering IOP. Rho kinase is a downstream effector of Rho GTPase signaling that regulates actomyosin dynamics in numerous cell types. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that inhibition of Rho kinase lowers IOP via relaxation of the trabecular meshwork which enhances AH outflow. By contrast, activation of Rho GTPase/Rho kinase signaling in the trabecular outflow pathway increases IOP by altering the contractile, cell adhesive and permeability barrier characteristics of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal tissues, and by influencing extracellular matrix production and fibrotic activity. This article, written in honor of the late David Epstein, MD, summarizes findings from both basic and clinical studies that have been instrumental for recognition of the importance of the Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathway in regulation of AH outflow, and in the development of Rho kinase inhibitors as promising IOP- lowering agents for glaucoma treatment.

### Neuroprotective agents in the management of glaucoma [^913841ed]. Eye (2018). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy, specifically a neurodegenerative disease characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. The pathogenesis of RGC loss in glaucoma remains incompletely understood and a broad range of possible mechanisms have been implicated. Clinical evidence indicates that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) does not prevent progression in all patients; therefore, risk factors other than those related to IOP are involved in the disease. The need for alternative, non-IOP-lowering treatments focused at preventing progression, that is, neuroprotectants, has become of interest to both the patient and the physician. Experimental evidence accumulated during the past two decades lend a great deal of support to molecules endowed with neuroprotective features. However, translation to the clinic of the latter drugs results unsuccessful mostly because of the lack of reliable in vivo measure of retinal damage, thus hampering the good therapeutic potential of neuroprotective agents given alone or as adjuvant therapy to IOP-lowering agents. Further research effort is needed to better understand the mechanisms involved in glaucoma and the means to translate into clinic neuroprotective drugs.

### Targeting mitochondrial dysfunction: innovative strategies to combat glaucoma neuroinflammation [^d0fbe461]. Experimental Eye Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Glaucomatous optic neuropathy represents a prevalent optic nerve degenerative disease. Neuroinflammation is recognized as a significant mechanism underlying optic nerve damage in glaucoma; however, the precise mechanisms driving neuroinflammation remain largely elusive. Existing studies have indicated that microglia-driven neuroinflammation is pivotal for neuroinflammation onset and progression. Mitochondrial dysfunction, encompassing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, metabolic deficiencies, and quality control impairments, is upstream of microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Thus, a deeper comprehension of the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and microglial activation in glaucoma may provide valuable insights into the underlying pathogenesis. As a result of these findings, promising avenues for developing effective interventions to mitigate optic nerve damage and preserve visual function in glaucoma patients have been identified.

### Primary open-angle glaucoma [^8a3ba7b2]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy and, perhaps, the most common form of glaucoma. Because the disease is treatable, and because the visual impairment caused by glaucoma is irreversible, early detection is essential. Early diagnosis depends on examination of the optic disc, retinal nerve fibre layer, and visual field. New imaging and psychophysical tests can improve both detection and monitoring of the progression of the disease. Recently completed long-term clinical trials provide convincing evidence that lowering intraocular pressure prevents progression at both the early and late stages of the disease. The degree of protection is related to the degree to which intraocular pressure is lowered. Improvements in therapy consist of more effective and better-tolerated drugs to lower intraocular pressure, and more effective surgical procedures. New treatments to directly treat and protect the retinal ganglion cells that are damaged in glaucoma are also in development.

### Relationship between ciliary blood flow and aqueous production: does it play a role in glaucoma therapy? [^c3576a87]. Journal of Glaucoma (2006). Low credibility.

This review will summarize the authors' recent studies of the relationship between ciliary blood flow and aqueous production, and discuss the relevance of that relationship to the mechanisms of action of glaucoma drugs that lower intraocular pressure by inhibiting aqueous production. The ciliary processes are not easily accessible, and so the data presented necessarily come from animals and from instrumentation operated at its engineering limits. Verification of the findings in humans, and perhaps refinement of the interpretations, must await future advances in technology. Nonetheless, the results to date are intriguing, and may help explain some paradoxes in glaucoma pharmacology.

### The immune response in glaucoma: a perspective on the roles of oxidative stress [^b34a67e0]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

Neurodegenerative insults and glial activation during glaucomatous neurodegeneration initiate an immune response to restore tissue homeostasis and facilitate tissue cleaning and healing. However, increasing risk factors over a chronic and cumulative period may lead to a failure in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune response pathways and represent a route for conversion of the beneficial immunity into a neuroinflammatory degenerative process contributing to disease progression. Oxidative stress developing through the pathogenic cellular processes of glaucoma, along with the aging-related component of oxidative stress, likely plays a critical role in shifting the physiological equilibrium. This review aims to provide a perspective on the complex interplay of cellular events during glaucomatous neurodegeneration by proposing a unifying scheme that integrates oxidative stress-related risk factors with the altered regulation of immune response in glaucoma.

### Current perspective of neuroprotection and glaucoma [^104078c6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Existing available glaucoma diagnostics, medications, and therapies need further advancement, especially if visual loss of any kind is to be eliminated. Diagnostics are now taking into consideration a variety of structural and pathological developments within the retina to identify the early onset and progression of glaucoma with a critical focus on RGC loss and degeneration moving beyond conventional IOP measurement diagnostic alone. With this in mind, the early and accurate identification of glaucoma, providing a longer, critical therapeutic window is fundamental to reduce and halt progression. This can be achieved through neuroprotection and neuroenhancement as the next exciting step into the future of glaucoma treatment with an emphasis on early prevention.

### Current perspective of neuroprotection and glaucoma [^b50ea8c3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide, with an estimated 8.4 million people suffering from blindness in 2010 alone, accounting for 21% of total blindness in the world today, and it is estimated that the number of those with glaucoma worldwide will rise to 79.6 million by the year 2020. Glaucoma is considered a progressive neurodegenerative eye disorder with varied symptoms most notably characterized in earlier stages by the degeneration and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons, leading to optic neuropathy and visual field loss. This occurs through the loss of function and death of RGC through initially the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis). In later stages of the disease, progression includes neuronal loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus and visual cortex. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered to be one of the key factors in glaucoma; however, elevated IOP is typically followed by the appearance of structural damage at the optic nerve head, including neuroretinal rim thinning, cupping of the optic disc, and sectoral retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, indicating the pathological progression of the disease within the retina as a whole.

The best known classification of glaucoma relies on the anatomy of the anterior chamber and the drainage pathway (open and narrow angles). It is usually categorized as primary or secondary, based on several combined pathologies including comorbid conditions such as infection, mechanical injury, or neovascularization that often affect a single eye alone. In addition, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) can present with high and low IOPs, with the latter termed "normal tension glaucoma" representing 40% of patients with POAG. Furthermore, there is increasing recognition that even significant lowering of IOP may be insufficient to prevent visual loss in some patients. Therefore, alternative treatments besides lowering IOP, especially via prevention of neuronal cell loss, are now being investigated with an emphasis on neuroprotection to slow down the progression of glaucoma. Most data cited are obtained from preclinical studies.

The present review will 1) give a brief overview of the current treatments aiming to maintain IOP, 2) discuss neuroprotective and neuroregenerative strategies targeting RGC loss and the prevention of optic nerve damage, and 3) introduce new advances in diagnostic technologies.

### European Glaucoma Society-terminology and guidelines for glaucoma, 6th edition [^72ef1375]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

We practice medicine in times of exponentially increasing medical knowledge. In 1950, it was estimated that the doubling time was 50 years; by 1980, it was 7 years and by 2010, 3.5 years. In 2020, it was projected to be just 73 days! To continue to practice evidence-based medicine and to provide the best possible care for our patients, clinicians need to adapt their strategies to keep their knowledge up to date. There will always be a role for critical appraisal of individual studies in the field of a clinician's practice, but with such an increase in the volume of published research, it becomes impossible to appraise all relevant material. For this reason, sources of distilled knowledge, such as the EGS Guidelines, become essential references for best practice medicine.
Rigorous methods for evidence synthesis, such as the systematic reviews overseen by Cochrane, provide a comprehensive summary of the current state of knowledge for important clinical questions. However, for many clinical uncertainties, there is little or no high-quality evidence, let alone an evidence synthesis. Where evidence is lacking, practice guidance needs to be built from expert opinion and consensus, while acknowledging the limitations of such an approach. Expert opinion, derived from sound medical knowledge and years of practice experience, also has an important role in understanding the relevance of lines of evidence and the nuances of implementing them in practice. Thus, the expert commentary around the evidence base given in these Guidelines is essential for proper implementation of published evidence. Importantly, the EGS Guidelines also include 'Choosing wisely' elements indicating actions which should be avoided due to insufficient evidence and/or unsubstantiated belief.
Guidelines need regular updating to take account of new knowledge and aspects of clinical care that have not been given sufficient emphasis in the past. This 6th Edition of the EGS Guidelines includes an updated 'evidence based' section with new clinical questions and evidence-based answers. The section 'What matters to patients' has also been updated, recognising that, because Guidelines are typically written by clinicians for clinicians, there have been gaps in understanding the patient perspective. The updated section now has direct input from the Expert by Experience patient advisors in the EGS Patient Involvement Project and includes eight Tips for Doctors in their communication with patients.
The Guidelines team, led by Drs Pazos, Traverso and Viswanathan, is to be congratulated for the 6th Edition of the Guidelines, updating and enhancing the previous edition, while maintaining the highly success format which gives a framework for glaucoma care, based on evidence synthesis and consensus expert opinion, and presented as a 'How to' manual for patient diagnosis and management.

### GWAS-by-subtraction reveals an IOP-independent component of primary open angle glaucoma [^1edb3002]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The etiology of primary open angle glaucoma is constituted by both intraocular pressure-dependent and intraocular pressure-independent mechanisms. However, GWASs of traits affecting primary open angle glaucoma through mechanisms independent of intraocular pressure remains limited. Here, we address this gap by subtracting the genetic effects of a GWAS for intraocular pressure from a GWAS for primary open angle glaucoma to reveal the genetic contribution to primary open angle glaucoma via intraocular pressure-independent mechanisms. Seventeen independent genome-wide significant SNPs were associated with the intraocular pressure-independent component of primary open angle glaucoma. Of these, 7 are located outside known normal tension glaucoma loci, 11 are located outside known intraocular pressure loci, and 2 are novel primary open angle glaucoma loci. The intraocular pressure-independent genetic component of primary open angle glaucoma is associated with glaucoma endophenotypes, while the intraocular pressure-dependent component is associated with blood pressure and vascular permeability. A genetic risk score for the intraocular pressure-independent component of primary open angle glaucoma is associated with 26 different retinal micro-vascular features, which contrasts with the genetic risk score for the intraocular pressure-dependent component. Increased understanding of these intraocular pressure-dependent and intraocular pressure-independent components provides insights into the pathogenesis of glaucoma.

### Glaucoma: the retina and beyond [^f774ff9d]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and is associated with characteristic damage to the optic nerve and patterns of visual field loss due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. Intraocular pressure (IOP) is regarded as the major risk factor. There are estimated to be over 60 million people worldwide with glaucomatous optic neuropathy of which 8.4 million are blind. The global incidence of glaucoma is anticipated to increase to 76 million by 2020 and 111.8 million by 2040. Glaucoma is an umbrella term encompassing various subtypes of the condition, but the structural damage to the optic nerve is common throughout. The formal definition of clinical glaucoma as suggested by Casson et al. is:

"a group of ocular disorders of multifactorial aetiology united by a clinically characteristic optic neuropathy with potentially progressive, clinically visible changes at the optic nerve head (ONH), comprising focal or generalized thinning of the neuroretinal rim with excavation and enlargement of the optic cup, representing neurodegeneration of retinal ganglion cell axons and deformation of the lamina cribrosa; corresponding diffuse and localized nerve - fibre - bundle pattern visual field loss may not be detectable in early stages; while visual acuity is initially spared, progression can lead to complete loss of vision; the constellation of clinical features is diagnostic"

Appendix 3 — gaps in research evidence for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) identifies potential areas for future research, including research to develop more sensitive and reliable indicators for glaucoma progression; develop clinically useful measures of ocular perfusion pressure and its influence on glaucoma progression; further evaluate the utility of anterior segment-optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), including longitudinal studies to determine the significance of eyes classified to have closed angles by AS-OCT but open by gonioscopy; investigate the use of self-tonometry for the measurement of diurnal intraocular pressure fluctuation; evaluate the complex relationship between glaucoma medication and ocular surface disease; identify medication persistence rates in patients with glaucoma at different stages of disease progression; identify the optimal strategy to detect RNFL progression with the RNFL thickness map; investigate the utility and validity of clinical testing outside the office setting (home monitoring); develop new visual field parameters aimed at reducing variability and improving patient acceptance; compare current medical treatments with surgery, particularly for people with severe glaucoma and in ethnic groups; determine how best to apply rate of change information to the individual ocular hypertensive patient; investigate the role of deep layer microvasculature damage in the pathophysiology of glaucoma; assess the sensitivity and specificity of telehealth screening and management services for patients with POAG; and evaluate the impact of diet/lifestyle on risks for POAG.

### Targeting transforming growth factor-β signaling in primary open-angle glaucoma [^80560de5]. Journal of Glaucoma (2017). Low credibility.

Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) may play a role in the pathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Elevated levels of TGF-β are found in the aqueous humor and in reactive optic nerve astrocytes in patients with glaucoma. In POAG, aqueous humor outflow resistance at the trabecular meshwork (TM) leads to increased intraocular pressure and retinal ganglion cell death. It is hypothesized that TGF-β increases outflow resistance by altering extracellular matrix homeostasis and cell contractility in the TM through interactions with other proteins and signaling molecules. TGF-β may also be involved in damage to the optic nerve head. Current available therapies for POAG focus exclusively on lowering intraocular pressure without addressing extracellular matrix homeostasis processes in the TM. The purpose of this review is to discuss possible therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-β in the treatment of POAG. Herein, we describe the current understanding of the role of TGF-β in POAG pathophysiology, and examine ways TGF-β may be targeted at the levels of production, activation, downstream signaling, and homeostatic regulation.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^5a97d750]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) — definition, intraocular pressure (IOP) risk, and normal tension glaucoma (NTG) distinctions are outlined: POAG is described as a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with an open angle and no other overt disease, characterized by acquired atrophy of the optic nerve head (ONH) and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their axons. Large-scale population studies report mean human IOP is about 16 mmHg, and POAG risk increases in the presence of IOP in excess of two standard deviations above this mean or 21 mmHg; however, elevated IOP by itself is not necessary and sufficient to make the diagnosis. NTG is a subtype of POAG in which elevated IOPs outside of the "normal range" are never clinically observed, and they differ primarily in that the level of IOP is the predominant risk factor in POAG while additional IOP-independent factors take increasing importance in NTG.

### Literature review and meta-analysis of translaminar pressure difference in open-angle glaucoma [^1d4dc7ab]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence in the literature regarding translaminar pressure difference's (TPD) role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. The optic nerve is exposed not only to intraocular pressure in the eye, but also to intracranial pressure (ICP), as it is surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid in the subarachnoid space. Although pilot studies have identified the potential importance of TPD in glaucoma, limited available data currently prevent a comprehensive description of the role that TPD may have in glaucomatous pathophysiology. In this review, we present all available qualified data from a systematic review of the literature of the role of TPD in open-angle glaucoma (OAG). PubMed (Medline), OVID Medline, ScienceDirect, SpringerLink, and all available library databases were reviewed and subsequent meta-analysis of pooled mean differences are presented where appropriate. Five papers including 396 patients met criteria for inclusion to the analysis. Importantly, we included all observational studies despite differences in ICP measurement methods, as there is no consensus regarding best-practice ICP measurements in glaucoma. Our results show that not only TPD is higher in glaucoma patients compared with healthy subjects, it is related to structural glaucomatous changes of the optic disc. Our analysis suggests further longitudinal prospective studies are needed to investigate the influence of TPD in OAG, with a goal of overcoming methodological weaknesses of previous studies.

### Recent advances in OCT imaging of the lamina cribrosa [^f719b2f6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Loss of vision in glaucoma occurs due to damage to retinal ganglion cell axons. This damage is believed to initiate at the level of the lamina cribrosa (LC), a network of connective tissue beams that provide structural and nutritional support to the retinal ganglion cell axons as they traverse the optic nerve head (ONH) to the brain. The resulting glaucomatous damage is characterised by distinctive changes in the ONH and patterns of visual field loss. Clinically, the disease is monitored by examining ONH morphology for signs of glaucomatous optic neuropathy, which if untreated will be recognised as a progressive deepening and enlarging of the cup and thinning of the neuroretinal rim.

Although the pathophysiology of the disease is still not completely understood, it is clear that glaucoma is a multifactorial disease with substantial variability in individual susceptibility and speed of progression. Despite decades of study, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) remains the only modifiable risk factor for slowing the progression of disease, regardless of whether or not the IOP is elevated. Hence, to further understand the pathogenesis of glaucoma, improve diagnosis and enable novel means for preventing or treating glaucoma, it is of interest to understand the effects of IOP on the ONH, and in particular the biomechanics of the LC and surrounding sclera. Furthermore, it is necessary to understand how these effects vary from one individual to another, as well as how they may change with disease or ageing.

Recent advances in optical coherence tomography (OCT) have made it possible to image in vivo the deep structures of the ONH, and in particular the LC.OCT has been widely adopted for clinical care to objectively assess small-scale changes in the eye, most commonly for retinal pathology but increasingly for glaucoma diagnosis and monitoring purposes. In glaucoma, OCT-derived structural parameters such as retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and macular ganglion cell complex thicknesses have shown promise for early glaucoma detection and assessing glaucoma progression. It is hoped that glaucoma diagnosis and risk management could be improved if additional structural information from the LC could be extracted using the same OCT scans — but this remains an imaging challenge.

The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in OCT imaging of the LC, in the technology, processing and analysis, and the impact these will have on our ability for diagnosing and monitoring glaucoma as well as expanding our understanding of its pathophysiology.

Foreword

The only time is now. Every "now" is unique. Responsible persons ask themselves, "How can I act well now?" The answers will differ for every person, because just as every situation is unique, so is every person different from every other person. But surely there must be some algorithm that will assist us in coming to the right answer. Unfortunately, no, for there is no right answer. There is only an answer that is as appropriate as we can conclude at that moment in that situation. No written guidelines can apply appropriately to every unique situation. Unfortunately we physicians have been suckled on a fallacy: "What's good for the goose is good for the gander". Phrased in medical terms, "normal findings are good, and abnormal findings are bad". This is too simple, and often wrong. Good clinicians know that care must be personalized for it to be optimal. So-called normal findings give rough guidance, sometimes applicable to groups, but frequently wrong for individuals. Consider intraocular pressure (IOP). A normal IOP of 15 mmHg good for some and bad for others, and an abnormal IOP of 30 mmHg is good for some and bad for others. We are so bombarded by the myth of the sanctity of the standard distribution curve that it is hard to think independently and specifically. Also, unfortunately, doctors are prone to decide for patients, often on the basis of normative data that is not relevant or important for the particular patient. That we do this is not surprising, as we want to help, and so we default to what seems to be the easy, safe (non-thinking) way, in which we do not have to hold ourselves accountable for the outcome. Somebody HAS to decide, or else we would be living in an anarchical world. Also true. And because none of us knows as much as we need to know to act appropriately, we seek advice from so-called "experts". For us to care for people well it is essential that we consider what others recommend. So we look to experts, as we should. However, experts are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. Remember that von Graefe in 1860 recommended surgical iridectomy for all glaucoma, Elliot recommended mustard plaster between the shoulders for glaucoma, Becker based treatment on tonographic findings, Weve reported 100% success with penetrating cyclodiathermy in glaucoma, Lichter advised against laser trabeculoplasty, many thought Cypass was great, and the investigators in the Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study indicated that an IOP usually around 12 mmHg was better than one usually around 20 mmHg. All wrong. What the authors of these guidelines have done excellently, is to provide a general framework on which ophthalmologists can hang pieces of evidence, so as to be able to evaluate the validity and the importance of that evidence. In doing this meticulously they have provided a valuable service to all ophthalmologists, none of whom individually have either the time or the skill to be fully informed. In their own practices the authors consider whether valid information is relevant for the particular person being considered. That process of considering relevance is essential, always. And relevance is based on the particular unique patient, unique doctor and unique situation. The only guideline the authors can provide in this regard is to remind us all to consider relevance with all patients in all situations, and from the patient's perspective. Even more important than the service to ophthalmologists is the benefit to patients that will result from thoughtful use of these guidelines. We need, also, to remember that diagnoses are generic, and that within every diagnosis there are differences. For example what does a diagnosis of primary open angle mean? Some of those affected will rapidly go blind despite the most thoughtful treatment and others will keep their sight even without treatment. What does a diagnosis of Chandler's Syndrome mean? In some, surgery works well, and, in others, poorly. So one never directs diagnosis and treatment at a condition, but rather at the person, the objective being the wellness of that person. The previous European Glaucoma Society Guidelines are used internationally. It is good that the EGS is again providing updated, useful information. The Guidelines are a practical, inspirational contribution.

### The role of transforming growth factor β in glaucoma and the therapeutic implications [^485c8145]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a progressive optic neuropathy frequently associated with elevated intraocular pressure, ocular vascular changes and extracellular matrix remodelling at the optic nerve head and in the trabecular meshwork. The pathogenesis is multifactorial and complex, but many recent studies have suggested that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) plays a major role in the process. Significantly elevated levels of TGF-β have been identified in the anterior chamber of glaucomatous eyes. TGF-β has also been shown to directly cause increased intraocular pressure. It is believed that this occurs through complex interaction with the trabecular meshwork, leading to decreased aqueous humour outflow. These processes occur through specific interactions with various proteins and signalling molecules also present in ocular tissues. By understanding the role that TGF-β plays in the pathogenesis of glaucoma, alternative therapeutic agents can be developed, which target these pathways and improve and assist in the management of disease. This review will cover previous investigative studies and discuss the current understanding of TGF-β's role in glaucoma and how it may serve as a potential therapeutic target.

### Mitochondrial dysfunction in glaucoma and emerging bioenergetic therapies [^2cdcd6c1]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

The similarities between glaucoma and mitochondrial optic neuropathies have driven a growing interest in exploring mitochondrial function in glaucoma. The specific loss of retinal ganglion cells is a common feature of mitochondrial diseases - not only the classic mitochondrial optic neuropathies of Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy and Autosomal Dominant Optic Atrophy - but also occurring together with more severe central nervous system involvement in many other syndromic mitochondrial diseases. The retinal ganglion cell, due to peculiar structural and energetic constraints, appears acutely susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial function is also well known to decline with aging in post-mitotic tissues including neurons. Because age is a risk factor for glaucoma this adds another impetus to investigating mitochondria in this common and heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease. Mitochondrial function may be impaired by either nuclear gene or mitochondrial DNA genetic risk factors, by mechanical stress or chronic hypoperfusion consequent to the commonly raised intraocular pressure in glaucomatous eyes, or by toxic xenobiotic or even light-induced oxidative stress. If primary or secondary mitochondrial dysfunction is further established as contributing to glaucoma pathogenesis, emerging therapies aimed at optimizing mitochondrial function represent potentially exciting new clinical treatments that may slow retinal ganglion cell and vision loss in glaucoma.

### Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies 22 loci for normal tension glaucoma with significant overlap with high tension glaucoma [^865a9842]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a chronic and progressive optic neuropathy that is characterized by damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision. It is a leading cause of irreversible blindness, and its worldwide prevalence was estimated to be around 2.4% in 2021. POAG is one of the most heritable diseasesand typically presents as two subtypes: high-tension glaucoma (HTG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG).

HTG is defined as POAG in patients with intraocular pressure (IOP) ≥ 21 mmHg, and it is usually associated with the ocular hypertension process, in which high IOP is the main risk factor in the disease progression. NTG is defined as POAG in patients with IOP consistently measured < 21 mmHg, and is believed to be more related to specific processes such as vascular dysregulation and ischemia. However, the stratification of POAG by IOP is controversial whereby different tension subtypes may be part of the same pathogenic processversus the claim that primary neurodegeneration features are more prominently in NTG.

The current treatments for NTG/HTG aim to lower IOP, which can slow disease progression. Yet, over 50% of POAG cases are not diagnosed until there is irreversible optic nerve damage. This highlights the importance of developing more accurate screening methods to identify individuals at high risk for NTG earlier in the disease process. In addition, a deeper understanding of the genetics of the neurodegenerative process of glaucoma could help develop neuroprotective treatments, which are currently unavailable, by inhibiting the pathogenic cascade that leads to nerve damage.

In this work, we aimed to untangle the shared and specific genetic architecture between the glaucoma tension subtypes and identify specific loci for NTG, which could lead to a more accurate risk assessment and screening prioritization. We also used our gene-discovery approach to highlight possible neuro-protective drug targets for POAG.

### Non-invasive electrophysiology in glaucoma, structure and function-a review [^952b0237]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

ERG and OCT angiography: structure-vascular and functional relationship

As a consequence of the prominent developments in OCT technology, OCT might be of considerable help for the characterization not only of structural retinal changes in glaucoma but also of vascular changes. Finally, electroretinographic approaches provide highly sensitive readouts of glaucoma-related damage. This prompts the question of the complementarities of these different approaches and the potential benefit of their combined use in order to provide insights and hallmarks about the damage mechanisms in glaucoma. An example of the benefit of such a multimodal assessment of glaucoma is given below on research that addresses the two popular theories on glaucoma pathogenesis, i.e. the "mechanical" vs the "vascular" theory.

RGC damage in glaucoma might be attributed to elevated IOP, exerting mechanical stress on the optic nerve head, i.e. "mechanical theory". However, a subset of glaucoma patients deteriorates in spite of good IOP control proposing other damage mechanisms; among those is the loss of RGC due to vascular dysfunction, i.e. the "vascular theory". Although IOP is the main risk factor, the interplay of these two mechanisms might be implicated in the primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), the most common type of glaucoma. In normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), on the other hand, the vascular dysfunction in its pathogenesis dominates.

### Who's lost first? Susceptibility of retinal ganglion cell types in experimental glaucoma [^86eb15c4]. Experimental Eye Research (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to summarize our current knowledge about the susceptibility of specific retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types in experimental glaucoma, and to delineate the initial morphological and functional alterations that occur in response to intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation. There has been debate in the field as to whether RGCs with large somata and axons are more vulnerable, with definitive conclusions still in progress because of the wide diversity of RGC types. Indeed, it is now estimated that there are greater than 30 different RGC types, and while we do not yet understand the complete details, we discuss a growing body of work that supports the selective vulnerability hypothesis of specific RGC types in experimental glaucoma. Specifically, structural and functional degeneration of various RGC types have been examined across different rodent models of experimental glaucoma (acute vs. chronic) and different strains, and an emerging consensus is that OFF RGCs appear to be more vulnerable to IOP elevation compared to ON RGCs. Understanding the mechanisms by which this selective vulnerability manifests across different RGC types should lead to novel and improved strategies for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration in glaucoma.

### Emerging concepts in glaucoma and review of the literature [^1d2f193a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is the most commonly acquired optic neuropathy. It represents a public health challenge because it causes an irreversible blindness. Emerging evidence indicates that the pathogenesis of glaucoma depends on several interacting pathogenetic mechanisms, which include mechanical effects by an increased intraocular pressure, decreased neutrophine-supply, hypoxia, excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, and the involvement of autoimmune processes. In particular, alterations in serum antibody profiles have been described. However, it is still unclear whether the autoantibodies seen in glaucoma are an epiphenomenon or causative. Oxidative stress appears to be a critical factor in the neurodestructive consequences of mitochondrial dysfunction, glial activation response, and uncontrolled activity of the immune system during glaucomatous neurodegeneration. In addition, hearing loss has been identified in association with glaucoma. A higher prevalence of antiphosphatidylserine antibodies of the immunoglobulin G class was seen in normal-tension glaucoma patients with hearing loss in comparison with normal-tension glaucoma patients with normacusis. This finding suggests a similar pathological pathway as a sign for generalized disease.

Glaucoma, its early diagnosis, and monitoring of interventions remain an ongoing challenge. We here review developments in functional assessment and its relation to morphology, evaluating recent insights in electrophysiology in glaucoma and highlighting how glaucoma research and diagnostics benefit from combined approaches of OCT and electrophysiological investigations. After concise overviews of OCT and non-invasive electrophysiology in glaucoma, we evaluate commonalities and complementarities of OCT and electrophysiology for our understanding of glaucoma. As a specific topic, the dynamic range (floor effects) of the various techniques is discussed.

### Transient diagnostics and therapeutic-related increase in intraocular pressure and risk to the glaucoma patient [^a078d9af]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, and intraocular pressure (IOP) is currently the main modifiable risk factor for this disease. There are some theories behind the glaucoma damage mechanism and how IOP plays an important role in the pathophysiology of the disease. It is known that elevated IOP leads to an increased pressure gradient across the lamina cribrosa, causing compression and deformation of this structure, compromising axonal transport and damaging the retinal ganglion cell axons. Previous studies have demonstrated that the impact of IOP rise in axonal transport changes occurs in a time-dependent fashion; thus, the duration of IOP insult is an important determinant of glaucoma damage.

There are several situations where a transient IOP increase occurs; however, it is still unclear if this could cause direct damage to the ganglion cell axons or compromise optic nerve perfusion. Although this transient elevation in IOP appears well tolerated in healthy eyes, little is known about how eyes with glaucoma respond to this IOP insult and the time scale at which IOP-related damage occurs. Patients with a glaucomatous optic nerve are more susceptible to acute IOP elevation than patients with ocular hypertension or normal eyes and this is probably explained by the different biomechanical properties of the connective tissues with eyes having different levels of susceptibility to the same IOP insult. In glaucomatous eyes, the optic nerve head and lamina cribrosa exhibit greater susceptibility to IOP-related stress due to compromised connective tissue properties. The lamina cribrosa in glaucomatous eyes tends to be thinner, less resilient, and more prone to deformation in response to IOP elevation compared to healthy eyes. These biomechanical vulnerabilities increase the risk of axonal compression and damage to retinal ganglion cell axons, even during transient IOP elevations. Additionally, glaucomatous eyes often have altered scleral rigidity and stiffness, which further influences the way the optic nerve head and surrounding structures respond to IOP stress.

In this review, we included studies that analyzed the IOP behaviour during surgical and diagnostic procedures. The objective of this review is to provide data on short-term IOP rise related to surgical and diagnostic procedures to understand whether this would be a real risk for glaucoma patients.

For example a pre-clinical animal model in glaucoma would ideally mimic the human disease by showing retinal ganglion cell and optic nerve damage brought about by chronic or transient ocular hypertension and would allow both frequent intra-ocular pressure measurements and easy visualisation of retinal neuronal damage. Although such models exist, there are important considerations around anatomical differences between the species and pathophysiological differences between the disease processes. Anatomical differences between human and rodent eyes such as the small size of the rodent eye and differences in the lens and vitreous cavity are a significant limitation to the use (and interpretation) of rat and mouse glaucoma models. Non-human primate models have a number of pathophysiological advantages but are expensive and have limited availability. In terms of disease initiation and ongoing pathogenesis, the key issue for all such models is the extent to which they occur 'naturally' or require 'induction' e.g. with injury by toxin or trauma. A range of such glaucoma models exists across different species, but each has their limitations and no ideal animal model currently exits. This potential pathophysiological discordance applies equally to a number of animal models for other disease processes, for example inducing CNV by laser disruption in a mouse to mimic age-related CNV in human macular degeneration; or inducing uveitis with injection of lipopolysaccharide into the murine peritoneum to mimic acute anterior uveitis. Newer iterations of these animal models, such as the numerous mouse models of CNV generation associated with a range of complement, chemokine or chemokine receptor abnormalities may more accurately mimic the human disease.

### Care of the patient with primary open-angle glaucoma [^10813eec]. AOA (2010). Medium credibility.

Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) management — the general principles of treatment for NTG patients do not differ from managing chronic POAG, treatment should be directed at lowering the IOP substantially from what is thought to be a damaging level in that individual, NTG patients tend to progress more slowly and have a lower risk of rapid evolution to blindness than patients with POAG, high intragroup variability exists and specific treatment should be guided by individual presentation and course, clinicians may initiate treatment of patients with mild to moderate NTG with PGAs without waiting for further progression, and an initially non-glaucomatous fellow eye of a unilaterally NTG patient may be observed without treatment until or unless glaucoma can be diagnosed.

### Central nervous system changes in glaucoma [^1273a284]. Journal of Glaucoma (2013). Low credibility.

Many glaucoma patients continue to lose vision despite treatment to lower intraocular pressure. In addition to the loss of retinal ganglion cells in the eye, there is injury to major visual pathways of the brain along the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway. Evidence for this comes from both glaucoma models and glaucoma patients. Understanding central visual system changes in glaucoma will provide insights into human glaucomatous neural degeneration and disease progression, in addition to potential novel strategies to prevent vision loss in glaucoma.

### Aqueous outflow imaging techniques and what they tell us about intraocular pressure regulation [^aad7be80]. Eye (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in the medical and surgical management of open-angle glaucoma have increased the number of treatment options available. Several new intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering treatments target the conventional aqueous outflow (AO) system. However, success rates are variable and outcomes in individual patients are often difficult to predict. Variable treatment responses remain unexplained and highlight deficiencies in our current understanding of AO regulation and IOP homeostasis. Imaging is often relied upon to confirm diagnoses and monitor treatment responses in other ocular and systemic pathologies. As yet no suitable AO imaging tool has been developed to fulfil this role in glaucoma. A variety of imaging techniques have been used to study the AO tracts of humans and animals in ex vivo and in vivo eyes. In this review, results from novel imaging techniques that assess aqueous drainage through the episcleral venous system are considered and we argue these provide new insights into AO regulation. We suggest that the ability to objectively measure AO responses to interventions would be a significant clinical advance, and we have demonstrated that this can be achieved with direct visualisation of aqueous drainage. We predict that the evolution of AO imaging technology will continue to reveal critical components of AO and IOP regulation, and that personalised IOP-lowering treatment in glaucoma care may well become a reality in the near future.

### Blood pressure and glaucoma [^9c218fd2]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2009). Low credibility.

Although intraocular pressure (IOP) is considered the main risk factor for the development of glaucoma and the only parameter subject to treatment, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that glaucoma may continue to progress despite lowering patients' IOP to targeted levels. Several studies have implicated vascular risk factors in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Among them, blood pressure (BP) and ocular perfusion pressure have become increasingly important. Although clinicians cannot currently visualise ocular blood flow directly, they can easily measure glaucoma patients' BP and IOP to calculate their ocular perfusion pressure and quantify the vascular changes. The purpose of this review article is to discuss the relationship between BP and IOP, BP and glaucoma, and perfusion pressure and glaucoma. We discuss the importance of autoregulation to maintain the adequate perfusion of the optic nerve head, and suggest that ocular perfusion pressure and its fluctuation may be parameters that need to be measured in glaucoma patients.

### Intraocular pressure matters [^4f58d475]. Ophthalmology: Glaucoma (2025). Medium credibility.

To date, evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials has shown that effective intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering therapy significantly reduces the risk of glaucomatous progression across all stages of the disease. Changes in IOP have a substantial impact on the load-bearing connective tissues of the optic nerve head (ONH), as well as the overlying neurovascular tissues of the ONH and retina. An initial treatment goal of reducing IOP by 25% to 35%-and possibly more in advanced cases-can help prevent progression. Additionally, maintaining stable IOP by minimizing both diurnal and long-term fluctuations may further enhance disease control and reduce the risk of worsening.

### Molecular genetics in glaucoma [^ad9ee284]. Experimental Eye Research (2011). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is a family of diseases whose pathology is defined by the progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells. Clinically, glaucoma presents as a distinctive optic neuropathy with associated visual field loss. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), chronic angle-closure glaucoma (ACG), and exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) are the most prevalent forms of glaucoma globally and are the most common causes of glaucoma-related blindness worldwide. A host of genetic and environmental factors contribute to glaucoma phenotypes. This review examines the current status of genetic investigations of POAG, ACG, XFG, including the less common forms of glaucoma primary congenital glaucoma (PCG), the developmental glaucomas, and pigment dispersion glaucoma.

### The relevance of arterial blood pressure in the management of glaucoma progression: a systematic review [^36eef2ed]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of visual impairment and blindness worldwide. The disease is characterized by structural and functional damage of the optic nerve head due to progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. High intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for disease development and progression. Other risk factors include age, family history, ethnicity, diabetes, and myopia. The rates of both glaucoma and high IOP are expected to co-occur more frequently as their rates keep rising parallel to the increasing life expectancy. To date, IOP is the only modifiable risk factor and therapeutic option in glaucoma. Nevertheless, some patients with normal or well-controlled IOP are still at risk for glaucomatous damage. The vascular paradigm suggests impaired systemic vascular function, thus compromising blood supply to the optic nerve head, as a risk factor for disease progression.

The interplay between IOP, blood pressure (BP), and ocular perfusion pressure (OPP) is poorly understood which limits the development of a universal consensus around these parameters in the management of glaucoma. The exact interaction between the course of glaucoma and arterial BP is complex with studies supporting both arterial hypotension and hypertension as protective and risk factors. The role of BP in relation to glaucoma risk has been clarified by the use of 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring. Nocturnal hypotension is considered a potential systemic vascular risk factor for glaucoma. Moreover, abnormal circadian rhythms — such as an increased nighttime BP, an absence of nocturnal BP dipping, or an excessive nocturnal BP dip — have been associated with target-organ damage and increased cardiovascular risk. However, even with the cumulative evidence on dysregulations in BP, evidence-based clinical decision-making remains challenging due to conflicting evidence and the poor understanding of the complex interplay between glaucoma and BP. To address these challenges, we performed a systematic review of studies evaluating the role of BP and antihypertensive medication in glaucoma.

### Heavy metal toxicity and the aetiology of glaucoma [^d69bc552]. Eye (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite recent advances, our understanding of the aetiological mechanisms underlying glaucoma remains incomplete. Heavy metals toxicity has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases and various ocular pathologies. Given the similarities in pathophysiology between glaucoma and some neurodegenerative disorders, it is plausible that heavy metal toxicity may play a role in the development of glaucoma. Heavy metal exposure may be occupational, or through water or dietary contamination. In this report, we review mechanisms for systemic and neurotoxicity for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, mercury, and manganese, and weigh the evidence for an association between glaucoma and the accumulation of heavy metals either in ocular tissues or in the central nervous system.

Introduction

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide among people over the age of 55. It is characterized by progressive optic neuropathy, caused by the gradual death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that transmit visual information from the outer retina to the brain via the optic nerve (myelinated RGC axons). Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk factor for POAGand is primarily caused by decreased outflow of the aqueous humor from the ocular anterior segment. Decreased outflow may be due to abnormal function of structures in the anterior segment of the eye, consisting of the trabecular meshwork (TM)and Schlemm's canal (SC)in the conventional outflow pathway, and the ciliary muscle and iris in the uveoscleral (unconventional) pathway. However, about one third of patients with POAG display optic nerve degeneration in the absence of abnormally high IOP measurements (normal tension glaucoma (NTG)). Conversely, many people with elevated IOP do not develop glaucoma, suggesting that other processes, including increased RGC susceptibility to normal IOP, might also lead to optic nerve damage. Currently, neuroprotective therapies are lacking, and medications that reduce IOP have limited effectiveness. Gaining a better understanding of the molecular and cellular causes of POAG in the anterior and posterior segments of the eye could suggest novel therapeutic targets.

A recent multi-ethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of 34,179 POAG cases and 349,321 controls of European, Asian, and African ancestries identified 127 risk loci associated with POAG, explaining ~9% of POAG heritability, and a meta-analysis of the European subset identified 68 POAG loci, some of which were not uncovered in the cross-ancestry meta-analysis. Furthermore, a GWAS meta-analysis of IOP performed on 139,555 individuals, primarily of European descendant, has identified 133 independent associations in 112 loci, largely overlapping with two other studies. The IOP variants' effect sizes and direction of effect are highly correlated with their effect on POAG risk, and together they explain 9–17% of IOP heritability. Vertical-cup-to-disc ratio (VCDR), central corneal thickness, and corneal hysteresis, a measure of the viscoelastic damping of the cornea, have also been associated with POAG risk, and large GWAS meta-analyses have uncovered 70–200 genetic associations for these traits –.

Introduction

Glaucoma comprises a group of ocular diseases with a multifaceted aetiology; however, the common feature is progressive, irreversible optic nerve injury that eventually leads to vision loss. According to the World Health Organisation, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is estimated that glaucoma affects 80 million individuals worldwide and approximately 11 million patients experience complete blindness. Owing to the aging population, the number of patients with glaucoma has been increasing steadily and is projected to reach 112 million by 2040. The pathogenesis of this disease involves the loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, leading to optic disc alterations and visual field loss. The major quantifiable risk factor for glaucoma is an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting from an imbalance between the production of aqueous humour and its drainage from the anterior chamber of the eye. Reducing IOP is the only established treatment option that may inhibit or slow the progression of vision loss. The progression of glaucoma is associated with the gradual development of structural and functional anomalies within the optic nerve, resulting in peripheral visual field loss, which significantly deteriorates quality of life during advanced stages of the disease. The pathogenesis of glaucoma is complex, multifactorial and poorly understood. Although increased IOP is believed to directly contribute to mechanical damage to the optic nerve head, only one-third of patients with glaucoma present with increased IOP during the early stages of the disease. Furthermore, visual field loss progresses in some patients despite achieving IOP control. According to the "vascular theory" of glaucoma, the loss of retinal ganglion cells results from an inadequate blood supply. Reduced ocular blood flow may be associated with vascular constriction and autoregulatory disorders. This hypothesis is supported by the co-occurrence of glaucoma with vascular diseases such as arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Potential contributing factors include mechanical stress, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and neurotrophin deficiency. An increase in IOP causes compression of blood vessels, which may impair blood flow in the retina. If the IOP is normal, retinal ischaemia may result from systemic vascular deregulation observed in many diseases, including arterial hypertension or hypotension, nocturnal hypotonia, heart rate disorders, Raynaud syndrome, and migraine. Reduced ocular blood flow has been identified as an IOP-independent risk factor for glaucoma progression because it leads to oxygen and nutrient deficiencies, resulting in disorders of cellular energy metabolism and accumulation of ROS. In the normal retina, ROS are generated during metabolic processes and are scavenged by antioxidant enzymes and chemical antioxidants. However, in glaucomatous eyes, ROS is generated in excess of the neutralising potential of the antioxidant system. This leads to oxidative stress in retinal ganglion cells, resulting in structural damage to proteins and nucleic acids, oxidation of lipids, hyaluronic acid depolymerisation, and eventually, cell apoptosis. Although blood flow anomalies associated with glaucoma have been examined using various techniques, it is still unclear whether they are the cause or a consequence of the disease.

Primary open-angle glaucoma suspect — management plan specifies that the goal of treatment is to monitor or lower IOP if an eye is likely to progress to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), to monitor for structural changes in optic disc and retina, and to monitor for functional changes of the optic nerve assessing the visual field; the decision to treat may arise in various settings, target IOP is an estimate that must be individualized and/or adjusted, and medical therapy is presently the most common initial intervention to lower IOP with consideration of the balance between side effects and effectiveness. If medical therapy fails to reduce IOP sufficiently, switching to an alternative medication as monotherapy or adding additional medication is appropriate until the desired IOP level is attained.

### Current perspective of neuroprotection and glaucoma [^ab79f309]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Neuroprotection therapies for glaucoma

Although there are clinically effective IOP reduction treatments, there has been a growing realization that alternative treatments are needed to also target the prevention of RGC loss as patients with glaucoma have been seen to continue to lose visual function even after successful IOP lowering.

Neuroprotection, by definition, is "the relative preservation of neuronal structure and/or function". In addition to reduction of IOP, neuroprotective therapies have the potential to halt RGC loss through promoting cell survivaland preventing further structural and functional damage of the optic nerve to preserve vision in those showing glaucomatous signs.

Though the primary mechanisms of glaucoma have not yet been fully elucidated, several key processes have been identified, such as mechanical compression, ischemia, oxidative stress, neurotropic growth factor deprivation, intracellular calcium toxicity, activation of autoimmunity, and glutamate neurotoxicity. In recent years, researchers have investigated a number of compounds that can protect RGCs via targeting the aforementioned pathways.

2.4 - Primary Angle-Closure

Scientific publications on angle-closure have suffered from the lack of a uniform definition and specific diagnostic criteria. Only in recent years has there been recognition of the need to standardize definitions of the various types.

Angle-closure is defined by the presence of iridotrabecular contact (ITC). This can be either appositional or synechial. Either can be due to any one of a number of possible mechanisms. Angle closure may result in raised IOP and cause structural changes in the eye. Primary angle-closure (PAC) is defined as an occludable drainage angle and features indicating that trabecular obstruction by the peripheral iris has occurred. The term glaucoma is added if glaucomatous optic neuropathy is present: Primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG). The main reason to distinguish Primary angle-closure glaucoma from Primary open-angle glaucoma is the initial therapeutic approach (i.e. iridotomy or iridectomy) and the possible late complications (synechial closure of the chamber angle) or the complications resulting when this type of glaucoma undergoes filtering surgery (uveal effusion, cilio-lenticular block leading to malignant glaucoma).

The prevalence of primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG)

Ethnic background is one of the major factors determining susceptibility to primary angle-closure (PAC). Population surveys show that PAC is more common among people of Asian descent than those from Europe. Among people aged 40 years and over, the prevalence of PAC ranges from 0.1% in Europeans, through 1.4% in East Asians, and up to 5% in Greenland Inuit. Of those over 40 years old in European derived populations, 0.4% are estimated to have PACG. Three-quarters of cases occur in female subjects. There are 1.60 million people in Europe and 581 000 people in the USA with PACG.

Primary glaucoma cases should be examined and the anterior chamber angle shown to be open on gonioscopy before PACG is excluded.

Provocative Tests

In general provocative tests for angle-closure provide little additional information since even when negative they may not rule out the potential for angle-closure. In addition they may be hazardous, triggering an acute angle-closure attack even while the patient is monitored.

### Glaucoma: the retina and beyond [^d6e777e9]. Acta Neuropathologica (2016). Low credibility.

Glaucoma is principally divided into open-angle or angle-closure subtypes, where angle closure refers to the presence of appositional or synechial iridotrabecular contact resulting in the obstruction of the trabecular meshwork and elevated IOP. Both open-angle glaucoma and angle-closure glaucoma can be further subdivided into primary or secondary diseases, where primary refers to the observation of characteristic optic neuropathy in the presence of normal or elevated IOP with no distinguishable pathological cause. Secondary disease refers to an elevated IOP with an identifiable pathological cause, such as inflammation, trauma, neovascularisation, pigment dispersion, and pseudoexfoliation. Finally, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) can be arbitrarily further subdivided depending on the IOP status of the patient. Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) was a commonly used term that has fallen out of favour recently. NTG refers to POAG, where patients exhibit a normal IOP (IOP typically < 97.5 percentile of population, < 21 mmHg) versus POAG with an elevated IOP (IOP typically > 97.5 percentile of population), although this distinction is arbitrary and may not be clinically relevant. It is also important to note that not all high IOP causes damage to the optic nerve, a condition known as ocular hypertension. This reinforces the theory that although IOP is currently the only modifiable risk factor in glaucoma, there are other factors influencing the progression of RGC loss. IOP reduction, even if the presenting IOP is normal, is still the principle way of managing this condition and is very effective with a 20% reduction in pressure, reducing the risk of progression by 50%.

2.3.1.1.8 Glaucoma associated with retinal detachment

Etiology and pathogenic mechanism:

Long standing retinal detachment that leads to ischaemic neovascularization. Retinal detachment is usually associated with a reduction of IOP. Gas tamponade can elicit significant IOP spikes. Dispersed silicon oil may cause chronic IOP elevation.

The trabecular meshwork may be obstructed by neovascularization caused by proliferative retinopathy, or by scarring, pigment dispersion and inflammation, or by cellular debris from retinal cells outer segments (Schwartz's syndrome). Surgery for retinal detachment can also cause glaucoma.

Symptoms and signs:

Elevated IOP and retinal detachment are present. Redness and pain are common features.

Treatment [I, D]:

Topical and systemic IOP lowering medication
Surgery for retinal detachment
Consider glaucoma surgery

2.3.1.2 Open-angle glaucoma due to ocular trauma

Ocular trauma leads to glaucoma by several different mechanisms. The secondary traumatic glaucomas can be caused by both open-angle and angle-closure mechanisms. In order to identify and treat the causes of IOP elevation; careful evaluation of the ocular damage must be performed.

Etiology:

Blunt non-penetrating or penetrating trauma to the eye.

Pathogenic mechanisms:

Blunt non-penetrating trauma can lead to reduced trabecular outflow due to traumatic changes of the trabecular meshwork. Scarring and inflammation of the trabecular meshwork, obstruction by red blood cells and debris, angle recession, lens-induced glaucoma. Elevated IOP may occur a very long time after the trauma. Positive steroid response after anti-inflammatory treatment should also be considered. Penetrating injury may damage one or more intraocular structure leading to elevated IOP.

Symptoms and signs:

Redness, pain, decreased vision with acute IOP elevation, or no symptoms with chronic IOP elevation. Acute or late IOP elevation (occurring months or even decades later) may follow blunt trauma.

Chemical burns, hyphaema, traumatic cataract, uveitis, angle recession, ruptured iris sphincter, iridodialysis can be present in various combinations.

Note: It is not recommended to perform gonioscopy in fresh ocular trauma to avoid compressing the eye. This examination can be delayed for several weeks.

Treatment [I, D]:

Anti-inflammatory
Topical and systemic IOP lowering medication
Long-term IOP follow up in the presence of permanent anterior segment damage.
Glaucoma surgery

### Retinal ganglion cells and supporting elements in culture [^114bccf2]. Journal of Glaucoma (2005). Low credibility.

Elucidating the pathophysiology of glaucoma has traditionally relied on animal models of intraocular hypertension and optic nerve injury, which are closely related to the human disease with respect to tissue damage. However, cell culture models of retinal neurons (particularly retinal ganglion cells) and supporting cells (particularly retinal glia and lamina cribrosa cells), although less closely related to glaucoma pathophysiology, have particular advantages in understanding intracellular processes associated with glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Examples of studies which are more readily achievable with cultured cells include: 1) Isolation and separation of purified cells to help define the role of classes of cell types; 2) Transfection of genetic material to over-express or knockdown specific genes; 3) Fluorescent imaging of calcium concentrations, reactive oxygen species concentrations, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular pH, and other measures of cellular physiology.
