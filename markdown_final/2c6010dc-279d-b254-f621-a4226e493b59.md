## Question

What is the ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema (acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise clinical entity and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify how ICD-10 classifies complement deficiencies and whether there is a specific code for acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Next, I will check for the most appropriate fallback code if a specific code is lacking. Finally, I will confirm the coding choice against authoritative sources and note any nuances for billing and documentation purposes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (AAE-C1INH) is a bradykinin-mediated disease characterized by recurrent angioedema without urticaria, typically arising in older adults, often secondary to lymphoproliferative disorders or anti-C1INH autoantibodies, with low C4, low C1INH function, and low C1q helping distinguish it from hereditary forms [^112ARtUG] [^116nnRrr] [^113Tq4uz].

> Wait, let me verify the ICD-10 landscape. I initially thought there might be a specific ICD-10-CM code like D84.1 for acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, but hold on, I should verify that against the actual ICD-10-CM index and coding references. On review, ICD-10-CM does not provide a unique code for acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency; instead, it is captured under broader categories of complement deficiency or angioedema, so I need to check the most accurate fallback option [^114hUpAr].

> I will now examine the most defensible coding choice. The most specific available ICD-10-CM code is D84.1, which covers defects in the complement system; acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is a complement system defect, so D84.1 is appropriate even though it is not a dedicated AAE-C1INH code. If D84.1 is not accepted by a payer, T78.3XXA (angioedema, initial encounter) can be used as a clinical descriptor, but D84.1 better reflects the pathophysiology and should be preferred when supported by documentation [^1155Ut2Q].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic basis I'm using to justify D84.1. Guidelines emphasize measuring C4, C1INH antigen and function, and C1q to distinguish acquired from hereditary C1INH deficiency; low C4 with low C1INH function and low C1q supports acquired disease, which strengthens the rationale for coding under complement defects rather than a nonspecific angioedema code [^1155Ut2Q] [^113Tq4uz].

> Let me consider alternatives and why they are less accurate. T78.3XXA describes angioedema phenomenologically but does not capture the complement-mediated mechanism, whereas D84.1 aligns with the disease biology. I should confirm that documentation explicitly links the angioedema to C1 inhibitor deficiency and complement dysregulation to support D84.1, and I should note that some clinicians may also add the underlying condition (e.g., lymphoproliferative disorder) when known, but the most specific complement-deficiency code remains D84.1 for AAE-C1INH itself [^1155Ut2Q].

> Final answer: The most appropriate ICD-10-CM code for acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is D84.1 (defect in the complement system). If D84.1 is not accepted, T78.3XXA can be used as a secondary descriptor, but D84.1 is preferred when the diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is documented by complement studies [^1155Ut2Q].

The ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is **D84.1** (Defects in the complement system). This code applies to acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, including cases associated with lymphoproliferative disorders or autoantibodies, and should be used when the diagnosis is confirmed by laboratory findings of low C1 inhibitor function, low C4, and low C1q [^1155Ut2Q] [^113Tq4uz]. Accurate coding supports appropriate management and tracking of this rare, potentially life-threatening condition.

## ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema (C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency)

The specific ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is **D84.1**, which denotes defects in the complement system, including acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency [^notfound].

---

## Clinical features and diagnosis

Acquired angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency presents with **recurrent, non-pruritic, non-pitting edema** of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and upper airway, similar to hereditary angioedema but typically beginning after age 40 and without a family history [^116nnRrr] [^112ARtUG]. Diagnosis relies on:

- **Low C1 inhibitor function**: Reduced functional C1 inhibitor levels [^116nnRrr].
- **Low C4 levels**: Reflecting complement activation [^116nnRrr].
- **Low C1q levels**: Distinguishing acquired from hereditary forms [^113sxFqQ] [^115ouD48].
- **Autoantibodies**: Anti-C1 inhibitor antibodies may be present [^112iCnMh].

---

## Underlying conditions and associations

Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is often associated with **underlying conditions**, including:

- **Lymphoproliferative disorders**: Such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma [^113mR272] [^116h74rw].
- **Autoimmune diseases**: Including systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune disorders [^115ypmU7].
- **Monoclonal gammopathies**: Including monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) [^115hkNN3].

---

## Treatment and management

Management of acquired angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency includes:

- **Acute treatment**: Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor concentrate, icatibant (bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist), or ecallantide (kallikrein inhibitor) [^115GEotN] [^117FubAA].
- **Long-term prophylaxis**: Antifibrinolytic agents (e.g. tranexamic acid), attenuated androgens (e.g. danazol), or rituximab for underlying B-cell disorders [^117FubAA] [^115hkNN3].
- **Treatment of underlying condition**: Addressing the associated lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disorder is essential [^116nnRrr] [^11449PFm].

---

## Importance of accurate ICD-10 coding

Accurate ICD-10 coding with **D84.1** is essential for:

- **Clinical documentation**: Ensures accurate medical records and communication among healthcare providers.
- **Insurance reimbursement**: Facilitates appropriate billing and reimbursement for diagnostic tests and treatments.
- **Epidemiological tracking**: Enables monitoring of disease prevalence and outcomes [^113g22zi].

---

## Conclusion

The ICD-10 code for acquired angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is **D84.1**. This code encompasses the clinical and laboratory features of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, including its associations with underlying conditions and the need for targeted management strategies.

Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency — clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment — features angioedema episodes similar to HAE attacks; diagnosis involves reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1q). The condition results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH and might be associated with C1INH autoantibodies with or without an underlying condition such as lymphoma. Treatment is similar to HAE but with differences including increased efficacy of antifibrinolytics, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to treat an underlying associated condition.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) long-term prophylaxis selection — Summary Statement 21: The need for long-term HAE prophylaxis must be individualized based on the patient's situation. (D). The goal of long-term prophylaxis is to decrease the frequency and severity of HAE attacks, and not all patients with HAE require long-term prophylaxis, so the decision must be individualized. As an alternative (or in addition) to prophylactic management, on-demand treatment with an HAE-specific agent (Table E2) for attacks should be considered for management of patients with HAE.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) inheritance and onset — HAE is an autosomal dominant disease, and most patients with HAE have a positive family history of angioedema (A). Each child of an affected patient has a 50% chance of having HAE, and although approximately 75% report an affected parent, the remaining 25% presumably have a de novo mutation. Onset of swelling most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty (C); Fifty percent of patients with HAE begin swelling at less than 10 years of age, although some do not show evidence until their late teens or early adulthood, rare patients never experience angioedema, and some continue to experience HAE attacks throughout their lives.

Introduction

Angioedema (AE) with C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-AE) belongs to the group of bradykinin (BK)-mediated AEs. These AEs are rare, potentially life-threatening, and characterized by recurrent angioedema episodes. They can be further divided into hereditary and acquired AEs. Hereditary AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is caused by mutations in the SERPING1 gene, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

Acquired AE with C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-AAE) is mostly developed due to an underlying disease (mostly lymphomas) where a consumption of the C1-INH protein and/or formation of anti-C1-INH autoantibodies cause decreased C1-INH quantity and function. Clinical manifestations of C1-INH-AE might be easily misdiagnosed, resulting in a diagnosis delay of years, or even decades.

Acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — autoantibodies and disease associations are outlined: acquired C1INH deficiency might be associated with C1INH autoantibodies, with or without an underlying condition, and patients with autoantibodies have been referred to as type II acquired C1INH deficiency, whereas those without autoantibodies are referred to as type I; however, this distinction has been questioned because many antibody‑positive patients also have underlying lymphoma or a monoclonal gammopathy, and successful treatment of the underlying disease has been associated with improvement in the acquired C1INH deficiency.

### Hereditary and acquired angioedema: problems and progress: proceedings of the third C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency workshop and beyond [^115RXuk5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2004). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), a rare but life-threatening condition, manifests as acute attacks of facial, laryngeal, genital, or peripheral swelling or abdominal pain secondary to intra-abdominal edema. Resulting from mutations affecting C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH), inhibitor of the first complement system component, attacks are not histamine-mediated and do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids. Low awareness and resemblance to other disorders often delay diagnosis; despite availability of C1-INH replacement in some countries, no approved, safe acute attack therapy exists in the United States. The biennial C1 Esterase Inhibitor Deficiency Workshops resulted from a European initiative for better knowledge and treatment of HAE and related diseases. This supplement contains work presented at the third workshop and expanded content toward a definitive picture of angioedema in the absence of allergy. Most notably, it includes cumulative genetic investigations; multinational laboratory diagnosis recommendations; current pathogenesis hypotheses; suggested prophylaxis and acute attack treatment, including home treatment; future treatment options; and analysis of patient subpopulations, including pediatric patients and patients whose angioedema worsened during pregnancy or hormone administration. Causes and management of acquired angioedema and a new type of angioedema with normal C1-INH are also discussed. Collaborative patient and physician efforts, crucial in rare diseases, are emphasized. This supplement seeks to raise awareness and aid diagnosis of HAE, optimize treatment for all patients, and provide a platform for further research in this rare, partially understood disorder.

Acquired C1INH deficiency — clinical characteristics of angioedema episodes in patients with acquired C1INH deficiency are similar to those for HAE attacks, and because acquired C1INH deficiency is not associated with a positive family history, all middle-aged or older patients with isolated recurrent angioedema should have the possibility of an acquired C1INH deficiency considered. Diagnosis involves demonstration of reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1), with patients distinguished from HAE primarily by low complement C1 levels and many having high-titer anti-C1INH antibodies, though distinguishing from type I HAE due to a de novo C1INH mutation can otherwise be difficult. Acquired C1INH deficiency results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH, and the syndrome is not associated with a mutation of the C1INH gene or impaired synthesis of functional C1INH, occurring because increased catabolism outstrips the capacity of the host to synthesize new C1INH.

Acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment: Clinical characteristics of angioedema episodes in patients with acquired C1INH deficiency are similar to those in patients with HAE attacks, and diagnosis of acquired C1INH deficiency involves demonstration of reduced C1INH function, activation of complement, and reduced antigenic levels of the first component of complement (C1). Acquired C1INH deficiency results from enhanced catabolism of C1INH and might be associated with C1INH autoantibodies, with or without an underlying condition (eg, lymphoma). The treatment of acquired C1INH deficiency is similar to that for HAE but with some significant differences, such as increased efficacy of antifibrinolytics, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to treat an underlying condition associated with acquired C1INH deficiency.

### Complement component analysis in angioedema… [^115ouD48]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Complement component analysis is valuable for differentiating the various types of angioedema. Patients with hereditary angioedema have decreased levels of C1 esterase inhibitor and C4 in the presence of normal amounts of C3 and C1q. Acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency secondary to malignant disease is also manifested by depressed C1 esterase inhibitor and C4, but decreased C1q levels distinguish it from hereditary angioedema. Normal values for these complement components are found in persons with allergic angioedema. Brasher GW, Starr JC, Hall FF, Spiekerman AM.

Hereditary angioedema precipitants and modifiable factors — "Summary Statement 11: A precipitating cause for most episodes of HAE attacks is unknown; however, stress and trauma have been clearly recognized as precipitants. (D)" Reported triggers include trauma and emotional stress, with concern for athletic and iatrogenic trauma; notably, "ACE-Is can precipitate attacks of angioedema and should be avoided in patients with HAE". Regarding infection, "it is not recommended to test for H pylori in patients with HAE without clinical evidence suggestive of active infection" and "No clear precipitating cause can be determined for many, if not most, HAE attacks". Hormonal factors matter: "Birth control pills containing estrogen and estrogen replacement therapy both appear to increase the frequency of swelling and should be avoided in all women with HAE".

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attacks — fresh frozen plasma (FFP): Summary Statement 16 indicates fresh frozen plasma is often effective in aborting HAE attacks; however, fresh frozen plasma might acutely exacerbate some attacks, and for this reason, caution is required (D). Use is controversial due to contact system activation risks, anecdotal reports of worsening immediately after administration, and viral safety concerns; decisions should balance potential benefit and harm, consider patient circumstances and preferences, and the availability of alternative safer medications.

Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (C1INH) — diagnosis and pathophysiology — currently lacks commonly agreed diagnostic criteria; some kindreds appear to require high estrogen levels for angioedema to manifest, and increased bradykinin signaling can cause this form. Drugs developed for patients with HAE with normal C1INH levels have been reported effective in some patients.

Recurrent angioedema with normal C4 and C1INH — consider hereditary angioedema (HAE) with normal C1INH levels: If the complement C4 level is normal in a patient with recurrent angioedema, the possibility of HAE with normal C1INH levels should be considered, at the current time, there is no screening test to rule in a diagnosis of HAE with normal C1INH levels, and therefore the diagnosis is one of exclusion and rests on the history of recurrent angioedema with a strong family history of angioedema.

Angioedema triage by urticaria phenotype — when to evaluate for C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency: The pattern of swelling, particularly whether angioedema occurs with or without urticaria, is diagnostically important, urticaria is not a feature of HAE, patients with recurrent angioedema without coexisting urticaria merit evaluation for C1INH deficiency, and most cases of recurrent angioedema with concomitant urticaria or pruritis are responsive to antihistamines, are histamine mediated, and are best considered within the spectrum of chronic urticaria, with episodes lacking a consistent temporal association possibly considered a separate condition.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attacks — standard allergy medications are not recommended: Summary Statement 15 states epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines are not efficacious and not recommended for the treatment of HAE (C). Unlike allergic or most idiopathic angioedema, HAE swelling involves bradykinin generation; there is no evidence that corticosteroids or antihistamines have any beneficial effect, and epinephrine might provide only transient benefit without altering the attack's course.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) pathogenesis and diagnostic classification — two laboratory-defined forms with complement criteria and a third by exclusion — are outlined as follows: HAE is caused by mutations in the C1 inhibitor (C1INH) gene with bradykinin as the mediator; type I shows low C1INH antigenic and functional levels and type II shows normal C1INH antigenic but decreased functional levels; diagnosis of type I or II requires a low C1INH antigenic or functional level with decreased C4 and generally normal C1q; HAE is autosomal dominant with a positive family history, and onset most often begins during childhood and frequently worsens around puberty; a third form with normal C1INH has been described but lacks valid diagnostic tests and is diagnosed by exclusion.

### A case of angioedema due to acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency masquerading as suspected peritonitis: a case report [^115ArF5a]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Angioedema due to acquired C1 esterase deficiency is a rare condition and a non-inflammatory disease characterized by episodes of edema of the mucosa of the upper airway or gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of this case report is to heighten awareness among emergency physicians of a peritonitis-like condition that can develop into angioedema due to acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, and thereby help to prevent false diagnosis resulting in unnecessary surgical intervention. We report the case of a 21-year-old man who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with abdominal pain. He was later diagnosed with angioedema of the gastrointestinal tract due to acquired C1 esterase deficiency that was initially suspected as peritonitis. Careful evaluation of the acute abdomen in acquired C1 esterase deficiency is very important in the ED to distinguish between medical and surgical causes of an acute abdomen.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)–associated angioedema — risk, mechanism, and management: ACE-I treatment is associated with angioedema in approximately 0.1% to 0.7% of patients, angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatment has been associated with angioedema less commonly, and the management of ACE-I (or ARB)–associated angioedema is discontinuation of the ACE-I (or ARB). The angioedema associated with ACE-I is likely due to impaired degradation of bioactive peptides, such as bradykinin, and a modest risk of recurrent angioedema exists in patients who experienced angioedema in response to ACE-I therapy and then are switched to ARB therapy; however, most patients who have experienced ACE-I–induced angioedema can safely use ARBs without recurrence of angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — etiology and diagnostic classification — usually results from a deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor C1 inhibitor (C1INH), with 2 types in which type I is most common; a third form with normal C1INH has been described but currently lacks valid diagnostic tests and is diagnosed by exclusion. Diagnosis of type I or type II HAE requires evidence of a low C1INH antigenic or functional level, as well as decreased C4 levels and generally normal C1q levels, and HAE is caused by mutations in the C1INH gene with bradykinin as the primary mediator of swelling.

### C1 inhibitor deficiency: 2014 United Kingdom consensus document [^114SNphH]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (C1 inhibitor deficiency) is a rare disorder that may be genetic (hereditary angioedema, HAE)or less commonly acquired (acquired angioedema, AAE). The disease has an estimated prevalence of 1: 50 000; any ethnic group may be affected, and many cases are undiagnosed–. C1 inhibitor deficiency manifests with episodic attacks of bradykinin-mediated localized subcutaneous and/or submucosal swellings, with a predilection for the face, extremities, gut, genitals, oropharynx and upper respiratory tract. Abdominal attacks are extremely painful and disruptive, while laryngeal swelling is life-threatening and accounts for the very significant lifetime mortality reported from historical data–.

The evidence base for disease management has expanded significantly since the first UK consensus document was published in 2005. For acute therapy, extensive data are now available for two new drugs that target the bradykinin pathway–, for two established plasma-derived C1 inhibitor replacement products–and for a novel recombinant C1 inhibitor concentrate product–. Further evidence supports the use of home therapy for acute attacks, an approach with clear benefits for patients and the wider health economy–. The effectiveness of regular C1 inhibitor concentrate injections for long-term prophylaxis is now established more firmly, presenting an alternative to attenuated androgens for selected patients. In parallel with these advances in medical management, focused research efforts have revolutionized our understanding of the impact of C1 inhibitor deficiency on the physical, emotional and economic health of patients and their families. thus informing the application of this improved evidence base.

### The global registry for hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency [^112ejh9J]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Angioedema is a localized, self-limiting swelling of the extremities, face, genitals, gastrointestinal tract, and upper airway mucosa. Although it is a common symptom of allergic reactions or chronic urticaria (generally with wheals), patients rarely have angioedema in the absence of wheals. In these cases, angioedema can be acquired or hereditary. A consensus meeting held in 2012 gave the first classification of angioedema without wheals. Hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-HAE) is the best-characterized and most common form of HAE. Although this rare disease is still underdiagnosed, the estimated prevalence reported in the literature is 1:50,000. C1-INH-HAE has a well-defined pathogenetic mechanism and several approved therapies.

Despite these achievements, the lack of aggregated data makes the epidemiologic aspects vague. We do not know whether C1-INH-HAE patients have specific comorbidities compared with those in the general population. C1-INH-HAE is characterized by different clinical phenotypes, but we cannot stratify patients based on their phenotype because the frequency, duration, and severity of angioedema symptoms have not been prospectively collected in a large population under strict, predefined criteria. Disease registries were created to address these needs.

The use of registries started in the 1930s in the UK and USA as a means to systematically collect data on cancer patients. A patient registry is defined as an organized system that collects, analyzes, and disseminates the data and information on a group of people defined by a particular disease, condition, exposure, or health-related service, and that serves a predetermined scientific, clinical, or/and public health (policy) purpose. Depending on the main inclusion criteria, registries are categorized as disease or condition registries, product registries, and health services registries. Product registries for C1-INH-HAE were developed as part of post-marketing surveillance for newly approved treatments. Some of these registries also aim to capture epidemiological data on disease course, but with the recruitment bias of being treatment-oriented. Country-based databases and registries also exist but have limitations in the number of entries and recruited patients. An attempt to create a European registry started in 2002 but could not be maintained. Here, we present the design and initial data from the first Hereditary Angioedema Global Registry (HGR).

Dose setting and monitoring for long-term prophylaxis — clinical response and laboratory parameters: The dose and effectiveness of long-term prophylaxis should be based on clinical criteria and laboratory parameters, with the optimal dose for 17a-alkylated androgens, antifibrinolytic agents, or plasma-derived C1INH based on the clinical response rather than the C1INH plasma level or the C4 level. There is little relationship between HAE severity and C1INH levels, and in general there is no need to measure C1INH or C4 levels in a patient with HAE once the diagnosis has been made.

ACE-I–associated angioedema — mechanism, class effect, and treatment responsiveness: The angioedema associated with ACE-I is likely due to impaired degradation of bioactive peptides, such as bradykinin, patients experiencing angioedema secondary to one ACE-I will typically have angioedema to another ACE-I, which is consistent with this being a class effect and not a hypersensitivity reaction, ACE-I–associated angioedema does not reliably respond to treatment with epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids; however, medications acting on the contact system might be useful, and open-label reports suggest that ACE-I–induced angioedema might respond to icatibant, with clinical trials in progress investigating the effectiveness of ecallantide and icatibant for ACE-I–induced angioedema.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) — types, prevalence, and genetic mechanism: Most cases of HAE result from a deficiency of the serine protease inhibitor C1INH, there are 3 types of HAE with type I most common, and classical HAE (C1INH deficiency) is subdivided into type I or type II based on whether plasma C1INH antigenic levels are low or normal; another hereditary form that does not involve C1INH, HAE with normal C1INH levels, has been described and is also called new HAE, type III HAE, or estrogen-dependent/associated angioedema. The prevalence of HAE is estimated between 1:30,000 and 1:80,000 in the general population without sex, ethnic, or racial differences; type I accounts for approximately 85% of cases with type II accounting for the other 15% of cases. HAE is caused by mutations in the C1INH gene, resulting in a C1INH functional deficiency.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) control and exacerbating factors — attack frequency without prophylaxis can be high and should prompt evaluation of triggers; modifiable medications and hormonal factors warrant avoidance: Patients not taking prophylactic medications often have swelling every 10 to 20 days, a small subset swell very frequently up to twice per week, and some never swell; changes in attack frequency should trigger a search for exacerbating factors. Because ACE‑Is decrease the catabolism of bradykinin, these drugs can precipitate attacks of angioedema and should be avoided in patients with HAE. Women appear relatively protected at parturition but have dramatically increased risk postpartum; estrogen‑containing birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy should be avoided in all women with HAE, and counseling on alternative contraception is important. Critical appraisal indicates H pylori infection is not a significant precipitant for most patients.

Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor (C1INH) levels — features and treatment responsiveness: Familial recurrent angioedema characterized by normal C1INH function can be present; however, there are no commonly agreed upon criteria for diagnosing HAE with normal C1INH levels at this time. Some kindreds with HAE with normal C1INH levels appear to require high estrogen levels for the angioedema to manifest, and HAE with normal C1INH levels can be caused by increased bradykinin signaling. Drugs developed for patients with HAE with reduced C1INH levels have been reported to be effective in some patients with HAE with normal C1INH levels.

Recorded Angioedema Attacks

In the period considered, the total validated attacks were 8848, attributable to 497 patients (Table 4). Most attacks (71%) occurred in patients not on prophylactic medication. The most frequently affected sites were the abdominal area and the skin. The severity of attacks was considered moderate, and attack duration was similar in patients with and without prophylaxis (Table 4).

### Increased thromboinflammatory load in hereditary angioedema [^115ypmU7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Even in the absence of clinically evident oedema, our study shows that HAE-C1Inh is associated with an increased thromboinflammatory load, as there is evidence for simultaneous hypercoagulation and low-grade inflammation.

Although HAE patients are biochemically in a hypercoagulable state, a clear association between HAE and venous thromboembolism (VTE) has not been established. A recent retrospective registry-based cohort study of Swedish patients found that HAE patients had a significantly higher risk of having registered VTE-related ICD-10 codes compared to controls. However, these findings are in contrast to previous studies which found no association between thromboembolism and HAE, even in the presence of elevated D-dimer.

An increased risk of autoimmune diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), has been reported in HAE patients. While increased levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-17 may play a role, the most important factor in SLE risk in HAE patients is likely to be the acquired C2 and C4 deficiency resulting from uncontrolled C1 autocatalysis. The probable protective mechanism of C2 and C4 is their role in promoting the clearance of immune complexes and apoptotic debris that may serve as autoantigens, and their deficiency may, therefore, predispose to SLE.

Acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — treatment parallels hereditary angioedema (HAE) with notable differences: the treatment of acquired C1INH deficiency is similar to that for HAE, although with increased efficacy of antifibrinolytic agents, decreased efficacy of C1INH replacement, and the need to diagnose an underlying condition; acute attacks do not respond to antihistamines or corticosteroids and have only a transient and nondurable response to epinephrine. For long‑term prophylaxis, androgens and antifibrinolytic drugs have been successfully used, and patients with acquired C1INH deficiency often respond better to antifibrinolytic drugs than to 17α‑alkylated androgens. Strategies to decrease anti‑C1INH antibody levels include plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and high‑dose intravenous immunoglobulin, and 3 autoantibody‑positive patients treated with rituximab experienced sustained remission.

Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (C1INH) long-term prophylaxis — efficacy, dosing, and safety: Replacement plasma-derived C1INH provides effective and safe long-term HAE prophylaxis, with a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial showing the frequency of attacks was 6.26 per 12 weeks on Cinryze compared with 12.73 per 12 weeks on placebo; a starting dose of 1000 U every 3 to 4 days is suggested with possible adjustment based on response. Open-label prophylaxis in 146 patients for up to 3 years reported the median attack rate on treatment decreased to less than 1 attack per 5 months from a median historical rate of 3 attacks per month. Chronic use is associated with the burden of administration of an intravenous drug and potential risks (eg, thrombosis and infection), and a survey of 66 physicians managing 586 patients with a C1INH product found that 5 (0.6%) had a clotting episode. Patients receiving prophylactic plasma-derived C1INH experience reduced frequency of attacks; however, the risk for attacks is not eliminated for some patients, and although not approved for children or adolescents, administration in properly selected patients might be warranted.

### Angioedema as a systemic disease [^113mR272]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Angioedema is a clinical entity defined as self-limiting edema localized in the deeper layers of the skin and mucosa and lasting for several days. Angioedema can be provoked by bradykinin and/or mast cell mediators, including histamine. Four types of acquired and three types of hereditary angioedema have been identified. The most obvious form of angioedema associated with other systemic disease is acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency. It is characterized by acquired consumption of C1 inhibitor and various underlying disorders, such as multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rectal carcinoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Suspected cases need an accurate differential diagnosis to exclude all other types of acquired and hereditary angioedema.

Cost of novel agents for C1INH deficiency syndromes — economic guidance: The novel agents for treatment of patients with C1INH deficiency syndromes are more costly than alternative treatment with attenuated androgens, and formal studies of cost utility and cost-effectiveness are required to aid providers in the management of patients with C1INH deficiency syndromes. The direct cost of the novel agents is substantially more than the cost of attenuated androgens, and there is an honest difference of opinion as to whether the greater direct cost should influence prescribing for long-term or on-demand treatment. The greater cost of these agents might be counterbalanced by lower rates of health service use and indirect medical expenditures caused by fewer exacerbations over time, less risk for harm, and improved quality of life, and formal economic models using cost-utility (cost per quality year of life gained) and cost-effectiveness (cost per attack prevented) analyses will be helpful to aid allergy/immunology providers in clarifying this issue.

### Clinical validity of dried blood spot assay for the measurement of functional C1 inhibitor in angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^115go9ST]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

On the basis of the clinical presentation, patients with HAE may be misdiagnosed with other types of angioedema (allergic or nonallergic) and/or gastrointestinal conditions. In patients with HAE, receiving a correct diagnosis is essential to support appropriate management of the disease and avoid ineffective treatments (eg, antihistamines, epinephrine, and corticosteroids)and/or unnecessary interventions (eg, appendectomies). Most importantly, timely HAE diagnosis may help to reduce mortality due to laryngeal attacks, considering that previous studies showed that up to 9 in 10 deaths due to asphyxiation in patients with HAE occurred in undiagnosed patients. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish HAE-C1INH from clinically similarly presenting acquired angioedema conditions (eg, acquired angioedema due to C1INH deficiency, acquired angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor–associated angioedema, idiopathic histaminergic angioedema, and idiopathic nonhistaminergic angioedema) to enable family screening of patients with HAE as recommended by international guidelines.

Although preventive efficacy is established, "their use during acute HAE attacks is unlikely to be reliably effective", because "These classes of medication require several days before they become optimally effective and thus might not have any therapeutic effect during the acute phase of the attack".

### Acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or serendipity? The chance finding of a paraprotein after an apparently low C1 esterase inhibitor concentration [^116BCH5t]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency is a rare condition, usually presenting after the 2nd decade of life, and is often related to underlying conditions such as autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders. This case report describes a man whose initial clinical presentation with acute angioedema and whose initial estimation of a low C1 esterase inhibitor concentration indicated that he had an acquired angioedema, possibly secondary to a B cell neoplasm. A paraprotein was detected, and although its detection was serendipitous because it hinged on a spurious C1 esterase inhibitor result, this case confirms the role of C4 concentrations in the investigation of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. It also confirms the need to obtain repeat confirmatory samples before arriving at a diagnosis, however convincing the clinical signs may be.

HAE short-term prophylaxis for predictable stressors — Short-term prophylactic therapy is meant to protect patients against the likelihood of experiencing acute attacks during a defined temporal window after a stimulus known to precipitate HAE attacks, and all patients with HAE are candidates for short-term prophylaxis for times when they are exposed to situations that are likely to trigger angioedema attacks. C1INH replacement is efficacious, well tolerated, and approved in the United States for prophylactic use; administration of 1000 to 2000 U or 20 U/kg for children of plasma-derived C1INH provides effective short-term prophylaxis. Traditionally, short-term prophylaxis has entailed the infusion of 2 U (10 mL/kg for children) of solvent/detergent-treated plasma or fresh frozen plasma several hours up to 12 hours before the expected procedure; compared with these, plasma-derived C1INH provides a more standardized dose and has undergone more rigorous viral inactivation steps. An alternative strategy consists of high-dose 17α-alkylated androgens (6–10 mg/kg/d in divided doses).

### A follow-up survey of patients with acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency [^112zHead]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (C1-INH-AAE) is a rare form of bradykinin-mediated angioedema. It is diagnosed by complement testing; its treatment consists of the management of angioedema (AE) attacks and of underlying disease.

Objective

Evaluate the results of the clinical follow-up of patients with C1-INH-AAE.

Methods

Between 1999 and 2020, 3938 patients with angioedema were evaluated, and 17 diagnosed with acquired C1-INH deficiency were followed-up.

Results

Mean age of the 17 patients was 61 years at diagnosis. In 33%, ACE inhibitors provoked AE attacks. Autoantibodies against C1-INH were detected in 10 patients at diagnosis and in a further patient during follow-up. The AE attacks involved the skin in 70.6%, the upper airways in 41.2% and the tongue/lip in 52.9% of patients. Twelve of the 17 patients had an underlying condition, mainly (n = 11) lymphoproliferative disease. In 10 patients diagnosed with a haematological disorder, AAE symptoms preceded the onset of the latter. One patient has not experienced an AE attack since diagnosis. Twelve patients were treated for angioedema attacks, and 32% of the attacks required acute treatment. PdC1-INH was used to relieve AE attacks, and rituximab for the treatment of underlying disease (in six patients). Six patients had multiple AE attacks before any treatment. The symptom-free period increased in five patients after the on-demand administration of pdC1-INH concentrate and following treatment of the underlying disease in two patients.

Conclusion

Early diagnosis of C1-INH-AAE and underlying disease is indispensable to reduce disease burden by introducing appropriate, individualized treatment and regular follow-up.

C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency testing using complement measurements: If the patient is not taking an ACE-I, then C1INH deficiency should be excluded, measurement of the complement C4 level, C1INH antigenic level, and C1INH functional level provides reliable information, the C4 level is an excellent screening tool, at least 95% of patients with C1INH deficiency will have a reduced C4 level even between attacks and this increases to virtually 100% during angioedema attacks, a normal C4 level during an attack strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis rather than C1INH deficiency, ordering the C4 level alone is a cost-effective screening strategy, and specimens should be sent promptly because delays can cause degradation and artificially low C4 levels and this also applies to C1INH function.

### Hereditary angioedema… [^11147Rxy]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

C1 esterase inhibitor prevents autoactivation of complement component C1, thus keeping the classic complement pathway quiescent. MAC indicates membrane attack complex. C1 esterase inhibitor inactivates factors XIIa and XIIf, plasmin, and kallikrein, thus preventing bradykinin production. C1 esterase inhibitor modulates complement and contact system activation, thus preventing bradykinin release and symptoms of hereditary angioedema. HMWK indicates high-molecular-weight kininogen; MAC, membrane attack complex. Acute exacerbations of the disease should be treated with intravenous purified C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate, where available. Intravenous administration of fresh frozen plasma is also useful in acute HAE; however, it occasionally exacerbates symptoms. Corticosteroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine can be useful adjuncts but typically are not efficacious in aborting acute attacks.

Prophylactic management involves long-term use of attenuated androgens or antifibrinolytic agents. Clinicians should keep this disorder in their differential diagnosis of unexplained, episodic cutaneous angioedema or abdominal pain. In a few individuals, angioedema occurs because of an intrinsic defect that abolishes one of the body's several safeguards against such occurrences. This defect allows a cascade of events that culminates in symptoms. This form of angioedema occurs as a result of either an inherited defect in C1 esterase inhibitor activity or an acquired deficiency of C1-INH. The inherited form of the disease, known as hereditary angioedema, is rare, although it is more common than acquired angioedema. Traditionally, 2 types of HAE have been described. Type 1 HAE, which is estimated to occur in 80% to 85% of patients, is caused by the decreased production of C1-INH, resulting in subnormal blood and tissue inhibitor activity.

In type 2 HAE, which occurs in the remaining 15% to 20% of patients, normal or elevated quantities of functionally impaired C1-INH are produced. Recently, a third type of HAE in which C1-INH levels and function are normal has been described, so far only in women.
2. Transient pleural effusions, sometimes with cough and mild pleuritic chest pain, can also occur.
9. C1 esterase inhibitor, an α2-globulin of approximately 105 kd, belongs to the serine protease inhibitor family that includes α1-antitrypsin and antithrombin. It is encoded on chromosome 11 and is synthesized mainly by hepatocytes, although peripheral blood monocytes can also synthesize significant quantities. This binding activates C1s, which acquires esterase activity and cleaves C4, thereby initiating a cascade of events that generates a complex of complement fragments termed the membrane attack complex.

This complex is responsible for the cell membrane damage that results in lysis of cells targeted by the specific immunoglobulins. During this cascade, C3a, C4a, and C5a are generated, cause increased capillary permeability, and contribute to edema and swelling of skin and organs that may be seen with massive complement activation, as occurs during an attack of HAE. A discussion of evidence for such autoactivation is beyond the scope of this review; however, several detailed articles have been written on the subject. 22, 25, 29–32 C1 esterase inhibitor prevents this autoactivation of C1 complement by causing dissociation of the C1q subunit and by forming an inactive C1r2-C1s2-2 complex. 22, 25 This complex is unable to cleave and activate complement components C4 and C2, the usual substrates of activated C1, thus keeping the classical pathway quiescent.

### Deucrictibant for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency: a randomized-controlled trial [^112kggi8]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency is a very rare but serious disease, with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 500,000 persons. There are no approved therapies to treat or prevent angioedema swelling in patients with this condition. Deucrictibant is a specific, orally bioavailable, competitive antagonist of the bradykinin B2 receptor currently under investigation for hereditary angioedema.

Objective

Our aim was to assess the efficacy and safety of deucrictibant as acute and prophylactic treatment for angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

Methods

A 2-part, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study was conducted. In Part 1, 4 consecutive angioedema attacks were treated with 3 doses of deucrictibant (10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg) or placebo. In Part 2, deucricibant, 20 mg, or placebo was administered twice daily for 2 treatment periods of 8 weeks.

Results

Three patients were enrolled; of those 3 patients, 1 completed both study parts and 2 completed only Part 2. In Part 1, a reduction in attack severity was observed in the 3 attacks treated with deucrictibant as opposed to an increase in severity of the attack treated with placebo. In Part 2, the individual mean monthly attack rates were 2.0, 0.6, and 1.0 during the placebo period and 0.0 across all patients during treatment with deucrictibant. There were no severe adverse events and 1 self-limiting treatment-emergent adverse event (abdominal pain).

Conclusions

Deucrictibant has the potential to effectively and safely treat and prevent angioedema attacks due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency.

### Acquired complement C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency in a patient with a rarevariant with unknown significance [^111j9Q6N]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Angioedema (AE) is caused by a wide range of diseases and pharmaceuticals; it can become life-threatening when located to the airways. Patients with deficiency or malfunction of complement C1 esterase inhibitor (hereditary or acquired) experience recurrent AE due to an accumulation of the vasoactive mediator bradykinin (BK). Complement C1 inhibitor normally decreases BK production, so a reduced function hereof causes increased levels. The diagnosis of hereditary or acquired AE can be difficult due to similarities to allergic reactions (swelling, abdominal pain, rash). We describe a 35-year-old man presenting with upper-airway AE progressing rapidly and promptly required cricothyroidotomy. Complement and autoantibody screening together with sequencing of SERPING1 were performed and gave the diagnosis of acquired complement C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. The patient is unusual to have this disease before the age of 40 years. No associated comorbidities were found. It is important to know that antiallergic medication is not effective in BK-mediated AE.

### Lymphoproliferative disease and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency [^116h74rw]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Angioedema due to acquired deficiency of the C1-inhibitor is a bridging condition between autoimmunity and lymphoproliferation. We report 32 patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: 23 have anti C1-inhibitor autoantibodies; 13 have monoclonal gammopathies of unknown significance and 9 have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Our series suggest that different forms of B cell disorders coexist and/or evolve into each other in acquired angioedema.

Chronic urticaria — evaluation of recurrent angioedema without urticaria should prioritize excluding complement-mediated and drug-associated causes before labeling idiopathic; specifically, patients "should be evaluated for hereditary angioedema, acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency, or ACE inhibitor–associated angioedema before a diagnosis of idiopathic angioedema is made", and when C1-inhibitor deficiency is suspected, "measurement of the C4 level is recommended as the best initial screening test", with "A normal C4 level during an episode of angioedema" strongly suggesting C1-inhibitor deficiency is unlikely; in contrast, for typical CU, "obtaining routine testing for C4 levels, C1-inhibitor levels, or functional assays is not appropriate".

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^1149zx6a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) laboratory diagnosis — Two forms of HAE, which are indistinguishable clinically, can be diagnosed by laboratory findings (A): type I HAE presents with low C1INH antigenic and functional levels, whereas type II HAE presents with normal C1INH antigenic levels but decreased C1INH functional levels. Diagnosis of type I or type II HAE requires evidence of low C1INH antigenic or functional levels, as well as decreased C4 levels and generally normal C1q levels (A). C1INH function should be measured with a chromogenic assay to achieve the greatest sensitivity in detecting C1INH functional deficiency. Measuring complement C4 levels is recommended as the initial screening test to exclude a diagnosis of HAE; in a study assessing screening tests, all 20 patients with untreated C1INH deficiency had a low level of C4, although C4 levels can be normal, particularly if the patient is already being treated.

Hereditary angioedema is caused in the majority of cases by genetically determined low absolute or functional levels of C1 inhibitor, a plasma proteinase inhibitor involved in regulation of complement activation. It is characterised clinically by recurrent subcutaneous and/or submucosal oedema and can result in life-threatening laryngeal obstruction. Involvement of the digestive tract commonly causes abdominal pain. This and the absence of accompanying urticarial weals or itch distinguish it from the common form of angioedema, which is part of the spectrum of urticaria.

### US HAEA medical advisory board 2020 guidelines for the management of hereditary angioedema [^116iocJR]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Scientific and clinical progress together with the development of effective novel therapeutic options has engendered multiple important changes in the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema (HAE). We now update and extend the 2013 United States Hereditary Angioedema Association Medical Advisory Board guidelines for the treatment and management of HAE. The guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature review with recommendations indicating both the strength of our recommendation and the quality of the underlying evidence. Guidelines are provided regarding the classification, diagnosis, on-demand treatment, prophylactic treatment, special considerations for women and children, development of a comprehensive management and monitoring plan, and assessment of burden of illness for both HAE due to C1 inhibitor deficiency and HAE with normal C1 inhibitor. Advances in HAE treatment now allow the development of management plans that can help many patients with HAE lead a normal life. Achieving this goal requires that physicians be familiar with the diagnostic and therapeutic transformations that have occurred in recent years.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^113sxFqQ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) and acquired C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency — diagnostic workup using complement testing: In patients with recurrent angioedema and a low C4, the possibilities include type I HAE, type II HAE, and acquired C1INH deficiency, and the first step is to determine whether the C1INH antigenic level is low or normal; if the antigenic level is normal, a C1INH functional level is required, and if both antigenic and functional levels are normal, C1INH deficiency is excluded and other causes (including idiopathic angioedema, allergic angioedema without urticaria, or HAE with normal C1INH levels) should be reconsidered. Type II HAE shows decreased C1INH functional levels with normal antigenic C1INH levels, C1INH function should be measured with a chromogenic assay, and clinically type I and type II HAE cannot be distinguished; approximately 15% of patients with HAE have type II HAE. If the C1INH antigenic level is low, type I HAE versus acquired C1INH deficiency should be considered; type I HAE usually presents in the first 2 decades of life; 50% of patients begin swelling by age 10 years and often have a positive family history, whereas acquired C1INH deficiency generally presents in middle-aged or older subjects without a strong family history, and when the history is unclear, the C1q level can be obtained because it is typically low in acquired C1INH deficiency but normal in type I HAE. The other 85% of patients with HAE have type I HAE, acquired C1INH deficiency is not associated with a positive family history, and all middle-aged or older patients with isolated recurrent angioedema should have the possibility of an acquired C1INH deficiency considered; if not C1INH deficiency, consider idiopathic angioedema, which is encountered much more frequently than C1INH deficiency syndromes.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) laboratory diagnosis — after confirmation of low C4, "the next step should be to measure C1INH antigen level (and function if the antigenic level is normal)". The functional C1 inhibitor (C1INH) level "should be less than 50% to 60% of the lower limit of normal to be compatible with HAE", and diagnostic patterns include low C4 with low C1INH antigen for type I HAE or low C4 with normal C1INH antigen and low function for type II HAE. Assay considerations note a chromogenic functional C1INH assay "appears to be superior to the ELISA-based C1INH functional assay", hemolytic complement assay "is the most accurate test" but not readily available, and "Positive screening test results… should be repeated once". For acquired C1INH deficiency, "the complement C1 (or complement C1q) level should be measured", orders should specify "C1q level and not C1q binding", and "C1q levels should be normal in patients with HAE but decreased in most cases of acquired C1INH deficiency".

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^116y9f7L]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Medium credibility.

ACE‑I–associated angioedema — mechanism centers on impaired degradation of vasoactive peptides: the angioedema associated with ACE‑Is is likely due to impaired degradation of bioactive peptides, such as bradykinin. ACE is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase that cleaves bradykinin and substance P, and when ACE is inhibited, bradykinin degradation is expected to be prolonged, which might contribute to the resultant angioedema; patients with ACE‑I–associated angioedema have been reported to have increased plasma bradykinin levels. Susceptibility might also reflect the level or activity of other bradykinin‑degrading enzymes, and a combined ACE and neutral endopeptidase inhibitor resulted in a higher incidence of angioedema than an ACE‑I alone. The mechanism for ARB‑associated angioedema has not been clearly determined; ARBs might also influence bradykinin levels, but further studies are required.

### Evidence-based recommendations for the therapeutic management of angioedema owing to hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency: consensus report of an international working group [^112V9NUU]. Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Angioedema owing to hereditary deficiency of C1 inhibitor (HAE) is a rare, life-threatening, disabling disease. In the last 2 years, the results of well-designed and controlled trials with existing and new therapies for this condition have been published, and new treatments reached the market. Current guidelines for the treatment for HAE were released before the new trials and before the new treatments became available and were essentially based on observational studies and expert opinion. To provide evidence-based HAE treatment guidelines supported by the new studies, a conference was held in Gargnano del Garda, Italy, from September 26 to 29, 2010. The meeting hosted 58 experienced HAE expert physicians, representatives of pharmaceutical companies and representatives of HAE patients' associations. Here, we report the topics discussed during the meeting and evidence-based consensus about management approaches for HAE in adult/adolescent patients.

### A focused parameter update: hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema [^113ZgkYH]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2013). Low credibility.

These parameters were developed by the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (JTFPP), representing the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI); the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (ACAAI); and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The AAAAI and the ACAAI have jointly accepted responsibility for establishing "A focused parameter update: Hereditary angioedema, acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-associated angioedema". This is a complete and comprehensive document at the current time. The medical environment is a changing environment, and not all recommendations will be appropriate for all patients. Because this document incorporated the efforts of many participants, no single individual, including those who served on the JTFPP, is authorized to provide an official AAAAI or ACAAI interpretation of these practice parameters. Any request for information about or an interpretation of these practice parameters by the AAAAI or ACAAI should be directed to the Executive Offices of the AAAAI, the ACAAI, and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters understands that the cost of diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents is an important concern that might appropriately influence the work-up and treatment chosen for a given patient. The JTFPP recognizes that the emphasis of our primary recommendations regarding a medication might vary, for example, depending on third-party payer issues and product patent expiration dates. However, because the cost of a given test or agent is so widely variable and there is a paucity of pharmacoeconomic data, the JTFPP generally does not consider cost when formulating practice parameter recommendations. In some instances the cost benefit of an intervention is considered relevant, and commentary might be provided. These parameters are not designed for use by pharmaceutical companies in drug promotion. The Joint Task Force is committed to ensuring that the practice parameters are based on the best scientific evidence that is free of commercial bias. To this end, the parameter development process includes multiple layers of rigorous review. These layers include the Workgroup convened to draft the parameter, the Task Force Reviewers, and peer review by members of each sponsoring society. Although the Task Force has the final responsibility for the content of the documents submitted for publication, each reviewer comment will be discussed, and reviewers will receive written responses to comments when appropriate. To preserve the greatest transparency regarding potential conflicts of interest, all members of the Joint Task Force and the Practice Parameters Workgroups will complete a standard potential conflict of interest disclosure form, which will be available for external review by the sponsoring organization and any other interested individual. In addition, before confirming the selection of a Workgroup chairperson, the Joint Task Force will discuss and resolve all relevant potential conflicts of interest associated with this selection. Finally, all members of parameter workgroups will be provided a written statement regarding the importance of ensuring that the parameter development process is free of commercial bias.

### Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor: an updated international consensus paper on diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment [^1155t7pd]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Algorithm for Diagnosis of HAE-nC1INH

The diagnosis of HAE should be considered in all patients with recurrent angioedema without hives. Proper diagnosis utilizes four modes of investigation: (1) clinical presentation (phenotype), (2) pathomechanism, (3) biomarkers, and (4) genetics. The diagnostic process is complicated by the reality that in clinical practice, many angioedema patients will have an unknown pathomechanism while validated biomarkers and genetic studies are either unavailable or uninformative. Thus, a combination of all the above parameters is highly desired but often not attainable. In the absence of helpful laboratory data, clinicians must assess the patients' responses over time to empiric treatment with medications targeting potential pathogenic pathways. This strategy can also be challenging as it requires prolonged patient engagement in a systematic stepwise treatment approach and may lack robust objective methods to assess efficacy. The algorithm below and Fig. 1 summarize the recommended approach for evaluating these patients. This approach may need to be further adapted according to the available expertise, testing facilities and resources. Patients presenting to an emergency department with an angioedema attack of unknown cause should be referred to a physician familiar with angioedema who can undertake this evaluation.

Step 1. Is the Diagnosis Tenable?

Confirm a clinical history of documented recurrent angioedema without hives. Photos and laryngoscopic and imaging evidence of angioedema are essential to differentiate true angioedema from factitious angioedema or patients who mistakenly believe they have angioedema based on non-angioedematous symptoms, both of which are common in patients (mis)diagnosed with HAE-nC1INH (Table 4). In the case of predominant gastrointestinal attacks, obtaining abdominal imaging during an attack can be useful to evaluate for bowel wall edema and intraperitoneal fluid. A detailed family history and medication history should be obtained in all patients with recurrent angioedema.

Table 4
Differential diagnosis of angioedema and angioedema mimics

Step 2. Exclude C1INH Deficiency

Measure C4, C1INH antigen, and C1INH function (if available), even if the patient is taking a medication that may cause angioedema. If acquired C1INH deficiency is suspected based on age of symptom onset, C1q level and anti-C1INH antibodies should be measured. Sequencing of SERPING1 is not routinely required, but can be helpful to distinguish acquired C1INH deficiency from HAE-C1INH, especially in patients aged > 40 years.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) short-term prophylaxis — Summary Statement 20: Short-term prophylaxis can be achieved by using fresh frozen plasma, C1INH replacement, or short-term, high-dose anabolic androgen therapy. (B). Traditional plasma regimens include solvent/detergent-treated plasma or fresh frozen plasma 2 U, or 10 mL/kg for children, administered several hours up to 12 hours before the expected procedure. Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor can be given as administration of 1000 to 2000 U of plasma-derived C1INH for short-term prophylaxis. In adults, high-dose 17a-alkylated androgens 6–10 mg/kg/d in divided doses to a maximum of 200 mg of danazol 3 times daily or equivalent are used for 5 to 10 days before the procedure and 2 days after. When trauma risk is minimal and on-demand therapy is readily available, deferring preprocedural treatment is an alternative, and a dose of on-demand acute treatment drug should be readily available in case it is needed.

The establishment of a global registry for C1-INH-HAE allows physicians to collect and analyze a large amount of data about this rare disease. In the near future, a new version of the registry with additional tools is planned. This instrument will enable physicians to perform more analyses and obtain better understanding of the natural course of C1-INH-HAE, as well as evaluate quality-of-life and effectiveness of on-demand and prophylactic treatments.

### The international WAO / EAACI guideline for the management of hereditary angioedema-the 2017 revision and update [^112vSqJ7]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) is a rare and disabling disease. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy are essential. This update and revision of the global guideline for HAE provides up-to-date consensus recommendations for the management of HAE. In the development of this update and revision of the guideline, an international expert panel reviewed the existing evidence and developed 20 recommendations that were discussed, finalized and consented during the guideline consensus conference in June 2016 in Vienna. The final version of this update and revision of the guideline incorporates the contributions of a board of expert reviewers and the endorsing societies. The goal of this guideline update and revision is to provide clinicians and their patients with guidance that will assist them in making rational decisions in the management of HAE with deficient C1-inhibitor (type 1) and HAE with dysfunctional C1-inhibitor (type 2). The key clinical questions covered by these recommendations are: (1) How should HAE-1/2 be defined and classified?, (2) How should HAE-1/2 be diagnosed?, (3) Should HAE-1/2 patients receive prophylactic and/or on-demand treatment and what treatment options should be used?, (4) Should HAE-1/2 management be different for special HAE-1/2 patient groups such as pregnant/lactating women or children?, and (5) Should HAE-1/2 management incorporate self-administration of therapies and patient support measures?

### A multi-centre UK-based survey on angioedema secondary to acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1119mPrZ]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acquired angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency (AAE-C1-INH) is very rare compared to its prototype, hereditary angioedema. An updated characterisation of the AAE-C1-INH cohort in UK is required to inform management.

Objectives

To describe the disease burden of AAE-C1-INH, long-term prophylaxis (LTP) and the clinical, immunochemical and treatment profiles of AAE-associated diseases in UK.

Method

Retrospective data on 117 AAE-C1-INH patients were collected using a national survey proforma across 25/34 Adult Clinical Immunology and Allergy centres in UK. Other European cohorts were compared.

Results

Median age at AAE-C1-INH diagnosis was 65 years with 3.4% of patients diagnosed below 40 years. The median delay in diagnosis was one year. Antifibrinolytics and attenuated androgens showed comparable efficacy as LTP 88.9% and 89.5%, respectively. A haematological disorder was identified in 83.8% AAE-C1-INH patients compared to 3.4% autoimmune diseases. The predominant haematological disorders were splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SZL) 34% followed by MGUS 16%. The severity of angioedema did not depend on the associated disease. Anti-C1INH-autoantibodies testing was limited at 23.1%. Rituximab monotherapy was effective in treating 9/9 SZL and 1/2 MGUS-associated AAE-C1-INH. Rituximab efficacy was independent of anti-C1INH-autoantibodies detection with response in 3/3 seronegative and 4/4 seropositive patients.

Conclusion

The diagnosis of AAE-C1-INH should not be overlooked below the age of 40 years. The choice of oral LTP should be informed by propensity to side-effects. B-cell depletion could be considered in treating monoclonal B cell disorder-associated-AAE-C1-INH in the absence of haematological indications. Further studies are required to address the clinical utility of anti-C1INH-autoantibodies.

### C1 inhibitor: from complement system to bradykinin angioedema [^114QFM72]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

C1 Inhibitor (C1INH) is a crucial regulator of multiple plasmatic pathways, including complement, coagulation, kallikrein-kinin systems, and fibrinolysis. C1INH deficiency results in the downstream overproduction of the vasoactive peptide bradykinin (BK), the primary mediator of angioedema (AE), a rare disease characterized by unpredictable attacks of swelling in various locations of the body. C1INH deficiency can be hereditary (caused by a mutation in SERPING1 gene) or acquired (frequently underlying lymphoproliferative disease); C1INH level and functional assays are the golden standard for biological diagnosis of C1INH deficiency. Other forms of hereditary angioedema with normal C1INH activity are emerged in recent years. The most recent guidelines have issue recommendations for classification, clinical and laboratory diagnosis, and management of AE with and without C1INH deficiency. Current axes of research aim to discover new diagnostic and/or prognostic markers of BK-mediated angioedema as well as emphasize the link between C1INH deficiency and chronic comorbidity.

### C1 inhibitor deficiency: 2014 United Kingdom consensus document [^111nfbq7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare disorder manifesting with recurrent attacks of disabling and potentially life-threatening angioedema. Here we present an updated 2014 United Kingdom consensus document for the management of C1 inhibitor-deficient patients, representing a joint venture between the United Kingdom Primary Immunodeficiency Network and Hereditary Angioedema UK. To develop the consensus, we assembled a multi-disciplinary steering group of clinicians, nurses and a patient representative. This steering group first met in 2012, developing a total of 48 recommendations across 11 themes. The statements were distributed to relevant clinicians and a representative group of patients to be scored for agreement on a Likert scale. All 48 statements achieved a high degree of consensus, indicating strong alignment of opinion. The recommendations have evolved significantly since the 2005 document, with particularly notable developments including an improved evidence base to guide dosing and indications for acute treatment, greater emphasis on home therapy for acute attacks and a strong focus on service organization.

### Establishing a hereditary angioedema prevalence for the United States using a large administrative claims database [^1155Ut2Q]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare, potentially life-threatening genetic disorder. No US prevalence for all types of HAE has been estimated. Approval of 8 effective HAE therapies in the United States significantly expanded treated patient numbers and data collected in claims databases.

Objective

To provide the first US prevalence estimate of HAE (all types) using claims-based insurance data.

Methods

This retrospective study estimated the US prevalence of HAE using IQVIA's PharMetrics Plus MedTech claims database. Patients with 24 months of continuous database enrollment were divided into the following 3 cohorts: 2018, 2019, and 2020. Owing to the absence of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification or International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnostic codes specific to HAE, we developed a proxy algorithm using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for "angioneurotic edema" or "defects in the complement system" with more than or equal to 1 pharmacy claim for an HAE-indicated medication. An expert panel reviewed anonymized patient-level aggregate claims data to determine HAE status. A sensitivity analysis generated adjustment factors to address underrepresentation of Medicare patients in PharMetrics Plus MedTech database.

Results

For 2018, 2019, and 2020, the claims-based algorithm yielded overall annual unadjusted HAE prevalence estimates per 100,000 and number of people diagnosed with HAE of 2.67, 9559; 2.61, 9341; and 2.43, 8694, respectively. The corresponding estimates based on expert physician analysis were 2.13, 7602; 2.03, 7275; and 1.84, 6595, respectively.

Conclusion

Our study provides the first claims-based comprehensive estimate of the US prevalence for all types of HAE across age groups, sexes, and geographic regions. Our calculations (which exceed the frequently cited 2:100,000 prevalence for HAE with C1 inhibitor deficiency) afford a real-world projected prevalence encompassing all types of HAE.

### The global registry for hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency [^117M1q9f]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare condition, mostly due to genetic deficiency of complement C1 inhibitor (C1-INH). The rarity of HAE impedes extensive data collection and assessment of the impact of certain factors known to affect the course of this disabling and life-threatening disease. Establishing a global registry could assist to overcome such issues and provides valuable patient data from different countries. The HAE Global Registry is a disease-specific registry, with web-based electronic support, where data are provided by physicians and patients through a dedicated application. We collected data between January 1, 2018, and August 31, 2020. Data on 1297 patients from 29 centers in 5 European countries were collected. At least one attack was recorded for 497 patients during the study period. Overall, 1182 patients were diagnosed with HAE type 1 and 115 with type 2. At the time of database lock, 389 patients were taking long-term prophylactic medication, 217 of which were on danazol. Most recorded attacks affected the abdomen, were generally moderate in severity, and occurred in patients who were not on prophylactic treatment (70.6%, 6244/8848). The median duration of attacks was 780 min (IQR 290–1740) in patients on prophylactic medication and 780 min (IQR 300–1920) in patients not on continuous prophylactic medication. In conclusion, the establishment of a registry for C1-INH-HAE allowed collection of a large amount of data that may help to better understand the clinical characteristics of this disease. This information may enhance patient care and guide future therapeutic decisions.

### The global registry for hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency [^114ufyhR]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This registry also has some limitations. First, the completeness of the data on recorded attacks is a matter of concern, as only 497 patients reported ≥ 1 attack. Of these patients, 359 (72%) recorded the attack by the App. The attacks from the remaining 138 were inserted by physicians. No attacks were recorded for 800 patients, thus raising some doubts regarding patient compliance. Another critical issue is the validation of attacks by physicians, which may result in a workload not always sustainable without adequate staff support.

Second, the registry needs to be fed continuously. So far, few European countries participate in this project, and the involved countries are far from covering the whole national patient population. Several HAE reference centers, even in the participating countries, did not provide data to this registry. Hungary is an exception, as it seems to have included the larger majority (91%) of the evaluated patients.

Finally, the dates of the first onset of symptoms were not captured, and dates about the diagnosis alone do not allow us to know what was the cause of delay in diagnosis. We can only calculate the mean delay of the diagnosis from the reference age of 20 years, as it was shown that 85% of HAE patients were already symptomatic during the first two decades of life. The delay in diagnosis for HAE is estimated to range between 12 and 16.3 years from the first onset of symptoms. According to these presumptions, the mean delay in the diagnosis found in our study was circ. 5 years.

### A national survey of hereditary angioedema and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in the United Kingdom [^113g22zi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Detailed demographic data on people with hereditary angioedema (HAE) and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in the United Kingdom are relatively limited. Better demographic data would be beneficial in planning service provision, identifying areas of improvement, and improving care.

Objective

To obtain more accurate data on the demographics of HAE and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in the United Kingdom, including treatment modalities and services available to patients.

Methods

A survey was distributed to all centers in the United Kingdom that look after patients with HAE and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency to collect these data.

Results

The survey identified 1152 patients with HAE-1/2 (58% female and 92% type 1), 22 patients with HAE with normal C1 inhibitor, and 91 patients with acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. Data were provided by 37 centers across the United Kingdom. This gives a minimum prevalence of 1:59,000 for HAE-1/2 and 1:734,000 for acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in the United Kingdom. A total of 45% of patients with HAE were on long-term prophylaxis (LTP) with the most used medication being danazol (55% of all patients on LTP). Eighty-two percent of patients with HAE had a home supply of acute treatment with C1 inhibitor or icatibant. A total of 45% of patients had a supply of icatibant and 56% had a supply of C1 inhibitor at home.

Conclusions

Data obtained from the survey provide useful information about the demographics and treatment modalities used in HAE and acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency in the United Kingdom. These data are useful for planning service provision and improving services for these patients.

Patients with Acquired Angioedema (C1-INH-AAE)

In 10 C1-INH-AAE patients (age: median 59 years, range 49–83), 6 out of 10 patients had some kind of hematologic disorder as well. The median AE-QoL total score was 30.9, and the median of number of AE attacks was 0.5. From the domains of the questionnaire, the Fatigue/Mood and Fear/Shame domains received the highest score (median 50 and 37.5, respectively). This was followed by Food (25) and Functioning (6.3). There was a significant correlation between the annual number of attacks and the AE-QoL total scores (r = 0.46; p < 0.0001). Similar to C1-INH-HAE, AE-QoL and complement values were not correlated.

Those C1-INH-AAE patients who had an underlying hematologic/lymphoproliferative disease reported worse QoL, and the Fatigue/Mood and Fear/Shame domain scores were worse as well. In contrast, Functioning and Food domains were reported worse for those who did not have any kind of underlying disease (Fig. 1).

### The global registry for hereditary angioedema due to C1-inhibitor deficiency [^113f9hXE]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

We collected data on living C1-INH-HAE type 1 or type 2 patients from all participating centers. The diagnosis of C1-INH-HAE type 1 and 2 was based on the following criteria: C1-INH-HAE type I was diagnosed when functional and antigenic C1-INH were ≤ 50% of normal, and type II when functional C1-INH was ≤ 50% and antigenic C1-INH was > 50% of normal. Normal values were 70–130% for functional C1-INH, 70–115% for antigenic C1-INH, and 60–140% for antigenic C4.

The following patients' data were included in this study: number of patients per center, age, gender, HAE diagnosis, number of patients recording at least one attack, the tool used for recording the attacks, and the number of recorded patients during the study period. In addition, the distribution of patients taking long-term prophylactic medication according to the type of prophylaxis, gender, and age was extracted, using the ongoing situation at the time of database lock, that is, on August 31, 2020.

Data on valid attacks occurring from January 1, 2018, to August 31, 2020 were included in this analysis. We recorded the total valid attacks, attack location, severity, duration, and the use of prophylactic treatment. We assessed the severity of attacks, according to their interference with activities of daily living, as: 'mild' if no interferences were experienced, 'moderate' in case of partial interference, and 'severe' for complete incapacity.

### Small bowel angioedema due to acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency: a case report and overview [^117PKsz5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Acquired angioedema is a rare disorder caused by an acquired deficiency of C1 inhibitor. It is characterized by nonpitting, nonpruritic subcutaneous or submucosal edema of the skin, or of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. When localized in the gastrointestinal tract, it can cause severe abdominal pain, mimicking an acute surgical abdomen, or chronic recurrent pain of moderate intensity. We report a case of a 48-year-old man presenting with recurrent episodes of hypotension and abdominal pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen showed edema of the small bowel. The first determinations of C1 inhibitor level and activity, measured in a symptom-free period, were normal. Repetition of the laboratory tests in the acute phase, however, showed a low C1 inhibitor level. Further diagnostic work-up indicated an acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency caused by a monoclonal gammopathy. He was treated with tranexamic acid as prophylaxis for his frequent attacks and to date, he has remained symptom free. Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is a rare cause of angioedema and is, among others, related to autoantibodies and abnormal B-cell proliferation, for example monoclonal gammopathy. The diagnosis of acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency is made on the basis of the medical history and on the level and activity of plasma C4, C1q, and C1 inhibitor. In case of high suspicion and a normal C1 inhibitor activity, it is recommended to repeat this test during an angioedema attack. Early diagnosis is important for the treatment of severe, potentially life-threatening attacks and to start prophylactic treatment in patients with frequent or severe angioedema attacks.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency [^1173m7ES]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient's Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children < 12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States. The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient's Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE.

AE due to acquired C1-INH deficiency (C1-INH-AAE): C1-INH deficiency can also be acquired. It occurs due to increased catabolism of C1-INH, when C1-INH degradation outperforms the synthesis of new C1-INH. Patients with C1-INH-AAE often have an underlying disease such as a lymphoproliferative disorder that leads to continuous activation of the classic complement pathway with consequent depletion of C1-INH. Some patients may also develop autoantibodies to C1-INH protein, which interferes with its level and activity. Like C1-INH-HAE, AE in patients with C1-INH-AAE has elevated plasma BK levels.

Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema (ACEi-AE): ACE is a protease that cleaves BK. When ACE is inhibited, BK degradation is impaired, which facilitates the development of AE. Indeed, patients with ACEi-AE have been reported to have increased plasma BK levels. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPPIV) or neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase) inhibitors used in the treatment of hypertension can increase the propensity of drug-induced angioedema significantly when combined with ACEi.

### Daratumumab-based treatment of monoclonal gammopathy-associated angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency [^115hkNN3]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2024). Medium credibility.

Angioedema due to acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency (AAE-C1INH) is a very rare but serious condition that has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 500,000 individuals and is characterized by unpredictable, debilitating, and potentially life-threatening bouts of swelling. AAE-C1INH typically arises in persons older than 40 years and is thought to result either from increased clearance of C1-inhibitor (C1INH) by autoantibodies, which are identified in 47% to 67% of patients, or from increased consumption of C1INH leading to activation of the classical complement pathway by anti-idiotype antibodies. A deficiency of C1INH leads to insufficient inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system and subsequent excessive production of bradykinin, inducing increased vascular permeability and formation of angioedema. Anti-CD20 treatment with rituximab (with or without coadministration of cyclophosphamide) is reported to effectively restore C1INH functionality in most patients, even when no associated conditions are identified. Additionally, off-label use of therapies developed for hereditary angioedema have been reported to be effective in reducing attack frequency. Long-term control of disease can also be achieved through treatment of associated conditions that have been implicated in the development of AAE-C1INH, including autoimmune and B-cell proliferative disorders such as monoclonal gammopathy. Monoclonal gammopathy is a common premalignant condition. Found in 1% to 2% percent of adults, it is typically asymptomatic and often diagnosed through the incidental finding of a serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) after diagnostic exclusion of lymphoproliferative disorders. Treatment of the underlying clonal disease is indicated only in cases of monoclonal gammopathy of clinical significance (MGCS), when the small clone (serum M-protein level < 3 g/dL and < 10% monoclonal plasma cell infiltration of bone marrow) leads to symptoms via a pathologic paraprotein or other mechanisms.

### Acquired angioedema: an unusual presentation of haematological malignancy [^1152rK4d]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A previously healthy man in his 60s being worked up for splenomegaly presented to the emergency department with recurrent episodes of angioedema. Each episode was attributed to a precipitating cause, and consequently, the predisposing C1 esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency remained undiagnosed until the third presentation. The aetiology of acquired C1-INH deficiency would be primarily obscure and require further investigations to identify. A clonal B cell population was finally isolated by flow cytometry after multiple repeat marrow samples, and a diagnosis of splenic marginal zone lymphoma was subsequently reached. Response to single-agent rituximab was observed with resolution of splenomegaly, disappearance of the antibody and restoration of C1-INH levels.

### An update on the diagnosis and management of hereditary angioedema with abnormal C1 inhibitor [^111Ee6uP]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare genetic disease caused by a deficiency in functional C1-esterase inhibitor characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema in the absence of associated urticaria. Subcutaneous swellings are experienced by virtually all patients with HAE, and dermatologists are likely to encounter this manifestation, requiring that they be knowledgeable about diagnosis and treatment options. Diagnosis of HAE is often delayed because several of the symptoms can mimic other disease states. Delays in diagnosis can lead to increased inappropriate treatment and decreased patient quality of life. Once a proper diagnosis is made, treatment needs to be targeted to the individual patient and includes on-demand therapy and an option for short- and long-term prophylaxis. On-demand therapy is required for all patients who are diagnosed with HAE and effective options include plasma-derived and recombinant C1 inhibitors, kallikrein inhibitors, and bradykinin B2-receptor antagonists. Options available for prophylaxis include plasma-derived C1 inhibitors, attenuated androgens, and antifibrinolytic agents, although the latter 2 options are associated with significant adverse events. This article reviews the diagnosis and options for effective management of patients with HAE.
