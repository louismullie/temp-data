## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the area of a rectangle inscribed in a triangle, with the rectangle's base on the triangle's base and its height given as x. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry and draw a diagram. Then, I should identify similar triangles and set up a proportion to find the rectangle's width. Next, I will compute the rectangle's area and simplify the expression. Finally, I will verify the answer against the provided options and double-check for any algebraic or conceptual errors.

> Let me first confirm the setup: a triangle with base b and height h has a rectangle inscribed so that the rectangle's base lies on the triangle's base and its height is x, which means the top of the rectangle is parallel to the base and sits at a distance x above it. I should draw this to visualize the similar triangles formed above the rectangle, because that will be key to relating the rectangle's width to the given dimensions.

> Wait, let me verify the similar triangles before I proceed. The large triangle has height h and base b, and above the rectangle there is a smaller triangle that is similar to the large one, with height (h − x) and unknown base, which I'll call w, the width of the rectangle. By similarity, the ratio of base to height should be the same, so w / (h − x) = b / h, which gives w = b(h − x)/h. Hold on, I should double-check that the heights are aligned correctly: yes, the small triangle's height is indeed h − x, so the proportion is valid.

> Now I will compute the area of the rectangle. Area equals width times height, so Area = w × x = [b(h − x)/h] × x = bx(h − x)/h. Let me simplify that to match the options: it becomes (bx/h)(h − x), which corresponds to option A. I should confirm that I didn't flip any terms; no, the algebra is correct and the units make sense dimensionally.

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought option E, x(h − x), might be plausible because it has the right factors, but that would only be correct if the width were simply (h − x), which it is not; the width depends on the triangle's base and height via similarity, so the correct expression must include the ratio b/h, which points back to option A. I should explicitly reject E because it omits the scaling factor from the triangle's geometry.

> Final answer: The area of the rectangle is (bx/h)(h − x), which is option A.

---

The area of the rectangle is **(A) ([bx/h](h − x))**.

---

## Geometric setup

Consider a triangle with base (b) and height (h). A rectangle is inscribed such that its base lies on the base of the triangle and its height is (x). The top vertices of the rectangle touch the two sides of the triangle, forming a smaller triangle above the rectangle.

---

## Similar triangles

The smaller triangle above the rectangle is similar to the original triangle. The height of the smaller triangle is (h - x), and its base is the width of the rectangle, denoted by (w). By similarity, the ratio of the base to the height is the same for both triangles:

[w/(h − x)] = [b/h]

Solving for (w):

w = [b/h](h − x)

---

## Area of the rectangle

The area (A) of the rectangle is the product of its width and height:

A = w × x = [b/h](h − x) × x = [bx/h](h − x)

---

## Verification of options

Comparing the derived expression with the given options:

- **(A) ([bx/h](h − x))**: Matches the derived expression.
- **(B) ([hx/b](b − x))**: Incorrect dimensions and form.
- **(C) ([bx/h](h − 2 x))**: Incorrect subtraction term.
- **(D) (x(b − x))**: Missing the height ratio [b/h].
- **(E) (x(h − x))**: Missing the base ratio [b/h].

---

## Conclusion

The correct answer is **(A) ([bx/h](h − x))**.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### Ultra-high dynamic range quantum measurement retaining its sensitivity [^6f9c90ae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

To improve the sensitivity for a large range, initially, a number of measurements with different areas are combined to uniquely define the magnetic field amplitude in a range limited by the measurement with the smallest area (Fig. 1d). Consequently, only part of the measurement time is spent on the largest area, which has the best sensitivity (but a small range), while the remainder of the time is spent on areas with a worse sensitivity. Therefore, the sensitivity of the combined measurement is strictly worse than this best sensitivity. Using halved areas (hence requiring at leastadditional areas) and the same number of iterations for each area and using no optimisations, for roughly the same σ B, the measurement time for the combined sequence. Thus, the sensitivity would becometimes worse, which is already a significant improvement compared to the straightforward case in the last paragraph.

The measurements resulting from different areas are combined via Bayes' theorem. For area A n, the measurement gives signal S n (for example the crosses/circles/triangles on the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d for three areas). The posterior probability distribution for the magnetic field B given measured signal S n iswiththe prior distribution, independent of B, andwiththe relation between the signal S and the applied field B (the sinusoids in Fig. 1a, d, e). Fig. 1e visualises these equations.is a Poisson distribution (counting photons), but it can be approximated by a normal distribution (green line along y -axis in Fig. 1e) when more than ~10 photons arrive (with continuity correction). This is generally the case when the uncertainty is below the maximum uncertainty, as described later. For the first measurement, the prior distribution is flat since there is no initial knowledge about the field, and for the remainder of the measurements, the previous posterior is the new prior distribution. This results in a combined distribution as demonstrated in Fig. 1f.

### CTLA-4 expression by B-1a B cells is essential for immune tolerance [^abe930a7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The forward V H primers used to amplify expressed IgH genes are located at the IgH framework region 2. To avoid primers interfering with the mutation analysis, the variable region stretching from the beginning of the CDR2 to the beginning to the CDR3 was examined for mismatches between the sequence read and the best-aligned germline reference sequence. To eliminate the impact of sequencing error on this calculation, only sequence reads with more than four copies were included in the mutation calculation.

D50 is a measurement of the diversity of an immune repertoire of J individuals (total number of CDR3s, Eq. (1)) composed of S distinct CDR3s in a ranked dominance configuration, where r i is the abundance of the most abundant CDR3: r 1 is the abundance of the most abundant CDR3, r 2 is the abundance of the second most abundant CDR3, and so on. C is the minimum number of distinct CDR3s amounting to ≥ 50% total sequencing reads. D50 is given by Eq. (2)To draw the TCRβ CDR3 tree-map for each sequencing sample, the entire rectangle is first divided into a set of rectangles with each rectangle corresponding to a distinct Vβ gene segment. The size of the individual rectangle is proportional to the relative frequency of sequence expressing a given Vβ gene. The rectangles are ordered based on area from large at the bottom right to small at the top left. Each Vβ rectangle is then further divided into a set of Vβ-Jβ rectangles with each rectangle corresponding to a distinct Vβ-Jβ combination. The size of the Vβ-Jβ rectangle is proportional to the relative frequency for a given Vβ-Jβ combination sequence. Vβ-Jβ rectangles are ordered based on area from large at the bottom right to small at the top left. Similarly, each Vβ-Jβ rectangles is further divided into a set of Vβ-Jβ-CDR3 rectangles with each rectangle representing a distinct Vβ-Jβ-CDR3 combination. The size of the particular Vβ-Jβ-CDR3 rectangle is proportional to the relative frequency for each Vβ-Jβ-CDR3 combination sequence. Therefore, each rectangle drawn in the map represents an individual CDR3 nucleotide sequence. In order to distinguish neighboring rectangles, corners of each rectangle are rounded and each rectangle are colored randomly.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^031312fd]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

### Technique of area measurement of epithelial defects [^65394279]. Cornea (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare two commonly used methods of area measurement of corneal epithelial defects, namely, estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle and use of image analysis software, the gold standard.

Methods

Thirty-eight patients with corneal epithelial defects were evaluated. The largest linear dimension of the epithelial defect and its largest possible perpendicular within the confines of the epithelial defect were measured using a slit lamp. The area was then measured using digital photographs and image analysis software. A paired sample t test was used to compare the results.

Results

The two measurements of area correlated well (P = 0.84); their difference was insignificant (P = 0.063) and a linear regression relation between the two could be derived with an r2 value of 0.71, which was significant.

Conclusions

Accurate slit-lamp measurements with estimation of the area of an equivalent rectangle can safely be used as a measure of the epithelial defect size when sophisticated image analysis software is not available.

### Patency of the lenticulostriate and pontine arteries after stenting of the intracranial arteries [^fdd1b68b]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Geometric models of the Spatial relationships between the stent struts and the perforating arteries

After the dimensions of all perforating artery origins were measured, the formulas for the coverage percentage of the perforating artery origins depending on the stent strut width were calculated. Two clinical situations were considered — stent strut lies on the major axis of the perforating artery ostium (Model 1) and two parallel stent struts cover the ostium, mimicking the telescopic technique (Model 2, Fig. 1). The formulas were as follows:

whereis the stent strut width and whereis the length of origin short axis. For every perforating artery, calculations were performed for stent strut widths of 30, 60, 78, 100 and 150. The first three values are typical of flow diverting stents, and the other two values are typical of conventional stents. The analysis was performed with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Fig. 1
Geometric representations of the problem of coverage of perforating artery origin (red ellipse) by stent struts (grey boxes). The width of the stent strut is equal to d, the long and short axes of the origin are equal to 2a and 2b, respectively. MCA middle cerebral artery

The geometrical analogy of an ostium of a perforating artery covered by a stent strut is an ellipse covered by a rectangle (Model 1). The least optimal situation is when the stent strut lies on the major axis. Figure 1 shows the geometrical problem: an ellipse (semimajor axis lengthand semiminor axis length) covered by a rectangle (shorter side length).

We would like to calculate the area of the ostium of the perforating artery uncovered by the stent strut: four times the green figure area. The green figure shows the area of a disk sector (radius length, central angle) minus the area of the orthogonal triangle (hypotenuse, cathetus); the disc sector area should be scaledtimes.

### Strong coronal channelling and interplanetary evolution of a solar storm up to earth and mars [^14773ca0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Visualizing a self-similar propagating ellipse

Figure 5a shows the geometry of an ellipse under the assumptions described above. The R (t) of the ellipse apex (the point of the ellipse farthest from the Sun along the ellipse central direction) is given by DBM. In this section, we derive equations for the ellipse semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b as a function of R (t), the inverse aspect ratio f and the half width λ. We use f = b/a rather than a r = a/b because it simplifies the following calculation. The equations

follow from the definition of f and the definition of angle β, which is the angle between the semi-major axis a and the normal to the tangent at point T (Fig. 5a). The location of T is the point of tangency on the ellipse for a line originating at the Sun. It can be easily seen that β = λ by checking the sum of the angles of the small orange triangle in Fig. 5a in relation to a larger triangle (not highlighted) containing the angles λ and η. The polar angle of the ellipse θ is given by a relationship from general ellipse geometry between β and θ. It is important to emphasize that we further construct the ellipse based on this particular value of θ, for which a line with distance r connects the ellipse center C to point T. Combining equation (2) gives a relationship for the polar angle θ based on known parameters,

From the law of sines on the large orange-shaded triangle in Fig. 5a we derive:

Angle α follows from the angles of the orange-shaded triangle, and distance r from the definition of an ellipse in polar coordinates:

The last equation can be rewritten with the definition of f as

Introducing α from equation (5) and the last equation for r into equation (4) then eliminates the unknowns (α, r) and expresses b in function of known variables:

Equations (7) are the final description of the ellipse parameters. The minor axis b of the ellipse depends on all known variables (R (t), f, λ) through θ and ω, from equations (3) and (6). The major axis a then simply follows from the definition of f in equations (2). The heliocentric distance of the centre of the ellipse is parameter c (Fig. 5b), closing the model equations necessary for visualizing the ellipse.

### Fractal modes and multi-beam generation from hybrid microlaser resonators [^29f660d7]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Fractal modes for three and four microsphere topologies

We observe fractal laser modes in the interstices of a microsphere array that are encompassed by three or more spheres. Owing to the reflectivity of polystyrene or silica spheres at grazing incidence, diffraction losses in the resonator of Fig. 1a are reduced in the vicinity of the sphere/water (gain medium) interface and fractal modes appear. Furthermore, the fractal modes associated with specific microsphere arrangements appear to be unique to that geometry. Both three and four sphere topologies have been examined and, for interstitial regions encompassed by three spheres, four distinct fractal laser modes have been observed. Two of these resemble the Sierpinski Triangle and one matches the prediction of Fresnel diffraction simulations. The ability afforded by microfabrication techniques to position microspheres precisely on a mirror surface allows for a desired fractal mode to be produced and to pattern the requisite sphere arrangement over substantial areas.

A light scattering system devised by Sweet et al. comprising reflecting spheres arranged in the form of a trigonal pyramid, yielded fractal patterns in the light intensity distribution emerging from any of the four optical ports ("basins"). In the present experiments, the top sphere of the ref.pyramid has been removed, and a symmetric resonator is realized in which microsphere ensembles in the form of quasi-triangles, rectangles, etc. are positioned between two mirrors (Fig. 1a). Figure 2 is a representative microscope image of a portion of an array of 200 μm diameter spheres within the resonator of Fig. 1a. Recorded in plan view (oriented toward the bottom mirror) with a 20 × microscope objective, this micrograph was acquired with a single pulse of the pump laser, and the spatial scale at lower right indicates a length of 25 μm. The interstice at upper right (where dashed white circles denote the perimeters of the three bordering spheres) shows a laser fractal mode, and a second, weaker mode is developing in the inter-sphere gap at lower right. The dominant feature of the stronger transverse laser mode comprises two superimposed triangles forming a "Star of David" pattern, lying at the junction of three larger triangles separated azimuthally by 120 o. Another unanticipated aspect of the experimental results reported here is that of coupled fractals, illustrated by the inset to Fig. 2 (lower left). In this case, two of the spheres have been separated intentionally and the extension of laser radiation beyond the 3-sphere interstice is evident.

### A general method for the creation of dilational surfaces [^6025b588]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Dilational structures can change in size without changing their shape. Current dilational designs are only suitable for specific shapes or curvatures and often require parts of the structure to move perpendicular to the dilational surface, thereby occupying part of the enclosed volume. Here, we present a general method for creating dilational structures from arbitrary surfaces (2-manifolds with or without boundary), where all motions are tangent to the described surface. The method consists of triangulating the target curved surface and replacing each of the triangular faces by pantograph mechanisms according to a tiling algorithm that avoids collisions between neighboring pantographs. Following this algorithm, any surface can be made to mechanically dilate and could, theoretically, scale from the fully expanded configuration down to a single point. We illustrate the method with three examples of increasing complexity and varying Gaussian curvature.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the non-surgical management of hip&knee osteoarthritis [^4d4c2921]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Algorithm — hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) management is presented as a step-by-step decision tree to facilitate understanding of clinical pathways and decision-making, with standardized symbols and ordered flow. This clinical practice guideline includes an algorithm designed to facilitate understanding of the clinical pathways and decision-making processes used in managing patients with OA and includes an ordered sequence of steps of care, recommended observations and examinations, decisions to be considered, and actions to be taken. For each VA/DoD clinical practice guideline, a corresponding clinical algorithm is depicted by a step-by-step decision tree; standardized symbols are used to display each step, and arrows connect the numbered boxes indicating the order in which the steps should be followed. Shape legend for interpreting the algorithm: rounded rectangles represent a clinical state or condition, hexagons represent a decision point formulated as a question that can be answered Yes or No, rectangles represent an action in the process of care, and ovals represent a link to another section within the guideline.

### Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle [^c8aad05c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

As we presented geometric structures of different shapes, we had also predicted that conservatives would prefer the shape of a triangle more often than liberals, and liberals would prefer the circle more often than conservatives (because it is the most "egalitarian" shape, with no dot seeming more important than any other). This prediction was confirmed, marginally: conservatives relative to liberals slightly preferred the triangle relative to the circle, r (2072) = −0.04, p = 0.054.

Separate multiple regressions in which preference for looseness-tightness and preference for circle were the outcome variables, respectively, and political ideology, age, gender, and education were predictor variables revealed that political ideology predicted looseness-tightness preference and preference for shape significantly (see Table 1). These analyses again suggest that political ideology meaningfully affects this basic preference for geometric looseness-tightness, independent of other related demographic variables.

Again, to examine the relationship between ideology, geometric looseness–tightness preference, and social looseness–tightness preference, we computed the same social looseness–tightness score as in Study 2a and conducted the same mediation analysis as in Study 2a. This analysis, with 679 participants, also confirmed partial mediation — political ideology indirectly affected people's preference for social looseness–tightness through a preference for geometric looseness–tightness (95% confidence interval = −0.04 to −0.095). These findings again suggest that the relationship between ideology and geometric looseness–tightness maps on to preferences for social looseness–tightness.

Building on Studies 1–2, showing that liberals and conservatives demonstrate universalism versus parochialism, respectively, Study 3 tests whether this pattern extends to evaluations of nonhumans versus humans, testing the hypothesis that liberals relative to conservatives will show more moral concern toward nonhuman (relative to human) targets. Although existing work shows ideologies associated with conservatism like social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism predict beliefs in human superiority over nonhuman animals and positive attitudes toward animal exploitation, the studies here explicitly test the relationship between political ideology and moral concern toward humans versus nonhumans.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^3bf27a75]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### From molecular to macroscopic via the rational design of a self-assembled 3D DNA crystal [^7b5f59e7]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

We live in a macroscopic three-dimensional (3D) world, but our best description of the structure of matter is at the atomic and molecular scale. Understanding the relationship between the two scales requires a bridge from the molecular world to the macroscopic world. Connecting these two domains with atomic precision is a central goal of the natural sciences, but it requires high spatial control of the 3D structure of matter. The simplest practical route to producing precisely designed 3D macroscopic objects is to form a crystalline arrangement by self-assembly, because such a periodic array has only conceptually simple requirements: a motif that has a robust 3D structure, dominant affinity interactions between parts of the motif when it self-associates, and predictable structures for these affinity interactions. Fulfilling these three criteria to produce a 3D periodic system is not easy, but should readily be achieved with well-structured branched DNA motifs tailed by sticky ends. Complementary sticky ends associate with each other preferentially and assume the well-known B-DNA structure when they do so; the helically repeating nature of DNA facilitates the construction of a periodic array. It is essential that the directions of propagation associated with the sticky ends do not share the same plane, but extend to form a 3D arrangement of matter. Here we report the crystal structure at 4 A resolution of a designed, self-assembled, 3D crystal based on the DNA tensegrity triangle. The data demonstrate clearly that it is possible to design and self-assemble a well-ordered macromolecular 3D crystalline lattice with precise control.

### Universality in long-distance geometry and quantum complexity [^7fa0611b]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

More generally, we can imagine adjusting this criterion in various directions. For example, we could require that a and c are not independent of n but have a mild n dependence. In the Supplementary Information, we mention a boundthat was proved in the context of nilpotent Lie groups of the formwhere 0 < α < 1. This implies that the fractional error vanishes at large d at a rate no slower than d α −1. This is a stronger statement than equation (22) if c is left unspecified, but it is a slightly weaker statement than equation (22) if it requires c = 1.

In the context of discrete groups, an elementary result is that the coarse geometry defined by the Cayley graph is independent of the choice of generating set. That is, we can consider a group G that is generated by some set of easy elements g 1, …, g k. The distance from the identity to some group element g is the minimum length of the word formed from g 1, …, g k that expresses g. Although the metric depends on the choice of generating set (or more generally, the penalty factors associated with each group element), the claim is that different choices of generating sets give distance functions that satisfy equation (22). Furthermore, we can consider properties of the geometry that depend on only the equivalence class. A particularly interesting property is δ -hyperbolicity, which is a notion of negative curvature that applies even in this discrete context. We can identify negative curvature by observing that all triangles in negatively curved spaces are slim — that is, any point on one side of the triangle is close to some point on another side of the triangle, with the maximum separation set by the curvature scale. This property defines what is known as Gromov hyperbolic groupsand is the subject of ongoing mathematical work. A simple example is a free group, where the Cayley graph is an infinite tree. This notion of negative curvature may explain our conjecture that the critical metric has negative sectional curvatures. In particular, the notion of δ -hyperbolicity shows that the concept of large-scale curvature is not a contradiction. In the context of Lie groups, we expect that although many members of a given equivalence class exhibit extreme local curvatures, their large-scale curvatures (for example, that probed by large triangles) should approximately agree with the large-scale curvatures of the critical metric.

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^16d6fe49]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Hidden metric spaces underlying real weighted networks

At the beginning of this section, we showed that the normalized weights of links participating in triangles are higher, thus suggesting a coupling between the weighted organization of real weighted complex networks and an underlying metric space. We then presented a model that has the critical ability to fix the joint degree–strength distribution, while independently varying the level of coupling between the weights and the metric space (parameter α). This opens the way to a definite proof of the geometric nature of weights in real complex networks, which inevitably must involve the triangle inequality: the most fundamental property of any metric space.

For unweighted networks, a direct verification of the triangle inequality based on the topology without an embedding in a metric space is not possible, due to the probabilistic nature of the relationship between the binary structure and the distance between nodes. In contrast, weights do contain information about their distances in the metric space (via equation (2)) such that a direct verification of the triangle inequality is possible. To ensure that the metric properties of triples in the network are in correspondence to the metric properties of the corresponding triangles in the underlying space, only triples of nodes forming triangles in the network are taken into account to evaluate the triangle inequality. There are however two main challenges when one tries to apply this methodology. The first one is related to the fact that connections in the weightedmodel depend not only on angular distances but also on hidden degrees, such that we need a purely geometrical formulation of the weighted hidden metric space network model, in which angular distances and degrees are combined into a single distance measure. The second issue is related to the intrinsic noise present in the system due to the stochastic nature of the processes conforming it, which may blur the evaluation of the triangle inequality. Below, we propose a way to overcome these two issues.

Since triangles are a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying metric space, we expect nodes forming triangles to be close to one another. Thus, the higher average normalized weight observed on triangles strongly suggests a metric nature of weights, which is not a trivial consequence of the relation between weights and topology. This leads us to formulate the hypothesis that the same underlying metric space ruling the network topology — inducing the existence of strong clustering as a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying geometry — is also inducing the observed correlation between ω norm and m. To prove this, we develop a realistic model of geometric weighted random networks, which allows us to estimate the coupling between weights and geometry in real networks.

A geometric model of weighted networks

Many models have been proposed to generate weighted networks. Among them, growing network modelsand the maximum-entropy class of models. However, none of them is general enough to reproduce simultaneously the topology and weighted structure of real weighted complex networks. We introduce a new model based on a class of random networks with hidden variables embedded in a metric spacethat overcomes these limitations. In this model, N nodes are uniformly distributed with constant density δ in a D -dimensional homogeneous and isotropic metric space (Supplementary Methods), and are assigned a hidden variable κ according to the probability density function (pdf) ρ (κ). Two nodes with hidden variables κ and κ ′ separated by a metric distance d are connected with a probability

where μ > 0 is a free parameter fixing the average degree and p (χ) is an arbitrary positive function taking values within the interval (0, 1). The free parameter μ can be chosen such that(κ) = κ. Hence, κ corresponds to the expected degree of nodes, so the degree distribution can be specified through the pdf ρ (κ), regardless of the specific form of p (χ) (Supplementary Methods). The freedom in the choice of p (χ) allows us to tune the level of coupling between the topology of the networks and the metric space, which in turn allows us to control many properties such as the clustering coefficient and the navigability.

### Mechanics of drosophila wing deployment [^4496d956]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Note that in the nano-indentation experiments, the solutions of the three-element Maxwell-Jeffrey model reduce to the simpler Kelvin-Voigt model described above. A loading of the formis imposed and we look for solutions of the form ϵ ≈ (t / T) α. For α = 2/3, there are two groups of terms that evolve as ~ t −1/3 and ~ t −4/3. For short times, the dynamics are governed by terms in the power of −4/3. Balancing these terms, we find the expression, withwhere τ e f f = τ 1 τ 2 /(τ 1 + τ 2) which tends toward τ 1 for τ 1 ≪ τ 2. Numerical simulations of Eq. (3) for different values ofconfirm the above scaling.

Model

Wing geometry and force balance

We consider two infinite plates of thickness e, connected with pillars of diameter d, height h, organized in a hexagonal lattice of pitch a. We assume that both plates undergo spatially homogeneous equibiaxial extension in e x and e y, so that the principal stretches in the plates read λ x = λ y = λ. We assume that the material is incompressible, which implies that λ x λ y λ z = 1 and λ z = 1/ λ 2. For the pillars, we consider a uniaxial extension in the e z direction. Incompressibility and isotropy lead to the following equation, superscript p refers to the pillars, and we denote.

A force balance in the plates relates the Cauchy stress in the principal directions σ x x = σ y y = σ to the internal pressure P. As the plates become thinner by a factor of 1/ λ 2 and the pillar height increases by λ p, we obtain the equation 2 σ e / λ 2 = P h λ p and:with Ψ = h /(h + 2 e) the relative height of the pillars in the non-deformed geometry.

Similarly, for the pillars, the longitudinal Cauchy stresscompensates for the increase in internal pressure, so thatwhere A p is the area of the pillars in the plane and A is the total area of the plates in the plane. We introduce the density of the pillars in the plane, such that:

In order to solve these equations and obtain the values of (λ, λ p) as a function of P, it is necessary to define the material's constitutive law.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Sensory experience modulates the reorganization of auditory regions for executive processing [^f6eea63b]. Brain (2022). Medium credibility.

Experimental design

All tasks were designed so that each had one condition with higher executive demands (higher executive function, HEF) and one with lower demands (lower executive function; LEF) (Fig. 1).

Figure 1
Executive function tasks. Each task had a higher executive demands condition (HEF, purple) and a lower executive demands condition (LEF, peach). See the 'Materials and methods' section for details of the design.

For the switching task, participants had to respond to the shape of geometric objects, i.e. a rectangle and a triangle, (Fig. 1). At the beginning of the run, participants were instructed to press a key with their left hand when they saw a rectangle and with their right hand when they saw a triangle. Each block started with a cue indicating that the task was to either keep the rule they used in the previous block ('stay' trials; LEF) or to switch it ('switch' trials; HEF). In the switch trials, participants had to apply the opposite mapping between the shape and the response hand. Each block included the presentation of the instruction cue (200 ms), a fixation cross (500 ms) and two to five task trials. During each trial, a geometrical shape (either a blue rectangle or a blue triangle) was shown at the centre of the screen until the participant responded for a max of 1500 ms. Visual feedback (500 ms) followed the participant's response. There were 230 trials in 80 blocks of either the LEF (40) or HEF (40) condition. The analysis for the HEF condition only included the first trial of the switch block (see 'Statistical analysis of behavioural performance' section).

Stereological principles in quantitative image analysis — Stereology is the statistical science providing practical methods for extracting accurate and precise quantitative structural information from imaging data sets of irregular objects. Stereological methods make no assumptions regarding shape, size, orientation, or spatial distribution of objects and are unbiased by design instead of relying on geometric model assumptions that may introduce bias. Stereology is the method of choice for quantifying lung structure in microscopy with rigorously defined standards, principles, and practical applications, and the same principles apply to CT, micro-CT, PET, MRI, and other modalities ("in vivo morphometry"), with use documented in the brain, heart, and lung.

### Modelling the species-area relationship using extreme value theory [^10b0aaff]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The nested species-area relationship, obtained by counting species in increasingly larger areas in a nested fashion, exhibits robust and recurring qualitative and quantitative patterns. When plotted in double logarithmic scales it shows three phases: rapid species increase at small areas, slower growth at intermediate scales, and faster rise at large scales. Despite its significance, the theoretical foundations of this pattern remain incompletely understood. Here, we develop a theory for the species-area relationship using extreme value theory, and show that the species-area relationship is a mixture of the distributions of minimum distances to a starting sampling focal point for each individual species. A key insight of our study is that each phase is determined by the geographical distributions of the species, i.e., their ranges, relative to the focal point, enabling us to develop a formula for estimating the number of species at phase transitions. We test our approach by comparing empirical species-area relationships for different continents and taxa with our predictions using Global Biodiversity Information Facility data. Although a SAR reflects the underlying biological attributes of the constituent species, our interpretations and use of the extreme value theory are general and can be widely applicable to systems with similar spatial features.

Triangle: ground-state degeneracy

Theoretical determination of ground states

The presence of the short-range L-J interaction results in two isotopic unit-cell dimer structures with exactly the same potential energy, splitting from the original one for the dense packing scheme of the hard regular triangle, as illustrated in Fig. 2a. Either type of the isotopes can be spatially duplicated to form the crystalline morphology in Fig. 2b, in which each unit-cell is composed of two neighboring monomers colored differently according to their body-orientations, as shown in the upper part of Fig. 2c. The spatial arrangement of unit-cells is shown in the lower part of Fig. 2c, which is a rhombic crystal phase, (, is smaller thanbut larger than) different from the crystalline structure of the hard triangular systemdue to the existence of the L-J balls.

### Effective use of tables and figures in abstracts, presentations, and papers [^9d553efc]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In some situations, tables, graphs, and figures can present certain types of information (including complicated relationships and sequences of events) more clearly and in less space than the same information would require in sentence form. However, do not use tables, graphs, and figures for small amounts of data that could be conveyed clearly and succinctly in a sentence. Also, do not reiterate in sentences the data that are shown in a table, graph, or figure: the point of creating a table or graph or figure is to eliminate that type of sentence from your manuscript. In building a data table you must balance the necessity that the table be complete with the equally important necessity that it not be too complex. Sometimes it is helpful to break a large table into several smaller ones to allow the reader to identify important information easily, but, conversely, it is a common mistake of novice authors to split up into several tables data that belong in one table. In almost all cases, only one table or graph or figure should be included in an abstract, and then only if it can convey essential information in less space and in a more easily interpretable way than the sentence form. For a poster, in almost all instances you should use only one typeface and one font in a table, graph, or figure. In general, do not use bold, italics, or color unless you are presenting a great deal of data and you need to highlight certain data values and you are certain that using bold, italics, or color will improve readability, which is rare. Do not include identical information in a table and a graph/figure. In reporting a clinical trial you will need to include a patient flow chart that identifies the number of patients initially screened for the study, the number of patients who were excluded (and why) after initial screening or in the final analysis, and how many patients entered, exited early, and completed each arm of the study. A treatment protocol should also be described with a flow chart. In preparing a graph the most common error is to include a line that suggests an unsubstantiated extrapolation between or beyond the data points. In selecting the graph's axes, avoid truncating, enlarging, or compressing the axes in ways that might make the graph confusing or misleading. To prepare clear, accurate, easily interpretable tables, graphs, and figures, rely on the rules described in authoritative guides such as the Council of Science Editors' Scientific Style and Format and the American Medical Association's Manual of Style.

### 2D material programming for 3D shaping [^0d7f1bf4]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cone singularities

The Riemann theorem suggests that our method can form any curved shapes of thin sheets by conformally morphing 2D hydrogels. However, in practice, the accessible Ω r limits accessible 3D configurations. To mitigate this limitation, we introduced the concept of cone singularities (Fig. 3). The idea is to first map a 3D shape on a cone surface (K = 0) and then unfold the cone surface to the 2D plane (without further area distortion) by cutting the surface through cone points, rather than directly mapping a shape to the plane (as shown in Fig. 2). This approach can significantly reduce Ω r, as a 3D shape can be conformally mapped to a cone surface with lower area distortion than to the plane and the cone surface can be isometrically flattened to the plane.

### Using geometry for the dorsiflexory wedge osteotomy of the first metatarsal [^19afde4b]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Dorsiflexory wedge osteotomy is indicated for the correction of structural and irreducible first metatarsal deformity to effectively shorten and elevate a plantar flexed first ray. This is most commonly due to fixed forefoot valgus deformity, the cavovarus foot type, and diabetic foot pathologic features involving an ulceration or preulcerative area on the plantar aspect of the first metatarsal head. Surgeons can subjectively judge the amount of correction, such as by restoring the frontal plane alignment of the forefoot, or objectively by returning Meary's angle to a parallel relationship on a weightbearing lateral radiograph. With this tip, we propose an objective measurement, with calculation and use of Meary's angle, to preoperatively quantify the amount of desired correction. In the present study, we applied basic geometric principles based on triangles to calculate the relationship between the width of the excised wedge and the angular degrees of achieved dorsiflexion. We hope these data will provide both objective and reasonable estimates for reconstructive foot and ankle surgeons working with these deformities and with this procedure.

### Dissociation of self and mother-related processing in abstinent heroin misusers [^d681e74a]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and procedure

Participants completed the self-mother matching task, which consisted of two phases. This task adapted the paradigm of Sui et al. with two key changes: (1) comparison stimuli were altered from (self, friend, stranger) to (self, mother, stranger) to assess both self- and mother-prioritization effects; and (2) to account for potential cognitive deficits associated with repeated drug use, we extended the response window.

In the initial phase, participants were instructed to assign three geometric shapes (circle, rectangle, and triangle, each measuring 3.8° × 3.8°) to the categories of "self", "mother", or "stranger". For example, they were informed that "the circle represents you, the rectangle represents your mother, and the triangle represents a stranger". The associations between the shapes and labels (you, mother, and stranger, each measuring 2.4° × 1.6°) were counterbalanced across participants. No stimuli were presented during this phase.

### Sagittal cephalometric evaluation without point nasion: sagittal G-triangle analysis [^130cca70]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

After several years of research, our team invented a novel cephalometric analysis using an equilateral triangle as a reference. Constructed on the geometric relationship of the cranial landmarks, this triangle was named the G-triangle. The sagittal, vertical, dental, and soft-tissue cephalometric measurements based on the G-triangle form the G-triangle analysis. Because the G-triangle is independent of nasion, its sagittal evaluation could serve as an alternative evaluation for the previously established sagittal cephalometric parameters. In this paper, with a focus on the sagittal evaluation, we aim to introduce sagittal G-triangle analysis to determine its correlation between the most widely used sagittal cephalometric parameters (SNA and SNB) and to identify its normal ranges using statistic calculation. The results of our study suggested that the sagittal G-triangle analysis, which served as the guide line for the ideal position of the maxilla and mandible, offers an immense help in the treatment planning of maxillofacial surgery.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

### Population coding of shape in area V4 [^d21b730e]. Nature Neuroscience (2002). Medium credibility.

Shape is represented in the visual system by patterns of activity across populations of neurons. We studied the population code for shape in area V4 of macaque monkeys, which is part of the ventral (object-related) pathway in primate visual cortex. We have previously found that many macaque V4 neurons are tuned for the curvature and object-centered position of boundary fragments (such as 'concavity on the right'). Here we tested the hypothesis that populations of such cells represent complete shapes as aggregates of boundary fragments. To estimate the population representation of a given shape, we scaled each cell's tuning peak by its response to that shape, summed across cells and smoothed. The resulting population response surface contained 3–8 peaks that represented major boundary features and could be used to reconstruct (approximately) the original shape. This exemplifies how a multi-peaked neural population response can represent a complex stimulus in terms of its constituent elements.

The following parameters were derived from the 3D model and expressed in micron units:

The maximum and minimum diameters of the base area (BA) of the hole, that is, the area of the hole in the plane of the RPE, and the axes of the maxima in the XZ planes of the scan. The maximum diameter most closely represents the BD measured clinically.
The maximum and minimum diameters of the minimum area (MA) of the hole defined as the minimum area in the central 20%–90% of the hole height. The minima of the MA most closely represent the MLD as used clinically and in the international VMT classification. The meridian of the minimum axis in the XZ planes was also measured, as well as the height of the minimum area as measured perpendicularly above the RPE.
The total surface area (SA), defined as the total surface area of the extracted 3D macular hole shape including both base and top areas, and the volume of the extracted 3D macular hole shape measured in pixel areas and voxels, respectively.

Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination of our research. Preoperative visual acuities were recorded using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letter charts and converted to logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) visual acuity for analysis.

### Integration of grid maps in merged environments [^f43db9ca]. Nature Neuroscience (2018). Medium credibility.

Natural environments are represented by local maps of grid cells and place cells that are stitched together. The manner by which transitions between map fragments are generated is unknown. We recorded grid cells while rats were trained in two rectangular compartments, A and B (each 1m×2m), separated by a wall. Once distinct grid maps were established in each environment, we removed the partition and allowed the rat to explore the merged environment (2m×2m). The grid patterns were largely retained along the distal walls of the box. Nearer the former partition line, individual grid fields changed location, resulting almost immediately in local spatial periodicity and continuity between the two original maps. Grid cells belonging to the same grid module retained phase relationships during the transformation. Thus, when environments are merged, grid fields reorganize rapidly to establish spatial periodicity in the area where the environments meet.

### Cranial base growth and morphology in second-trimester normal human fetuses and fetuses with cleft lip [^a16dad53]. The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The present radiographic study describes the size and shape of the cranial base from the sagittal aspect for a sample of 77 second-trimester "normal" control fetuses (n = 61) and fetuses (n = 16) exhibiting isolated, unilateral clefts of the lip (CL), ranging in fertilization age from 10 to 22 weeks.

Methods

Fetuses were placed in a cephalostat, and standardized, lateral head radiographs were taken. The radiographs were traced, and 15 cephalometric landmarks were identified and digitized for analysis. Growth curves for cranial base lengths, angles, and areas were compared between control and CL groups. Also, cranial base triangles were constructed and shape comparisons were made using tensor biometric analysis.

Results

No significant differences (p > .05) in regression line slopes were noted for any comparisons between the control and CL samples. Tensor biometric analysis also revealed no significant differences in the shapes of various cranial base triangles between the control and CL samples.

Conclusion

This report presents second-trimester baseline growth curves for various cranial base components in CL human fetal specimens, and these data suggest that CL fetuses may also be used as an appropriate control sample for prenatal growth comparison studies of cleft lip and palate and cleft palate.

### Topological data analysis in medical imaging: current state of the art [^dbb4626f]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

For example, suppose we have three points in a two-dimensional point cloud, two of which are closer together than either is to the third point (Fig. 1). In this example, we can take three patients who present with malignancy, each having a different 3D tumor volume on CT imaging. For patients 1 and 2, their volumes are similar and form a simplicial complex with only a small distance threshold. If we expand our distance threshold, we can now include other values that are increasing dissimilar, connecting all three points to create a triangle. In practice, we'd have many more points and dimensions in our point cloud, but this illustrates the principle of filtration and simplicial complex hierarchies at a basic level.

Fig. 1
An example of three patients with varying 3D tumor volumes within a two-dimensional point cloud. The point from patient 1 and patient 2 for 3D tumor volume is close, therefore only requiring a small distance threshold to create a simplicial complex. As the distance threshold is expanded, the simplicial complex can include additional points with increasing variance

Once the series of simplicial complexes has been built, their structures can be analyzed. Homology, a topological tool, counts the number of holes in each dimension that exist within a space. In simplicial complexes, these are connected components, loops, voids, and higher-dimensional voids. To build the intuition around this, it is important to consider a part in a simplicial complex made of three, two-way relationships (edges in a graph) but lacking a mutual three-way relationship (to form a triangle of three points within a mutual distance of each other). This forms a loop, a part of the space with a potentially higher-dimensional interaction that does not exist in the simplicial complex but includes the lower-dimensional interactions. We can consider mutual three-way relationships that do not form a mutual four-way relationship, which would create a void. Betti numbers, which track the number of holes that exist in each dimension for a space or a simplicial complex, are a good way to summarize and quantify this information.

### Complex shapes self-assembled from single-stranded DNA tiles [^84f12b1b]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Programmed self-assembly of strands of nucleic acid has proved highly effective for creating a wide range of structures with desired shapes. A particularly successful implementation is DNA origami, in which a long scaffold strand is folded by hundreds of short auxiliary strands into a complex shape. Modular strategies are in principle simpler and more versatile and have been used to assemble DNA or RNA tiles into periodic and algorithmic two-dimensional lattices, extended ribbons and tubes, three-dimensional crystals, polyhedra and simple finite two-dimensional shapes. But creating finite yet complex shapes from a large number of uniquely addressable tiles remains challenging. Here we solve this problem with the simplest tile form, a 'single-stranded tile' (SST) that consists of a 42-base strand of DNA composed entirely of concatenated sticky ends and that binds to four local neighbours during self-assembly. Although ribbons and tubes with controlled circumferences have been created using the SST approach, we extend it to assemble complex two-dimensional shapes and tubes from hundreds (in some cases more than one thousand) distinct tiles. Our main design feature is a self-assembled rectangle that serves as a molecular canvas, with each of its constituent SST strands — folded into a 3 nm-by-7 nm tile and attached to four neighbouring tiles — acting as a pixel. A desired shape, drawn on the canvas, is then produced by one-pot annealing of all those strands that correspond to pixels covered by the target shape; the remaining strands are excluded. We implement the strategy with a master strand collection that corresponds to a 310-pixel canvas, and then use appropriate strand subsets to construct 107 distinct and complex two-dimensional shapes, thereby establishing SST assembly as a simple, modular and robust framework for constructing nanostructures with prescribed shapes from short synthetic DNA strands.

For the intrinsic generation time, we obtained a pooled mean estimate of 5.86 days (95% CI: 5.47–6.26 days) for the Alpha variant based on two studies and 5.67 days (95% CI: 3.79–7.55 days) for the Delta variant based on two studies (Fig. 6, Additional file 1: Fig. S7). Only one study (for Italy) reported an estimate for the Omicron variant: 6.84 days (95% CrI: 5.72–8.60 days). There was no significant difference between Alpha and Delta (p -value: 1).

### Large-area patterning of full-color quantum dot arrays beyond 1, 000 pixels per inch by selective electrophoretic deposition [^954ed311]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Afterward, we achieved green and blue QD micro-line arrays using our green- and blue-emitting QDs by the SEPD method, as shown in Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22, respectively. The fluorescent images of the green and blue QD patterns under 365 nm UV excitation are homogeneous and bright. Patterned electrodes with different shapes and sizes were designed to explore the potential of SEPD in patterning QDs. Figure 3a and Supplementary Fig. 23 demonstrate the large-area QD emitting pixel array with different shapes, sizes, and colors, which consists of tens of micron-sized pixels (triangle, rectangle, square, hexagon and circle patterns). High-resolution aligned green pixels, ranging from 252 PPI (43.9 × 90.2 μm pixel size) to 1,093 PPI (14.6 × 30.5 μm pixel size), were created by two-step depositing QDs both on positive and negative electrodes (Fig. 3b). Our results demonstrate the advantages of SEPD for arbitrarily patterned high-resolution, large-scale QD arrays, facilitating the creation of devices with the ultrahigh pixel densities required in emerging display applications (such as augmented reality and virtual reality).

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Pore configuration landscape of granular crystallization [^b2d1eb3b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

It is notable that a Delaunay tetrahedron generates a point in the PD 2 plot only when its circumcentre lies inside its four triangular faces. Such a tetrahedron is called 'well-centred'. The birth value is the largest circumradius of the four faces and the death value is the circumradius of the tetrahedron. Circumradii of the triangular faces, ρ i, and of the tetrahedron, R, are related by ρ i = R sin(γ i) where γ i is the angle between the outward-pointing normal to face i and a radial line drawn from the tetrahedron circumcentre to one of the vertices on face i. The angles γ i can take any value in (0, π) so ρ i ∈(0, R), with ρ i = R when γ i = π /2 (and so have birth = death in PD 2). For a tetrahedron to be well-centred, however, we must have γ i < π /2 for all four faces. But the largest angle in any given tetrahedron must be greater than that for a regular tetrahedron, so. This means the circumradii of the faces of a well-centred tetrahedron satisfy ρ i ∈(R sin(γ max), R sin(π /2)), that is, ρ i / R ∈(/3, 1). This is quite a narrow strip in the persistence diagram PD 2 (/3 = 0.9428), and implies that any point (b, d) in PD 2 with d > 3 b /must be due to a 'pore' built from two or more Delaunay tetrahedra (that is, five or more beads in the bead-pack data).

Our bead packs are weakly polydisperse, and the variation in bead radii is compensated for by using the weighted DT (also known as a regular triangulation) based on the power distance to a ball B (z, r): d B (x) = d (x, z) 2 − r 2. The definition of alpha shapes carries over naturally to this setting.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^79b1194c]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

### Polygonal non-wetting droplets on microtextured surfaces [^9354e9e4]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this work, by contrast to polygonal liquid morphogenesis passively generated by varying the shape of the micropillars and the arrangement of the arrays in the wetting case, an active way to precisely shape non-wetting water and liquid metal droplets into various polygonal patterns by varying the thickness of the droplets is developed. High micropillars are employed and the minimum thickness of the droplets is typically more than two times of the pillar size, which guarantees a stable Cassie-Baxter wetting state. By imposing confinement on the droplets, the movement of the solid-liquid-vapour three-phase contact line in preferential directions is observed, shaping the droplets into triangles, squares, rectangles, and hexagons. The number of sides of the final polygonal pattern is found mainly dependent of the arrangement of the microtextures, while the shape of the microtexture cross-section plays a secondary role. The formation of the polygonal droplets is interpreted from an energy point of view: the three-phase contact lines preferentially moved in certain directions to more easily overcome the energy barrier due to the arrangement of the microtextures. A quantitative relationship correlating the polygonal pattern to the contact angle, the thickness of the droplet, and the geometric topology of the microtextures are established.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

### A novel approach to surgical markings based on a topographic map and a projected three-dimensional image [^8d5199a6]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Surgical markings play a crucial role in the planning of plastic surgery procedures. However, despite their importance, they are often imprecise. For instance, when assessing patients in need of autologous fat grafting, surgeons often base markings on estimations of where volume deficiency exists and how much volume will correct the deficiency. In this article, the authors describe a novel approach to lipostructure, guided by a computer-based roadmap. A digital three-dimensional topographic surgical map is created using three-dimensional photography and analytic software and then projected as an image onto the patient in the operating room. This unique concept can be applied to most soft-tissue procedures in plastic surgery.

Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

### Efficacy evaluation of hyaluronic acid gel for the restoration of gingival interdental papilla defects [^e33ee87b]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This clinical study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of reconstruction of the gingival interdental papilla via injection of hyaluronic acid gel.

Materials and Methods

Eight female participants with Class I or II gingival papilla loss in anterior sites were included in this study. The gingival biotype was evaluated previously. Hyaluronic acid gel was injected into the base of the deficient papilla, which was repeated twice at 3 and 6 weeks after the initial injection. The height of the gingival papilla and the area of papilla loss were examined on clinical photographs before treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. The data were tested for a normal distribution and analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. P < .05 was considered significant.

Results

The height of the gingival papilla increased 0.311, 0.45, and 0.4 mm from baseline at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, after treatment (P < .05), whereas the area of the black triangle was reduced by 0.31, 0.41, and 0.36 mm 2 at the same time points (P < .05). In addition, patients with a thick gingival biotype showed a better effect of treatment on the increase in the height of the gingival papilla and decrease in the area of the black triangle.

Conclusions

Our study verified a remarkable effect of hyaluronic acid gel injection in restoring the deficient gingival papilla of the natural teeth, especially in patients with a thick gingival biotype.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

Left atrial (LA) linear and area measurements — the most widely used linear dimension is the anteroposterior (AP) measurement in the parasternal long-axis using M-mode or, preferably, two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), but the AP linear dimension should not be used as the sole measure of LA size; LA area can be planimetered in apical four- and two-chamber views, and optimal contours should be obtained while avoiding foreshortening.

Prostate ultrasound — specifications of the prostate ultrasound examination state that the prostate should be imaged in its entirety in at least 2 orthogonal planes, sagittal and axial or longitudinal and coronal, from the apex to the base of the gland, and an estimated volume is determined from measurements in 3 orthogonal planes (volume = length × height × width × 0.52). The volume of the prostate may be correlated with the prostate-specific antigen level. The gland should be evaluated for a focal mass, echogenicity, symmetry, and continuity of margins, and color and power Doppler sonography may be helpful in detecting areas of increased vascularity that can be used to select potential sites for biopsy. The periprostatic fat and neurovascular bundle should be evaluated for symmetry and echogenicity, and the course of the prostatic urethra should be documented, when possible, with asymmetry between left and right periurethral tissues as well as their impact on the base of the bladder noted. The seminal vesicles should be evaluated for size, shape, position, symmetry, and echogenicity from their insertion into the prostate via the ejaculatory ducts to their cranial and lateral extents.

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

Surface area–normalized standard Kt/V (SAstdKt/V) — rationale and definition note that the volume of urea distribution (V) in the Kt/V denominator is problematic, whereas body surface area (BSA) is a more commonly used denominator for physiologic functions; a secondary analysis of HEMO showing improved outcomes in women but not in men at the higher HD dose raised concerns about inappropriate use of V as the dose denominator in women and smaller patients, and efforts to eliminate this bias led to an expression of stdKt/V with BSA in the denominator that retained the current targeted values; SAstdKt/V is the surface area–normalized standard Kt/V with Vw defined by the Watson formula and BSA based on height and weight, and 20 is a normalizing factor (the population mean V/BSA, L/m2), which may be different from 20 when using equations other than those by Watson et al and DuBois and DuBois, for example in children.

### The nutritional geometry of liver disease including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^b2142b86]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Nutrition has a profound effect on chronic liver disease, especially non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Most observational studies and clinical trials have focussed on the effects of total energy intake, or the intake of individual macronutrients and certain micronutrients, such as vitamin D, on liver disease. Although these studies have shown the importance of nutrition on hepatic outcomes, there is not yet any unifying framework for understanding the relationship between diet and liver disease. The Geometric Framework for Nutrition (GFN) is an innovative model for designing nutritional experiments or interpreting nutritional data that can determine the effects of nutrients and their interactions on animal behaviour and phenotypes. Recently the GFN has provided insights into the relationship between dietary energy and macronutrients on obesity and ageing in mammals including humans. Mouse studies using the GFN have disentangled the effects of macronutrients on fatty liver and the gut microbiome. The GFN is likely to play a significant role in disentangling the effects of nutrients on liver disease, especially NAFLD, in humans.

### Wetting and complex remodeling of membranes by biomolecular condensates [^86e585fa]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The tension triangle in Fig. 2c also implies the relationships

between the surface tensions and the contact angles, as follows from the law of sines for the tension triangle in Fig. 2c. When we take the difference of the two equations in Eq. (10), the affinity contrast, in Eq. (9) becomes equal to

Thus, the rescaled affinity contrast, which is a mechanical quantity related to the adhesion free energies of the membrane segments, is equal to the factor, which is a purely geometric quantity that can be obtained from the three contact angles, as determined by analysing the optical images (Fig. 2a, e). The inequalities in Eq. (9) imply the inequalitiesfor the geometric factor, where the interpretation for the limiting values offollows from the limiting cases for the affinity contrast, in Eq. (9). The smallest possible value ofcorresponds to complete wetting of the membrane by the condensate phase, while the largest possible value ofcorresponds to dewetting of the membrane by this phase. The dimensionless factor, is negative if the membrane prefers the condensate over the exterior buffer and positive otherwise. It then follows from the data in Fig. 2d that the membrane prefers the condensate for molar salt concentrations93 mM and the exterior buffer for. For, the geometric factor, vanishes, corresponding to equal contact angles, and no affinity contrast between the condensate and the exterior buffer. Therefore, by measuring the geometric factor, as a function of the salinity or another control parameter, we obtain the affinity contrast, in units of the interfacial tension, as a function of this control parameter.

Note that the geometric factor is scale-invariant and does not depend on the sizes of a given vesicle-condensate couple, as exemplified in Supplementary Fig. 12.

### Reading angles in maps [^03895f86]. Child Development (2013). Low credibility.

Preschool children can navigate by simple geometric maps of the environment, but the nature of the geometric relations they use in map reading remains unclear. Here, children were tested specifically on their sensitivity to angle. Forty-eight children (age 47:15–53:30 months) were presented with fragments of geometric maps, in which angle sections appeared without any relevant length or distance information. Children were able to read these map fragments and compare two-dimensional to three-dimensional angles. However, this ability appeared both variable and fragile among the youngest children of the sample. These findings suggest that 4-year-old children begin to form an abstract concept of angle that applies both to two-dimensional and three-dimensional displays and that serves to interpret novel spatial symbols.

### Underlying principles of visual shape selectivity in posterior inferotemporal cortex [^2b1f8750]. Nature Neuroscience (2004). Medium credibility.

Object perception depends on shape processing in the ventral visual pathway, which in monkeys culminates in inferotemporal cortex (IT). Here we provide a description of fundamental quantitative principles governing neural selectivity for complex shape in IT. By measuring responses to large, parametric sets of two-dimensional (2D) silhouette shapes, we found that neurons in posterior IT (Brodmann's areas TEO and posterior TE) integrate information about multiple contour elements (straight and curved edge fragments of the type represented in lower-level areas) using both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. This results in complex, distributed response patterns that cannot be characterized solely in terms of example stimuli. We explained these response patterns with tuning functions in multidimensional shape space and accurately predicted neural responses to the widely varying shapes in our stimulus set. Integration of contour element information in earlier stages of IT represents an important step in the transformation from low-level shape signals to complex object representation.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^ee7134ad]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

Trap arrays and control potentials

Our surface ion trap chip is fabricated in similar manner to that described in ref.and consists of two equilateral triangular trap arrays with side length of ≃40 and ≃80 μm, respectively (Fig. 1a, b), both with a distance of ≃40 μm between the ions and the nearest electrode surface. The shapes of radio-frequency (RF) electrodes of the arrays are optimized by a linear-programming algorithm that yields electrode shapes with low fragmentation, and requires only a single RF-voltage source for operation. To design different and even non-periodic arrays for dedicated trap distances, we can apply the same algorithm to yield globally optimal electrode shapes. Resulting electrode shapes may look significantly different, but will have comparable complexity, spatial extent and the same number of control electrodes per trap site. Therefore, we expect that different arrays will not require different fabrication techniques (Methods). The two arrays are spaced by ≃5 mm on the chip, and only one of them is operated at a given time. Although we achieve similar results in both arrays, the following discussion is focussed on the 80 μm array.

Three-dimensional confinement of 25 Mg + ions is provided by a potential φ RF oscillating at Ω RF from a single RF electrode driven at Ω RF /(2 π) = 48.3 MHz with an approximate peak voltage U RF = 20 V. Setting the origin of the coordinate system at the centre of the array and in the surface plane of the chip, the RF potential features three distinct trap sites at T0 ≃(−46,0,37) μm,… Owing to the electrode symmetry under rotations of ± 2 π /3 around the z -axis, it is often sufficient to consider T0 only, as all our findings apply to T1 and T2 after an appropriate rotation. Further, the RF potential exhibits another trap site at ≃(0,0,81) μm (above the centre of the array); this 'ancillary' trap is used for loading as well as for re-capturing ions that escaped from the other trap sites. We approximate the RF confinement at position r by a pseudopotential, cp. ref. where Q denotes the charge and m the mass of the ion, and E RF (r) is the field amplitude produced by the electrode.

### Combinatorial discovery of microtopographical landscapes that resist biofilm formation through quorum sensing mediated autolubrication [^23283785]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

To discover design rules for topographical control of bacterial responses to surfaces (beyond simple geometries or isolated bioinspired topographical designs), we conducted an unbiased screen of combinatorially generated shapes using a high-throughput microtopographical polymer chip, the TopoChip. This mathematically designed, random combination of basic primitive shapes comprising triangles, circles and rectangles to produce a library of > 2000 microtopographies was previously used to identify surface topographies that induced proliferation or osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells. Here, we describe the generation of predictive statistical and machine learning models for bacterial pathogen attachment using topographical descriptors that encode geometric elements. We used these models to identify relationships between topographical patterns and their pro- and anti-attachment properties. Random Forest and Multiple Linear Regression with Expectation Maximisation results are reported after finding that the models generated using these were marginally superior to SVM and XGBoost models. The consistency found in results from the different modelling approaches enabled us to identify key feature shape parameters with the highest relevance for bacterial attachment. Notably, we found hit topographies that significantly reduced attachment and subsequent biofilm formation in vitro by pathogens including P. aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, A. baumannii, and S. aureus. For the small number of polymers considered, we found that the topographic control of the biofilm formation was not significantly influenced by chemistry. However, prior work with a larger library of polymers has also shown a useful relationship between surface chemistry and attachment.

### Machine learning meets complex networks via coalescent embedding in the hyperbolic space [^4aa17e63]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Physicists recently observed that realistic complex networks emerge as discrete samples from a continuous hyperbolic geometry enclosed in a circle: the radius represents the node centrality and the angular displacement between two nodes resembles their topological proximity. The hyperbolic circle aims to become a universal space of representation and analysis of many real networks. Yet, inferring the angular coordinates to map a real network back to its latent geometry remains a challenging inverse problem. Here, we show that intelligent machines for unsupervised recognition and visualization of similarities in big data can also infer the network angular coordinates of the hyperbolic model according to a geometrical organization that we term "angular coalescence". Based on this phenomenon, we propose a class of algorithms that offers fast and accurate "coalescent embedding" in the hyperbolic circle even for large networks. This computational solution to an inverse problem in physics of complex systems favors the application of network latent geometry techniques in disciplines dealing with big network data analysis including biology, medicine, and social science.

### Brain-optimized deep neural network models of human visual areas learn non-hierarchical representations [^27c79d7b]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Training and validation of task-optimized and brain-optimized networks.

a An encoding model based on a task-optimized deep neural network (AlexNet; white trapezoid). Multiple convolutional layers (η i) convert the input stimulus on trial t, X t, into feature maps. A read-out head (blue rectangle) transforms network activations into predicted brain activity (r t v, where v indexes a single voxel). The read-out head consists of Gaussian spatial pooling fields (example at lower left) with position and size selected from a fixed grid of candidates (lower right). The pooling field and each feature map are multiplied pixel-wise and then summed, reducing each feature map to a single feature value. The array of feature values across all maps (left vertical rectangle) are weighted by an array of feature weights (w v) and then summed (with a bias term b v) to yield predicted brain activity. Compressive point nonlinearities (f (⋅)) are applied at several processing stages. b A similar architecture is used for the encoding model based on the brain-optimized network (GNet; orange trapezoid depicts a single-branch architecture). The "flexible" spatial pooling fields used in the read-out head may be non-Gaussian (example at lower left). c Training for the AlexNet-based encoding model. For each voxel, only read-out head parameters (g v, w v, b v) are optimized (gears) for visual areas V1–V4 (colored rectangles) in each subjects' brain (S1, …, S8). The "voxelwise loss" (squared difference between predictions and measured activity data) is evaluated independently for each voxel. d Training for the GNet-based encoding model. Both the read-out head and GNet parameters are optimized jointly ("joint loss") for all voxels, subjects and brain areas. e Prediction accuracy is evaluated for each voxel by correlating predicted brain activity with measured brain activity (ρ AlexNet, ρ GNet) across a set of held-out validation trials with natural scenes. We plot the average accuracy (y -axis of central plot) vs. the difference in accuracy (x -axis) for each voxel (dots; color indicates visual area). For this example subject (S1) the GNet-based encoding model predicts responses to natural scenes most accurately for 81.3% of voxels in V1–V4. f In this example, the GNet-based encoding models predicts responses to artificial stimuli more accurately for 88% of voxels in V1–V4.

Let us now discuss the efficiency of the upconversion photoluminescence process by means of the changes in the exciton emission intensity for different energy gains and gradual intensity descent rates. At 7 K, we estimate a change in the X line intensity of 0.632 decade (see Fig. 5c (40 meV – 32 meV) × 0.079 dec/meV). Then, at 70 K, we have a change in the X intensity of 1.2 decade (see Fig. 6c (60 meV – 37.5 meV) × 0.054), whereas at room temperature in ambient, we obtain a change in the X line intensity of 2.56 decade (see Fig. 2b (150 meV – 50 meV) × 0.0256). This simple analysis shows that at T = 295 K the upconversion photoluminescence intensity can be tuned by about two orders of magnitude over the mean energy gain of 100 meV.

### Multiple tipping points and optimal repairing in interacting networks [^bf70cdce]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Geometry of the Manhattan distance minimization problem

The optimal strategies shown in different colours in Fig. 5 are derived from the geometrical reasoning shown in Fig. 9. Figure 9a shows a plot of a series of curves consisting of points at identical Manhattan distances from point S 1 (equidistant curves). They produce a 'diamond' shape, and the minimal Manhattan distance between point S 1 and the green region translates into the task of 'fitting' the diamond so that it just touches the green region and its centre is at S 1. The diamond in Fig. 9a touches the green region at two points — triple points, which are the solution to the minimization problem. Figure 9b shows the solution for point S 6 in the light blue region. Here the solution suggests a different strategy — decreasing only.

### Complex wireframe DNA nanostructures from simple building blocks [^a9063491]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Results

Structural design

To design a typical wireframe structure entirely from synthetic strands, a 2D or 3D graph is first generated (Fig. 1a). Such a graph, composed of nodes and edges with a specific node-edge geometry, is rendered so that the nodes represent vertices of different numbers of arms and the edges represent simple DNA duplexes of variable lengths (Fig. 1b). The number of edges connected to a certain node is arbitrary, as are the numbers of base pairs of constituent edges. Arbitrary shapes can be designed by defining a full set of node-node connectivity and the corresponding edges of variable lengths. For purposes of practicality, the number of edges connecting to a certain vertex is set to be no more than seven and the edge lengths are set to be full turns (rounded multiples of 10.5 base pairs) in this study. Afterwards, edges are segmented into complementary domains to ensure that the corresponding strands with multiple domains satisfy synthesis (e.g. a typical strand is less than 100 nt and preferably less than 80 nt) and self-assembly (e.g. a paired complementary domain is no less than 6 bp and preferably no less than 10 bp) requirements (Fig. 1c). Although the segmentation could also be arbitrary, a typical edge in this study is segmented in a standardized fashion into two root domains of the same length and a stem domain (Fig. 2a, inset and Supplementary Fig. 1). To relax tension around the crossovers at a certain vertex (e.g. a vertex of 5 or 6 arms), extra unpaired base(s) (e.g. 1T, 2T, or 3T) can be added as spacers across arms (Supplementary Table 1). After a specific strand arrangement is laid out, the final step is to populate strands with sequences to meet certain sequence generation criteria(e.g. base-pairing and mismatch prevention). As colors indicate, a distinct DNA sequence was appointed to each component strand (Fig. 1d).

### Shaping micro-clusters via inverse jamming and topographic close-packing of microbombs [^7662020f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Programming the degrees of freedom in topographic clusters

Empirically, the final clusters can be programmed by the number of seeds (N = 1, 2, 3,…) and the number of vertices of the well (V = 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6 for circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and hexagons, respectively) providing topographic confinement. As shown in Fig. 5a, we analyzed over 2000 clusters. In the confinement of N = 1, single-cell particles could be created by filling the microwell, imitating the shape of the confinement. For N > 1, the differentiated cleavages were symmetric when k = V / N yielded an integer k, i.e. (V, N) = (0, 2), (0, 3), (3, 3), (4, 2), (6, 2), and (6, 3). Otherwise, clusters with random microbomb assembly were observed. Regarding the orientation of the constituent cells, the (6, 2) combination, for example, could program two types of symmetric clusters: one with a cleavage wall normal to one of the 6 edges where the interior angle of a unit is 3 π (marked as a black line), and the other containing two isosceles trapezoids (internal angle is 2 π) shares the space diagonally (marked as a blue line). In addition, it is important to note that since there are no predictable cues for the cleavage orientation in the case of the singularity (V = 0), the perfect programming of clusters (100%) for all cases of N is warranted from the non-pinning mobility in confinement. The SEM images in Fig. 5b, c reveal the hollow nature of the clusters from a triangular prism (Fig. 5b) and a cube with a cleavage connecting four cells (Fig. 5c) after focused ion beam (FIB) milling. At room temperature, the shell became glassy again, and thus the microbombs could maintain the packed shape permanently.

### Stiffness-switchable DNA-based constitutional dynamic network hydrogels for self-healing and matrix-guided controlled chemical processes [^3f71142b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Trigger-induced shape transitions of the CDN hydrogels

The triggered control over the stiffness properties of the CDN hydrogels is, also, imaged visually. Figure 3a shows that the treatment of a triangle-shaped hydrogel X with E 1 results in a smaller triangle (hydrogel Y), consistent with the enhanced crosslinking. The further treatment of the resulting hydrogel Y with the counter trigger E 1 ' restores the larger triangle-shaped structure demonstrating the recovery of hydrogel X. The shape transitions of hydrogels (X → Y → X) reach constant dimensions after being subjected to E 1 or E 1 ' for 2 h, respectively. Figure 3b shows the effect of trigger E 2 on the triangle-shaped hydrogel X. A shapeless quasi-liquid hydrogel is obtained, consistent with the formation of the low-stiffness hydrogel Z. The shapeless quasi-liquid hydrogel Z does not recover to the triangle shape upon the application of the counter trigger E 2 '. Nonetheless, the resulting hydrogel is in a shrunken state consistent with the formation of a stiffer hydrogel X, Supplementary Fig. 17. In addition, subjecting the high-stiffness triangle-shaped hydrogel Y to the effectors E 1 ' and E 2 leads to its transition to the shapeless, quasi-liquid state Z, Supplementary Fig. 18. It should be noted that the shape transitions originate from swelling (hydration) effect dictated by the crosslinking of the respective hydrogel.

### Multilayer block copolymer meshes by orthogonal self-assembly [^960cfe94]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Continued scaling-down of lithographic-pattern feature sizes has brought templated self-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) into the forefront of nanofabrication research. Technologies now exist that facilitate significant control over otherwise unorganized assembly of BCP microdomains to form both long-range and locally complex monolayer patterns. In contrast, the extension of this control into multilayers or 3D structures of BCP microdomains remains limited, despite the possible technological applications in next-generation devices. Here, we develop and analyse an orthogonal self-assembly method in which multiple layers of distinct-molecular-weight BCPs naturally produce nanomesh structures of cylindrical microdomains without requiring layer-by-layer alignment or high-resolution lithographic templating. The mechanisms for orthogonal self-assembly are investigated with both experiment and simulation, and we determine that the control over height and chemical preference of templates are critical process parameters. The method is employed to produce nanomeshes with the shapes of circles and Y-intersections, and is extended to produce three layers of orthogonally oriented cylinders.

### Accuracy of left ventricular cavity volume and ejection fraction for conventional estimation methods and 3D surface fitting [^52d31e23]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Bloomgarden's multiple long‐axis method

When multiple radially oriented long‐axis views are prescribed, the method of Bloomgarden et al 6 can be used. The volume contribution for each adjacent contour point pair, [p i, p i+1], resembles a pie‐slice and is computed from the average distance from each contour point to the prescription central axis, R p = (R i + R i+1)/2, and the angular separation between the N s imaging planes, 2π/ N s, via:where π R p 2 is the area of the associated disk, Δ x p is the separation between the contour points along the direction of the central axis, N s is the number of long‐axis slices, and N P is the number of contour points. This approach was later adopted by Bloomer et al 25 to estimate LV mass. This equation, however, relies on the central axis passing exactly through the true apex, which is rarely the case. Figure 3 shows an exaggerated depiction of the effect of this discrepancy. The approach was therefore augmented in this article to account for the volume of myocardial tissue contributed by contour points located between the apex line and the central axis.

Figure 3
Augmented Bloomgarden method. The volume contribution for contour point pairs above the true apex line (light gray region) contains both left ventricular cavity and myocardial tissue. Contour point pairs that lie between the true apex line and the prescription central axis contribute only myocardial tissue (dark gray region). Thecavity volume in the augmented Bloomgarden method is computed by adjusting Equation (10) to subtract the myocardial tissue volume.

### Programmable interactions and emergent geometry in an array of atom clouds [^7ba0b504]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Interactions govern the flow of information and the formation of correlations between constituents of many-body quantum systems, dictating phases of matter found in nature and forms of entanglement generated in the laboratory. Typical interactions decay with distance and thus produce a network of connectivity governed by geometry-such as the crystalline structure of a material or the trapping sites of atoms in a quantum simulator 1,2. However, many envisioned applications in quantum simulation and computation require more complex coupling graphs including non-local interactions, which feature in models of information scrambling in black holes 3–6 and mappings of hard optimization problems onto frustrated classical magnets 7–11. Here we describe the realization of programmable non-local interactions in an array of atomic ensembles within an optical cavity, in which photons carry information between atomic spins 12–19. By programming the distance dependence of the interactions, we access effective geometries for which the dimensionality, topology and metric are entirely distinct from the physical geometry of the array. As examples, we engineer an antiferromagnetic triangular ladder, a Möbius strip with sign-changing interactions and a treelike geometry inspired by concepts of quantum gravity 5,20–22. The tree graph constitutes a toy model of holographic duality 21,22, in which the quantum system lies on the boundary of a higher-dimensional geometry that emerges from measured correlations 23. Our work provides broader prospects for simulating frustrated magnets and topological phases 24, investigating quantum optimization paradigms 10,11,25,26 and engineering entangled resource states for sensing and computation 27,28.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Humorous peer play and social understanding in childhood [^864316d9]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

However, as already noted, humour is inherently social and therefore interactional in nature. Research suggests that peer relationships become an increasingly important context for sharing humour, not only for pure enjoyment, to foster intimacy, maintain harmony, and diffuse potential conflicts. Friendly, positive peer relationships are built upon children being 'in tune' with one another, and this is exemplified by recent research that highlights that children's behaviours are often heavily dependent on the behaviours of their peers in play. For example, recent findings have indicated that children's tendency to engage in pretenceand in connected communicationwith a peer is dependent on their play partner's behaviour. Although the overarching focus of this paper is to examine associations between social understanding and humour production, child-level associations could be overestimated without accounting for dyad-level effects. Given that studies of focal children's play with siblings and peers have demonstrated that children engage in similar levels of humour as their play partner, we considered individual child characteristics in the context of partner effects in peer play.

The present study investigated whether humour production is associated with measures of social understanding in a sample of children on the cusp of middle childhood. Our battery of assessments included: understanding of beliefs and desires of characters in non-verbal films (Silent Films), spontaneous attribution of mental states of animated geometric shapes (Triangles Theory of Mind task,), and children's ability to infer the antecedent cause of others' behaviour from their natural facial expressions (Retrodictive Mindreading). Children's spontaneous humour production was coded within the context of peer play and assessed alongside parent reports. We predicted that children's performance in measures of social understanding would be associated with a greater tendency to produce humour. Given that associations between children's humour in play and social understanding could be explained by child-level characteristics, such as age, gender, language ability, and executive functioning skills, such as working memory and inhibitory control, we investigated these factors as potential covariates in our analyses. Finally, we used multilevel modelling to account for the dyadic context of peer play; we tested the influence of children's play partners in addition to child-level factors on humour production.

### Arrays of individually controlled ions suitable for two-dimensional quantum simulations [^178267d1]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

A precisely controlled quantum system may reveal a fundamental understanding of another, less accessible system of interest. A universal quantum computer is currently out of reach, but an analogue quantum simulator that makes relevant observables, interactions and states of a quantum model accessible could permit insight into complex dynamics. Several platforms have been suggested and proof-of-principle experiments have been conducted. Here, we operate two-dimensional arrays of three trapped ions in individually controlled harmonic wells forming equilateral triangles with side lengths 40 and 80μm. In our approach, which is scalable to arbitrary two-dimensional lattices, we demonstrate individual control of the electronic and motional degrees of freedom, preparation of a fiducial initial state with ion motion close to the ground state, as well as a tuning of couplings between ions within experimental sequences. Our work paves the way towards a quantum simulator of two-dimensional systems designed at will.

### Changes in semantic memory structure support successful problem-solving and analogical transfer [^5231072f]. Communications Psychology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In our daily life, we constantly deal with problems, ranging from the most mundane (e.g. what to cook for dinner given the ingredients at our disposal), to professional activities (e.g. how to reorganize our current plans to meet a new deadline), up to major societal challenges (e.g. how to find innovative solutions against global warming). How do we find new solutions to problems? While the ability to solve problems is a critical skill for adapting to new situations and innovating, the mechanisms underlying the problem-solving process remain largely unknown.

Among the new problems we face each day, some are well-defined (e.g. playing a jigsaw puzzle). The initial state (i.e. the number of independent pieces) and goal state (i.e. assembling the pieces so it looks like the picture model) are clear, and the solver can apply a set of operations (i.e. interlocking the pieces as a function of their shape) to reach the goal. However, for many of our problems (e.g. organizing work activities during the COVID-19 pandemic), the problem space is ambiguous. No heuristics or existing rules could be applied to transform the initial state into the goal state. Such "ill-defined" problemsthus require additional mental processes, which have been tightly linked to creative thinking –. Ill-defined problem-solving (or creative problem-solving) is often referred to as insight solving, where the solution comes to mind suddenly and effortlessly, with a "Eureka" phenomenon –. According to the Representational Change Theory, solving such problems involves restructuring the initial problem mental representational space, which presumably entails combining elements related to the problem in a new way. In theory, restructuring allows one to change perspective, reframe the problem, or escape its implicitly imposed constraints, leading to creative associations. For instance, consider the following problem: "A man walks into a bar and asks for a glass of water. The bartender points a shotgun at the man. The man says, 'Thank you', and walks out". The problem is ill-defined because the path to finding the solution is to be discovered, and the goal state is vague. Solving this problem first requires asking the right question: in which context would a shotgun and a glass of water help somebody? Rather than relying on obvious associations (e.g. a glass of water is related to thirst), solvers must fill the missing link between the relevant elements of the problem (a shotgun induces fear, and fear can be a remedy for hiccups, as can drinking a glass of water). Hence, restructuring the initial representation of a given problem would allow one to see this link and find its solution.

### Guidelines for performing a comprehensive transthoracic echocardiographic examination in adults: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^24e92f6b]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Transthoracic echocardiography sector size and depth — Depth is measured in units of length and should be set to maximize the size of the display for the structures or flow of interest, and because the heart is a moving structure, higher frame rates are desirable to increase temporal resolution; unnecessarily large sector depths can reduce image quality, and a narrower sector angle may be appropriate in some circumstances to enhance image quality.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### High-sensitive spatially resolved T cell receptor sequencing with SPTCR-seq [^ffcab2a5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Hierarchical cell type composition model (HCCM)

The createCellGraph function is designed to construct a cell graph based on spatial coordinates and a set of features using Delaunay triangulation. Delaunay triangulation is a method that creates a set of non-overlapping triangles, from a set of pointsin the plane. This method ensures that for each triangle t j ∈ T, there exists a circumcircle passing through its vertices, and no other point from the set P lies inside that circle. The Delaunay triangulation maximizes the minimum angle of all triangles in the set, resulting in a well-distributed configuration. By applying the Delaunay triangulation method to the spatial coordinates (x, y) of the cells, the createCellGraph function generates a set of edges that represent the spatial relationships between cells. The resulting graph provides a structured representation of the relationships between cells, considering both their spatial proximity and the selected features. To create the cell graph, the function first extracts the spatial coordinates of the cells corresponding to the given features. Then, it computes the Delaunay triangulation on these coordinates, generating a set of edges connecting the nodes (cells) based on their spatial proximity. The function associates each edge with a pair of barcodes to establish a correspondence between the cells. Finally, it merges the edge information with the spatial coordinates, resulting in a data frame containing the source and destination nodes of each edge based on the Delaunay triangulation. The output of the createCellGraph function is a data frame representing the cell graph with edges derived from the Delaunay triangulation of the spatial coordinates. This graph allows for the exploration and analysis of the relationships between cells in a spatial context, considering the selected features. We transformed the graph into an igraphobject and computed the relationships between data points in a hierarchical manner, where data points are organized into nested levels. These types of graphs are useful for visualizing relationships and understanding the structure of data sets that have inherent hierarchies such as cellular interactions and compositions. We decided to visualize hierarchical graphs through circle packing.

### Tuning curves for approximate numerosity in the human intraparietal sulcus [^a1111e81]. Neuron (2004). Low credibility.

Number, like color or movement, is a basic property of the environment. Recently, single neurons tuned to number have been observed in animals. We used both psychophysics and neuroimaging to examine whether a similar neural coding scheme is present in humans. When participants viewed sets of items with a variable number, the bilateral intraparietal sulci responded selectively to number change. Functionally, the shape of this response indicates that humans, like other animal species, encode approximate number on a compressed internal scale. Anatomically, the intraparietal site coding for number in humans is compatible with that observed in macaque monkeys. Our results therefore suggest an evolutionary basis for human elementary arithmetic.

Metasurface geometries in a, b the virtual space (u-v frame) and in c, d the real space (x – y frame). The relation between these two spaces is governed by the transformation in Eq. (1), and its contour plot containing the isolines of real and imaginary parts of z is shown by the light-gray solid lines in a, b. The filled orange circles and triangle markers in a, b, and e denote theandsingularities of the mapping, respectively. The solid orange lines in a and b denote the branch cut of the mapping, terminating at theandsingularities. All the magenta and black solid lines in a, b correspond to the boundary of the metasurface with the same colors shown in c, d, showing the multiplicity of the mapping. To further demonstrate such multiplicity, four points along the black line of the slab in a, b with coordinates (u, v) = (1, − π), (1, − π /2), (1, 0), and (1, π /2) are highlighted by the open stars, circles, triangles, and squares, and their equivalent points are shown by the same markers in c, d and in the eccentric cylinder of the virtual space in b. The values of a 0 are 0 in a and c, and 0.1 in b and d. Other geometric parameters are Λ = 30 π nm, w 0 = 1.5, u 0 = 1, and d = 0.5. e The left panel illustrates the geometries of the plasmonic metasurfaces in the virtual space for a complex a 0 = δ exp(i θ). The two solid lines show the trajectories of the ln(0) singularities as θ varies from − π to π, for two values of δ = 0.1 (green) and δ = 0.03 (purple). Along the solid green line, we depict the eccentric cylinders with different values of θ, and their corresponding metasurfaces in the real space are shown in the right panel. The orange dashed lines highlight the metasurfaces when δ = 0.

### Indexing glomerular filtration rate to suit children [^21155ba8]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

In order to be able to compare individuals of differing size, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is conventionally indexed to body surface area (BSA). This does not, however, suit children because they naturally have a relatively high BSA simply because of their small size. The aim of the study was to identify an appropriate simple whole-body variable based on height and weight suitable for indexing GFR that would be simultaneously appropriate for both children and adults.

Methods

A database of 532 routine clinical GFR measurements, each based on 3 venous blood samples obtained between 2 and 4 h after injection of (51)Cr-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, was analyzed to give GFR and, using only the half-time of the slope of the clearance curve, the quotient GFR to extracellular fluid volume (ECV). BSA was obtained from the Haycock formula, which is based on height and weight raised to indices to give units of area. Both GFR and GFR/ECV were corrected for the 1-compartment assumption using previously published empiric correction formulas. ECV was obtained by dividing GFR by GFR/ECV. An equation analogous to Haycock's was derived in which the indices of height and weight were varied to give an iterative best fit to ECV instead of BSA.

Results

GFR, ECV, and BSA increase as functions of age until about age 13 y, corresponding to a BSA of about 1.35 m(2), which was taken as the cutoff point between children and adults. As humans grow, their ratio of height to effective radius changes as a nonlinear function of surface area. Humans must therefore change shape as they grow. Moreover, the ECV-to-weight ratio decreases as a function of body size, suggesting that humans also change body composition as they grow. The new equation, giving an iterative best fit to ECV, was ECV = weight(0.6469) x height(0.7236) x 0.02154. ECV, either measured or estimated from the new equation, corresponding to a BSA of 1.73 m(2), was 12.9 L. Expressed as values normalized to the corresponding average adult values, the new equation and the second-order polynomial fit to ECV were superimposed as they increased as functions of BSA or weight. In contrast, normalized BSA and normalized weight were respectively larger and smaller than normalized ECV in children. GFR indexed to the new equation correlated more closely with GFR indexed to ECV than did GFR indexed to BSA and, along with GFR/ECV, showed a greater fall as a function of age than did GFR/BSA.

Conclusion

When required in absolute units rather than as a rate of turnover of ECV, GFR is appropriately indexed to indices of height and weight as defined by this new equation, which avoids disadvantages to children from indexing to BSA. This unmasks higher values of filtration function in children than have hitherto been recognized.

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^070d751c]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Force and torque constraints can be added using the known main B 0 field distribution, integrating over the current distribution for each basis function and entering the results into matrix H or C. One row is added for each direction of force or torque, to obtain an overall magnitude constraint. Eddy currents are computed in a similar manner; the step response for time‐dependent eddy currents on the surface of a conducting cylinder — typically the thermal shield in the magnet — is computed at multiple points in space and time. Each point in space and time is entered as a separate inequality constraint equation. It is usually sufficient to constrain eddy currents at time = 0 following a step change in gradient current, reducing the size of the problem.

Finally, and of primary significance to the present work, E‐field constraints can be handled in a similar manner to those for force and torque. At gradient frequencies of interest, the time evolution of E‐fields in human tissues is short, and therefore proportional to instantaneous slew rate and not the detailed waveform shape in time. Thus, given a body model, the E‐field is computed from each gradient coil basis function for unit slew rate at a series of points over the body surface, such as using the methods we have described recently. 17 Calculation at points on the interior of the model is not required, as the maximum magnitude always occurs on the surface of a uniform body model (see Supporting Information). A magnitude constraint is created on the surface by placing a series of rotated inequality constraints on the vector E‐field tangent to the surface. For example, we choose 32 directions at each point spaced over 360º, which constrains the magnitude to within 0.5% of the desired value.

### Programmable design of isothermal nucleic acid diagnostic assays through abstraction-based models [^ee62ac0a]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

The concept of the reaction graph

Our reaction graph concept entails simple representations of functional hairpin-based nucleic acid isothermal amplification mechanisms, enabling scientists to quickly establish the main reactions and the amplicons, with the ability to design strategies addressing situations that are currently challenging when using existing methods. In order to achieve this goal and demonstrate the amplification methods for developing basic DNA nodes and circuits, the process was simplified into five components (Fig. 1a): the functional hairpin motif self-folding assembly process (solid arrows); the primer extension process (dashed arrows); the formation of functional hairpin motifs generated through amplification (blue box); numeral marked primers and functional hairpin motif self-folding products (green triangle for forward strands and green square for reverse strands).

Programming a nucleic acid isothermal amplification pathway as a reaction graph in which the hairpin complex acts as the initiator and encodes two priming sites in the loop region: (a) A schematic for generating the secondary structure mechanism and reaction graph from the functional hairpin motif-mediated isothermal amplification. The letters a/s denote the complementarity of the nucleic acid sequence and the numbers represent specific fragments in the functional hairpin structure (e.g. 2a is complementary to 2s). During their amplification, the functional hairpin motif double strand product (blue box) disassembles (solid arrows) to form sense (green triangle) and anti-sense (green square) strand products. The formation of self-folding products exposes the priming sites which leads to the hybridisation of the primers and extension of the sequence by the strand-displacement DNA polymerase (dashed arrows) to generate a double strand amplicon. The amplicon then becomes the target (or initiator) for further amplification cycles via circuit S and A; b The reaction kinetics of the mechanism described in Fig. 1a with different lengths of loop fragment from 40 nt (black squares), 50 nt (red disk) and 60 nt (blue triangle).
