## Question

59 years old male with positive igra and history of bcg immunization at 8–9 years of age and negative chest xray. Is it latent tb?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 59-year-old man with a positive interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), a history of BCG vaccination at age 8–9, and a negative chest radiograph has latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how LTBI is defined clinically and what elements are required to make that diagnosis. Then, I should verify the implications of BCG vaccination on test selection and interpretation. Next, I will review the performance characteristics of IGRA versus tuberculin skin test (TST) in BCG-vaccinated individuals. After that, I need to check how a negative chest radiograph fits into excluding active TB. Then, I should consider risk stratification and whether a second test is warranted. Finally, I will synthesize the findings into a clear conclusion and outline management steps, including treatment options and follow-up, making sure I align with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical definition of LTBI, because I need to ensure I am applying the correct framework before interpreting the test results. LTBI is defined as immunologic evidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (positive IGRA or TST) in a person who has no clinical, radiographic, or microbiologic evidence of active TB disease, which means the diagnosis is a composite of immunologic positivity plus exclusion of active disease by history, exam, and chest radiography, and if indicated, sputum studies.

> Wait, let me verify the role of BCG vaccination in this case, because that can confound interpretation. BCG vaccination, especially when given after infancy or with repeated doses, can cause false-positive TST results due to cross-reactivity, whereas IGRAs use antigens not present in BCG strains (ESAT-6 and CFP-10) and are therefore not affected by prior BCG, making IGRA the preferred screening test in BCG-vaccinated individuals aged 5 years and older [^113jBHMn] [^111rgkBH] [^1155sRUQ] [^116dzzXZ].

> I will now examine the test performance characteristics to ensure the positive IGRA is likely to be a true indicator of infection rather than a false positive. IGRAs have high specificity (about 96–99% in pooled analyses) and are unaffected by BCG, whereas TST specificity drops to roughly 60% in BCG-vaccinated populations; sensitivity estimates for IGRAs are comparable to or better than TST in many settings, supporting the reliability of a positive IGRA in this context [^113mKZ5x] [^114g7qRZ] [^115BZR6a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about active disease; I need to check whether the negative chest radiograph effectively excludes active TB in this scenario. In immunocompetent adults with a positive IGRA and no suggestive symptoms, a normal chest radiograph generally supports the absence of active pulmonary TB, though rare exceptions can occur, particularly in advanced immunosuppression; thus, the negative chest radiograph is a key component in establishing LTBI rather than active disease in this patient [^1126tdg9] [^112MvpnN].

> Let me consider risk stratification next, because it influences both the pretest probability and the threshold for treatment. At age 59, the baseline lifetime risk of progression from LTBI to active TB in immunocompetent adults is about 5–10% if untreated, and this risk is front-loaded in the first 1–2 years after infection; without a reported recent exposure, this patient likely falls into a low-to-intermediate risk category, but treatment still provides meaningful individual and public health benefit [^116uEdHZ] [^115dezHu] [^112MvpnN].

> Hmm, wait a minute, should I order a confirmatory TST now that the IGRA is positive? Initially, I thought a second test might be needed to confirm LTBI, but hold on, I should verify guideline direction here. For individuals 5 years and older with a history of BCG vaccination, guidelines recommend IGRA over TST because of superior specificity; in low-risk individuals who are tested anyway and have a positive initial test, a second test can be considered, but in a BCG-vaccinated person with a positive IGRA and no symptoms, the positive IGRA alone is generally sufficient to diagnose LTBI after excluding active disease, so a confirmatory TST is not routinely required in this scenario [^113jBHMn] [^117PdKeH] [^112MvpnN].

> Let me synthesize the findings carefully. The patient has immunologic evidence of M. tuberculosis infection by IGRA, no clinical or radiographic evidence of active TB, and a BCG history that makes IGRA the preferred and more specific test; therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis is latent tuberculosis infection, and the next step is to offer treatment for LTBI after counseling on benefits and risks [^1126tdg9] [^112MvpnN] [^112tSutD].

> I should double-check management recommendations to ensure alignment with current practice. Treatment for LTBI is recommended to prevent progression to active TB; preferred short-course rifamycin-based regimens (3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, or 3–4 months of daily rifampin with or without isoniazid) are favored over longer isoniazid monotherapy when drug interactions and contraindications allow, and baseline clinical assessment plus liver function testing is advised for patients with liver disease risk factors or those on hepatotoxic drugs; treatment should not begin until active TB is excluded, which has been done here [^112tSutD] [^112MvpnN].

> But wait, what if the patient declines treatment or has a contraindication? I need to ensure we document shared decision-making and arrange follow-up, because even without treatment, periodic clinical monitoring is prudent; if risk factors change (for example, immunosuppression, diabetes, or planned TNF-alpha inhibitor therapy), the threshold for treatment should be revisited, and in some high-risk populations, clinicians may consider dual testing strategies to maximize sensitivity, though that is not routinely indicated in an immunocompetent adult with a positive IGRA and no symptoms [^112h7VhA] [^116imagU].

> In conclusion, yes — this 59-year-old man with a positive IGRA, childhood BCG vaccination, and a negative chest radiograph has latent tuberculosis infection; the positive IGRA provides immunologic evidence of infection, and the normal chest radiograph plus lack of symptoms effectively exclude active TB, fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for LTBI and supporting an offer of preventive therapy with appropriate counseling and monitoring [^1161xq6n] [^1126tdg9] [^112tSutD].

Based on a positive IGRA, a history of BCG vaccination at 8–9 years, and a negative chest X-ray, this 59-year-old male most likely has **latent TB infection (LTBI)** [^112MvpnN]. The IGRA is **not affected by prior BCG** [^111rgkBH] and is preferred in BCG-vaccinated individuals [^113jBHMn] [^112MvpnN]. A negative chest X-ray and no symptoms support LTBI rather than active TB [^1126tdg9]. No further testing is needed unless symptoms develop or immunosuppression occurs; if treatment is considered, use CDC-recommended short-course regimens [^112tSutD] after excluding active TB [^112MvpnN].

---

## Interpretation of test results

### Interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)

- **Specificity**: IGRA is highly specific (> 95%) and not affected by prior BCG vaccination [^113mKZ5x] [^111rgkBH], unlike TST, which can be falsely positive after BCG [^115BZR6a].

- **Sensitivity**: IGRA sensitivity is comparable to TST (~81–86%) in immunocompetent adults [^112bvPbT].

- **Clinical significance**: A positive IGRA indicates infection with M. tuberculosis but does not distinguish latent from active disease [^112eoZqu].

---

### Chest radiograph

A negative chest X-ray in an asymptomatic person with a positive IGRA supports **LTBI** and makes active pulmonary TB unlikely [^1126tdg9].

---

### Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination

BCG vaccination in childhood can cause false-positive TST but **does not affect IGRA** [^111rgkBH], so the positive IGRA in this patient is unlikely to be due to BCG [^112MvpnN].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

According to ATS/IDSA/CDC guidelines, IGRA is preferred over TST in individuals aged ≥ 5 years with a history of BCG vaccination or when return for TST reading is unlikely [^113jBHMn] [^114NykMY]. LTBI is diagnosed when there is a positive IGRA or TST, no symptoms or signs of active TB, and a negative chest X-ray [^1126tdg9] [^112MvpnN]. Routine dual testing (IGRA plus TST) is **not recommended** [^112MvpnN].

---

## Risk of progression to active TB

The lifetime risk of progression from LTBI to active TB is ~5–10% in immunocompetent adults, with about half occurring within the first 2 years after infection [^116uEdHZ]. Risk is higher with immunosuppression, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or recent exposure [^114w5QGB].

---

## Recommended next steps

- **Clinical evaluation**: Confirm absence of symptoms and signs of active TB (cough, fever, night sweats, weight loss) [^1126tdg9].

- **No additional testing**: No further diagnostic tests are indicated unless symptoms develop or immunosuppression occurs [^notfound].

- **Consider treatment**: Offer LTBI treatment with CDC-recommended short-course regimens (e.g. 3 months of once-weekly isoniazid plus rifapentine, or 4 months of daily rifampin) after excluding active TB [^112tSutD].

- **Patient education**: Explain the meaning of LTBI, the risk of progression, and the benefits and risks of treatment [^112MvpnN].

---

## Conclusion

This patient has **LTBI** based on a positive IGRA, a negative chest X-ray, and no symptoms. The IGRA result is not confounded by prior BCG vaccination [^111rgkBH]. No further testing is needed unless symptoms or immunosuppression arise; consider short-course preventive therapy if indicated [^112tSutD].

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^115WVym7]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests for LTBI — two types are used in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires intradermal purified protein derivative with interpretation 48 to 72 hours later, whereas the IGRA uses a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response with laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. FDA-approved IGRAs include T-SPOT.TB, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and QuantiFERON-Gold Plus; patients tested with an IGRA do not need to return for interpretation, and testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination because IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine and for persons who may be unlikely to return. Diagnosis of LTBI is based on further clinical assessment and ruling out active tuberculosis by medical history, physical examination, chest radiograph, and other laboratory tests.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1155sRUQ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening tests and test characteristics: Two types of screening tests for LTBI are currently available in the US: the tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The TST requires trained personnel to administer intradermal purified protein derivative and interpret the response 48 to 72 hours later. The IGRA requires a single venous blood sample that measures the CD4 T-cell response to specific Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens and laboratory processing within 8 to 30 hours after collection. Testing with IGRA may have advantages over TST for persons who have received a BCG vaccination, as IGRA does not cross-react with the vaccine, and for persons who may be unlikely to return for TST interpretation.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^116opVjE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — rationale and strength language: Accuracy studies indicate that IGRAs are more specific and equally or more sensitive than TST in individuals who have received the BCG vaccination; therefore, false-positive results are less likely with IGRAs than with TST, and false-positive results may lead to unnecessary treatment and its accompanying risks (i.e., hepatotoxicity). To minimize these risks, the guideline development panel chose to recommend IGRA testing for individuals who received the BCG vaccination, and the recommendation to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing is strong for those who have received the BCG vaccination or who are not likely to return for TST read; in contrast, the suggestion to perform IGRA testing rather than TST testing on all other patients who are likely to be infected with Mtb and have a low or moderate risk of progressing to TB disease is conditional, and while the committee concluded that IGRA testing is preferable in most patients, it recognized that TST testing may be more appropriate in a sizeable minority due to availability, feasibility, cost, or burden.

Latent tuberculosis infection — risk stratification and prognostic test performance are described as follows: Individuals with immunological evidence of exposure to Mtb antigens but without clinical disease are termed latently infected, and those with recent infection (< 2 years) are at increased risk for progression to clinical disease. Those with negative TSTs or IGRAs are unlikely to progress to TB, yet the PPV of either test is relatively modest, with household-contact estimates that 20–200 people require treatment to prevent one case. Evidence for IGRAs in children < 5 years old is still limited, and studies to inform appropriate use for accurately diagnosing LTBI in this age group are needed.

### Time for a change? Updated guidelines using interferon gamma release assays for detection of latent tuberculosis infection in the office setting [^112SqSxk]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alfa inhibitors and other systemic medications increases the risk of reactivating a latent tuberculosis (TB) infection. Therefore, screening for latent TB infection is important in dermatology patients eligible for treatment with these medications. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) has its limitations, it has been the standard choice for diagnosis of latent TB infection. Since the development of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), the role of the TST has been re-evaluated and IGRAs have increasingly been incorporated into national guidelines. Although there are situations when either test may be performed, in individuals who have received a BCG vaccination and in those who are unlikely to return for a TST reading, IGRAs may be particularly helpful in distinguishing patients at risk for TB. This article discusses the advantages and disadvantages of both the TST and the IGRA and presents a summary of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2010 guidelines for using IGRAs.

Targeted testing program factors — IGRA vs TST: The benefit of targeted testing for LTBI resides not in the test employed, but in its programmatic use, and programmatic considerations such as cost, test availability, prevalence of BCG exposure in the target population, ability to reevaluate the patient 2–3 days after testing, and staff training/experience might affect the decision to use IGRA- or TST-based evaluations.

ATS/IDSA/CDC tuberculosis diagnosis — test performance and BCG effects: In patients who are known to have received vaccination with BCG, the specificity of IGRAs has been consistently superior to TST, whereas among patients without BCG vaccination the specificity of IGRAs and TST appears similar; meta-analyses estimate the specificity of QFT-IT to be > 95%, the specificity for TST is roughly 97% in those with no prior exposure to BCG, and specificity is reduced to roughly 60% in those with a history of BCG vaccination. For T-SPOT, reported specificities include 97% in German healthcare workers using a cutoff of 6 spots, 85% in Korean adolescents, and 99% in Navy recruits when using the 8-spot cutoff.

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^1161xq6n]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection spectrum and latent tuberculosis infection definitions: Persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have a broad array of presentations, ranging from those with clinical, radiographic, and microbiological evidence of tuberculosis (TB disease) to those who are infected with Mtb but have no clinical evidence of TB disease (latent tuberculosis infection [LTBI]). Individuals with LTBI who have been recently exposed have an increased risk of developing TB, whereas those with remote exposure have less risk over time unless they develop a condition that impairs immunity. Operationally, recent exposure can be defined either epidemiologically (ie, as might occur in the setting of the household of an infectious case or occupational exposure) or immunologically (ie, conversion of a tuberculin skin test or interferon-γ release assay [IGRA] from negative to positive).

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnostic testing — IGRA vs TST and age thresholds: Guidelines recommend that persons at low risk for Mtb infection and disease progression NOT be tested for Mtb infection. We concur with this recommendation. If diagnostic testing is nevertheless performed in such individuals, We suggest performing an IGRA instead of a TST in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest a second diagnostic test if the initial test is positive in individuals 5 years or older (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). When such testing is performed, the person is considered infected only if both tests are positive. We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence). In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age. While both IGRA and TST testing provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent TB. Therefore, the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to starting on treatment for LTBI. This is typically done by determining whether or not symptoms suggestive of TB disease are present, performing a chest radiograph and, if radiographic signs of active TB are seen, then sampling is performed and the patient managed accordingly.

### Effectiveness of BCG vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in adults: a cross-sectional analysis of a UK-based cohort [^113XPvsC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

BCG appears to reduce acquisition of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in children, measured using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs). We explored whether BCG vaccination continues to be associated with decreased prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection in adults.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of data from adult contacts of tuberculosis cases participating in a UK cohort study. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) of BCG, ascertained based on presence of a scar or vaccination history, against latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), measured via IGRA, was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. The effects of age at BCG and time since vaccination were also explored.

Results

Of 3453 recent tuberculosis contacts, 27.5% had LTBI. There was strong evidence of an association between BCG and LTBI (adjusted odds ratio = 0.70; 95% confidence interval, .56-.87; p = 0.0017) yielding a VE of 30%. VE declined with time since vaccination but there was evidence that LTBI prevalence was lower amongst vaccinated individuals even > 20 years after vaccination, compared with nonvaccinated participants.

Conclusions

BCG is associated with lower prevalence of LTBI in adult contacts of tuberculosis. These results contribute to growing evidence that suggests BCG may protect against M. tuberculosis infection as well as disease. This has implications for immunization programs, vaccine development, and tuberculosis control efforts worldwide.

BCG and false positives

BCG vaccination can result in false positive results on TSTs in those vaccinated when older than 1 year of age. This could have falsely inflated the number of people estimated to be TB immunoreactive in the studies that we analysed. If so, the proportion of TB immunoreactive people who developed TB associated with immunosuppression would have been higher than our estimates. To ensure that this was not the case, for each study we determined the use of BCG vaccine in the appropriate country and whether the more specific IGRA testswere used to determine TB immunoreactivity. We concluded that our estimates of TB immunoreactivity were not falsely high because of BCG vaccination (see supplementary table 2).

High-risk Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection — committee practice when initial testing is negative is described as follows: many committee members acknowledged that they perform a second test in clinical practice if patients at high risk for progression test negative, specifically performing a tuberculin skin test (TST) if an initial interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is negative or an IGRA if an initial TST is negative, and if the second test is positive, they consider this evidence for infection with Mtb; this approach aims to increase sensitivity, is not based upon empirical evidence, and may be an acceptable trade off when the consequences of missing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) are judged higher than those of a false-positive result.

### Guidelines on interferon-γ release assays for tuberculosis infection: concordance, discordance or confusion? [^112hKrFk]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Identification of latent tuberculosis (TB) infection and preventive therapy is important for TB control, especially in high-risk populations. Since the advent of interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs), many studies have evaluated their role in the diagnosis of active and latent TB. With the growing evidence base, many guidelines now include IGRAs. We surveyed the literature and contacted experts to identify 33 guidelines and position papers from 25 countries and two supranational organizations. The results show considerable diversity in the recommendations on IGRAs, with four approaches commonly proposed: (i) two-step approach of tuberculin skin test (TST) first, followed by IGRA either when the TST is negative (to increase sensitivity, mainly in immunocompromised individuals), or when the TST is positive (to increase specificity, mainly in bacillus Calmette-Guérin-vaccinated individuals); (ii) Either TST or IGRA, but not both; (iii) IGRA and TST together (to increase sensitivity); and (iv) IGRA only, replacing the TST. Overall, the use of IGRAs is increasingly recommended, but most of the current guidelines do not use objective, transparent methods to grade evidence and recommendations, and do not disclose conflicts of interests. Future IGRA guidelines must aim to be transparent, evidence-based, periodically updated, and free of financial conflicts and industry involvement.

INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by a bacterial pathogen (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affects the lungs. Globally, it is one of the leading causes of death from a single infectious agent. According to the World Health Organization, 1.25 million individuals died from TB, and approximately 10.8 million became ill with the disease in 2023. Furthermore, approximately one-fourth of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacilli. Among them, there is a 5%–10% risk of becoming ill and potentially spreading the disease within their lifetime. Individuals with latent TB infection do not exhibit symptoms and cannot transmit the disease. TB is preventable and treatable. However, the number of cases being properly diagnosed and treated remains low. Therefore, the quick and accurate detection of both M. tuberculosis infection and disease is essential to adequately control this pandemic.

Currently used diagnostic methods for latent TB infection and disease include bacterial culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), chest radiography, the tuberculin skin test (TST), and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs). Bacterial culture is the current gold standard for the diagnosis of TB disease, followed by PCR, whereas the TST and IGRAs are the most commonly used methods to diagnose a latent TB infection. The TST has been available and widely used since the 1900s. It uses a heat-killed purified protein derivative from M. tuberculosis cultures, which shares components with other mycobacteria. Therefore, the TST cannot distinguish between M. tuberculosis infection and reactivity due to previous vaccination with the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine or infections caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). This may change with the development of new Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen-based skin tests.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) epidemiology and progression in the US: Estimated prevalence is about 5.0%, or up to 13 million persons, approximately 30% of persons exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis will develop LTBI, and if left untreated approximately 5% to 10% of healthy, immunocompetent persons will progress to having active tuberculosis disease.

### Identification and management of latent tuberculosis infection [^113tS7CL]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is a condition in which a person is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but does not currently have active tuberculosis disease. An estimated 10 to 15 million persons in the United States have LTBI. Because 5 to 10 percent of persons with LTBI are at risk of progressing to active disease, identification and treatment of LTBI are essential for the elimination of tuberculosis. Screening is recommended for high-risk persons, including immigrants; residents and employees of congregate living facilities; and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Targeted tuberculin skin testing remains the most acceptable method of LTBI screening. New tests are being developed, the most promising of which are in vitro interferon-gamma release assays. All screened persons found to have LTBI should be offered treatment, regardless of age. Before initiating treatment, active tuberculosis must be ruled out by patient history, physical examination, and chest radiography. The treatment of choice for LTBI is isoniazid for nine months. Hepatotoxicity is the most severe adverse effect. Isoniazid should be discontinued if transaminase levels are greater than three times the upper limit of normal in symptomatic patients or five times the upper limit of normal in asymptomatic patients.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) testing — cautions and limitations: While both IGRA and TST provide evidence for infection with Mtb, they cannot distinguish active from latent tuberculosis and the diagnosis of active TB must be excluded prior to treatment for LTBI; a large (> 15 mm) TST reaction is more likely to reflect infection, measurement variability exists for IFN-γ tests (the FDA accepts a variance of 11%), there are insufficient data for quantitative interpretation of IGRAs beyond FDA cut-points, results near the cut-point are less reliable, and the results of IFN-γ testing should be reported quantitatively; discordance between TST and IGRA is common and in low-risk populations discordant tests are likely to be false positives.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^113BnaGM]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Our results have implications for guidelines and future cost-effectiveness analyses, particularly in the screening of tuberculosis contacts for latent tuberculosis infection and also recent migrants (ie, in the past 5 years) from high-burden countries. Although negative predictive values were similar for all tests, we have found statistically significant differences for the positive prediction of progression to active tuberculosis between tests, with a positive TST-5 result being a significantly worse predictor than all other tests, and a positive T-SPOT. TB result being a significantly better predictor than all other tests, except for TST-15, and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube was significantly better than TST-10. Although the review of the WHO guidelines, did not examine TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status compared with IGRAs, we show for the first time, to our knowledge, that by use of this stratification method, TST is equivalent to IGRAs. The most recent WHO guidelinesrecommend either a TST or IGRA as equivalent alternatives without taking into account previous BCG vaccination. Our results contradict this recommendation. The screening strategy by which participants are identified for treatment influences the cost-effectiveness of any test-and-treat programme; the more people who are identified as positive and eligible for treatment, the greater the cost. The trade-offs of testing with TST-5 (which identified the most progressors but with potentially the highest number needed to treat) versus IGRAs and TST-15 (which are likely to have the lowest numbers needed to treat) has implications for WHO guidelines depending on the uptake of testing and adherence to management in different settings. In the absence of a highly specific diagnostic test for latent tuberculosis infection at risk of progression, a cheap and non-toxic treatment is needed that can be given to a larger proportion of screened people than is the case with current treatment options.

Tuberculin skin test definition and limitations — Traditionally, LTBI has been defined by the presence of a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) (≥ 5 mm of induration at 48–72 hours in people with HIV) in people with no clinical or radiographic evidence of TB disease, but the TST has disadvantages including the requirement for two visits, decreased specificity among people who received Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination, and decreased sensitivity among people with advanced immunodeficiency; the first two limitations have led to broader use of IGRAs for the detection of LTBI.

Methods

The studies presented in this manuscript comply with all relevant ethical regulations. Protocols for Human Subjects participation were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Saint Louis University, Case Western Reserve University, and the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center. Written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in any study procedures.

Participant groups

BCG-vaccinated individuals were participants in prior trials conducted at Saint Louis University. All BCG-vaccinated individuals were IGRA negative prior to enrollment and remained IGRA negative at the time of participation in the current study. Participants were recruited from prior studies that had included both standard ID administration of BCG and experimental PO vaccination. All were healthy young adults with no prior history of BCG vaccination, previous close contact TB exposures, or previous known TB infection or disease. For studies of peripheral blood, all participants received BCG via only one route, either ID or PO vaccination. Because recipients of PO vaccination represented the group with the smallest target population from which we could recruit participants for research bronchoscopy procedures, we also included individuals who had received both PO and ID vaccination. Of eight recipients of PO BCG who participated in research bronchoscopy procedures, six received PO vaccination alone, and only two received both PO and ID BCG on the same day; we refer to this combined group as recipients of "PO ± ID BCG". Participants were recruited from a prior clinical trial of PO vs. ID BCG (DMID-01–351) into an RNASeq-based substudy of that trial (DMID-01–351 Transcriptomics Substudy)

LTBI individuals self-reported prior positive PPD tests or QuantiFERON TB Gold In-Tube tests and no history of BCG vaccination. Repeat PPD testing confirmed positive responses (≥ 10 mm induration) in all participants, and most had positive QuantiFERON results. LTBI individuals denied historical or current symptoms of TB, and chest x-rays were negative for active disease.

Mtb/BCG-naïve control participants had no prior positive PPD or QuantiFERON tests or history of BCG vaccination. All had negative confirmatory PPD tests.

Research bronchoscopy participants of all study groups were 18–50 year-old non-smokers without asthma or other chronic respiratory, cardiac, or systemic disease, and no recent systemic immunosuppression.

### Tuberculin purified protein derivative (Tubersol) [^114xzELY]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

TUBERSOL Tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative (Mantoux), is indicated to aid diagnosis of tuberculosis infection (TB) in persons at increased risk of developing active disease.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have published guidelines regarding populations that would benefit from tuberculin skin testing (TST). Current recommendations can be accessed at: http://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/testing.htm.

Previous BCG vaccination is not a contraindication to tuberculin testing. The skin-test results of BCG vaccinated persons can be used to support or exclude the diagnosis of TB infection. However, an FDA-approved interferon gamma release assay is preferred over tuberculin skin test for persons 5 years of age and older who were previously vaccinated with BCG. (8)

### How should I interpret an interferon gamma release assay result for tuberculosis infection? [^114rYSDH]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) are the first new diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI) since the century-old tuberculin skin test (TST). They are cell-mediated immune-based blood tests that have revolutionised LTBI diagnosis and are increasingly recommended by national guidelines.

Objectives

With the rapid expansion of the IGRA evidence-base in recent years, the limitations of IGRA and uncertainties in clinical interpretation of IGRA results have increasingly come into focus. In LTBI diagnosis these include: prognostic power of IGRAs relative to TST for quantifying risk of progression to active disease, false-negative rates in immunocompromised patients, the clinical meaning of IGRA reversion and the significance of the size of IGRA response. Furthermore, the role of IGRAs in the diagnostic work-up of active TB is unclear, and there is little evidence supporting use of the tests in anti-TB treatment monitoring.

Methodological Approach

On-going large prospective longitudinal clinical endpoint cohort studies of active and latent TB will tackle some of the uncertainties regarding IGRAs. Here we discuss clinical practice and guidance in light of the current uncertainties, based on existing evidence.

Conclusions and Impact

Current and planned clinical research will fill the gaps in the evidence-base, narrowing the areas of uncertainty and informing future policy. Translational research into next-generation IGRAs and new T cell-based diagnostic platforms will likely overcome the limitations of current IGRAs in the near future.

### Key advances in vaccine development for tuberculosis-success and challenges [^116ZaUeq]. NPJ Vaccines (2023). Medium credibility.

Recent progress in evaluating TB vaccines in clinical trials

A major roadblock to testing vaccines is defining tractable endpoints. Our inability to detect M. tuberculosis in asymptomatic individuals is a major impediment to evaluating the ability of vaccines to prevent infection. While microbiological techniques can detect M. tuberculosis in individuals with pulmonary disease, these tests can be confusing and often fail to detect individuals with paucibacillary disease. Tuberculin Skin Tests (TST) offer a quick and cheap alternative but cannot differentiate between M. tuberculosis infection and BCG vaccination. The current gold standard in TB diagnostics is the Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). A subject's peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with specific M. tuberculosis antigens, and the amount of IFNγ released is measured. Since the antigens used in the assay are expressed by M. tuberculosis and not by BCG, it can specifically detect M. tuberculosis infection even in BCG vaccinated individuals. However, as it measures T cell responses and not bacilli, it indicates exposure to M. tuberculosis and cannot differentiate between individuals who have cleared the infection or are persistently infected.

### Diagnostic accuracy of interferon-gamma release assays for diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ipta1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Two authors (AP and SC) independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of all articles retrieved from the systematic search to exclude irrelevant studies. In case of disagreement, the discordant articles were included in the full-text review. The full articles of included studies from the first step were independently reviewed by two authors (PL and PT) to select eligible studies and abstract data. The reviewers resolved disagreements regarding study selection and data abstraction by discussion. The reviewers also manually reviewed the references of included studies and the previous systematic reviews to identify additional eligible studies. The reliability of study selection was assessed using the percent of agreement andstatistic.

The following information was abstracted from each study, including author names, year of publication, study design, the country in which each study was conducted, type of IGRA test, and participant characteristics (number of participants, age, sex, proportion of confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis patients, proportion of patients with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis, participant immune status, history of previous tuberculosis infection, and history of BCG vaccination).

Outcome

The primary outcomes were the diagnostic accuracy variables, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR), negative LR, and diagnostics odds ratio (DOR). Diagnostic accuracy measures were abstracted, including true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative for each IGRA test and reference test.

Study quality assessment

The risk of bias in each eligible study was independently evaluated by two authors (PL and PT) using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Disagreements between two reviewers were settled by the discussion with the third reviewer (TP). We defined studies with low risk of bias if they were judged as having low risk of bias for all domains of risk of bias evaluation.

### Interferon-gamma release assays and TB diagnosis [^113pedwr]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

Worldwide in 2007, there were an estimated 9.27 million new cases of active tuberculosis (TB) and 1.8 million deaths related to the disease. However, in most people with TB, the infection is 'latent'; the underlying cause, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains alive but patients are asymptomatic and non-infectious. Latent infection progresses to active disease in around 10% of individuals at some point. It therefore represents a large reservoir of potential future active cases who, if correctly identified, can be treated with prophylactic anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy before active TB develops. Until recently, the only test to indicate the relative risk of an individual having latent TB infection was the tuberculin skin test (TST), but this lacks specificity.3 Here we look at the place of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), a new approach in the diagnosis of TB.

### New approaches in the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection [^112a9no8]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

The current cumulative evidence (summarized in several reviews and meta-analyses) suggest that the performance of the two (ELISA-based and ELISPOT-based) formats of IGRAs are nearly comparable in predicting development of active disease in immunocompetent individuals. However, the agreement between IGRAs and TST is generally poor due to false-positive TST results in BCG vaccinated subjects. The clinical relevance of a positive TST result is usually poor (i.e. unable to predict which patients will develop active TB disease in the near future) and sensitivity as well as specificity are influenced by the different cut-off values used in different settings. However, the value of negative TST result in predicting no further development of active disease in human subjects presumably exposed to M. tuberculosis is fairly high (negative predictive value). On the other hand, the predictive value of positive IGRA results for the development of active TB is usually better than that of TST while the predictive value of a negative result is very high in immunocompetent individuals, particularly if the TST is also negative. The TST is often negative in immunocompromised individuals and its performance is also influenced by the immunosuppressing conditions while the sensitivity of IGRAs is generally better than TST and the experimental conditions (particularly in T-SPOT.TB assay) can be easily adjusted for testing immunocompromised individuals.

Data analysis

In the planned primary analysis, for each identified group and tuberculosis test we estimated the pooled primary and secondary outcomes using random effects meta-analysis. We pooled the results for QFT-Gold and QFT-Gold-In-Tube (referred to as QFT). We analysed outcomes separately for TST indurations at 5 mm, 10 mm, and 15 mm cut points, T-SPOT. TB, QFT, and both IGRAs pooled together.

In planned secondary analysis, for studies reporting results of TST and IGRA, we calculated the incidence rate ratio among people with concordant (same test results) and discordant (test results differ) results. In further planned secondary analyses, we included all studies, regardless of the number of participants tested, and conducted a priori defined stratified analysis based on method of follow-up (passive v active), median year of study start (≤ 2005 v ≥ 2006), study design (randomised controlled trial v retrospective cohort v prospective cohort), mean or median duration of follow-up (≤ 24 months v > 24 months), annual tuberculosis incidence in country of study (< 30 per 100 000 v ≥ 30 per 100 000), country level income (high v upper middle, lower middle, and low), method of tuberculosis diagnosis (microbiological v microbiological and clinical v not specified), and study quality (high v moderate v low). In post hoc analysis, we conducted stratified analysis based on proportion of patients excluded because of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (< 20% v ≥ 20%) and stratified analysis based on country level policy of BCG vaccination (multiple or post-infancy v vaccination only at birth or none) according to the BCG World Atlas.

All analyses were performed with package meta (version 4.9–5) in R. Individual study outcome estimates were log or logit transformed and random effects meta-analysed using generalised linear mixed models with a Poisson distribution; pooled estimates were back transformed. This method has the advantage of avoiding zero cell corrections that could bias estimates when events are rare. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic. Publication bias was not assessed statistically, as factors other than results, such as investigator motivation and funding, might influence why a study is published, commonly used tests do not always agree, few population groups analysed met the minimum criteria for statistical assessment of publication bias, and lack of statistical significance or funnel plot asymmetry does not indicate lack of publication bias.

Screening for coinfections — tuberculosis recommendations — Upon initiation of care, persons with HIV without a history of tuberculosis or a prior positive tuberculosis screening test should be screened for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection using either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Those with positive test results should be treated for latent M. tuberculosis infection after active tuberculosis has been excluded. Persons with HIV who have close contact with persons with infectious tuberculosis should be treated for latent M. tuberculosis infection regardless of their TST or IGRA results, age, or prior courses of tuberculosis treatment; active tuberculosis should be excluded first.

Screening for, and treatment of, latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before anti- tumour necrosis factor α therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of active tuberculosis by more than 80% and is recommended before initiation of treatment. In the absence of a 'gold standard' test for LTBI, current screening involves taking a clinical history of risk factors, chest radiograph and tuberculin skin test. Alternative cellular immune-based screening tests have been developed to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. This paper summarises the current position and advances in the use of newer screening strategies for LTBI.

### Serial interferon-γ release assay in children with latent tuberculosis infection and children with tuberculosis [^114UkeDr]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA) is used for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and for serial testing of active tuberculosis (TB). The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of IGRA for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of children with LTBI and children with TB. IGRA was performed in BCG vaccinated children before and six months after the beginning of treatment.

Methods

A total of 59 BCG vaccinated children aged 4–18 years were investigated due to exposure to active TB. The participants were divided into two groups: Group 1, children with LTBI (N = 41), and Group 2, children with TB (N = 18). IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube) was performed twice, i.e., before treatment and at the end of prophylaxis and therapy.

Results

There was no significant difference in IFN-γ concentrations between Group 1 and Group 2 subjects either before or after the treatment. Difference between pre-treatment and post-treatment IFN-γ concentrations compared in either Group 1 or Group 2 was not statistically significant. During follow-up, children with LTBI did not develop active TB. In addition, in children with TB, signs and symptoms of TB improved with anti-TB therapy.

Conclusion

This study showed that the concentrations of IFN-γ did not differ in children with LTBI and TB either before or at the end of treatment. IGRA may remain positive over a long period of time. It seems that IGRA is not useful for monitoring treatment of children with LTBI and children with TB.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^115QinqH]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

In our secondary analysis of incidence rate ratios among contacts being tested with both a TST and an IGRA, we found that among this high risk population, incidence rate ratios were high for both concordant positive and discordant positive groups, when compared with the concordant negative group. This implies that in the presence of a single negative test result for latent tuberculosis infection in a high risk person, there might be value in performing a second test. Whether to use TST or IGRA first is, however, unclear, as the direct comparison of these tests was not an objective of this meta-analysis. This question was assessed recently, but with inconsistent results.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Our meta-analysis has key strengths. In our literature search we maximised sensitivity, and to further enhance sensitivity we applied loose criteria for citations to qualify for full text review. Using generalised linear mixed models to perform random effects meta-analysis reduced biases that would be introduced through other methods of pooling, such as inverse variance, that require zero cell corrections. Finally, we estimated several effect measures that policymakers and providers might use when determining whether to test, treat, or test and treat people for latent tuberculosis infection.

This meta-analysis has some limitations. Many studies used passive follow-up for detection of active tuberculosis and were of low quality; factors which we found to be associated with lower observed rates of active tuberculosis. Some studies included people who previously had tuberculosis. In such studies, however, these participants were most often a minority of the included population, and tuberculosis rates did not differ between studies with and without people who previously had tuberculosis. Publication bias was not statistically assessed but cannot be excluded. The included studies in this review were published from 1990 to 2019. The risk of tuberculosis over this period might be variable owing to changes in health systems and population health, among others, resulting in higher tuberculosis rates being observed in studies conducted earlier in this period. However, we did not identify a consistent difference in tuberculosis risk between studies conducted before and studies conducted after 2006. In studies using a TST, rounding of induration measurements might introduce bias, but since this is a common issue in clinical practice, we do not think it affects the generalisability of our results. Most included studies were conducted in settings with a tuberculosis incidence of less than 100 per 100 000 population, potentially restricting generalisability of our results to settings with a low incidence of tuberculosis and low risk of reinfection.

### Conversion or reversion of interferon γ release assays for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1169GVtR]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Interferon γ release assays (IGRAs) are widely used for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection. However, with repeated testing, IGRA transformation (conversion or reversion) may be detected and is challenging to interpret. We reviewed the frequency of and risk factors for IGRA transformation.

Methods

We screened public databases for studies of human participants that reported the frequency of IGRA transformation. We extracted study and participant characteristics, details of IGRA testing and results. We calculated the pooled frequency of IGRA transformation (and transient transformation) and examined associated risk factors.

Results

The pooled frequency of IGRA conversion or reversion from 244 studies was estimated at 7.3% (95% confidence interval, 6.1%-8.5%) or 22.8% (20.1%-25.7%), respectively. Transient conversion or reversion were estimated at 46.0% (95% CI, 35.7%-56.4%) or 19.6% (9.2%-31.7%) of conversion or reversion events respectively. Indeterminate results seldom reverted to positive (1.2% [95% CI, .1%-3.5%]). IGRA results in the borderline-positive or borderline-negative range were associated with increased risk of conversion or reversion (pooled odds ratio [OR] for conversion, 4.15 [95% CI, 3.00–5.30]; pooled OR for reversion, 4.06 [3.07–5.06]). BCG vaccination was associated with decreased risk of conversion (OR, 0.70 [95% CI, .56-.84]), cigarette smoking with decreased risk of reversion (0.44 [.06-.82]), and female sex with decreased risk of either conversion or reversion (OR for conversion, 0.66 [.58-.75]; OR for reversion, 0.46 [.31-.61]).

Conclusions

IGRA conversion is less common than reversion, and frequently transient. Research is needed to determine whether individuals with reversion would benefit from tuberculosis-preventive treatment. Retesting of people with indeterminate results is probably not indicated, because indeterminate results seldom revert to positive.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112ZDqme]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Tuberculosis screening in persons with HIV — interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) vs tuberculin skin test (TST) and special situations: The QuantiFERON-TB Gold in-tube and T-SPOT TB tests are US Food and Drug Administration–approved aids for detecting latent M. tuberculosis, and a meta-analysis suggests IGRAs perform similarly to TSTs; prior Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination may yield a positive TST with less cross-reactivity for IGRA. The CDC states that use of an IGRA is preferred over the TST in patients with a history of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination and in those unlikely to return for skin test reading, and IGRAs reported as indeterminate should be repeated. Advanced immunosuppression may be associated with false-negative results, routine cutaneous anergy testing is not recommended, and routine use of IGRA in children aged < 5 years is currently not recommended.

### Systematic review: T-cell-based assays for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: an update [^113mKZ5x]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Interferon-gamma-release assays (IGRAs) are alternatives to the tuberculin skin test (TST). A recent meta-analysis showed that IGRAs have high specificity, even among populations that have received bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. Sensitivity was suboptimal for TST and IGRAs.

Purpose

To incorporate newly reported evidence from 20 studies into an updated meta-analysis on the sensitivity and specificity of IGRAs.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched through 31 March 2008, and citations of all original articles, guidelines, and reviews for studies published in English were reviewed.

Study Selection

Studies that evaluated QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (both from Cellestis, Victoria, Australia), and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, United Kingdom) or its precommercial ELISpot version, when data on the commercial version were lacking. For assessing sensitivity, the study sample had to have microbiologically confirmed active tuberculosis. For assessing specificity, the sample had to comprise healthy, low-risk individuals without known exposure to tuberculosis. Studies with fewer than 10 participants and those that included only immunocompromised participants were excluded.

Data Extraction

One reviewer abstracted data on participant characteristics, test characteristics, and test performance from 38 studies; these data were double-checked by a second reviewer. The original investigators were contacted for additional information when necessary.

Data Synthesis

A fixed-effects meta-analysis with correction for overdispersion was done to pool data within prespecified subgroups. The pooled sensitivity was 78% (95% CI, 73% to 82%) for QuantiFERON-TB Gold, 70% (CI, 63% to 78%) for QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, and 90% (CI, 86% to 93%) for T-SPOT.TB. The pooled specificity for both QuantiFERON tests was 99% among non-BCG-vaccinated participants (CI, 98% to 100%) and 96% (CI, 94% to 98%) among BCG-vaccinated participants. The pooled specificity of T-SPOT.TB (including its precommercial ELISpot version) was 93% (CI, 86% to 100%). Tuberculin skin test results were heterogeneous, but specificity in non-BCG-vaccinated participants was consistently high (97% [CI, 95% to 99%]).

Limitations

Most studies were small and had limitations, including no gold standard for diagnosing latent tuberculosis and variable TST methods and cutoff values. Data on the specificity of the commercial T-SPOT.TB assay were limited.

Conclusion

The IGRAs, especially QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube, have excellent specificity that is unaffected by BCG vaccination. Tuberculin skin test specificity is high in non-BCG-vaccinated populations but low and variable in BCG-vaccinated populations. Sensitivity of IGRAs and TST is not consistent across tests and populations, but T-SPOT.TB appears to be more sensitive than both QuantiFERON tests and TST.

### Screening of immigrants in the UK for imported latent tuberculosis: a multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis [^111xM3pC]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2011). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

We obtained data for demographics (age categorised as < 16 years, 16–25 years, or 26–35 years, and sex), BCG vaccination status (ascertained through documentary evidence, reliable history of vaccination, or a characteristic scar), and country of origin. From reported country of origin, we further classified data into region of origin (Europe and the Americas, Middle East and north Africa, other Asia, Indian subcontinent, or sub-Saharan Africa) and we took tuberculosis incidence in the country (categorised as 0 cases per 100 000/year–50 cases per 100 000/year; 51/100 00–150/100 000; 151/100 000–250/100 000; 251/100 000–350/100 000, and ≥ 350/100 000) from WHO's 2009 global report on tuberculosis.

Continuous data were summarised with median and IQR, and were compared with the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical responses were expressed as a simple descriptive percentage with 95% CIs, and comparisons were made with Pearson χ² or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. We calculated yield of latent infection as the proportion of individuals who were IGRA positive; indeterminate results were included in the denominator when calculating IGRA-positivity. We assessed univariate associations of the presence of latent infection with age, sex, region of origin, tuberculosis incidence in country of origin, and BCG status using logistic regression, and reported as crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% CIs. We then calculated adjusted ORs by mutually adjusting in a multivariate logistic regression for age, sex, and tuberculosis incidence in country of origin (to account for potential confounders) with the same categories outlined above. We did not include BCG status in the multivariate model because of the high proportion of missing values.

To assess the different thresholds of incidence screening we calculated, at every incidence level cutoff, the absolute number of immigrants needing to be screened, the yield for latent tuberculosis infection, and the proportion of individuals with latent infection who would not be detected at particular thresholds of screening. Because screening of children is a priority in tuberculosis control, and because the number of child immigrants younger than 16 years is small, we also considered screening all children irrespective of tuberculosis incidence in their country of origin.

Analyses used STATA version 9.2. All tests were two-tailed and p values less than 0.05 were regarded as significant.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^111i8PWi]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

When the intention is to identify the largest proportion of individuals with a positive test result who might progress to active tuberculosis, such as among household contacts of patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis, TST-5 — as currently recommended in US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines — might be the best approach. By contrast, screening programmes (eg, of migrants) should consider progression rates, the trade-off between the three criteria of selecting the most appropriate testing method outlined earlier, and the cost-effectiveness of the selected testing strategy.

We compared our results with the review that informed the WHO guidelines on managing latent tuberculosis, and summarised all existing pairwise comparisons of an IGRA versus TST. We identified several studies in our literature search and from the WHO review that evaluated TST versus a single IGRA in high incidence countries, and four did head-to-head comparisons in low incidence countries. However, only one of these studies compared TST with each of the commercially available IGRAs, and the other three studies only compared TST with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube. Although sample sizes ranged from 339 to 1335 participants, all four studies had 15 or fewer individuals who progressed to active tuberculosis. To our knowledge, our study is the largest head-to-head comparison of the three available diagnostic tests for latent tuberculosis infection, both in terms of the number of participants and progressions to active tuberculosis. Our estimates of positive predictive value are towards the low end of those previously reported, and are less than were found in two other small cohort studies. Positive predictive values for the development of active tuberculosis depend in part on the incidence of tuberculosis in the study population — ie, the positive predictive value is higher when the incidence is greater. Our analysis of TST stratified by BCG-vaccination status showed similar IRRs to those for both IGRAs, which is in contrast with the WHO guidelines reviewthat concluded TSTs had a lower IRR than IGRAs for progression to active tuberculosis in low incidence countries. In our study, progression of disease was increased among the recently exposed participants compared with migrants whose infection had probably been acquired in another country.

### Interferon-gamma release assays versus tuberculin skin testing for detection of latent tuberculosis in chronic haemodialysis patients [^114MfUbW]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

End stage renal disease increases the risk of reactivating latent tuberculosis (LTBI). Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA) are an alternative to the tuberculin skin test (TST) for detecting LTBI.

Methods

Sixty-two hemodialysis patients (46 male, 16 female, aged 65 ± 15 years) from 3 hemodialysis facilities in the Geneva area were submitted to a TST, 2 IGRA (T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON Gold in tube: QFT), a chest radiography, and a questionnaire to record social status, country of birth, history of prior TST, tuberculosis (TB), BCG (Bacillus of Calmette-Guérin vaccine), and any cause of immuno-suppression. LTBI was defined as prior "at risk" contact with a case of contagious TB and/or a chest X-ray suggestive of prior TB infection.

Results

Positivity rate was 19% for TST, 21% for QFT and 29% for T-SPOT-TB; 8% of QFT and 11% of T-SPOT-TB were indeterminate. Agreement between IGRA was fair (kappa = 0.60). After adjusting for age and BCG, OR (Odds Ratio) of having a positive QFT was 4.6-fold (p = 0.029) higher in patients with LTBI vs. those without LTBI. In contrast, no association was found between LTBI and having a positive T-SPOT.TB or a positive TST. As expected, there was a strong association between prior BCG vaccination and having a positive TST (OR 5.3, p = 0.017). QFT was the only test with a significant OR of having LTBI (adjusted OR: 4.4; 95%CI: 1.1–17.6; p = 0.034). Among 5 patients with definite prior TB, TST and T-SPOT.TB were positive in 1 and QFT, in 2.

Conclusions

In this population, QFT was superior to TST for detecting LTBI, but both IGRAs and TST have important limitations, and are unreliable for screening for LTBI.

### 5-year follow-up of active tuberculosis development from latent infection in rural China [^116qYzpp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

A 5-year follow-up study found declining disease development rates from latent tuberculosis infection. In the latter 3 years, the incidence, per 100 person-years, was 0.26 for interferon-γ release assay positives and 0.19 for tuberculin skin test positives (P = 0.28). In addition, all round have been checked.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116Fmz4U]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — tuberculosis testing cadence and modality preferences are as follows: Testing should begin during infancy (3–12 months of age) and continue annually (expert opinion), and tuberculin skin test (TST) is preferred over interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) for children aged < 2 years (strong, low). Both TSTs and IGRAs can be used for children with HIV for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) who are ≥ 5 years old, and some experts provide recommendations for testing children ≥ 2 years with IGRAs; IGRAs are preferred for bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-vaccinated people or when TST return rates are low (strong, moderate). After tuberculosis disease has been excluded, all children with HIV with a positive TST or IGRA or with close contact with infectious tuberculosis should receive preventive therapy (strong, high).

### Official American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America / centers for disease control and prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children [^116dzzXZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Tuberculin skin test (TST) — performance characteristics and two‑step testing report that sensitivity measured in clinically well persons with previously treated tuberculosis is high (95%–98%). False‑negative reactions occur more frequently in infants and young children, early (< 8 weeks) after infection, in persons with clinical conditions associated with immunosuppression or overwhelming illness, after recent viral and bacterial infections, and with treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (eg, high‑dose corticosteroids, TNF inhibitors). Test specificity is decreased among persons with prior BCG vaccination — especially those vaccinated postinfancy or with repeat vaccination — and in areas where nontuberculous mycobacteria are common, increasing false‑positive TST reactions. Because of the boosting phenomenon, initial repeat testing is recommended for persons with a negative TST who will undergo periodic screening and have not been tested recently (eg, 1 year), and this 2‑step testing uses a repeat TST within 1–3 weeks after an initial negative TST to avoid misclassification of boosting as conversion.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114g7qRZ]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening test accuracy — tuberculin skin test (TST) thresholds and interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) — is summarized as follows: The sensitivity and specificity of TST depends on the threshold used to determine positivity, with 5-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 80% (12 studies; n = 1323) and pooled specificity 95% (3 studies; n = 5149), 10-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 81% (15 studies; n = 1427) and pooled specificity 98% (8 studies; n = 964), and 15-mm induration showing pooled sensitivity 60% (9 studies; n = 1004) and pooled specificity 99% (10 studies; n = 9653). For IGRAs, pooled sensitivity of T-SPOT.TB was 90% (37 studies; n = 5367) with pooled specificity 95% to 97% (2 studies; n = 1664); for QFT-GIT, pooled sensitivity was 81% (48 studies; n = 7055) and pooled specificity 99% (3 studies; n = 2809); for QFT-Plus, pooled sensitivity was 89% (11 studies; n = 939) and pooled specificity 98% based on a single study (n = 211). Reliability studies suggest moderate to substantial agreement between 2 observers, with interrater reliability higher for IGRA and varying by manual vs automated reading.

### Tuberculosis testing and latent tuberculosis infection treatment practices among health care providers-United States, 2020–2022 [^112yT7L6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

CDC estimates that up to 13 million persons in the United States have latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Approximately 5%–10% of persons with LTBI in the United States who remain untreated will develop tuberculosis (TB) disease at some point in their lifetime. TB disease is infectious and can be fatal. In 2022, approximately three quarters (73%) of reported TB cases in the United States occurred among non–U.S.-born persons. The most common countries of birth among non–U.S.-born persons with TB have been China India, Mexico, Philippines, and Vietnam.* Efforts to eliminate TB in the United States include finding and treating persons with TB disease, expanding LTBI testing and treatment to prevent progression to TB disease, and addressing disparities among groups disproportionately experiencing impacts of TB. Since 1992, TB cases have generally decreased in the United States; however, ongoing TB prevention and control efforts are needed to continue this trend and achieve TB elimination in the United States (< 1 case per million persons annually).

Persons who were born in countries where TB disease is common are at increased risk for TB infection. In addition, many persons born outside the United States have received the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) TB vaccine. This vaccine is often given to infants and small children in countries where TB is common to decrease the risk for childhood TB meningitis and disseminated disease; however, it is not thought to prevent pulmonary TB disease in adolescents and adults, and protection wanes over time. Having previously received the BCG vaccine can cause a false-positive reaction to TB skin tests, leading to falsely diagnosing TB infection or conversely, misattributing a positive TB test result to childhood BCG vaccination, even though the patient does have TB infection. TB blood tests are not affected by previous BCG vaccination. When possible, CDC recommends that health care providers (HCPs) test persons at risk for TB using TB blood tests (interferon-gamma release assays), and if a diagnosis of LTBI is made, prescribe a short-course LTBI treatment regimen in preference to longer course 6- or 9-month isoniazid monotherapy. Persons at increased risk for TB infection should be tested for TB infection as part of routine health care. TB-related questions were added to the Porter Novelli DocStyles survey to assess HCP testing and treatment practices.

Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) management — benefits and risk — notes there are 2 major benefits of treating LTBI, preventing progression to active TB disease and producing public health benefits; patients with LTBI have a 4%–6% lifetime risk of developing TB disease, with approximately half of cases following recent exposure; in a trial of 28 000 individuals with LTBI and radiographic evidence of healed tuberculosis, isoniazid for 52 weeks reduced subsequent TB disease from 14.3% to 3.6%; overall, studies provide high-quality evidence of benefit in high-risk populations and only moderate-quality evidence for low or intermediate risk populations.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^115ZDKWJ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Added value of this study

To our knowledge, this is the largest and first adequately powered study in a country with a low incidence of tuberculosis where the risk of reinfection is low to provide evidence that the predictive value of IGRAs is less than estimated previously. Although we found no significant differences in negative predictive values between the two IGRAs and TST in head-to-head comparisons, we found differences in the proportion of participants who were classified as negative by these tests, and in the positive prediction of progression to active tuberculosis. A positive T-SPOT. TB result was a significantly better predictor of disease progression than all other tests, TST that accounted for BCG-vaccination status (TST-15) and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube were significantly better predictors of progression than TST-10 (with a 10 mm positive threshold), while a positive TST-5 result (5 mm positive threshold) was a significantly worse predictor of progression than all other tests. Additionally, we did subgroup analysis for migrants and contacts.

Implications of all the available evidence

Compared with the evidence in the WHO guidelines, among participants with positive IGRA results we found a decreased progression to active tuberculosis. This finding has implications for national and WHO policy and future recommendations. We provide evidence on which tests should be selected for the implementation of migrant testing for latent tuberculosis infection in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis and for contact investigation. We found substantial differences in TST performance when stratified by BCG-vaccination status, which is relevant to cost-effectiveness analysis and future guidelines.

Evaluating these tests requires cohort studies that assess individuals' IGRA and TST status at baseline with prospective follow-up to determine the predictive values of each test for the development of active tuberculosis. Systematic reviews, have highlighted heterogeneity and a paucity of relevant studies, particularly of head-to-head comparisons of different testing strategies in countries with a low incidence of tuberculosis where the risk of reinfection is low. Previous head-to-head comparisons have been relatively small scale (ie, 135–1335 participants), and most, have assessed only two testing strategies. To assess the prognostic value of tuberculosis testing kits, we did a head-to-head comparison of the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of tuberculosis as assessed by three different tests applied to the same individuals in a large prospective cohort of people who did not take preventive treatment.

Healthcare worker serial testing with interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) — variability and retesting: IGRAs have not proven to solve false-positive results in serial testing of low-risk individuals, and there is insufficient information to define conversion or reversion; reported findings include a QFT conversion rate of 12% and a reversion rate of 24%, and an IGRA conversion of 6%–8% with rates 6–9 times higher than TST. Multiple laboratory-related factors can cause variability around the cutoff, supporting the committee's recommendation that quantitative values be reported, and given varied sources of IGRA variability the committee thought that a positive test in a low-risk individual was likely to be a false-positive result and recommended repeat testing.

Latent tuberculosis infection testing in healthy children under 5 years — The guideline states: "We suggest performing a TST rather than an IGRA in healthy children < 5 years of age for whom it has been decided that diagnostic testing for LTBI is warranted (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence)". It adds, "In situations in which an IGRA is deemed the preferred diagnostic test, some experts are willing to use IGRAs in children over 3 years of age". Cautions note that, in young children, indeterminate IGRA results "range from 0 to 35%", that "an increased rate of indeterminate IGRA results in children < 5 years of age" has been reported, and that blood collection can be challenging because "phlebotomy is more difficult in young children" and "a relatively high incidence of failed phlebotomy has been documented in some studies".

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114w5QGB]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility Criteria and Data Analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

### Meta-analysis: new tests for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: areas of uncertainty and recommendations for research [^116mwske]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, the tuberculin skin test was the only test for detecting latent tuberculosis (TB) infection, but 2 ex vivo interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are now commercially licensed.

Purpose

To estimate sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of IGRAs (commercial or research versions of QuantiFERON [QFT] and Elispot) for diagnosing latent TB infection in healthy and immune-suppressed persons.

Data Sources

The authors searched MEDLINE and reviewed citations of all original articles and reviews for studies published in English.

Study Selection

Studies had evaluated IGRAs using Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific antigens (RD1 antigens) and overnight (16- to 24-h) incubation times. Reference standards had to be clearly defined without knowledge of test results. DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Specific criteria for quality assessment were developed for sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

Data Synthesis

When newly diagnosed active TB was used as a surrogate for latent TB infection, sensitivity of all tests was suboptimal, although it was higher with Elispot. No test distinguishes active TB from latent TB. Sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test and IGRAs was similar in persons who were categorized into clinical gradients of exposure. Pooled specificity was 97.7% (95% CI, 96% to 99%) and 92.5% (CI, 86% to 99%) for QFT and for Elispot, respectively. Both assays were more specific than the tuberculin skin test in samples vaccinated with bacille Calmette-Guérin. Elispot was more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test in 3 studies of immune-compromised samples. Discordant tuberculin skin test and IGRA reactions were frequent and largely unexplained, although some may be related to varied definitions of positive test results. Reversion of IGRA results from positive to negative was common in 2 studies in which it was assessed.

Limitations

Most studies used cross-sectional designs with the inherent limitation of no gold standard for latent TB infection, and most involved small samples with a widely varying likelihood of true-positive and false-positive test results. There is insufficient evidence on IGRA performance in children, immune-compromised persons, and the elderly.

Conclusions

New IGRAs show considerable promise and have excellent specificity. Additional studies are needed to better define their performance in high-risk populations and in serial testing. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the predictive value of IGRAs.

### IFN-γ-independent immune markers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure [^112RhCj2]. Nature Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Main

Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Exposure to Mtb leads to a spectrum of outcomes, including primary progressive disease and latent Mtb infection (LTBI). A diagnosis of LTBI is based on evidence of immune sensitization to Mtb antigens and the absence of clinical symptoms of tuberculosis (TB) or direct microbiologic evidence of disease. The clinical standards that establish evidence of Mtb exposure and infection include the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA). TST measures a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to purified protein derivative (PPD) from Mtb. The IGRA was developed to distinguish between bacille Calmette–Guèrin (BCG) vaccination and Mtb infection via the ex vivo measurement of T cell-produced IFN-γ to peptides from the Mtb proteins ESAT6 and CFP10.

A subset of healthy, immunocompetent individuals remain TST and IGRA negative despite persistent, high levels of exposure to Mtb. Highly Mtb -exposed but persistently TST and IGRA negative individuals have been described among healthcare workers, household contacts of patients with TB – and gold miners living and working in close quarters with individuals with active disease. These individuals have been dubbed 'resisters' related to their persistent ability to remain TST and IGRA negative. Initial studies seeking to define why these individuals continue to remain TST/IGRA negative despite high Mtb exposure identified two associated chromosomal loci. In addition, differences in transcriptional responses to Mtb infection were found in blood monocytes from these individuals compared with individuals who develop a positive TST after similar mycobacterial exposure. These innate signatures point to potentially unique, first-response immunity to Mtb. From the adaptive immune perspective, the persistent lack of TST and IGRA reactivity has been interpreted as suggesting that these individuals are uninfected despite long-term close-contact exposure. Another explanation could, however, be that the 'resister' phenotype reflects an alternative immune response to Mtb exposure and/or infection.

### Utility of the antigen-specific interferon-gamma assay for the management of tuberculosis [^116VkwgQ]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The tuberculin skin test, now over a century old, is prone to reader variability, and outcomes are influenced by cross-reactivity with environmental mycobacteria, previous bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination, and anergy in immunosuppressed individuals. More recently, T-cell-based interferon-gamma responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis - specific antigens have been investigated for their role in diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection.

Recent Findings

We review the evidence supporting the utility of the interferon-gamma assay for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in low-prevalence countries. We discuss the principle of the test, technical factors related to performance, and its utility in active tuberculosis, in specialised subgroups such as immunocompromised patients, and its applicability in developing countries.

Summary

Compared with the tuberculin skin test, the antigen-specific interferon-gamma assay, when used in a standardised protocol (overnight incubation assay using a combination of two antigens) for the diagnosis of LTBI, has greater specificity in BCG-vaccinated individuals, displays a stronger association with exposure, and is less biased by environmental mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium avium. Prospective studies are required, however, to confirm that treating LTBI, as defined by the interferon-gamma assay, will reduce the tuberculosis burden in low-prevalence countries and whether interferon-gamma responses are predictive of those who have a high risk of progression to active tuberculosis. Further studies are required to address the utility of the interferon-gamma assay in specialised subgroups of patients, in developing countries, and as a marker of disease activity.

### Absolute risk of tuberculosis among untreated populations with a positive tuberculin skin test or interferon-gamma release assay result: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113FJ4gW]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To determine the annual rate of tuberculosis development after a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay result (IGRA), or both, among untreated populations with characteristics believed to increase the risk of tuberculosis (at risk populations).

Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Data sources

Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials from 1 January 1990 to 17 May 2019, for studies in humans published in English or French. Reference lists were reviewed.

Eligibility criteria and data analysis

Retrospective or prospective cohorts and randomised trials that included at least 10 untreated participants who tested positive to tuberculosis antigens (contained in TST or IGRA, or both) followed for at least 12 months. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) and meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines, two reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed quality using a modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies (QUADAS-2) tool. Data were pooled using random effects generalised linear mixed models.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was tuberculosis incidence per 1000 person years among untreated participants who tested positive (TST or IGRA, or both) in different at risk subgroups. Secondary outcomes were the cumulative incidence of tuberculosis and incidence rate ratios among participants with a positive test result for latent tuberculosis infection compared with those with a negative test result in at risk subgroups.

Results

122 of 5166 identified studies were included. In three general population studies, the incidence of tuberculosis among 33 811 participants with a TST induration of ≥ 10 mm was 0.3 (95% confidence interval 0.1 to 1.1) per 1000 person years. Among 116 197 positive test results for latent tuberculosis infection in 19 different at risk populations, incidence rates were consistently higher than those in the general population. Among all types of tuberculosis contacts, the incidence of tuberculosis was 17.0 (95% confidence interval 12.9 to 22.4) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive IGRA result and 8.4 (5.6 to 12.6) per 1000 person years for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Among people living with HIV, the incidence of tuberculosis was 16.9 (10.5 to 27.3) for participants with a positive IGRA result and 27.1 (15.0 to 49.0) for participants with a positive TST result of ≥ 5 mm. Rates were also high for immigrants, people with silicosis or requiring dialysis, transplant recipients, and prisoners. Incidence rate ratios among test positive versus test negative participants were significantly greater than 1.0 in almost all risk groups, for all tests.

Conclusions

The incidence of tuberculosis is substantial in numerous at risk populations after a positive TST or IGRA result. The information from this review should help inform clinical decisions to test and treat for latent tuberculosis infection.

### The conundrum of prior bacille calmette-guerin vaccination in children of temporary residents in the United States [^1128hJvF]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of the most widely used vaccines throughout the world. Children of temporary residents in the United States frequently undergo tuberculin skin testing as part of their health maintenance visits. Management of those children with a positive skin test can lead to doctor-parent disagreements, because of differences in tuberculosis (TB) policies between the United States and other countries that routinely administer BCG vaccine. Two British specialists compare their approach with that of the United States. They also discuss the potential for specific diagnosis of latent TB infection with interferon-based TB diagnostic blood testing, to distinguish positive skin tests caused solely by BCG vaccination.

### Comparison of tuberculin skin testing and interferon-γ release assays in predicting tuberculosis disease [^111dPCN7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the relative performance of 3 clinically available tuberculosis (TB) tests in predicting TB disease development in the low-incidence setting of the US?

Findings

In this diagnostic study of 22 020 participants, 2 US-approved interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) demonstrated significantly superior performance in predicting progression to TB disease compared with the tuberculin skin test.

Meaning

These findings suggest that IGRAs should be used to guide clinical decisions on prevention of TB disease.

### Interferon-γ release assays for diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection: evidence in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders [^114XCsgc]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To provide a narrative synthesis of evidence on interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in individuals with immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs).

Recent Findings

Only a few studies have evaluated IGRAs in IMIDs, and most were small and varied considerably with respect to the use of immunosuppressive medications and types of IMIDs. Current evidence does not clearly suggest that IGRAs are better than tuberculin skin test (TST) in identifying individuals with IMID who could benefit from LTBI treatment. To date, no studies have been done on the predictive value of IGRAs in IMID patients. Important questions remain unanswered as to the impact of immunosuppressive medications and the impact of type of IMID on IGRA performance.

Summary

Despite the lack of clear evidence, there is an increasing tendency for guidelines to prefer IGRA over TST in IMIDs or to recommend both TST and IGRA to enhance sensitivity. We believe the use of either test is acceptable for LTBI screening. Clinicians could consider starting with IGRAs in individuals with a history of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination after infancy or with repeated BCG vaccinations. When the index of suspicion for LTBI is high, both IGRA and TST could be performed, especially prior to initiating TNF-α inhibitor therapy. Regardless of the test used, it is important to remember that in the face of immune-suppression, both IGRA and TST can be falsely negative and are thus only diagnostic aids - they will need to be interpreted with other clinical and risk factor data.

Indeterminate/invalid IGRA responses — outcomes, causes, and immediate actions: IGRAs have a trichotomous outcome yielding a positive, negative, or indeterminate result; indeterminate/invalid results can result from either a high background (nil) response or from a poor response to positive control mitogen; indeterminate results are associated with immunosuppression, although they may occur in healthy individuals; when a poor mitogen response may be due to performance issues such as collection/processing errors, incubator malfunction, or technical errors, it is reasonable to simply repeat the assay, whereas a persistently diminished mitogen response may reflect anergy.

Tuberculosis immunodiagnostics in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — test performance and timing are highlighted: Overall yield can be as low as 30% to 50% in pediatric patients; tuberculin skin test (TST) reading can be compromised if not performed and read by experienced personnel within 48 to 72 hours after placement; measles vaccine can temporarily suppress tuberculin reactivity for 4 to 6 weeks and TST testing is recommended on the same day as live immunizing vaccines or ≥ 4 weeks after vaccination; interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) are more specific at 90% to 100% compared with 56% for the TST when evaluating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); and the diagnosis of LTBI requires a positive immunodiagnostic test in an asymptomatic patient with a negative chest X-ray.

Screening frequency: The USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening for LTBI. In the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors; screening frequency could range from 1 time-only screening among persons at low risk for future TB exposure to annual screening among those who are at continued risk of exposure.

### Defining the role of cellular immune signatures in diagnostic evaluation of suspected tuberculosis [^113BM5eW]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

By virtue of their positive IGRA status, all individuals in this cohort had already been found to mount Mtb-specific T-cell responses. However, PPD antigen can also detect cross-reactive responses to Bacillus Calmette-Guérin in vaccinated individuals who are not infected with Mtb. Thus, we sought to compare signature performance after stimulation with either PPD or Mtb-specific peptides. The Mtb peptide stimulation was comparable to PPD stimulation for all signatures, with good correlation in results between the 2 stimuli and comparable diagnostic performance for all 6 signatures (Supplementary Figure 2); however, PPD stimulation generally resulted in a larger number of analyzable events (responsive T cells).

5.2.1.2.1 Tuberculosis

Statement 80. We recommend that prior to commencing anti-TNF therapy, IBD patients should be screened for tuberculosis (TB) using a combination of clinical risk stratification, chest x-ray and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.8%).

Screening for active or latent TB is essential prior to starting anti-TNF or other biologic therapy. A Dutch study suggested that screening rates for TB in IBD patients are high at 90–97%, with 3% latent prevalence. Tuberculin skin test is likely to have false-negative results due to immunosuppressive therapy, so interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) should be used. A high rate of anergy to skin-based antigen tests was shown by immunising 82 consecutive IBD patients against tuberculin (TST) or control antigens. In this study no TST result was positive, but 71% of patients failed to respond to any antigen. Importantly, 83% of patients on steroid or immunomodulator therapy were anergic versus 43% not on these therapies (p < 0.002). A retrospective study of TB screening in 340 patients in the United States with 512 Quantiferon TB Gold (QFT-G) IGRA tests reported 1.5% positivity, 2.7% indeterminate and 95.8% negativity. Only one case of tuberculosis reactivation occurred in 17 months of follow-up (0.3%). This patient had an indeterminate test and was on immunosuppressive therapy prior to testing. No significant difference was seen in positivity rates between those on immunosuppressive therapy and those not. Only moderate concordance was seen between TST and QFT-G in this study (kappa = 0.4152, p = 0.0041). IGRA tests were evaluated in 125 adult patients with IBD in London, 90 of whom were anti-TNF naïve, with 35 on established anti-TNF therapy.109 (87%) were BCG vaccinated. 98% IGRA tests were negative, 1% indeterminate and 2% positive. This method of screening was deemed cost-effective in comparison to the 2005 British Thoracic Society guideline. No subsequent cases of TB were reported with a median follow-up of 24 months. A Korean study examined newly developed TB cases in IBD patients on established anti-TNF therapy. They described 25 cases in total (84% pulmonary, 16% extrapulmonary), of whom 76% developed TB within 5 years of commencing anti-TNF despite previous negative screening for latent infection, and 12% developed reactivation of latent infection after 3 months of chemoprophylaxis. Primary infection with TB on anti-TNF agents is therefore a significant risk, particularly in higher incidence areas, irrespective of baseline screening.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 and other respiratory tract infections in older adults with comorbidities: a randomized controlled trial [^116cXYwe]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

The study BCG-PRIME was published by Eva L Koekenbier and colleagues in 2023 in the journal Clin Microbiol Infect. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the BCG-PRIME study, the trial question was: what is the role of BCG vaccine in older adults with underlying comorbidities? In the BCG-PRIME study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the BCG-PRIME study, the population was: 6112 patients (2275 female, 3837 male). The inclusion criteria were adults > 60 years of age with ≥ 1 underlying comorbidities and no contraindications for BCG vaccination. The key exclusion criteria were history of documented COVID-19; known history of a positive Mantoux or active tuberculosis; severely immunocompromised state; vaccination with a live vaccine in the past 4 weeks, or planned vaccination with a live vaccine during the next 4 weeks. In the BCG-PRIME study, the interventions were: n = 3058 BCG (0.1 mL of BCG vaccine via intradermal injection in the left upper arm) n = 3054 placebo (0.1 mL saline via intradermal injection in the left upper arm). In the BCG-PRIME study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in COVID-19 infection (4.2% vs. 3.8%; HR 1.12, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.44). In the BCG-PRIME study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in COVID-19-related hospitalization (0.6% vs. 0.7%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.61) No significant difference in clinically relevant respiratory tract infection (2.2% vs. 2.4%; HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.28) No significant difference in respiratory tract infection-related hospital admission (0.85% vs. 0.94%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.53). In the BCG-PRIME study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in death from all causes at 6 months. In the BCG-PRIME study, the conclusion was: in adults > 60 years of age with ≥ 1 underlying comorbidities and no contraindications for BCG vaccination, BCG was not superior to placebo with respect to a COVID-19 infection.

### Screening for latent tuberculosis infection in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^114jpv9Y]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Screening intervals for LTBI — the USPSTF found no evidence on the optimal frequency of screening; in the absence of evidence, a reasonable approach is to repeat screening based on specific risk factors, with frequency ranging from 1-time only screening among persons at low risk for future tuberculosis exposure to annual screening among those at continued risk of exposure.

### Screening for tuberculosis infection prior to initiation of anti-TNF therapy [^112tDeVx]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

T-cell interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are more specific and probably more sensitive than the tuberculin skin test (TST) for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) and suspected LTBI who are candidates for anti-TNF therapy are at a significant risk of TB reactivation yet are prone to false-negative TST results because they are already on immunosuppressive medications. The role of these new blood tests in this patient population is therefore of considerable interest but is currently unclear. The limited published evidence-base shows that agreement between IGRA and TST results is poor in patients with IMID compared to patients without IMID, due to lower proportions of TST-positive results in patients with IMID. Discordant TST-positive, IGRA-negative results are associated with prior BCG vaccination and discordant TST-negative, IGRA-positive results are associated with steroid therapy. Notably, positive IGRA results are more closely associated with the presence of risk factors for LTBI than TST. The percentage of indeterminate IGRAs can be up to 12%. IGRA results in patients already taking anti-TNF agents currently remain uninterpretable. Given the clinical imperative to prevent reactivation of TB in patients starting anti-TNF therapy, screening algorithms should maximise diagnostic sensitivity for detection of LTBI. Therefore, a positive result to either an IGRA or TST, in addition to currently recommended clinical screening for risk factors for LTBI, should prompt consideration of preventive treatment of LTBI in this population.

### Use of an interferon-gamma release assay to diagnose latent tuberculosis infection in foreign-born patients [^116gVjRP]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The tuberculin skin test (TST) has a low specificity in the setting of bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination. Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) appear to be more specific but have not been validated in this population under routine clinical conditions. We sought to validate the routine clinical use of the T-SPOT.TB test (Oxford Immunotec; Oxford, UK), an IGRA, in a predominantly foreign-born population with a high rate of BCG vaccination.

Methods

We compared the TST and the T-SPOT.TB test in 96 subjects at a New York City Department of Health tuberculosis clinic. We aimed to determine which test better predicted being a close contact of a case of active tuberculosis, a surrogate for latent tuberculosis infection.

Results

A positive T-SPOT.TB test result was strongly associated with being a close contact of a case of active tuberculosis after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted odds ratio, 2.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 7.3; p = 0.03). A positive TST result was associated with being a contact only in subjects without BCG vaccination (p = 0.02). The T-SPOT.TB test was more specific for being a close contact than the TST (p < 0.001). Specificity in BCG-vaccinated subjects was 3% for the TST compared with 70% for the T-SPOT.TB test (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The T-SPOT.TB test is superior in routine clinical use to the TST for identifying high-risk individuals among foreign-born populations with high rates of BCG vaccination.

### Latent tuberculosis: two centuries of confusion [^115FvKPB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

21st Century: Latent TB Refers to a Host Who Is TB Immunoreactive in the Absence of TB Disease

It is on this historical backdrop that at the tail end of the 20th century, latent TB acquired yet another new definition. This 21st-century definition of latent TB has circled back to the host (Table 1). However, in contrast to the 19th-century postmortem pathological diagnosis, it is now an antemortem immunological diagnosis. This new LTBI diagnosis requires a pertinent positive — TB immunoreactivity — and a pertinent negative — the absence of clinical manifestations. Each of these presents diagnostic quandaries.

Table 1.
Definitions of Latent Tuberculosis over Two Centuries

The TB immunoreactivity tests (TST and, more recently, IFN-γ release assays, or IGRAs) are neither 100% specific nor sensitive. A positive TST/IGRA cannot distinguish present infection from present disease, nor can it distinguish present from past infection. Several lines of evidence suggest that the majority of individuals thought to have LTBI have actually cleared their TB infection. Conversely, a negative TST/IGRA test is observed in 10–40% of HIV-negative individuals with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, and an even higher percentage of patients with miliary TB. Moreover, a new concept has emerged that recognizes people who have epidemiologic evidence of exposure without demonstrable T-cell–mediated immune responses to mycobacterial antigens, and such individuals would test negative. For these "resisters", there is evidence through alternative assays that infection has occurred despite the subject being TST/IGRA negative. In sum, the immunologic definition of infection overlooks people who are infected but do not manifest classical immunoreactivity yet includes people with immunoreactivity who have already cleared their infection (Table 2).

Table 2.
Tuberculous Infection versus Immunoreactivity

Regarding the pertinent negative — the absence of clinical manifestations — this term lends itself to different interpretations by clinicians and microbiologists. If clinical manifestations mean signs and symptoms, then individuals with subclinical TB (bacteriologically positive but negative on symptom screening) could be considered to have latent TB. Indeed, it is likely that some of the patients described by Laennec and Louis would have been sputum culture positive, had the test existed 2 centuries ago. If absence of clinical manifestations refers to a negative sputum culture, as suggested by others, TB is unique among bacterial infectious diseases in that the state of infection is diagnosed with a negative test for the microbe.

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^115EfvQA]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends preventive treatment in populations who are at risk for the development of tuberculosis (TB). Individuals who are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis without clinical manifestation, known as latent TB infection, are at risk for the development of TB. Two types of indirect diagnostics are recommended to detect individuals who might benefit from TB preventive treatment: purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA). In both, a simple dichotomization to positive and negative denotes probable infection or not, respectively. None are considered "gold standard tests for TB infection" since they measure immune sensitization to mycobacterial antigens and, consequently, they cannot differentiate current TB infection from past infection, as well as infection from disease.TST also lacks specificity for TB infection owing to cross-reactivity among individuals vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette−Guérin vaccines (BCG) or infected by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). IGRA, including T-SPOT.TB and QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube (QFT-GIT) or Plus (QFT-Plus), use M. tuberculosis -specific antigens, ESAT-6 and CFP-10. Thus, they are not affected by BCG or most NTM (other than Mycobacterium kansasii, marinum and szulgai) and are expected to increase the diagnostic specificity.

In head-to-head comparisons, previous meta-analyses using aggregated data suggest IGRA's increased specificity does not appear to confer greater prognostic ability to predict individuals who will progress from infection to disease than the TST. Despite IGRA's higher relative risk estimates for incident TB, confidence intervals were imprecise and overlapped. In addition, the higher relative risk estimates of IGRA was driven by studies with a high risk of incorporation where these were conducted in low-incidence resource-rich countries that had widely adopted the test and used positive IGRA results to trigger investigations of active TB only in test positives. These findings underpinned the initial policy on the use of IGRA for prediction of TB in low TB incidence countries, and later updates were used to inform global policy that recommends the use of either test interchangeably in all settings regardless of the background TB incidence.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111UPa3D]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Detection of latent TB infection (LTBI) in children with HIV — IGRA versus TST use: Among children < 15 years old with HIV, IGRAs and TSTs can be used to diagnose LTBI in children 5 years or older (strong, moderate), and when applicable, IGRAs are preferable for diagnosing LTBI in Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)–vaccinated people and those who are unlikely to return for interpretation of TST results (strong, moderate). CDC guidelines currently recommend TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children 2 to 5 years old, while some experts and the AAP Red Book recommend using IGRAs to diagnose LTBI in children ≥ 2 years old; however, younger age (< 5 years), HIV itself, and lower CD4 cell counts have been associated with indeterminate IGRA results (and false negative TST results). CDC guidelines and the AAP Red Book recommend TSTs for diagnosing LTBI in children < 2 years old (expert opinion). Diagnostic methods include the TST administered by the Mantoux method using 5 tuberculin units of an FDA-approved purified protein derivative, or an FDA-approved IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold, QuantiFERON-Plus, and T-SPOT.TB).

Diagnostic approach for suspected LTBI — principles — states that no definitive diagnostic test for LTBI exists; recommendations for diagnostic testing are based upon the likelihood of infection with Mtb and the likelihood of progression to TB disease if infected; and, given the lack of randomized or observational studies directly comparing diagnostic approaches with clinical outcomes, recommendations are based on evidence about test accuracy combined with evidence that treatment of LTBI improves clinical outcomes.

### The risk of falsely declaring noninferiority of novel latent tuberculosis treatment in large trials [^115JSm7S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors examined the impact of LTBI prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity of currently available proxy tests for LTBI, and the choice of noninferiority margins and other parameters on the design and interpretation of noninferiority trials. There is much debate about what constitutes "true" latent infection. A particular concern in noninferiority trials relates to the specificity of a test for LTBI and the prevalence of true LTBI in the study population.

A low prevalence of LTBI would mean that many individuals in the trial are not infected, which increases the risk of falsely declaring noninferiority. This modeling analysis suggests that without testing for LTBI, that risk is substantial when the LTBI prevalence is below 45%. When LTBI prevalence is less than 45%, it is still better to "enrich" the trial population for LTBI by enrollment based on LTBI tests. However, as the low specificity of the LTBI test would again result in low prevalence, more specific tests, such as IFN-γ release assays (IGRAs), should be used. Indeed, more broadly, the authors conclude that noninferiority trials evaluating regimens for treating LTBI should enroll participants based on IGRAs rather than on the PPD tuberculin skin test (TST), to decrease the risk of misclassifying ineffective regimens as noninferior. The conclusion that IGRAs are better than TSTs was predetermined by the assumption that the TST has a considerably lower specificity (59–70% for TSTs vs. 93–99% for IGRAs) in "standard practice" than IGRAs. These specificity estimates are derived from studies that used a TST cutoff of 5 mm for children and HIV-infected individuals in accordance with CDC recommendations — a sensible public health decision to ensure that few cases of LTBI are missed by maximizing sensitivity at the expense of specificity. However, trials do not have to use standard TST cutoffs. Previous studies suggested that it is possible to achieve very high specificity levels with the TST using higher thresholds. Indeed, at cutoffs of ≥ 15 mm, the TST's ability to predict subsequent TB is similar to that of IGRAs.

### Prognostic value of interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin test in predicting the development of active tuberculosis (UK PREDICT TB): a prospective cohort study [^112VeFJQ]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2018). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Tackling tuberculosis requires testing and treatment of latent tuberculosis in high-risk groups. The aim of this study was to estimate the predictive values of the tuberculin skin test (TST) and two interferon-γ release assays (IGRAs) for the development of active tuberculosis in high-risk groups — ie, people in recent contact with active tuberculosis cases and from high-burden countries.

Method

In this prospective cohort study, we recruited participants from 54 centres (eg, clinics, community settings) in London, Birmingham, and Leicester in the UK. Participants were eligible if they were aged 16 years or older and at high risk for latent tuberculosis infection (ie, recent contact with someone with active tuberculosis [contacts] or a migrant who had arrived in the UK in the past 5 years from — or who frequently travelled to — a country with a high burden of tuberculosis [migrants]). Exclusion criteria included prevalent cases of tuberculosis, and participants who were treated for latent tuberculosis after a positive test result in this study. Each participant received three tests (QuantiFERON-TB Gold-In Tube, T-SPOT. TB, and a Mantoux TST). A positive TST result was reported using three thresholds: 5 mm (TST-5), 10 mm (TST-10), and greater than 5 mm in BCG-naive or 15 mm in BCG-vaccinated (TST-15) participants. Participants were followed up from recruitment to development of tuberculosis or censoring. Incident tuberculosis cases were identified by national tuberculosis databases, telephone interview, and review of medical notes. Our primary objective was to estimate the prognostic value of IGRAs compared with TST, assessed by the ratio of incidence rate ratios and predictive values for tuberculosis development. The study was registered with, and is now complete.

Findings

Between May 4, 2010, and June 1, 2015, 10 045 people were recruited, of whom 9610 were eligible for inclusion. Of this cohort, 4861 (50.6%) were contacts and 4749 (49.4%) were migrants. Participants were followed up for a median of 2.9 years (range 21 days to 5.9 years). 97 (1.0%) of 9610 participants developed active tuberculosis (77 [1.2%] of 6380 with results for all three tests). In all tests, annual incidence of tuberculosis was very low in those who tested negatively (ranging from 1.2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 0.6–2.0 for TST-5 to 1.9 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1.3–2.7, for QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube). Annual incidence in participants who tested positively were highest for T-SPOT. TB (13.2 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 9.9–17.4), TST-15 (11.1 per 1000 person-years, 8.3–14.6), and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (10.1 per 1000 person-years, 7.4–13.4). Positive results for these tests were significantly better predictors of progression than TST-10 and TST-5 (eg, ratio of test positivity rates in those progressing to tuberculosis compared with those not progressing T-SPOT. TB vs TST-5: 1.99, 95% CI 1.68–2.34; p < 0.0001). However, TST-5 identified a higher proportion of participants who progressed to active tuberculosis (64 [83%] of 77 tested) than all other tests and TST thresholds (≤ 75%).

Interpretation

IGRA-based or BCG-stratified TST strategies appear most suited to screening for potential disease progression among high-risk groups. Further work will be needed to assess country-specific cost-effectiveness of each screening test, and in the absence of highly specific diagnostic tests, cheap non-toxic treatments need to be developed that could be given to larger groups of people at potential risk.

### Effect of BCG vaccination against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in adult Brazilian health-care workers: a nested clinical trial [^115eGXci]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

The study BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) was published by Paulo Cesar Pereira Dos Santos and colleagues in 2024 in the journal Lancet Infect Dis. This study is related to the following diseases: Pulmonary tuberculosis. In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of BCG vaccination for pulmonary tuberculosis in healthcare workers? In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the population was: 1985 patients (1475 female, 510 male). The inclusion criteria were adult healthcare workers in a population with a high incidence of tuberculosis. The key exclusion criteria were contraindications to BCG vaccination; > 1 month of treatment with specific tuberculosis treatment; previous adverse reactions to BCG; recent BCG vaccination; non-compliance with assigned interventions. In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the interventions were: n = 996 BCG vaccine (0.1 mL intradermal injection of BCG [Danish strain 1331]) n = 989 placebo vaccine (intradermal injection of 0.9% saline). In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus) conversion at 12 months (3.4% vs. 3.2%; RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.77). In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in sustained conversion (1.5% vs. 1.9%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.57) No significant difference in IGRA conversion with a positivity threshold ≥ 0.70 IU/mL (1.5% vs. 1.3%; RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.45) No significant difference in IGRA conversion with a positivity threshold ≥ 2.00 IU/mL (0.6% vs. 0.5%; RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.36 to 3.85). In the BRACE (pulmonary tuberculosis) study, the conclusion was: in adult healthcare workers in a population with a high incidence of tuberculosis, BCG vaccine was not superior to placebo vaccine with respect to a IGRA (QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus) conversion at 12 months.

### Predictive performance of interferon-gamma release assays and the tuberculin skin test for incident tuberculosis: an individual participant data meta-analysis [^113iZXmp]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and IPD meta-analysis following Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) guidance. The protocol for this review is registered on PROSPERO This study involved analyses of anonymised data from previously published cohort studies, with data pooling via a secure system. Ethical approvals for sharing of data were sought and obtained by contributors of individual participant data, where required. Data were stored in a data safe haven held by the University College London.

Eligibility criteria

We adapted the eligibility criteria from our previous systematic review that developed a multivariable model to predict the development of active TB, limited to low TB incidence countries (annual incidence ≤ 20/100,000 persons; PROSPERO CRD42018115357). The previous review included TST and IGRA results as model parameters but did not compare their predictive performance. For the present review, we included studies from low to high TB incidence settings which systematically tested participants with both TST and at least one commercially available IGRA (paired) and followed them for incident TB for the median follow-up duration of at least one year in any world region (Table S1 in the appendix).

Definitions

For the primary analysis, incident TB disease was defined as bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed TB as per study definitions. In the sensitivity analysis, we restricted to bacteriologically confirmed TB. We excluded cases of TB disease diagnosed within 42 days of enrolment, which were deemed cases of prevalent TB in line with the definition used previously. We explored alternative definitions of prevalent TB in sensitivity analyses (see below).

For TST, we explored multiple cut-off values: ≥ 5 mm (TST 5 mm), ≥ 10 mm (TST 10 mm), ≥ 15 mm (TST 15 mm), and BCG-stratified (TST 5/15 mm), which is ≥ 15 mm for BCG-vaccinees and ≥ 5 mm for unvaccinated. The results of QFT-GIT were defined as per its package insert. For T-SPOT.TB results, we classified "borderline positive" and "borderline negative" results as positive and negative, respectively, as previously. No studies reported data on QFT-plus. Indeterminate results were excluded for both QFT-GIT and TSPOT.TB.

### Clinical overview of latent tuberculosis infection… [^112MvpnN]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

People with latent TB infection:

- Have a small number of TB bacteria in their body that are alive but inactive Cannotspread TB bacteria to others
- Do notfeel sick, but may become sick if the bacteria in their bodies become active
- Usually have a positiveTB blood test or TB skin test results indicating TB infection
- Have typically normalchest radiographs
- Have negativesputum smears and cultures
- Should consider treatment for latent TB infection to prevent TB disease
- Do notrequire respiratory isolation. People with latent TB infection are at risk for TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB cases. Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease in the United States. Treatment for latent TB infection is effective for preventing TB disease. For Everyone: About Inactive Tuberculosis.

There are two types of tests that can determine if a person has been infected with TB bacteria:

- TB blood tests
- TB skin test TB blood tests measure the immune response to TB proteins in whole blood to determine if a person is infected with TB bacteria. Health care providers are encouraged to use newer TB blood tests to detect latent TB infection. TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome. The bacille Calmette-Guérin TB vaccine can cause a false positive TB skin test result. Unlike the TB skin test, TB blood tests are not affected by BCG vaccination. Routine testing with both TB blood and skin tests is not recommended. Consider these factors when determining which test to use.

TB blood test is the preferred method of testing for:

- People who have received the BCG vaccine
- People who might be less likely to return for TB skin test reading and interpretation. A diagnosis of latent TB infection is made if a person has a positive TB blood test or TB skin test result and a medical exam does not indicate TB disease. The diagnosis is based on information gathered from:

- Medical history,
- TB blood test or TB skin test,
- Chest radiograph,
- Physical examination, and
- Sputum examination.

### Treatment for latent tuberculosis infection… [^112tSutD]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points People with latent tuberculosis infection can be treated to prevent TB disease. CDC and the National Tuberculosis Coalition of America preferentially recommend short-course, rifamycin-based, 3- or 4-month latent TB infection treatment regimens. Overview Finding and treating people with latent TB infection is essential for controlling and eliminating TB disease. Treatment for latent TB infection prevents TB disease. For Everyone: Treating Inactive Tuberculosis. Treatment Considerations for Latent TB infection People with latent TB infection should be treated to prevent the development of TB disease. Progression from untreated latent TB infection to TB disease accounts for approximately 80% of U. S. TB cases. Do not start latent TB infection treatment until TB disease is excluded.

People with known risk factors for developing TB disease and have a positive TB blood test result, or a tuberculin skin test result should be given high priority for latent TB infection treatment. People with no known risk factors for TB may be considered for treatment of latent TB infection if they have either a positive IGRA result or if their reaction to the TB skin test is 15 mm or larger. Keep Reading: Tuberculosis Risk Factors. Three months of daily isoniazid and rifampin The 3HR regimen is recommended for:

- Children and adults of all ages who are HIV-negative
- People with HIV taking some combinations of antiretroviral therapy. Six months of daily isoniazid 6H is strongly recommended for adults and children of all ages who are HIV-negative. It is a treatment option for adults and children of all ages who are HIV-positive.

Nine months of daily isoniazid 9H is another treatment option for adults and children of all ages. Laboratory testing at the start of latent TB infection therapy is recommended for patients with any of the following factors:

- Liver disorders
- History of liver disease
- Regular use of alcohol or injection drugs
- Risks for chronic liver disease
- HIV infection
- Pregnancy or the immediate post-partum period.

### Clinical and laboratory diagnosis for tuberculosis… [^1126tdg9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease, or a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease.
- Latent TB infection is diagnosed if the person has a positive result from a TB blood test or skin test and a medical evaluation does not indicate TB disease.
- TB disease is diagnosed by medical history, physical examination, chest x-ray, and other laboratory tests, including culture. Considerations All persons with signs or symptoms of TB disease or a positive result from a TB blood test or tuberculin skin test should be medically evaluated for TB disease.
- Health care providers are encouraged to use TB blood tests to detect TB infection. TB blood tests are preferred for:

- People who have received the BCG vaccine and
- People who might be less likely to return for TB skin test reading and interpretation.
- People who have received the BCG vaccine and
- TB skin tests are an acceptable alternative in situations where a TB blood test is not available, is too costly, or is too burdensome.
- Current CDC guidelines recommend the TB skin test as the method of testing for children younger than 5 years of age. Normal findings on chest radiography generally can be used to rule out pulmonary TB in a person who has had a positive reaction to a TB blood test or TB skin test and no symptoms of disease. Rare exceptions have been noted in patients with HIV whose immune status has not been restored by anti-viral treatment. Examinations of clinical specimens are of critical diagnostic importance. The specimens should be examined and cultured in a laboratory that specializes in testing for.
- A n egative culturedoes not necessarily rule out TB disease.

Some patients with negative cultures are diagnosed with TB disease based on their clinical presentation. Specimen culture is important for TB genotyping, a laboratory-based approach used to analyze the genetic material of M. tuberculosis. TB genotyping results, when combined with epidemiologic data, help identify persons with TB disease involved in the same chain of recent transmission. Reporting cases Latent TB infection Some states and localities have developed legal reporting requirements for latent TB infection as a tool to prevent TB disease.
