## Question

A 42-year-old woman with recently diagnosed dermatomyositis presents for her 3-month follow-up. She reports ongoing muscle weakness and a persistent, pruritic rash. She also mentions difficulty sleeping and feeling 'down' most days. On review, you note she has gained weight since starting corticosteroids and expresses frustration about her appearance and fatigue. She has not previously discussed her mood or psychological wellbeing in detail.

Based on current guidelines, what steps should you take during this consultation regarding her psychological wellbeing and quality of life?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what steps should be taken during this consultation to assess and address psychological wellbeing and quality of life in a 42-year-old woman with dermatomyositis who reports sleep disturbance, low mood, fatigue, weight gain, and appearance concerns. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the guideline-backed imperative to routinely screen for psychological wellbeing and HRQoL. Then, I should verify which validated tools are appropriate for adults with IIM. Next, I will structure the clinical interview to elicit mood, sleep, fatigue, body image, and steroid-related psychosocial effects. After that, I need to interpret scores and decide on referral thresholds. Then, I will integrate management of disease-specific drivers that worsen HRQoL, including pruritus, steroid side effects, and functional limitations. Finally, I should outline follow-up cadence, documentation, and coordination with rehabilitation and mental health services, making sure each step aligns with evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the guideline imperative, because I need to ensure I'm not overstepping. The British Society for Rheumatology recommends that psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life be assessed routinely using age-appropriate tools in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, and that factors negatively impacting HRQoL — such as skin involvement, pruritus, and steroid adverse effects — be addressed proactively [^112yAqwQ] [^1143zyDW].

> Wait, let me verify the best tools to use in adults with IIM. The BSR guidance supports routine HRQoL assessment and notes that instruments like the SF-36 are adult-specific, while the OMERACT myositis working group has endorsed fatigue, pain interference, and physical function as mandatory patient-reported domains, with skin symptoms mandatory when relevant; the CDASI correlates with skin-specific QoL and can track clinically meaningful changes over time, which is useful for monitoring pruritic cutaneous disease in DM [^111FxcR1] [^111HXkP1] [^1115Nrup] [^113EkkHo].

> I will now examine how to structure the clinical interview so I don't miss key psychosocial domains. I should screen for mood and anxiety symptoms, sleep quality and duration, fatigue and its impact on activities, body image and self-esteem, and steroid-related psychosocial effects such as mood lability, irritability, and sleep disturbance; I also need to ask about social functioning, work or caregiving impacts, and perceived control or isolation, because these are repeatedly flagged as important in myositis mental health literature and patient-reported outcome frameworks [^11274BQ9] [^111HXkP1] [^115QeAef].

> Hold on, I should verify how to quantify symptoms. For mood, the PHQ-9 is reasonable for depression screening, and GAD-7 for anxiety, while the SF-36 provides a broad HRQoL profile; for pruritus and skin impact, I can use a numeric rating scale for itch and consider Skindex-16 or DLQI to capture dermatologic QoL, noting that CDASI changes of roughly 7–10 points map to meaningful QoL improvements in symptoms and emotions depending on baseline severity, which helps me interpret longitudinal change [^113EkkHo] [^1115Nrup].

> Next, I should review interpretation and referral thresholds. I need to check for PHQ-9 scores ≥ 10 or GAD-7 ≥ 8 as flags for probable depression or anxiety warranting referral, and I should also consider referral when sleep disturbance, fatigue, or body image distress are severe or function-limiting even if mood scales are subthreshold, because untreated mental health comorbidity worsens adherence and outcomes in IIM, and patients frequently under-report symptoms unless explicitly invited to discuss them [^11274BQ9] [^1142gujP].

> Let me consider disease-specific drivers that I must actively manage because they directly worsen HRQoL. Pruritus is a major, treatable contributor to poor sleep and mood in DM, so I should intensify cutaneous therapy and consider options like antimalarials, methotrexate, mycophenolate, IVIG, or rituximab for refractory skin disease, while also using topical corticosteroids and photoprotection; I should confirm that steroid toxicities are being mitigated via taper planning and steroid-sparing agents, and address functional limitations with PT/OT to improve independence and self-image [^111FxcR1] [^112nnvjp] [^114zheXn] [^11151mRK] [^111wegLH].

> But wait, what if steroid-induced mood or sleep changes are prominent? I should double-check for steroid-related neuropsychiatric effects and coordinate a taper strategy with close monitoring, because guidelines emphasize tapering prednisolone to the lowest effective dose and using DMARDs to reduce steroid exposure; I also need to monitor for hypertension, hyperglycemia, sleep disturbance, and mood changes as part of routine steroid surveillance, and document these at each visit [^111VYheS] [^115QeAef].

> I need to ensure I don't overlook nonpharmacologic interventions that meaningfully improve wellbeing. Individually tailored exercise and rehabilitation are recommended to improve psychological wellbeing across disease activity levels, and I should refer to physical and occupational therapy for strength, function, and ADLs; for mental health, I should offer referral to psychology for CBT-based interventions, consider mindfulness or acceptance-based approaches, and provide education on sleep hygiene and fatigue pacing, aligning with patient preferences and access [^111FxcR1] [^116gVhTu].

> Next, I should review follow-up cadence and documentation. Given persistent symptoms, reassessing mood, sleep, fatigue, and skin-related QoL every 3 months is reasonable, with earlier checks if new psychosocial stressors arise; I should document baseline scores, track changes, and communicate with the multidisciplinary team, including dermatology, rheumatology, PT/OT, and mental health, to coordinate care and avoid fragmented messaging [^111FxcR1].

> Hold on, I should verify that my plan addresses equity and patient-centeredness. Patients with rare autoimmune diseases often report feeling unheard when psychosocial needs are not addressed, so I should explicitly invite discussion of emotional health, validate experiences, and offer practical resources; where access is limited, I should consider tele-mental health options and connect with patient organizations for peer support and education, recognizing that unmet mental health needs are common in IIM and that early intervention can improve adherence and outcomes [^1142gujP] [^11274BQ9].

> In summary, I should confirm that my approach is guideline-concordant and measurable: screen routinely with validated tools, elicit psychosocial impacts in a structured interview, quantify symptoms with appropriate instruments, refer when thresholds or functional impact warrant it, aggressively treat disease-specific drivers like pruritus and steroid toxicities, embed rehabilitation and nonpharmacologic mental health supports, and reassess periodically with documented outcomes and coordinated multidisciplinary care [^112yAqwQ] [^111FxcR1] [^111HXkP1] [^1115Nrup].

(xii) How should quality of life and mental wellbeing be assessed and treated in people with IIM?

1 -Psychological wellbeing and psychiatric comorbidities should be assessed (1, C, 92%).

2 -Psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life should be routinely assessed using an age-appropriate tool (1, B, 100%).

3 -Factors negatively impacting upon health-related quality of life (e.g. skin involvement, pruritis, steroid adverse effects) should be addressed (1, C, 96%).

4 - Paediatric-specific. Factors negatively impacting upon health-related quality of life in children include pain, muscle weakness, and poor sleep, and should be managed appropriately (1, C, 95%).

5 -Individually tailored exercise and/or rehabilitation should be encouraged across all ranges of disease activity with the aim of improving psychological wellbeing (1, B, 96%).

6 -Where relevant, targeted exercises given by a specialist physiotherapist and/or a specialist occupational therapist to improve grip strength should be considered, due to the negative impact of poor grip strength on activities of daily living and quality of life (2, C, 96%).

Significant deficits are evident in measures of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in both adult and juvenile-onset IIM. Evidence suggests a number of IIM-specific factors that can negatively impact HRQoL, such as active disease, increased functional impairment, and decreased muscle strength. HRQoL can be assessed using tools such as the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ-50) and the 36-Item Short Form Survey (adult-specific). Minimizing functional impairment via specialist physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy should be considered. Screening for concerns such as low mood and anxiety, and offering psychological interventions as early possible where needed can be considered.

(xiii) What IIM management considerations should be made for certain ethnic groups?

1 -Ethnicity is to be considered when assessing patients; clinical manifestations, associated autoantibodies, and underlying risk factors may vary according to ethnicity (2, C, 96%).

Ethnic minority groups appear to be at increased risk of anti-signal recognition particle (anti-SRP) autoantibody-related disease, increased cardiovascular risk, and more at risk of juvenile polymyositis/juvenile connective tissue myopathy. Calcinosis rates are higher in black children with JDM in North American and South African cohorts.

There have been important developments in defining cutaneous lupus erythematosus and dermatomyositis. The skin manifestations of these two diseases have a profound impact on QOL, with both emotional and symptomatic impacts that are important to address. The proliferation of potential therapeutic targets has made it important to make sure that these diseases are defined in a way that they can be included in translational and clinical studies of both localized and systemic forms of the diseases. There are now validated disease tools and QOL studies that are facilitating current and future scientific and therapeutic developments.

Psychological and emotional well-being are critical aspects of overall health for individuals with chronic rheumatologic conditions. Mental health-related literature, however, predominantly focuses on systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis, with limited emphasis on idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs). High proportions of those with juvenile myositis report psychological distress at levels warranting mental health referral. Adults with dermatomyositis diagnosed with depression or anxiety do not receive adequate mental health care. Mental health symptoms in those with IIMs are associated with worse health-related quality of life, medication adherence, and disease outcomes. Despite demonstrated high rates of mental health burden, access to mental health care remains severely lacking. Data related to mental health burden is limited by small sample size, limited generalisability, variable methods of assessment, and inconsistent diagnosis codes to define mental health conditions. Additional research is needed to validate current screening tools in myositis populations. Other relevant measurable factors include disease severity, non-health- and health-related trauma exposure, loneliness, isolation, loss of control, sleep difficulties, fatigue, pain, self-esteem, body image, sexual health, and health inequities. Studiesare needed investigating the efficacy of therapeutic and pharmacologic interventions among patients with myositis who experience depression and anxiety. Currently, knowledge and resources are limited around mental health burden and potential intervention for those living with IIMs. The Myositis International Health & Research Collaborative Alliance (MIHRA) Psychological Impact Scientific Working Group offers a preliminary road map to characterise and prioritise the work ahead to understand baseline mental health burden and compare avenues for intervention.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis: what comes next? Long-term outcomes in childhood myositis from a patient perspective [^113tifhL]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

At the time of this study, specific questions on mental health status, such as if young people were suffering from depression or anxiety (either self-reported or diagnosed) were not addressed. Since this time, the impact of chronic disease on mental health status has increasingly been recognised, but this has not specifically been addressed in this study. We recognise that mental health comorbidities may influence responses given to questions in the SF-36 and study questionnaire.

A further limitation of this study is that the study questionnaire relying on perceived disease activity, which was not validated by a face-to-face consultation at that time. It is possible that perceived muscle weakness for example may be impacted by several factors including cardiorespiratory fitness, endurance, physical disability, or psychological wellbeing. However, the fact that over one-third of patients reported muscle weakness at the time of the questionnaire is comparable to other studies that demonstrate impaired muscle strength and cardiorespiratory fitness compared to healthy controls many years after the diagnosis of JDM.

A 62-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with malaise, lethargy and proximal muscle weakness. She had a similar presentation in childhood. A muscle biopsy was inconclusive, however, she was treated for a presumptive diagnosis of inflammatory myositis. In a second flare in childhood, she developed proximal muscle weakness and calcinosis cutis. A muscle biopsy was consistent with juvenile dermatomyositis. She was treated with corticosteroids, however, she relapsed again 1 year later, requiring a prolonged course of corticosteroids, which led to remission and treatment was subsequently stopped. She remained well for 30 years without any relapses, however, at the age of 40 she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, treated with local excision and radiotherapy. She had a further period of 22 years in good health, until her current presentation, with a relapse of dermatomyositis, 52 years after the last flare. She is currently in remission following successful immunosuppressive therapy.

Regarding medical management for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, BSR 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate high-dose corticosteroids as induction therapy in patients with active muscle inflammation at time of treatment. Administer oral prednisolone at a dose of 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, usually 40–60 mg.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis: what comes next? Long-term outcomes in childhood myositis from a patient perspective [^1131o7x1]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

This important aspect was not addressed specifically at the time of this study. The SF-36 captured limited questions on the impact of emotional health on activities and energy. The bespoke questionnaire designed for this study asked if young people were under the care of other medical specialists and asked them to list medications, but did not specifically ask if they have sought access to counselling or psychology services, or if they had received treatment for anxiety or depression. We acknowledge that the presence of comorbidities such as depression or mental health issues may impact responses to the SF-36 and questionnaire.

It is now well recognised that inclusion of the patient perspective in healthcare is crucial not only to inform research priorities, but also to improve patient management and outcomes. Patient-reported outcomes have been infrequently documented in children with inflammatory myopathies, particularly in long-term follow-up. Our study helps to address this gap, by combining long-term follow-up data with current patient perceptions, and has shown high reported rates of persistently active disease in this sub-group of adolescents and young adults and that this affects all facets of life.

There were also high reported rates of current medication use and muscle disease in questionnaire responders, thus indicating flare of or persisting muscle disease in longer-term follow-up. In explanation of this, we cannot exclude responder bias, and we cannot verify patient-reported outcomes; however, patient-physician discordance in disease activity is well documented not just for JDM, but also in other paediatric and adult rheumatic diseases. In published studies, patient reports of disease activity are often higher than those of physicians. The discrepancy may be due to physician focus on objective measures of treatment response versus the patient focus on subjective experience of pain, disability or quality of life, which can lead to worse clinical and patient-reported outcomes. It would be useful to invite questionnaire responders for face-to-face clinical assessments to confirm their disease activity from a physician perspective.

### Dermatomyositis [^1156SqA1]. Clinics in Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis is one of the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. It is characterized clinically by progressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness and a characteristic rash. There are patients with rash who have little or no muscle disease. Although the process primarily attacks the skin and the muscles, it is a systemic disease with frequent manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract and pulmonary system. Dermatomyositis has been linked to internal malignancy in somewhere between 15% and 25%. Therapy for the muscle disease includes systemic corticosteroids with or without an immunosuppressive agent. Therapy of the skin disease begins with photoprotection and topical corticosteroids, but also includes the use of antimalarial agents and immunomodulatory therapies.

Over the course of 6 to 8 weeks of therapy, the effectiveness of the treatment is clinically observed for improved muscle strength and cutaneous symptom alleviation. Typically, a decrease in Creatine kinase levels is first observed throughout the healing process, followed by a more gradual return of muscle strength. The prednisone dose can be reduced once clinical improvement is seen. In connecting the patient's history with clinical indicators, our case study emphasises the importance of clinical judgement. A multidisciplinary strategy combining family doctors, rheumatologists, dermatologists, and medical oncologists is crucial for the management of JDM.

### Dermatomyositis [^117Hph1J]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy with characteristic skin manifestations. Although the disorder is rare, with a prevalence of one to 10 cases per million in adults and one to 3.2 cases per million in children, early recognition and treatment are important ways to decrease the morbidity of systemic complications. An association with other connective tissue disorders (overlap syndrome) and malignancy make this diagnosis particularly important to primary care physicians. Patient management includes careful evaluation for underlying malignancy and liberal use of physical therapy, antihistamines, sunscreen and oral corticosteroids. Poor prognostic indicators include poorly responsive disease, delay in diagnosis and the presence of malignancy. The therapeutic goal is to maintain function and prevent or minimize sequelae.

### Cutaneous symptoms of dermatomyositis significantly impact patients' quality of life [^111WSwYr]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Dermatomyositis affects visible skin and causes disease symptoms that can affect patients' quality of life (QOL).

Methods

In all, 71 patients with dermatomyositis or dermatomyositis sine myositis completed two QOL measures (the Skindex-16 and the Dermatology Life Quality Index) and a visual analog scale for pruritus. Disease severity was assessed by Physician's Global Assessment.

Results

The mean Dermatology Life Quality Index score was 10.7 and the mean Skindex-16 score was 51.1. Itching contributed to impact on both the Dermatology Life Quality Index and Skindex-16. Females reported worse QOL.

Limitations

The effect of treatment on quality of life was not assessed in these analyses.

Conclusion

QOL impairment in dermatomyositis is greater than in other skin conditions including psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. Pruritus is an important treatable factor that significantly impacts QOL for patients with dermatomyositis.

### Refractory dermatomyositis responsive to anifrolumab [^115w1xLH]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 43-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer and pruritic rashes of the face, hands, and torso ongoing for a few years presented with worsening skin disease, including newer involvement of the eyelids and scalp. There was now associated fatigue, proximal muscle weakness, and joint stiffness. Ductal breast carcinoma had been diagnosed 2 years earlier — with lung and lymph node metastases occurring a year later — which had been treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, resulting in largely stable nonprogressive disease that was being managed palliatively. On examination, there were violaceous patches and plaques typical of DM: on the face, including a heliotrope discoloration of the eyelids; on the fingers, with Gottron papules; and characteristic lesions on the chest, back, lateral aspect of the hips and thighs (Fig 1, A and B). Ragged cuticles and periungual telangiectasias were also present. Punch biopsies of the dorsal aspect of the hand and upper portion of the back demonstrated a vacuolar dermatitis consistent with DM. Creatine kinase was mildly elevated at 202 U/L (ref 9–185); myositis antibody testing was positive for transcriptional intermediary factor 1-gamma at 34 U (ref < 20 U) (Labcorp). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated mild edema-like signals of thigh muscles compatible with myositis.

### The treatment and prognosis of dermatomyositis: an updated review [^116gPTjM]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. The mainstay of treatment for DM is oral corticosteroids. However, the dose and length of treatment is debated. Adding to the confusion, there have been no randomized controlled studies comparing the use of various corticosteroid doses and taper rates, and no controlled long-term studies assessing the hypothesis that, unlike systemic lupus erythematous, patients with DM can often achieve long-term remission off therapy. This literature review supports an approach that prednisone should be started at about 1 mg/kg/d, which is then tapered slowly based on the response. As patients respond differently to prednisone, additional therapies may be necessary. When to initiate these therapies requires clinical judgment. In addition, as we learn more about the pathophysiology of DM, newer medications that target specific mechanisms in the immune response may help us better treat the disease. Evidence-based data with long-term follow-up will allow for selection of the best treatment to maximize long-term remission, not simply short-term lowering of the systemic corticosteroid dose.

Patient 3 is a 50-year-old woman with dermatomyositis diagnosed after presenting with heliotrope rash and violaceous erythema of the chest, upper back, and arms accompanied by symmetric proximal muscle weakness with elevated serum creatinine kinase and aldolase levels. She was initially treated with hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, and prednisone; however, her disease was minimally responsive to therapy. Fig 3, A and B show persistent involvement of the upper back, chest, and arms. Routine malignancy screening was up to date and negative. About 6 months after dermatomyositis diagnosis, despite a recent normal mammogram, she noticed a lump on self–breast exam, and subsequent workup confirmed invasive ductal breast carcinoma. Dermatomyositis treatment was discontinued. She underwent a double mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Following chemo-radiation, her skin was completely clear. She remained symptom free for about 2 years; however, she then presented with an itchy rash on her face and upper back and myalgia of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. Complete metastatic workup was negative for recurrent breast cancer. She was given a steroid taper and subsequently resumed hydroxychloroquine. She has been doing well for the last 3 years.

Theme 4: support to live well: core care or an added extra?

One of the difficulties participants described in relation to managing their health was that it did not feel legitimate to talk about emotional health during consultations and interactions with health professionals, despite the significant impact of their RAIRD on their lives.

The understanding was that health professionals needed to prioritize the physical health agenda, but that meant participants had few opportunities to talk about their wellbeing or to access mental health and psychological support. In their experience, a holistic or whole person approach was rarely part of their core care.

'the last thing they [Drs] want to hear is you saying, I don't want you to feel my joints, or test my leg strength, I want to talk about the social impact, what this has done to my life, and ways I can, you know, help improve it, they absolutely do not want to talk about that' (M, inflammatory myositis, age 60–70 years)

These data suggest that there are assumptions, possibly on the part of both patients and health professionals, about which issues it is appropriate to raise. There is potential here for agenda setting and explicit invitations to discuss wellbeing as part of core care.

'I get 15 minutes to talk about everything to do with my lung disease and my muscle weakness and my heart condition… so I don't want to be getting into this stuff about how incredibly fatigued I am, the destruction of my life that this condition has brought about… but then where does it go? I just don't, there isn't anywhere to take it' (F, inflammatory myositis, age 30–40 years)

' 12½ years of having a long-term condition, not once has any medical professional said to me, how are you really? Are you having difficulty coping mentally? ' (F, SD, age 60–70 years)

### Management of cutaneous dermatomyositis [^116QeGMg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is traditionally classified as an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy distinguished by muscle weakness and characteristic cutaneous findings. Patients presenting with the skin manifestations in the absence of clinical evidence of muscle weakness are categorized as clinically amyopathic DM. The symptoms associated with the cutaneous findings can be particularly debilitating, and a discordant response to therapy exists between muscle and skin disease. Various therapeutic agents and treatment approaches have been described, both for the cutaneous and extracutaneous manifestations; however, a paucity of controlled studies in this disease leads to limitations in interpreting the available data. In this review, emphasis is placed specifically on summarizing the current literature regarding management of cutaneous DM. In addition, an algorithmic approach to treatment of skin disease is presented.

### Patient-reported outcomes in myositis [^112RpEds]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) impact patients' lives in diverse and complex ways beyond their muscle weakness. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which directly measure patients' daily experience with IIM without interpretation of care providers, are crucial to assess the real-world impact of IIM. The OMERACT Myositis Working Group has been working on developing a core domain set of PROs with respective measurement instruments for use in clinical trials and routine clinical care. The newly defined core domain set includes fatigue, pain interference, and physical function. Integrating PROs into practice may improve patient-provider communication and support shared decision-making in IIM management.

Applicability and utility

Supplementary Fig. S2 (available at Rheumatology online) shows an overview of recommendations. There should be no barriers to implementation in the UK. Use of the audit tool (Supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online) is encouraged.

This guideline highlights the limited high-quality evidence base available for IIM, with relative absence of RCTs or head-to-head comparison of treatments. Recommendations are therefore predominantly based on observational studies. Controlled trials are crucial to further evaluate promising treatments. Long-term outcomes especially related to cardiovascular or cerebrovascular risks needs better definition. Impact of IIM on mental health and quality of life should not be underestimated. Patients and carers should be fully integrated in defining priorities for future IIM research.

### Evaluating important change in cutaneous disease activity as an efficacy measure for clinical trials in dermatomyositis [^1115Nrup]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients may experience improved quality of life (QoL) without complete clearance of skin disease. The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index Activity (CDASI-A) score correlates with the Symptoms and Emotions subscales of Skindex-29, a measure of QoL, down to CDASI-A scores of 7 points (for Symptoms) and 10 points (for Emotions).

Objectives

Our goal was to define an important change in disease activity, as measured by the CDASI-A, that results in a meaningful change in QoL in patients with dermatomyositis.

Methods

In 103 patients, we assessed the percentage change and actual change in CDASI-A scores needed to achieve a meaningful improvement in QoL, using linear regression models.

Results

We found that meaningful improvement correlates with 7.86 points (P < 0.001) in Symptoms, and 10.29 points (P < 0.001) in Emotions, after correlating Skindex-29 to an established definition of meaningful change in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). For patients with initial CDASI-A scores > 14 points, a 40% change in CDASI-A between the first two visits suggests a meaningful change in Skindex-29. In patients with moderate initial CDASI-A (15–26 points), the changes in CDASI-A resulting in meaningful changes in Symptoms and Emotions were 6 points (P < 0.001) and 7 points (P < 0.001), respectively. For initial CDASI-A scores in the severe range (27–35 points), an improvement in CDASI-A by 11 points (P = 0.030) and 9 points (P = 0.021) leads to a meaningful change in Symptoms and Emotions, respectively.

Conclusions

In patients with an initial CDASI-A score > 14 points, a 40% change in the CDASI-A score can be used to indicate a meaningful change in QoL in future dermatomyositis trials. What's already known about this topic? The Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) is a validated disease assessment tool used to capture the extent of cutaneous activity and damage. The Skindex-29 and Dermatology Life Quality Index are standardized and validated measures of quality of life (QoL) for clinical trials and correlate with CDASI Activity (CDASI-A) scores. What does this study add? We identified what change in Skindex-29 scores over two consecutive visits would indicate an important change (a minimal clinically important difference) in QoL. We determined which change in CDASI-A scores over two consecutive visits would lead to a meaningful change in QoL. For patients with an initial CDASI-A score > 14 points, a 40% change in the CDASI-A score over two visits is associated with a meaningful change in QoL. What are the clinical implications of this work? Clinical trials can consider using a 40% change in the CDASI-A score as an end point when assessing the clinical efficacy of drugs.

### Understanding the role of type I interferons in cutaneous lupus and dermatomyositis: toward better therapeutics [^112sLQzV]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old female presented to a rheumatology-dermatology clinic with a pruritic rash that began 6 months prior, after a viral illness. She had previously been diagnosed with eczema and treated with antihistamines and topical steroids without improvement. She also noted fatigue, hair loss, and severe scalp pruritus. Physical examination was notable for violaceous periorbital edema, scaly erythematous papules on the metacarpophalangeal joints of bilateral hands, dilated capillaries of the proximal nail folds, scaly plaques on bilateral elbows, and excoriated erythematous plaques on upper chest, back and hips. The patient reported no muscle weakness, and strength testing and creatinine phosphokinase were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thigh showed no evidence of inflammation or edema. Antibody testing was negative. A diagnosis of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis was made. Computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, colonoscopy, and mammogram showed no evidence of cancer. The patient was initiated on methotrexate. Her cutaneous manifestations persisted with debilitating intractable pruritus, and thus, she was transitioned to mycophenolate mofetil, again with minimal improvement. Intravenous immunoglobulin was not approved by insurance given the lack of muscle involvement in her disease. This patient's case highlights a common clinical scenario in rheumatology and dermatology and raises several important issues related to the immunologic underpinnings of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and dermatomyositis (DM): What is the role of type I interferon (IFN) in triggering skin disease in CLE and DM? What is the role of IFN in the pathogenesis of skin inflammation in CLE and DM? Can we apply what we know about IFN-targeted therapeutics in CLE and DM to develop better treatments for skin disease?

Case report

Patient 1

Patient 1 is a 57-year-old woman with a long-standing history of classic dermatomyositis diagnosed 16 years ago. The patient initially presented with the characteristic rash of dermatomyositis: heliotrope sign, V-sign with poikiloderma over the chest, shawl sign on the back, and proximal nailfold with ragged cuticles and capillaries looping. She also had violaceous patches and plaques over the extensors, scalp pruritus, scale, and proximal muscle weakness. Skin biopsy done over the chest found diffuse mucin in the dermis with mixed perivascular and lichenoid lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates consistent with dermatomyositis.

Laboratory work up was significant for elevated levels of creatine kinase (CK) and aldolase. No underlying malignancy was found. Systemic steroids were initiated as well as hydroxychloroquine. She developed a pruritic eruption secondary to hydroxychloroquine. This treatment was discontinued, and over the next years she continued to be steroid dependent despite adequate trials of multiple immunosuppressive agents, including mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, acitretin, intravenous immunoglobulin, tacrolimus, chlorambucil, infliximab, and rituximab. Chronic steroid use resulted in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus as well as other steroid-associated side effects. Her disease continued to flare despite these therapies with a cutaneous dermatomyositis activity and severity index (CDASI) score of 43. Severe cutaneous disease is defined by a CDASI score of more than 14. Although she was on stable doses of mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone, apremilast given at 30 mg orally twice daily was added to her treatment regimen. Steroids and steroid-sparing agents were kept at a stable dose for the first 3 months. The patient had follow-up 1 month after apremilast initiation and every 3 months thereafter. One month into her treatment, she noticed significant improvement of her skin disease and then clearance after 3 months of apremilast with a CDASI score of 0. Her muscle weakness lagged behind and she noticed improvement after 9 months of being on apremilast with normalization of her aldolase and CK. The patient weaned off all immunosuppressive agents and prednisone and continues on apremilast as monotherapy. The patient experienced mild nausea and diarrhea with apremilast that improved 4 weeks into the treatment. She was able to discontinue insulin and lose weight and she continues to be clear of both skin and muscle symptoms on apremilast for more than 2 years.

Despite the treatment, in contrast to improvement in her muscle symptoms, the heliotrope rash of her eyelids persisted. After several years, the patient developed multiple limited skin retraction lesions with hyperpigmentation on both lower limbs. Palpation of these lesions revealed dry, cold and very firm skin on both thighs and calves, particularly in the distal areas. X-ray and ultrasound imaging of the calves showed multiple subcutaneous calcifications in the distal muscles.

### Update on outcome assessment in myositis [^112h1aSz]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2018). Medium credibility.

The adult and juvenile myositis syndromes, commonly referred to collectively as idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs), are systemic autoimmune diseases with the hallmarks of muscle weakness and inflammation. Validated, well-standardized measures to assess disease activity, known as core set measures, were developed by international networks of myositis researchers for use in clinical trials. Composite response criteria using weighted changes in the core set measures of disease activity were developed and validated for adult and juvenile patients with dermatomyositis and adult patients with polymyositis, with different thresholds for minimal, moderate and major improvement in adults and juveniles. Additional measures of muscle strength and function are being validated to improve content validity and sensitivity to change. A health-related quality of life measure, which incorporates patient input, is being developed for adult patients with IIM. Disease state criteria, including criteria for inactive disease and remission, are being used as secondary end points in clinical trials. MRI of muscle and immunological biomarkers are promising approaches to discriminate between disease activity and damage and might provide much-needed objective outcome measures. These advances in the assessment of outcomes for myositis treatment, along with collaborations between international networks, should facilitate further development of new therapies for patients with IIM.

### Juvenile dermatomyositis: what comes next? Long-term outcomes in childhood myositis from a patient perspective [^113EHEvT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Childhood idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are rare disorders, with an annual incidence of 1.9–4.0 million children per year. Answering questions from parents and patients regarding long-term outcomes is difficult, not only because of the rarity of these conditions, but also because physicians often lose contact with patients when they transition from paediatric to adult services. Most previous studies investigating long-term outcomes in these patients have used cross-sectional clinical review with retrospective case-note data acquisition. In addition, few have investigated patient-reported outcomes. Knowledge of patient-reported long-term outcomes by studying a prospective patient cohort is important as it will facilitate refinement of current treatment algorithms and help provide better care in this patient group.

### A pilot trial of rituximab in the treatment of patients with dermatomyositis… [^1156tWnK]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Disposition of patients. Objective assessments in patients with dermatomyositis after rituximab therapy. A, CD19+ B-cell counts. B, Manual Muscle Test scores. C, Creatine phosphokinase levels in 4 patients who had elevated baseline levels. D, Dermatomyositis Skin Severity Index scores. Background Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disease that is associated with muscle and skin inflammation. Using quantitative scales, we sought to evaluate the effects of rituximab therapy on muscle strength and skin disease in patients with dermatomyositis. Observations. An open-label trial of rituximab therapy was conducted in 8 adult patients with dermatomyositis. Patients received 2 infusions of rituximab 2 weeks apart without peri-infusional steroids.

The primary outcome was partial remission at week 24, or skin disease. After the first infusion of rituximab, all patients achieved sustained depletion of peripheral B cells. One patient withdrew at week 16 owing to a lack of treatment efficacy. Three patients achieved partial remission at week 24, in each case by improvement in muscle strength. Muscle enzyme levels and skin scores at week 24 were not significantly changed from those at baseline. Rituximab infusions were well tolerated, with no serious infectious complications. One patient died of metastatic cancer 9 months after his last infusion. Conclusion Depletion of peripheral B cells had modest effects on muscle disease and limited effects on skin disease in our cohort of patients with dermatomyositis.

Rituximab therapy has been reported to normalize muscle strength and creatine phosphokinase levels in 2 patients with DM with refractory muscle disease and to improve recalcitrant skin disease in 3 patients. 10–12 A preliminary open-label study of 6 patients with DM showed that rituximab therapy improved muscle strength, lung capacity, and skin disease; however, a standard scale to quantify cutaneous involvement was not used. 13 The purpose of our study was to further evaluate the effects of rituximab therapy on the clinical signs and symptoms of patients with DM. All patients had skin biopsy findings consistent with DM. The patients had to have evidence of at least mild muscle disease with either a modified Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Test score of less than 85 or elevation of CPK or aldolase levels.

They were also required to have active skin disease defined as a Dermatomyositis Skin Severity Index score of greater than 2. They had to have adequate renal, liver, and hematologic parameters. They were permitted to continue treatment with topical corticosteroids or immunomodulators, oral corticosteroids, antimalarial agents, or mycophenolate mofetil if the doses were stable for 4 weeks before screening. The primary end point was the percentage of patients with a partial remission at week 24 defined as any of the following: at least 50% reduction in CPK levels if the baseline values were greater than 2 times the upper limit of normal; at least 50% reduction in muscle strength deficit if the baseline MMT score was less than 85; or a 75% improvement in the DSSI score.

Patients' unmet needs

This paragraph intends to highlight the unmet needs of the MCTD community. The content of this paragraph has been realised by the ERN ReCONNET European Patient Advocacy Group that carefully collected the voices and the points of view of the whole European community of the disease they represent.

Early diagnosis is the primal need for patients with MCTD as it often takes a long time to establish the diagnosis. Besides that, when a diagnosis is finally made, patients are traditionally vaguely told that they have 'some kind of' rheumatic disease or autoimmune disease which clearly does not help understanding what is wrong with them and what they are expected to face during the lifelong course of the disease. The understanding how this disease develops and what outcomes are realistic for these patients, is essential.

Furthermore, prevalence of the disease is not well defined, and patients and doctors have no precise information on the number of MCTD cases at present. Eventually, the European Reference Networks will be able to help somehow with the most fundamental measure of the burden of the disease to plan appropriately for patient healthcare needs. Also, there's a lack of knowledge regarding this disease among physicians as patients often feel that they do not know how to address the reported symptoms.

Life style and its impact in patients quality of life (QOL) is often disregarded, thus the need to measure it or understand if it is ever measured would be useful to build evidence-based patient-focused guidelines on lifestyle issues. There is also a need for a more holistic approach to disease management, as doctors may be treating symptoms and organ to organ, while overlooking the individual beyond the patient. Patient education may also contribute to improve QOL.

In addition, pain management and fatigue are huge challenge, as pain is still treated insufficiently, and fatigue is still inadequately assessed. Non-pharmacological approaches and specific programme, such as exercise, patient education, psychological support or emotional burden management, are needed.

Treatment options are limited to hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs, so there is also a need for alternative treatments with less side effects.

Information and awareness are undoubtfully very important unmet needs among all stakeholders involved: HCPs, public, employers, families, care givers and patients. Furthermore, information on available clinical trials is missing so there is definitely a gap to fill.

Last but not least, tax exemption on access to care needs reflection, as we need to understand how it works in different European countries.

The patient journey is fraught with severe, diverse, and diffuse physical impairment, psychological burden, and diminishing health-related quality of life. SSc remains unfamiliar to many clinicians. Delayed/misdiagnosis, inadequate screening, and attention for common complications with potentially preventable disability/death contribute to patients feeling isolated and unsupported. We present actionable standards including screening, anticipatory guidance, and counseling in patient-centered SSc-care emphasizing psycho-social health as the central goal, whereas robust vigilance and efforts to improve biophysical health and survival are imperatives that support this goal.

Regarding medical management for dermatomyositis and polymyositis, more specifically with respect to management of ILD, BSR 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate corticosteroids with or without a single disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (azathioprine, cyclosporin, tacrolimus, mycophenolate) in patients with chronic Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated ILD. Consider initiating rituximab or cyclophosphamide in treatment-resistant patients.

### OMERACT 2018 modified patient-reported outcome domain core set in the life impact area for adult idiopathic inflammatory myopathies [^111HXkP1]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To present and vote on a myositis modified patient-reported outcome core domain set in the life impact area at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 2018.

Methods

Based on results from international focus groups and Delphi surveys, a draft core set was developed.

Results

Domains muscle symptoms, fatigue, level of physical activity, and pain reached ≥ 70% consensus and were mandatory to assess in all trials. Domains lung, joint, and skin symptoms were mandatory in specific circumstances. This core set was endorsed by > 85% at OMERACT 2018.

Conclusion

We propose a life impact core set for patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and will proceed with instrument selections.

### Treatment of dermatomyositis with methotrexate and prednisone… [^113WXzWj]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Adrenal corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy in dermatomyositis. Unfortunately, about one fifth of the patients, primarily those with the acute form of the disease, do not respond to steroid therapy1 or are unable to tolerate the required dosage level. Improvement in steroid-refractory myositis has been reported after the addition of the folic acid antagonist, methotrexate. 2–6 We describe a patient with dermatomyositis who failed to maintain a response with prednisone but underwent complete remission after the addition of oral methotrexate therapy. Report of a Case A 67-year-old woman had an eight-month history of swelling and erythema of the hands, feet, and periorbital regions. Progressive symmetrical proximal muscle weakness of the extremities also developed. The patient was unable to comb her hair or lift her arms above her head. Dysphagia, facial muscle weakness, Raynaud's phenomenon, and arthritis were absent.

Dermatomyositis (DM) is a rare inflammatory myopathy shown to disproportionately affect Black individuals, with estimated incidence 3-fold greater than that in White individuals. As with multiple cutaneous diseases in skin of color, specific manifestations of DM in Black patients remain underreported in educational sources and scientific literature, leading to potential misdiagnoses or diagnostic delays.

### Development and validation of the dermatomyositis skin severity index [^116bpBYF]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory muscle disease with characteristic cutaneous findings of heliotrope eruption, Gottron's papules and a photodistributed eruption with poikiloderma.

Objectives

To develop and validate a tool to assist with objective assessment of the skin disease of dermatomyositis.

Methods

A skin severity index was developed; content validity was evaluated by a panel of experts, and construct validity was assessed by convergence with other measures of disease severity including physician's global assessment of disease, specific skin disease changes (ulceration, poikiloderma and pruritus), and quality of life. Test and retest reliability and interobserver reproducibility were determined.

Results

In total, 98 subjects were enrolled. The Dermatomyositis Skin Severity Index (DSSI) showed significant correlation to the physician's global assessment, assessments of poikiloderma and self-assessment of pruritus. Inter-rater reliability showed strong correlations from 0.73 to 1. Test-retest (intrarater reliability) was completed on 33 subjects, and showed correlations above 0.75. The ability of this tool to detect clinical changes with treatment has not been fully evaluated.

Conclusions

The DSSI is a valid and reliable measure of skin disease severity in dermatomyositis and can be used in future clinical trials as an assessment tool.

### Factors associated with clinical remission of skin disease in dermatomyositis… [^115TbtRo]. JAMA Network (2018). Excellent credibility.

The majority of adult patients with dermatomyositis do not achieve satisfactory control of skin disease despite long-term aggressive therapy. Our data support the need for better therapies for dermatomyositis. Importance Cutaneous disease represents a significant burden for patients with dermatomyositis. However, quantitative estimates of the probability of skin disease remission and clinical factors associated with skin outcomes are lacking. Prospective cohort study conducted at a dermatology clinic at a tertiary academic referral center. All adult patients with dermatomyositis seen between May 15, 2007, and October 28, 2016, were eligible. Patients were included in the current analysis if they had a baseline Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Disease Area and Severity Index activity score of 12 or higher, and 2 or more CDASI scores separated by 3 months or more within their first 3 years of follow-up.

Clinical remission was relatively uncommon in our population despite aggressive systemic therapy, and patients with anti–melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 antibodies were even less likely to enter clinical remission during a 3-year follow-up period. Although mycophenolate mofetil compared favorably with other treatment options, our data provide evidence that a substantial population of patients with dermatomyositis have skin disease that is not adequately managed with standard-of-care therapies. Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy that manifests as inflammation in the skin, muscles, joints, and lungs. 1, 2 Chronic activity and long-term damage in these organ systems are problems for patients.

Cutaneous disease is an important component of DM disease burden, as it is present in patients with classic myositis, patients who have clinically amyopathic DM and never develop muscle disease, and patients with persistent skin inflammation despite adequate control of their myositis. This notion is supported by data3 from large cohorts showing that patients with juvenile DM often continue to experience chronic skin inflammation despite control of their myositis. This is especially problematic because skin disease is associated with a significant negative impact on quality of life.
4. Because our clinic is a tertiary referral center, the majority of our patients were previously treated, and had variable disease duration at baseline. All patients were treated with standard-of-care therapy at the discretion of the investigators.

In our study, the term systemic therapy specifically refers to antimalarials, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, and oral or intravenous corticosteroids. Patients were required to have received 3 or more consecutive months of a medication for it to be considered a treatment. Variables with P values less than. 10 in the univariable analysis were retained in the multivariable model. For selected variables and the outcome of CR, Kaplan-Meier plots were created and log-rank analysis used to compare curves. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.
4. Our study group comprised 74 patients with moderate-to-severe cutaneous disease at their baseline visit. The median duration of follow-up was 17. 5 months, with a median interval between CDASI scores of 4 months.

### Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies: state of the art on clinical practice guidelines [^1148u2j7]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) encompass a heterogeneous group of rare autoimmune diseases characterised by muscle weakness and inflammation, but in antisynthetase syndrome arthritis and interstitial lung disease are more frequent and often inaugurate the disease. Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have been proposed for IIMs, but they are sparse and heterogeneous. This work aimed at identifying: i) current available CPGs for IIMs, ii) patients ' and clinicians' unmet needs not covered by CPGs. It has been performed in the framework of the European Reference Network on rare and complex connective tissue and musculoskeletal diseases (ReCONNET), a network of centre of expertise and patients funded by the European Union's Health Programme. Fourteen original CPGs were identified, notably recommending that: i) extra-muscular involvements should be assessed; ii) corticosteroids and methotrexate or azathioprine are first-line therapies of IIMs. ii) IVIG is a treatment of resistant-DM that may be also used in other resistant-IIMs; iii) physical therapy and sun protection (in DM patients) are part of the treatment; v) tumour screening for patients with DM include imaging of chest, abdomen, pelvis and breast (in woman) along with colonoscopy (in patients over 50 years); vi) disease activity and damages should be monitor using standardised and validated tools. Yet, only half of these CPGs were evidence-based. Crucial unmet needs were identified both by patients and clinicians. In particular, there was a lack of large multidisciplinary working group and of patients ' preferences. The following fields were not or inappropriately targeted: diagnosis; management of extra-muscular involvements other than skin; co-morbidities and severe manifestations.

### Clinical endpoints in myositis: challenges and ways forward [^115RsE8D]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review addresses the challenges and advances in clinical endpoints for myositis, with a particular focus on ensuring comprehensive assessment of both muscle and skin disease activity. The relevance of this review stems from recent developments in outcome measures and their implications for clinical trial design and patient inclusivity. While quality of life (QoL) and lung involvement are also important aspects of myositis, they are beyond the scope of this review and need to be addressed in future studies.

Recent Findings

Traditional outcome measures like the Total Improvement Score (TIS) have limitations, especially for patients with skin-predominant dermatomyositis (DM). Recent studies highlight the importance of incorporating skin-specific measures such as the Cutaneous Disease Area and Severity Index (CDASI) and the novel composite measure, Dermatomyositis Outcomes for Muscle and Skin (DMOMS). These measures provide a more balanced assessment of disease activity. Clinical trial data analyzed using these measures have demonstrated significant benefits for patients with both classic and amyopathic DM, emphasizing the need for their broader adoption.

Summary

Advancements in outcome measures are crucial for inclusive and effective myositis clinical trials. Incorporating comprehensive tools like the DMOMS can enhance the assessment of both muscle and skin disease activities, potentially leading to better therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes. This shift is essential for addressing the needs of all Idiopathic inflammatory myopathy patients, including those with skin-predominant DM.

### Being on the juvenile dermatomyositis rollercoaster: a qualitative study [^115nxgmK]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Juvenile Dermatomyositis is a rare condition typically managed in specialist centres around the world. The physical effects of JDM are often presented in the literature, but this study brings attention to the psychosocial issues. Any 'tools' which health professionals employ to measure physical disease status only capture half the picture of how CYP with JDM are really doing. Currently there are no instruments available specifically to assess psychosocial needs of those with JDM, however work is ongoing in this area and the development and dissemination of these will be very valuable to the speciality. Not all treatment centres will have a psychologist or specialist nurse to support young people in their day to day management of their condition, therefore, having an understanding of the psychosocial effects upon CYP of chronic disease in general, and more specifically of JDM, is important for all. Screening for concerns, such as low mood and anxiety is a good place to start and has been shown by Knight (2018) to be vital in young people with Lupus, a similar rheumatic condition. Through providing more developmentally appropriate information on a regular basis and providing an opportunity for young people to voice their anxieties is essential. Furthermore, providing strategies to help CYP manage the inevitable uncertainty of living with an unpredictable chronic condition; ensuring they are assisted to explain their condition in a clear and concise way to their peers and frequent information is given to schools, is recommended. The young people interviewed talked about a lack of knowledge and understanding from their teachers about JDM, and whilst this could apply to other rheumatic conditions, we believe there is no published literature for health care professionals or parents to provide to schools, unlike other conditions such as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Whilst there is limited research within the JDM speciality field, there is extensive progress made through over conditions such as oncology, but also within similar autoimmune conditions like juvenile arthritis. For example, these areas of need could be filled by provision of targeted psychosocial interventions, which could include one-to-one counselling or peer support disseminated through a peer mentoring system as described by Kohut et al. (2018) for juvenile arthritis.

### Comparison of the utility and validity of three scoring tools to measure skin involvement in patients with juvenile dermatomyositis [^1159c8jP]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

We therefore recognize that there is scope for a new skin tool for juvenile DM that takes into account the strengths of the 3 existing tools, to be devised, tested, and validated in large cohorts using robust and internationally agreed standards 22. Until that time we propose the use of a skin VAS and one of these tools in routine practice could improve recognition and prompt treatment of ongoing skin disease in juvenile DM.

Fig 1
Dermatomyositis of (A) the face and (B) upper portion of the back at presentation.

Treatment was commenced with hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily (approximately 5 mg/kg/day), but after 2 weeks, she developed a morbilliform (presumably drug-) eruption of the torso and extremities leading to its discontinuation. Topical agents to include corticosteroids, tacrolimus, and ruxolitinib had negligible effects. Prednisone was begun and dosed at 1 mg/kg/day, which lessened the skin manifestations, but cutaneous signs and symptoms still remained severe and extracutaneous disease was progressive. Intravenous immunoglobulin dosed at 2 g/kg monthly was initiated, and after 5 cycles muscle symptoms had improved, but there was little change in the skin lesions and only modest improvement in the pruritus (Fig 2, A and B). Anifrolumab 300 mg monthly was then begun (and intravenous immunoglobulin discontinued), chosen based on its rapid effect when used for cutaneous lupus, and its promising safety data — including malignancy rate comparable to placebo — as described in a long-term extension safety study. Anifrolumab administration resulted in marked skin improvement of the torso that was apparent after the first injection (Fig 3, A and B), and was continued for an additional 3 doses, leading to near-clearing of the facial activity. At that time, progressive metastatic hepatic, osseous, and lymph node disease was identified, chemotherapy was then reinstituted, and the decision was made to pause treatment with anifrolumab. Skin disease remained under excellent control for 2 months after the last anifrolumab injection (Fig 4, A and B), at which point the face, scalp, neck, and chest flared, prompting plans to resume the anifrolumab.

### Dermatomyositis onset in the puerperium period [^113VWh85]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Dermatomyositis is rare during the reproductive period, but when it does occur, most cases have been reported from the viewpoint of the obstetric management of high-risk pregnancy. In return, there is little information concerning the contribution of pregnancy to the development and course of dermatomyositis. We describe a patient with dermatomyositis that presented after the delivery of a healthy infant. This case, with support from a literature review, suggests that pregnancy could be a trigger or contributor for the development of dermatomyositis.

### Quality of life in dermatomyositis [^113EkkHo]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Quality of life (QoL) for patients with inflammatory skin disease can be significant, but has been evaluated in just one study in dermatomyositis (DM).

Objective

We sought to examine the relationship between the Cutaneous Dermatomyositis Area (CDASI) and Severity Index, a DM-specific cutaneous severity instrument, and various QoL study instruments and to determine the impact of DM on QoL.

Methods

Skin-specific QoL instruments, the Skindex and the Dermatology Life Quality Index, and global medical QoL instruments, the Short Form 36 and the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index, were used. Pruritus was evaluated by a visual analog scale and a 0-to-10 scale in DM and cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) populations, respectively.

Results

There was a significant correlation between the CDASI and all skin-specific QoL scores (lowest P = 0.0377). Using the Short Form 36, DM population was found to have significantly worse QoL scores than the general population with the exception of bodily pain (all subscore P values < .01). Furthermore, DM had a significantly lower vitality score, representing energy level, compared with CLE, hypertension, diabetes, and recent myocardial infarction scores (lowest P = 0.003). There was a significantly lower mental health score, representing overall mood, to all compared diseases except CLE and clinical depression (P values < .01 when significant). We found that DM produces more pruritus than CLE (P < .0001).

Limitations

A larger patient population needs to be studied to further assess QoL in patients with DM.

Conclusion

We conclude that DM has a large impact on QoL, even when compared with other diseases, and that DM skin disease activity correlates with a poorer QoL.

### What works for whom? Determining the efficacy and harm of treatments for pain [^1176amVC]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

There has been a tension between the needs of regulators and industry to demonstrate that interventions are effective and safe, and the needs of professionals to understand how well interventions will work for their patients, and patients to understand what might work for them as individuals. The custom has been to focus on statistical outcomes based on average results, but in-depth analysis based on outcomes obtained by individual patients demonstrates that few are average. Rather, a minority of patients achieve very large reductions in pain (responders), while the majority achieve little (nonresponders). Those who benefit in terms of pain also benefit in other areas, with improved sleep, fatigue, mood, function, quality of life, and ability to work. This changes how benefit and risk are seen; nonresponders should stop treatments that don't work and not, therefore, be exposed to risks, while responders have very large benefits to offset against rare but potentially serious harm. This alternative view, patient-centred and practice-orientated, has major implications for clinical practice, how and why we do clinical trials and how they are designed, how health economic evaluations are done, for decisions made by regulatory and other bodies, and for the theory and practice of evidence-based medicine.

### Dermatomyositis… [^113Fa3iu]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Dermatomyositis is a condition affecting the skin and muscles. Cutaneous DM is an inflammatory disease with characteristic skin findings and frequent inflammation of the muscles. Patients may also have internal disease that can affect the lungs, joints, esophagus, and heart. Dermatomyositis can occur in children or adults. This disease in children may result in calcium deposits in the skin. Adults with DM could have an internal cancer. Some patients have only skin disease, which is called amyopathic DM, while others have skin changes and myositis. In some patients, the skin disease may still be active even if the myositis is effectively treated. The cause of DM is not known, but it might be associated with inherited factors, reaction to an infectious agent, a medication, sunlight, or internal cancer.

Symptoms and Manifestations The classic skin changes in DM include a heliotrope rash and Gottron papules. Other characteristic skin findings include red purplish discoloration on the face, exposed surfaces of the arms, forearms and hands, scalp, upper chest, upper back, and the lateral hips in addition to changes around the cuticles of the fingernails. Many patients are sensitive to sunlight. The muscle inflammation tends to affect larger muscles and can present as difficulty raising the arms above the shoulder or trouble rising from a chair or climbing stairs. Sometimes there is muscle tenderness, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Dermatomyositis can also affect the esophagus, lungs, or heart.

Diagnosis and Evaluation A physician will perform a thorough skin examination, test your strength, take a thorough history, order blood tests, perform a skin biopsy, and possibly perform tests or imaging of your muscles. If you are an adult, you will need to be screened for internal cancer at the time of diagnosis, and these tests are usually repeated annually for 3 years. In addition, the function of your esophagus, lungs, and heart will also be evaluated. Treatment Management of DM is aimed at the organs affected. Patients with muscle disease are usually treated with oral corticosteroids initially, with transitioning to use of other systemic medications that lower inflammation. Physical therapy to maintain the full range of motion of the joints and prevent muscle loss is helpful. The skin must be treated with sun-protective measures, including avoidance of sunlight, use of protective clothing, and sunscreens.

Topical therapies, including creams and ointments, may be prescribed, but are unlikely alone to effectively treat skin DM. Most patients need long-term use of systemic medications, including immunosuppressants, or a medication given as an infusion called immune globulin. Response to treatment is assessed by physical examination of the skin and muscles and for muscle disease by repeated blood testing.

American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) guideline — corticosteroids versus observation in newly diagnosed adults: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), with a remark that there may be a subset for whom observation might be appropriate based on severity of thrombocytopenia, additional comorbidities, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, need for upcoming procedures, and patients' values and preferences. For patients with a platelet count of ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel recommends against corticosteroids and in favor of management with observation (strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects), noting that for patients at the lower end of this threshold; for those with additional comorbidities, anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, upcoming procedures; and for elderly patients (> 60 years old), treatment with corticosteroids may be appropriate. A good practice statement specifies that the treating physician should ensure that the patient is adequately monitored for potential corticosteroid side effects and should conduct an assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (depression, fatigue, mental status, etc) while patients are receiving corticosteroids.

### Defining criteria for disease activity States in juvenile dermatomyositis based on the juvenile dermatomyositis activity index [^113eWuTu]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

The observation that patients meeting the cut-offs for ID and LDA had lesser physical disability and better HRQL in the physical domain, whereas those whose JDMAI scores were above the thresholds for MDA and HDA had greater impairment of these two health domains indicate that the cut-offs possess good construct validity and may potentially predict prognosis. The lack of difference in the proportion of patients who met the various cut-offs in relation to the level of HRQL in the psychosocial domain was expected, as this aspect of quality of life is influenced by many factors external to disease activity. The comparability of the degree of cumulative damage across patients meeting the different cut-offs reinforces the role of the JDMAI as a specific measure of disease activity that is not affected by the different construct of disease damage.

### Patients' experiences of managing their rare rheumatic disease [^113hHh3z]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Our 2020 survey of UK health professionals highlighted that 80% of NHS departments had no self-management programmes accessible for patients with RAIRDs. Patient self-management programmes in RA improve wellbeing and reduce healthcare utilization. Self-management programs for people with RA usually exclude patients with RAIRDs; possibly due to the perception that these diseases may be too complex or different to manage in that setting, yet their needs are as great. A systematic review of six randomized controlled trials of self-management programmes in SLE demonstrated improvements in anxiety, depression, stress and disease activity. There are no randomized controlled trials of self-management or educational programmes in vasculitis, myositis or SSc. In SSc, pilot studies of self-management programs appear to improve self-efficacy including in pain management.

There is a need for dedicated psychological support and self-management programmes for people with RAIRDs, a whole-team approach (specialist teams empowering people to manage their own care), staff training (e.g. brief psychological interventions) and signposting to resources, including patient charities. It is, however, important that patients feel informed and confident and that the healthcare system is there to support them in this process, so they know that they can access the right care at the right time as needed. More than 80% of rheumatology health professionals reported they would welcome additional training in self-management and psychological support for people with RAIRDs.

Owing to the rarity of these RAIRDs and current lack of formal psychological support, there is an opportunity to develop a combined cross-condition self-management intervention to address the common impacts of these conditions, reduce isolation, improve health outcomes and be more economically viable for the NHS than disease-specific provision. This could be designed to be feasible and acceptable for different types of rheumatology unit in the UK to deliver as part of routine care. If co-designed with patients and health-professionals, such an intervention could potentially increase health professional engagement and confidence in support for patients with RAIRDs across all types of specialist and district general hospital settings. To explore this initiative further, more work to engage with people who do not usually take part in research and a wider and more in-depth exploration of the key components and delivery methods is required.

PU50 Insights on atypical juvenile dermatomyositis cases: a call for vigilance in diagnosis

I. Awan, A. Sridhar

Paediatric Rheumatology, Leicester's Children Hospital, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, United Kingdom

Correspondence: I. Awan

Pediatric Rheumatology, 23(2): PU50

Introduction: Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM) is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by muscle weakness and distinctive skin rashes. Atypical presentations challenge clinicians, often leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Objectives: This abstract presents two cases of atypical JDM, emphasizing the varied clinical manifestations and the need for heightened awareness in pediatric practice.

Methods: The cases were documented through direct patient observation, caregiver interviews, and a review of the patient's medical records, including imaging and laboratory results; clinical progression, multidisciplinary consultations, and treatment outcomes.

Results: The first case relates to a young girl presented with a classical vasculitic skin rash and muscle weakness for half a year, complicated by sensory issues due to coexisting autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Notably, she exhibited normal muscle enzyme & Myositis specific antibodies but MRI revealed bilateral symmetrical myositis. This case underscores the diagnostic utility of advanced imaging when serum markers are unremarkable. The second case is about a young female who presented with typical helicotropic rash and Raynaud's phenomenon despite normal muscle enzymes. Unlike the first case, her MRI of the muscles was normal however her Myositis specific antibodies were weak positive for Anti-PM-Scl75, leading to a diagnosis of Amyopathic JDM. These cases illustrate the diagnostic challenge of JDM and intersection of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly ASD in the first case and Raynaud's phenomenon in the second case, which underscores the necessity for comprehensive evaluations in atypical presentations. These cases fill a crucial gap in understanding the heterogeneity of JDM presentations, particularly in the context of normal MRI findings and coexisting conditions. The juxtaposition of the two cases provides insights into how atypical clinical features may lead to misdiagnosis or delayed treatment, underscoring the necessity for clinicians to consider a broader spectrum of symptoms. This abstract contributes to the current literature by advocating for a multidisciplinary approach incorporating pediatric rheumatology, dermatology, and psychology, promoting earlier recognition and intervention. It emphasizes the importance of personalized care strategies to address both autoimmune and developmental aspects of the disease.

### Emerging therapeutics in the management of connective tissue disease. part II: dermatomyositis and scleroderma [^111s1W3g]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

The management of connective tissue diseases is dramatically evolving with the advent of biologics and novel oral systemic therapeutics. Despite involvement in the care of these complex patients, there is a knowledge gap in the field of dermatology regarding these emerging agents. The second article in this continuing medical education series discusses new and emerging therapeutics for dermatomyositis and scleroderma that target cells, intracellular signaling pathways, and cytokines.

### Multidisciplinary collaborative guidance on the assessment and treatment of patients with long COVID: a compendium statement [^113XfXg7]. PM & R (2025). High credibility.

Long COVID — management and activity guidance highlight that current management strategies focus on symptom-based supportive care, with critical considerations including energy conservation strategies and addressing comorbidities and modifiable risk factors, and that it is essential to validate the patient's experience, tailor physical activity recommendations carefully to the patient's current capacity because overly intense activity can trigger PEM/PESE and worsened muscle damage, and determine treatment recommendations with humility because there are many persistent unknowns related to Long COVID.

### Mental health considerations in chronic disease: what is the best approach for supporting a scleroderma patient? [^112NjW2q]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Each person who presents for scleroderma-focused care not only has their own psychosocial stressors in their day-to-day life but they also have scleroderma symptom-specific stressors as well as their own mental health reactions throughout their journey with this disease course. There are many actions patients can take to help and support themselves when they are faced with any of the mental health and social determinants of health stressors associated with this rare, chronic illness. Using the scleroderma specialty providers to inform, discuss, and address these areas with their patients can assist with more effective symptom and disease self-management.

### Disease-specific quality indicators, guidelines and outcome measures in scleroderma [^116Hrowo]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

The assessment of the patient with systemic sclerosis remains a challenge for the clinical investigator and the clinician. The measures used to assess the impact of the disease on the quality of life and the outcome measures for both clinical practice and clinical research, including therapeutic trials, are presented and discussed, with emphasis on present limitations.

### Range and consistency of outcome measures reported in randomised trials in dermatomyositis: a systematic review [^117J3EaT]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Dermatomyositis (DM) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, which can be resistant and unresponsive to initial treatments, leading to severe complications and impaired quality of life. There are few randomised trials in dermatomyositis and the outcomes reported may not be consistent, which can limit decision-making. The aim of this study is to assess the scope and consistency of outcomes reported in randomised trials in dermatomyositis.

Methods

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and clinicaltrials.gov were searched from 1993–2020 for randomised trials in children and adults with dermatomyositis. The frequency and characteristics of the outcomes reported were analysed and classified.

Results

20 trials were included. Across these trials, a total of 743 outcome measures were reported, which were grouped into 34 outcome domains; of which 17 were clinical, 13 were surrogate/biochemical, and 4 were patient-reported outcomes. The top five most frequently reported outcome domains were muscle inflammation (15 trials, 46 outcome measures), physical function (14 trials, 16 outcome measures), muscle strength (13 trials, 30 outcome measures), global health (12 trials, 33 outcome measures) and immunologic marker (11 trials, 91 outcomes).

Conclusions

The majority of outcomes reported in trials in people with dermatomyositis and JDM are clinical and surrogate outcomes rather than patient-reported outcomes. The outcomes reported are very inconsistent across trials, with wide heterogeneity in the measures used. Standardised reporting of critically important outcomes is needed to strengthen the value of trials for decision-making.

### Spontaneous recovery of dermatomyositis and unspecified myositis in three adult patients [^113MZmT4]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis and unspecified myositis are idiopathic inflammatory myopathies in which prednisone is usually started as soon as the diagnosis has been established. Therefore, little is known about the natural history of these diseases and spontaneous recovery may escape attention. Here, we present three patients who achieved remission without administration of immunosuppressants. In these three patients, treatment was not started because of spontaneously improving symptoms and signs during the diagnostic process. After 3–5 years, all patients are still free of muscle weakness. These case reports demonstrate that spontaneous long lasting remission can occur in a small proportion of patients with subacute onset idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. In some patients, immunosuppressive treatment with the risk of serious side effects can perhaps be omitted. However, close and frequent monitoring is required in these instances.

### International consensus guidance for the management of glucocorticoid related complications in neuromuscular disease [^116wS8Td]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). High credibility.

Methods — search and study selection for the scoping review used a comprehensive OVID Medline search limited to articles published since 2010. The initial search yielded a total of 1531 studies; after removing 109 duplicate articles, 1422 unique studies remained. Each abstract was independently screened by two reviewers, the full-text articles of 284 abstracts were retrieved for evaluation by two independent reviewers, disagreements were reconciled by a third reviewer, One hundred ninety studies were excluded for assorted reasons, and in total, 94 articles were included in the development of the scoping review.

### Promising treatments in juvenile dermatomyositis [^111zA1mD]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) is an autoimmune systemic connective tissue disorder treated by various anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating agents. JDM typically requires immunomodulatory therapies including corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, intravenous immunoglobulins, and other steroid-sparing therapies. It is important to also employ nonpharmacologic interventions, which are integral in the treatment of JDM to optimize outcomes. These include photoprotection, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and mental health support. There are increasing number of exciting, emerging therapies including as Janus kinase-inhibitors, CAR-T cells, and interferon blockers. This review will provide summary of current JDM treatments and some promising newly emerging therapies.
