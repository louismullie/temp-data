## Question

Basilar artery occlusion treatment strategies

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment strategies for acute basilar artery occlusion, including how to think about intravenous thrombolysis, endovascular thrombectomy, patient selection, timing, technique, and special scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and prognosis to frame urgency. Then, I should verify the strength and hierarchy of evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine intravenous thrombolysis indications and timing. After that, I need to evaluate endovascular thrombectomy indications, timing, and technique. I will then consider patient selection modifiers such as NIHSS severity, infarct burden, occlusion location, and etiology. Finally, I should integrate bridging strategies, rescue therapies, and practical implementation considerations, and close with a concise, clinically actionable algorithm.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. Basilar artery occlusion accounts for roughly 1–2% of ischemic strokes but carries very high morbidity and mortality, with poor outcomes in the majority of untreated or non-recanalized patients, which underscores the need for rapid reperfusion strategies and explains why equipoise has been challenging in trials [^117LjLRR] [^1123qE5Y].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to anchor decisions. Initially, I thought BEST and BASICS were the pivotal trials establishing benefit, but wait, let me verify that. BEST and BASICS were actually neutral for the primary functional outcome, whereas the more recent ATTENTION and BAOCHE trials demonstrated clear benefit of thrombectomy over best medical therapy, and the VERITAS individual patient data meta-analysis across ATTENTION, BAOCHE, BASICS, and BEST confirmed a robust benefit of endovascular therapy, which corrects my earlier assumption and aligns with contemporary guidance [^11288ccS] [^112y7aob] [^113VihtW].

> I will now examine intravenous thrombolysis. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm indications and timing. Although there are no BAO-specific randomized trials of IVT versus no IVT, expert consensus and guidelines support offering IVT within 24 hours in the absence of contraindications, with stronger support within 4.5 hours and more cautious consideration from 4.5–24 hours, particularly when there is no extensive posterior fossa infarction, and this applies across stroke severities in BAO [^111RbQAR] [^112p2LKW] [^111xdhdh].

> Now, I need to evaluate endovascular thrombectomy. The ATTENTION and BAOCHE randomized trials showed that EVT improves functional independence and reduces mortality compared with best medical therapy, with the signal strongest in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms and within 24 hours of onset, and the VERITAS IPD meta-analysis quantified a roughly 2.4-fold increase in odds of favorable functional outcome with EVT, albeit with higher symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates, which I should explicitly acknowledge in counseling [^112y7aob] [^113VihtW] [^114TUXFU].

> Let me consider timing next, because speed matters. I should double-check the time windows. For patients with NIHSS ≥ 10 and within 6–24 hours, guidelines suggest EVT plus best medical therapy over BMT alone, and for 0–6 hours the benefit is expected to be at least as strong, though most contemporary trials enrolled patients up to 24 hours; observational data also show that onset-to-puncture within 6 hours is associated with markedly better outcomes, reinforcing the principle to treat as fast as possible when feasible [^116N82Z8] [^113riA1h] [^112Brikk].

> I need to check patient selection modifiers that modify benefit and futility. Benefit appears greater with NIHSS ≥ 10, proximal or mid-basilar occlusions, and smaller infarct burden on baseline imaging, whereas patients with NIHSS < 10 or extensive posterior fossa ischemia may not benefit and may even fare worse with EVT; pc-ASPECTS is commonly used to gauge infarct extent, with higher scores favoring reperfusion, though I should confirm that evidence for imaging selection is still evolving and largely consensus-based in BAO [^116N82Z8] [^114FuaM9] [^111U3SuE] [^111g1CKw].

> Hold on, I should verify technique preferences and bridging. Direct aspiration first-line is favored over stent retriever by ESO/ESMINT based on observational comparative data and expert consensus, and if IVT is not contraindicated, combined IVT plus EVT is suggested over direct EVT alone, acknowledging that anterior circulation data on direct EVT are mixed and BAO-specific randomized comparisons are limited; I should also note that ongoing trials like ANGEL-COAST will clarify aspiration versus stent retriever in BAO [^113A81Cn] [^114agANv] [^113pDECM].

> Next, I should review special scenarios and rescue strategies. In suspected intracranial atherosclerotic disease with basilar stenosis, rescue angioplasty with or without stenting after failed or complicated EVT is reasonable, and add-on antithrombotic therapy during or within 24 hours after EVT may be considered when there is failed reperfusion, imminent re-occlusion, or need for stenting, balancing bleeding risk and using shared decision-making; I need to ensure I frame these as conditional suggestions given low-quality evidence [^115fT8sK] [^114pznrP] [^114ExXJ3].

> I should confirm how to operationalize this at the bedside. Rapid vessel imaging with CTA or MRA is essential to diagnose BAO and triage to reperfusion, and systems that minimize onset-to-puncture time improve outcomes; cost-effectiveness modeling supports CTA-based strategies to expedite treatment, and I need to ensure teams are prepared for posterior circulation access and bailout techniques when anatomy is challenging [^113Ae2TM] [^113riA1h] [^112Brikk].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm, and I will double-check alignment with guidelines. For suspected BAO, obtain emergent CTA/ MRA, start stroke pathway, and give IVT if within 24 hours and no contraindications, with stronger urgency in the 0–4.5 hour window; if NIHSS is ≥ 10 and there is no extensive posterior fossa infarction, proceed to EVT within 24 hours, prioritizing ≤ 6 hours when feasible; if NIHSS is < 10, consider best medical therapy with IVT and individualize EVT based on occlusion location, collateral status, and patient factors; throughout, favor direct aspiration first-line and consider bridging IVT when appropriate, with rescue angioplasty/stenting and short-course antithrombotics for ICAD-related lesions or failed reperfusion [^116N82Z8] [^111RbQAR] [^113A81Cn] [^114agANv] [^115fT8sK].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and counseling points. The magnitude of benefit is clearest in moderate-to-severe BAO within 24 hours, whereas mild presentations and extensive infarcts remain areas of equipoise; EVT increases sICH risk but reduces mortality in pooled analyses, so shared decision-making is crucial, and ongoing trials may refine imaging selection and device strategies in the near term [^113VihtW] [^114TUXFU] [^112y7aob].

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a **neurological emergency** with high morbidity and mortality [^1123qE5Y]. Rapid reperfusion is critical: **IV thrombolysis (IVT) within 24 hours** is recommended if there is no extensive ischemia, and **mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours** is indicated for moderate-to-severe strokes (NIHSS ≥ 10) without extensive infarction, with the strongest benefit when performed within 6–12 hours [^116N82Z8] [^113riA1h]. For mild strokes (NIHSS < 10), evidence is limited; best medical therapy may be preferred, and EVT should be individualized [^114FuaM9]. Direct aspiration is the **first-line EVT technique**, and rescue angioplasty/stenting is considered for underlying stenosis or re-occlusion [^113A81Cn] [^115fT8sK]. Early recognition, fast imaging (CTA/MRA), and transfer to a comprehensive stroke center are essential to improve outcomes [^1158hQGT] [^112Brikk].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

BAO presents with **variable symptoms** — dizziness, vertigo, dysarthria, dysphagia, ataxia, cranial nerve deficits, and altered consciousness — and can progress rapidly to coma or death [^1123qE5Y]. Early diagnosis relies on **CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA)** to confirm occlusion and guide therapy [^1123qE5Y].

---

## Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT)

- **Indications**: IVT is recommended within 24 hours of symptom onset if there is no extensive ischemia on imaging, regardless of stroke severity [^111RbQAR] [^111xdhdh].
- **Agents**: Alteplase (0.9 mg/kg) is standard; tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) is an alternative in some protocols [^114wpZLr].
- **Limitations**: Lower recanalization rates (~53%) and risk of hemorrhage limit efficacy in BAO [^116kbqc9].

---

## Endovascular therapy (EVT)

- **Indications**: EVT is recommended for moderate-to-severe BAO (NIHSS ≥ 10) within 24 hours, especially 6–12 hours, without extensive infarction [^116N82Z8] [^113riA1h].
- **Technique**: Direct aspiration is preferred over stent retriever as first-line strategy [^113A81Cn].
- **Outcomes**: EVT improves functional independence and reduces mortality, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of ~6 for favorable outcomes [^114TUXFU] [^113VihtW].

---

## Combined therapy (IVT + EVT)

Combined therapy is **reasonable** when IVT is not contraindicated, as it may enhance recanalization and outcomes, though evidence is mixed and evolving [^114agANv] [^113odvqt].

---

## Special considerations

- **Mild strokes (NIHSS < 10)**: Evidence for EVT is limited; best medical therapy may be preferred, with EVT individualized [^114FuaM9].
- **Extensive infarction**: Reperfusion therapy is generally not recommended due to low benefit and high risk [^111U3SuE].
- **Underlying stenosis**: Rescue angioplasty/stenting is considered for intracranial atherosclerotic disease or re-occlusion [^115fT8sK].

---

## Prognostic factors

Favorable outcomes are associated with **younger age, lower NIHSS, shorter onset-to-treatment time, and successful recanalization** [^113QH2QG] [^113riA1h]. Extensive infarction, high NIHSS, and delayed treatment predict poor outcomes [^113QH2QG] [^113riA1h].

---

## Current guidelines summary

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Time window** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| IVT | No extensive infarction | ≤ 24 hours | Strong recommendation |
| EVT | NIHSS ≥ 10, no extensive infarction | ≤ 24 hours (strongest 6–12 h) | Strong recommendation |
| EVT | NIHSS < 10 | ≤ 24 hours | Individualized |
| Direct aspiration | First-line EVT | N/A | Strong recommendation |
| Rescue angioplasty/stenting | Underlying stenosis or re-occlusion | N/A | Expert consensus |

---

## Conclusion

BAO requires **rapid recognition and reperfusion**. IVT within 24 hours is foundational, and EVT is indicated for moderate-to-severe strokes without extensive infarction, with the strongest benefit when performed within 6–12 hours. Direct aspiration is preferred, and rescue strategies are used for stenosis or re-occlusion. Mild strokes warrant individualized decisions, and early transfer to comprehensive stroke centers is critical to optimize outcomes [^116N82Z8] [^113riA1h].

### Focused update to guidelines for endovascular therapy for emergent large vessel occlusion: basilar artery occlusion patients [^116YeNR7]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Endovascular therapy (EVT) dramatically improves clinical outcomes for patients with anterior circulation emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) strokes. With recent publication of two randomized controlled trials in favor of EVT for basilar artery occlusions, the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS) Standards and Guidelines Committee provides this focused update for the existing SNIS guideline, 'Current endovascular strategies for posterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke'.
Methods

A structured literature review and analysis of studies related to posterior circulation large vessel occlusion (basilar or vertebral artery) strokes treated by EVT was performed. Based on the strength and quality of the evidence, recommendations were made by consensus of the writing committee, with additional input from the full SNIS Standards and Guidelines Committee and the SNIS Board of Directors.

Results

Based on the results of the most recent randomized, controlled trials on EVT for basilar or vertebral artery occlusion, the expert panel agreed on the following recommendations. For patients presenting with an acute ischemic stroke due to an acute basilar or vertebral artery occlusion confirmed on CT angiography, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥ 6, posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (PC-ASPECTS) ≥ 6, and age 18–89 years: (1) thrombectomy is indicated within 12 hours since last known well (class I, level B-R); (2) thrombectomy is reasonable within 12-24hours from the last known well (class IIa, level B-R); (3) thrombectomy may be considered on a case by case basis for patients presenting beyond 24 hours since last known well (class IIb, level C-EO). In addition, thrombectomy may be considered on a case by case basis for patients aged < 18 years or > 89 years on a case by case basis (class IIb, level C-EO).

Conclusions

The indications for EVT of ELVO strokes continue to expand and now include patients with basilar artery occlusion. Further prospective, randomized controlled trials are warranted to elucidate the efficacy and safety of EVT in populations not included in this set of recommendations, and to confirm long term outcomes.

### Treatment and outcomes of acute basilar artery occlusion in the basilar artery international cooperation study (BASICS): a prospective registry study [^114LWX3Y]. The Lancet: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment strategies for acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) are based on case series and data that have been extrapolated from stroke intervention trials in other cerebrovascular territories, and information on the efficacy of different treatments in unselected patients with BAO is scarce. We therefore assessed outcomes and differences in treatment response after BAO.

Methods

The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) is a prospective, observational registry of consecutive patients who presented with an acute symptomatic and radiologically confirmed BAO between November 1, 2002, and October 1, 2007. Stroke severity at time of treatment was dichotomised as severe (coma, locked-in state, or tetraplegia) or mild to moderate (any deficit that was less than severe). Outcome was assessed at 1 month. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 4 or 5, or death. Patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment they received: antithrombotic treatment only (AT), which comprised antiplatelet drugs or systemic anticoagulation; primary intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), including subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis; or intra-arterial therapy (IAT), which comprised thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, stenting, or a combination of these approaches. Risk ratios (RR) for treatment effects were adjusted for age, the severity of neurological deficits at the time of treatment, time to treatment, prodromal minor stroke, location of the occlusion, and diabetes.

Findings

619 patients were entered in the registry. 27 patients were excluded from the analyses because they did not receive AT, IVT, or IAT, and all had a poor outcome. Of the 592 patients who were analysed, 183 were treated with only AT, 121 with IVT, and 288 with IAT. Overall, 402 (68%) of the analysed patients had a poor outcome. No statistically significant superiority was found for any treatment strategy. Compared with outcome after AT, patients with a mild-to-moderate deficit (n = 245) had about the same risk of poor outcome after IVT (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60–1.45) or after IAT (adjusted RR 1.29, 0.97–1.72) but had a worse outcome after IAT compared with IVT (adjusted RR 1.49, 1.00–2.23). Compared with AT, patients with a severe deficit (n = 347) had a lower risk of poor outcome after IVT (adjusted RR 0.88, 0.76–1.01) or IAT (adjusted RR 0.94, 0.86–1.02), whereas outcomes were similar after treatment with IAT or IVT (adjusted RR 1.06, 0.91–1.22).

Interpretation

Most patients in the BASICS registry received IAT. Our results do not support unequivocal superiority of IAT over IVT, and the efficacy of IAT versus IVT in patients with an acute BAO needs to be assessed in a randomised controlled trial.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT) guideline on acute management of basilar artery occlusion [^111xdhdh]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Plain language summary

The basilar artery supplies blood to the back of the brain and brainstem, including critical areas involved in the regulation of breathing, consciousness, swallowing, vision, and mobility. Individuals who suffer an ischemic stroke due to a blood clot in the basilar artery, have a very high risk of death or permanent disability if the clot cannot be dissolved or removed rapidly. The two treatment strategies aimed at acute clot busting or removal are administration of clot-dissolving drugs into a vein (intravenous thrombolysis) and mechanical removal of the clot with a catheter placed into an artery (mechanical thrombectomy). However, these treatments also carry risks, such as bleeding in the brain, and they can be ineffective if given too late. This guideline provides recommendations for the acute treatment of stroke caused by basilar artery occlusion using clot-busting or removal therapies.

The key recommendations/suggestions of the guideline include the following:

Treat patients with basilar artery occlusion with intravenous thrombolysis within 24 hours of symptom onset if there are no contraindications, such as extensive, already permanent ischemic damage to the brain. Thrombolysis should be used regardless of the severity of stroke symptoms.
Treat patients with basilar artery occlusion and moderate-to-severe stroke symptoms with mechanical thrombectomy within 24 hours of symptom onset if there is not extensive, already permanent ischemic damage to the brain. Patients with mild stroke symptoms may experience harm from thrombectomy.
Use intravenous thrombolysis in addition to mechanical thrombectomy if there are no contraindications.
Choose direct suction of the clot with an aspiration catheter as the first-line approach in mechanical thrombectomy, instead of a stent retriever.

Some of the recommendations and suggestions about mechanical thrombectomy for patients with symptoms due to basilar artery clot were supported by very low-quality evidence, whereas the rest were based on expert opinions.

Plain language summary

The basilar artery supplies blood to the back of the brain and brainstem, including critical areas involved in the regulation of breathing, consciousness, swallowing, vision, and mobility. Individuals who suffer an ischaemic stroke due to a blood clot in the basilar artery, have a very high risk of death or permanent disability if the clot cannot be dissolved or removed rapidly. The two treatment strategies aimed at acute clot busting or removal are administration of clot-dissolving drugs into a vein (intravenous thrombolysis) and mechanical removal of the clot with a catheter placed into an artery (mechanical thrombectomy).

### Endovascular therapy for stroke due to basilar artery occlusion: a BASIC challenge at BEST [^112pB8V4]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Basilar artery occlusion stroke is known to have poor outcome with a high rate of morbidity and mortality despite best medical therapy. Since the original report of intra-arterial therapy for basilar artery occlusion in 1983, two recent randomized trials comparing endovascular therapy versus best medical management were completed on a large scale, BASICS (Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study) and the BEST trial (Basilar Artery Occlusion Endovascular Intervention Versus Standard Medical Treatment), both of which demonstrated equivocal benefit of the two modalities. In this commentary, we comment and highlight important lessons related to basilar occlusion stroke as learned from the BASICS and BEST randomized trials.

### Endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion [^11288ccS]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Basilar artery occlusion is one of the most devastating neurological conditions with high risks of disability and mortality. Despite the overwhelming benefit of endovascular therapy (EVT) in the anterior circulation and observational data supporting the efficacy of EVT in the posterior circulation, evidence from randomized controlled trials in basilar artery occlusion had been lacking until recently. The BEST (Basilar Artery Occlusion Endovascular Intervention Versus Standard Medical Treatment) and BASICS (Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study) randomized trials showed a nonsignificant direction of benefit but failed to demonstrate the superiority of EVT over standard medical therapy in basilar artery occlusion. However, these trials paved the way for 2 subsequent positive trials by highlighting the importance of consecutive recruitment, fast enrollment and avoidance or minimization of cross-over. The recently completed ATTENTION (Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion) and BAOCHE (Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular Trial) trials showed that EVT is beneficial for basilar artery occlusion within 24 hours of onset, with a treatment effect similar to what has been shown in anterior circulation large vessel occlusion ischemic stroke. In this topical review, we examine and contextualize the current evidence on EVT for basilar artery occlusion.

### Endovascular thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion: translating research findings into clinical practice [^112y7aob]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Background

Basilar artery occlusion is a rare and severe condition. The effectiveness of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion was unclear until recently, because these patients were excluded from most trials of endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion ischaemic stroke.

Recent Developments

The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) and the Basilar Artery Occlusion Endovascular Intervention versus Standard Medical Treatment (BEST) trials, specifically designed to investigate the benefit of thrombectomy in patients with basilar artery occlusion, did not find significant evidence of a benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in terms of disability outcomes at 3 months after stroke. However, these trials suggested a potential benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in patients presenting with moderate-to-severe symptoms. Subsequently, the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion (ATTENTION) and the Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular (BAOCHE) trials, which compared endovascular thrombectomy versus medical therapy within 24 h of onset, showed clear benefit of endovascular thrombectomy in reducing disability and mortality, particularly in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms. The risk of intracranial haemorrhage with endovascular thrombectomy was similar to the risk in anterior circulation stroke. Thrombectomy was beneficial regardless of age, baseline characteristics, the presence of intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and time from symptom onset to randomisation. Therefore, the question of whether endovascular thrombectomy is beneficial in basilar artery occlusion now appears to be settled in patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms, and endovascular thrombectomy should be offered to eligible patients. WHERE NEXT? Key outstanding issues are the potential benefits of endovascular thrombectomy in patients with mild symptoms, the use of intravenous thrombolysis in an extended time window (ie, after 4.5 h of symptom onset), and the optimal endovascular technique for thrombectomy. Dedicated training programmes and automated software to assist with the assessment of imaging prognostic markers could be useful in the selection of patients who might benefit from endovascular thrombectomy. Large international research networks should be built to address knowledge gaps in this field and allow the conduct of clinical trials with fast and consecutive enrolment and a diverse ethnic representation.

### Is more evidence needed for thrombectomy in basilar artery occlusion? The BASICS and BEST meta-analytical approaches [^114Dfp5p]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

The initial search strategy yielded 43 studies (plus the BASICS trial preliminary results retrieved from the European Stroke Organisation/World Stroke Organisation conference report). Five studies were duplicates and another 35 were excluded because they were not an RCT or did not include basilar artery stroke. There are no other related ongoing RCT, except for the Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular Trial (NCT02737189), assessing the extended time window (6–24 hours). The literature database search confirmed only the BEST (Endovascular treatment versus standard medical treatment for vertebrobasilar artery occlusion) and BASilar artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) trials investigated thrombectomy for the treatment of BAO acute stroke. These trials had similar inclusion criteria (except for a small difference in the stroke window tolerance for the performance of thrombectomy: 6 hours for the BASICS trial and 8 hours for the BEST trial). The samples included were reasonably homogeneous, but the BASICS patients received intravenous thrombolysis more often compared with BEST patients (~80% vs ~30%) (online supplemental table 1).

In the BEST trial intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, there was no difference between treatment groups in the 90-day primary outcome, mRS 0–3 (intervention, 28/66, 42% and control, 21/65, 32%; OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.15). Similarly, no difference was found in the BASICS trial primary outcome ITT analysis (intervention, 68/154, 44% and control, 55/146, 38%; OR 1.31, 95% CI 0.82 to 2.08). In both trials, the secondary efficacy and safety outcomes were similar between groups.

Mechanical thrombectomy was associated with favourable functional outcomes in BAO stroke, with an OR 1.62% and 95% credible interval (high density interval) 1.01–2.77 (figure 1A and online supplemental figure 2). The observed absolute risk reduction would translate to a number need to treat of 13. Using classical ('frequentist') estimates, meta-analysis would result inconclusive, with an OR 1.37 (95% CI 0.93 to 2.02) (figure 1B).

### Is more evidence needed for thrombectomy in basilar artery occlusion? The BASICS and BEST meta-analytical approaches [^112a9h6e]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy for stroke associated with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) is well established and among the most effective treatments in medicine. Stroke associated with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) was not included in the seminal thrombectomy randomised clinical trials (RCTs). BAO accounts for 1% of the ischaemic strokes and 5%–10% of the LVO, but 70%–80% of BAO victims evolve to death or full dependence. The terminal nature of the brainstem and thalamic circulations may predispose to such dismal outcomes.

Only two RCT designed to assess the efficacy of early (< 6–8 hours since symptoms onset) thrombectomy for BAO treatment, the BEST and BASICS trials. Given the prior evidence for thrombectomy benefit for anterior circulation stroke is well settled; BAO stroke shares a similar physiopathology with very poor prognosis; the two available BAO trials had limited sample sizes but large absolute differences on the functional outcomes; we propose that an aggregated analysis of the BEST and BASICS trials should be performed under a Bayesian approach.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT) guideline on acute management of basilar artery occlusion [^117LjLRR]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) comprises only 1–2% of ischemic stroke but imposes a significant burden on patients due to the associated high disability and mortality. Reperfusion therapy is the standard of care for improving outcome of eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke. The European Stroke Organisation (ESO) Guideline on intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) does not differentiate recommendations based on stroke location. Accordingly, IVT is an integral part of acute management of BAO despite the lack of randomized controlled trials (RCT) focusing specifically on posterior circulation occlusions. Very poor prognosis of untreated BAO is probably the most important reason for not having pivotal RCTs comparing IVT to no reperfusion therapy. Evidence for the efficacy of endovascular treatment (EVT) has until recently been mainly confined to anterior circulation large-vessel occlusions. Consequently, the 2019 joint Guideline of the ESO and the European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT) on mechanical thrombectomy in arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) could only constitute an expert opinion on EVT in BAO, leaving considerable uncertainty about the optimal acute management of the disease.

### Endovascular treatment for basilar artery occlusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112HkfK6]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Independent randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) have provided robust evidence for endovascular treatment (EVT) as the standard of care treatment for acute large vessel occlusions in the anterior circulation. We examined available studies specific to posterior cerebral circulation ischemic strokes to see if any conclusions can be drawn regarding EVT options.

Methods

We performed a systematic literature search to identify studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of EVT versus standard medical treatment for patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO). We extracted data for outcomes of interest and presented associations between the two groups with the use of risk ratios (RRs) or odds ratios (ORs), with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model to pool the effect estimates.

Results

We identified five studies (two RCTs, three observational cohorts) including a total of 1098 patients. Patients receiving EVT had a higher risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) compared to those receiving non-interventional medical management (RR 5.42, 95% CI 2.74–10.71). Nonsignificant trends towards modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores 0–2 (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.74–1.41), mRS scores 0–3 (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.64–1.47), overall functional improvement (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.57–1.51), and all-cause mortality (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.78–1.35) at 3 months were seen.

Conclusion

Although EVT increases the probability of sICH, the available data do not exclude the possibility of improved functional outcomes over standard therapy. As larger studies are challenged by the perceived lack of equipoise in this vulnerable patient population, results of ongoing RCTs are expected to provide substantial input for future meta-analyses.

Discussion

Although the individual trials resulted inconclusive, the Bayesian meta-analysis with an enhanced sample size and power suggested a functional outcome benefit for thrombectomy in BAO stroke patients. In view of the potential signal of benefit, we would advocate for the initiation of long-term clinically-led registries, especially in low-income and middle-income countries, where the greatest burden of the disease lies. Although our result is promising, we acknowledge that the BEST and BASICS trials authors, with the full individual-level database, will be able to perform a more comprehensive analysis, including subgroup stratification and/or meta-regression. A Bayesian approach may not be the ' BASICS', straightforward method, but it is probably the 'BEST' one for this scenario.

The aim of the present European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations on the acute management of patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO). These guidelines were prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure of the ESO and according to the GRADE methodology. Although BAO accounts for only 1–2% of all strokes, it has very poor natural outcome. We identified 10 relevant clinical situations and formulated the corresponding Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes (PICO) questions, based on which a systematic literature search and review was performed. The working group consisted of 10 voting members (five representing ESO and five representing the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT)) and three non-voting junior members. The certainty of evidence was generally very low. In many PICOs, available data were scarce or lacking, hence, we provided expert consensus statements. First, we compared intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to no IVT, but specific BAO-related data do not exist. Yet, historically, IVT was standard of care for BAO patients who were also included (although in small numbers) in IVT trials. Non-randomized studies of IVT-only cohorts showed a high proportion of favorable outcomes. Expert Consensus suggests using IVT up to 24 hours unless otherwise contraindicated. We further suggest IVT plus endovascular treatment (EVT) over direct EVT. EVT on top of best medical treatment (BMT) was compared with BMT alone within 6 and 6-24hours from last seen well. In both time windows, we observed a different effect of treatment depending on a) the region where the patients were treated (Europe vs Asia), b) on the proportion of IVT in the BMT arm, and c) on the initial stroke severity. In case of high proportion of IVT in the BMT group and in patients with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score below 10, EVT plus BMT was not found better than BMT alone. Based on very low certainty of evidence, we suggest EVT+BMT over BMT alone (this is based on results of patients with at least 10 NIHSS points and a low proportion of IVT in BMT). For patients with an NIHSS score below 10, we found no evidence to recommend EVT over BMT. In fact, BMT was non-significantly better and safer than EVT. Furthermore, we found a stronger treatment effect of EVT+BMT over BMT alone in proximal and middle locations of BAO compared with distal location. While recommendations for patients without extensive early ischemic changes in the posterior fossa can, in general, follow those of other PICOs, we formulated an Expert Consensus Statement suggesting against reperfusion therapy in those with extensive bilateral and/or brainstem ischemic changes. Another Expert Consensus suggests reperfusion therapy regardless of collateral scores. Based on limited evidence, we suggest direct aspiration over stent retriever as the first-line strategy of mechanical thrombectomy. As an Expert Consensus, we suggest rescue percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and/or stenting after a failed EVT procedure. Finally, based on very low certainty of evidence, we suggest add-on antithrombotic treatment during EVT or within 24 hours after EVT in patients with no concomitant IVT and in whom EVT was complicated (defined as failed or imminent re-occlusion, or need for additional stenting or angioplasty).

### Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy for acute basilar occlusion: pro [^1146Pmqm]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Acute thromboembolic occlusion of the basilar artery accounts for 6% to 10% of large-vessel stroke in humans. Because of the brain region supplied by this artery, the case fatality rate is the highest for all ischemic stroke subtypes, ranging from 40% to 86%. Patients who undergo successful recanalization of the basilar artery by intra-arterial thrombolysis have lower mortality of approximately 39%. Considering all published series, a consistent survival benefit is predicted by revascularization (mortality 87% nonrecanalized compared with 39% recanalized; P < 0.001). Although no large randomized studies of revascularization for acute basilar artery occlusion have been performed, it is unlikely that endovascular efforts are inferior to the natural history of the disease, and it is likely that patients benefit from this aggressive approach.

### Endovascular therapy for acute basilar artery occlusion: a review of the literature [^1149SGB9]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Basilar artery occlusion is an infrequent form of acute stroke; clinical outcomes are heterogeneous, but the condition can be fatal. There is a lack of randomized controlled trial data in this field. Case series suggest that patients who are recanalized have much better outcomes than those who are not, and it is generally accepted that intra-arterial techniques achieve high rates of recanalization. Controversially, several studies, including a meta-analysis and registry-based investigation, that have compared intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial treatment suggest similar outcomes. However, there are many potential sources of bias in each of these studies, precluding a firm conclusion. Indeed, there are many confounding factors that can influence the outcome including severity of presentation, site of occlusion, clot load, degree of collateral flow, timing of therapy, agent used for recanalization and dose of thrombolytic agent. Additionally, pretreatment infarct core imaging using diffusion-weighted imaging and the posterior circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS) scoring systems have been shown to predict outcome and therefore may be useful in selecting patients for aggressive therapy. Protocols combining intravenous agents such as glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists or thombolytics agents with intra-arterial techniques ('bridging' therapy) have shown encouraging improvements in neurological outcome and survival. Furthermore, initial case series describing the use of mechanical clot extraction devices or aspiration catheters suggest high rates of recanalization. What would be useful is a randomized trial comparing IVT, endovascular approaches and a combined IVT/endovascular approach. However, the small numbers of patients and multiple confounding factors are barriers to the development of such a trial.

### Endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion in sudden onset to maximal deficit ischemic events [^114Yi6pM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare cause of stroke and accounts for 5% of large‐vessel occlusion strokes, which are generally associated with a higher mortality if recanalization is not achieved. Although evidence from the BEST (Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion: Endovascular Interventions vs Standard Medical Treatment) trial failed to support the superiority of endovascular therapy (EVT) over medical management, this was likely due to a high crossover rate and poor study recruitment. In contrast, results from the randomized controlled BASICS (Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study) may not exclude that a substantial benefit is obtained from EVT. Encouragingly, the latest results from two randomized controlled trials (ATTENTION [Endovascular Treatment For Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion: A Multicentre Randomised Clinical Trial] and BAOCHE [Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular]) and a meta‐analysis have demonstrated that EVT may be associated with improved clinical outcomes for patients with acute BAO when compared with standard medical treatment. In addition, our prospective BASILAR (Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study Registry) has suggested that EVT is associated with favorable outcomes in patients with BAO at 90 days and that time is critical for patients with acute BAO who receive EVT, particularly the onset‐to‐puncture time (OPT).EVT has been progressively applied as a popular strategy for patients with BAO in daily clinical practice. Compared with the anterior circulation, the posterior circulation has distinct anatomy and blood flow features, such as two vertebral arteries converging with the basilar artery, a highly developed, persistent collateral arterial network, reverse filling of the distal basilar artery, and delicate plasma flow around the clot. As a consequence, the onset of symptoms and signs of acute BAO are complicated and can include sudden onset to maximal deficit (SOTMD), causing progressive exacerbation and fluctuations of symptoms. However, the efficacy of EVT for each form of onset of BAO remains uncertain.

### Basilar artery occlusion [^115VjGj4]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Basilar artery occlusion is assumed to carry a grave prognosis, with mortality rates of up to 90%. Diagnosis is often delayed, or even missed, as a result of the variety of clinical presentations seen with this condition. The pathogenesis of occlusion can be secondary to both local atherothrombosis or cardioembolism. The use of noninvasive imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography has improved recognition of clinical syndromes associated with occlusion. Although no randomized studies have been performed, recanalization of the vascular occlusion, particularly with thrombolytic agents, appears to result in improved outcomes in selected patients. However, the optimum timing for therapy is unclear, and reperfusion therapy may need to be combined with definitive vascular treatment of underlying vascular stenosis. Increasing awareness of this condition may reveal the natural history to be more diverse than previously recognized.

### Recanalization treatments in basilar artery occlusion-systematic analysis [^112EehLG]. European Stroke Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Basilar artery occlusion is a most devastating form of stroke, and the current practice is to reverse it with revascularization therapies. Pharmacological thrombolysis, intravenous or intraarterial, has been adjuncted or replaced with invasive, endovascular thrombectomy procedures. The preferred approach remains unknown and many recanalizations are futile with no clinical benefit. We sought to determine reasons for futility and weigh the existing reports to find whether endovascular mechanical interventions provide superior outcomes over pharmacological thrombolysis alone.

Methods

After analyzing systematically the reports of outcomes produced by variable basilar artery occlusion recanalization protocols, information was retrieved and reconciled from 15 reports published from year 2005 comprising 803 patients in 17 cohorts. In the largest single-center cohort (162, Helsinki), predictors of futile recanalization (three-month modified Rankin Scale score 4 to 6) were determined.

Results

Good outcome was reported by mechanical approaches either alone or on demand more frequently than by pharmacological, intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis protocols (35.5% versus 24.4%, p < 0.001), accompanied by higher recanalization rates (84.1% versus 70.9%, p < 0.001). Along with superior recanalization rate at 91%, good outcome was reached by primary thrombectomy in 36% at the cost of substantial futile recanalization rate at 60%, which was lower when using modern stentrievers only (52.8%). In the Helsinki cohort, the single most significant predictor was extensive baseline ischemia, increasing the odds of futility 20-fold (95%CI 4.39–92.29, p < 0.001). Other attributes of futility were ventilation support and history of atrial fibrillation or previous stroke.

Conclusions

Endovascular mechanical approaches have been reported to provide superior outcomes over pharmacological thrombolysis in basilar artery occlusion. Stricter patient selection, most notably to exclude victims of already extended ischemia, would assist in translating excellent recanalization rates into improved clinical outcomes and more acceptable futility rates.

### Endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion: among the first to conceptualize, last to prove [^114BGrUV]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

In 1981, the dismal outcomes of patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) inspired the first reports of intra-arterial thrombolytic treatment in BAO. These reports were among the first to conceptualize that opening an artery could help patients with large vessel occlusion stroke. Whereas multiple anterior circulation LVO trials demonstrated the efficacy of endovascular therapy starting in 2014, proof of benefit for BAO was lacking until 2022. In this commentary, we reflect on how the BASICS (Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study) and BEST (Basilar Artery Occlusion: Endovascular Interventions vs Standard Medical Treatment) trials lay the foundations for clinical trials in BAO, subsequently leading to the positive results of the ATTENTION (Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar-Artery Occlusion) and BAOCHE (Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular) trials.

Literature search

For each PICO question, search terms were prepared by the MWG and a guideline methodologist. Where an existing and validated search strategy was available (eg, from an existing systematic review), it was used or adapted. If a question of interest had recently undergone an appropriate systematic review, the corresponding search strategy and identified references were used, combined, and updated as necessary. The search strategies are described in online supplemental table 3.

The search per se was conducted by the ESO Guideline methodologist Salman Hussain. The Ovid MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from the inception to January 13, 2023. Reference lists of review articles, authors' personal reference libraries, and previous guidelines were also searched for additional relevant records. The search was validated with multiple references provided for the validation process by all MWG members and matched each specific PICO question. Finally, the search was updated in PubMed until February 20, 2024.

The search results from MEDLINE and Embase were uploaded to the web-based Covidence platform (Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) for review by the MWG. Two or more MWG members were assigned to independently screen the titles and abstracts of publications registered in the Covidence platform and then evaluate the full text of potentially relevant studies. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between two reviewers or a third MWG member (including one of the chairpersons).

RCTs were prioritized, but due to limited randomized data, health registry data analyses, observational studies (minimum size: 20 subjects), and systematic reviews or meta-analyses of observational studies were also considered. Only angiography-verified BAO studies in adults published in English were considered. We excluded publications of only abstracts and protocols.

### Acute basilar artery occlusion: endovascular interventions vs standard medical treatment (BEST) [^113ZDSPn]. ClinicalTrials (2015). Low credibility.

Study Overview This clinical trial is designed to compare the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment plus standard medical therapy with standard medical therapy alone for acute BA occlusion presented within 8 h of estimated occlusion time. There is only one ongoing clinical trial-Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional intra-arterial treatment after intravenous treatment in 750 patients with BA occlusion, which was anticipated to be completed in Oct 2017. Initiation of intra-arterial therapy should be feasible within 6 hours of estimated time of BA occlusion. And patients are required to have an NIHSS ≥ 10 at time of randomization, and take IV rt-PA, age between 18–85 years old.

In this trial, the investigators did not have age or NIHSS score limit, patients who did not fulfill the requirements for IV rt-PA can also be included into the trial, the investigators also extended the time window to 8 hours which will accelerate the recruitment of potential subjects. In endovascular treatment arm, the time interval between randomization to procedure finish will be controlled within 120 mins. The preparation of endovascular treatment will start immediately after randomization for those eligible patients for IV rt-PA within 4. 5 hours after acute stroke onset, with no need to wait for the one-hour rt-PA infusion. A positive trial will suggest substantial clinical benefit from endovascular treatment plus standard medical therapy over standard medical therapy. This trial may provide novel evidence of adopting endovascular treatment for acute patients with BA occlusion, which may consequently advance our current approach for acute stroke treatment.

### Intra-arterial treatment for basilar artery occlusion… [^115njajV]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Exposures Intra-arterial treatment by mechanical thrombectomy and/or IA thrombolysis. Main Outcomes and Measures Adequate recanalization was defined as a score of 2b or 3 on the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score. Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale of 0 to 3 at first follow-up. Imaging data on the patency of the vertebral arteries and posterior communicating arteries, as well as the presence of cerebellar arterial anastomosis, were recorded and posttreatment imaging results were reviewed. After clinical evaluation, BAO was diagnosed with computed tomographic angiography or magnetic resonance angiography and subsequently confirmed with conventional angiography. Intra-arterial treatment consisted of IA thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or a combination of both, based on the judgment of the operator.

Intra-arterial therapy was given either as primary treatment or add-on to intravenous therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was administered to eligible patients, in accordance with current management guidelines. In addition, we assessed whether the PICA-SCA and posterior communicating artery collaterals provided filling of the basilar tip. For each collateral subgroup, and for various combinations, the influence of patency on functional outcome was investigated. In 7 patients, only pharmacological therapy was applied with IA urokinase. In 1 case, mechanical thrombectomy could not be performed because of extensive tortuosity of the vertebral artery and no IA treatment was administered. Adequate recanalization was achieved in 34 cases. However, despite application of the newest techniques, outcome after acute BAO remains poor for many patients.

It is still a devastating condition with enormous potential benefit from recanalization therapy, just as is the case for severe ischemic stroke in the anterior circulation. 19, 20 Successful recanalization after large-vessel occlusion, including BAO, is associated with better outcome, 6, 21, 22 and the chance of recanalization is higher with additional IA treatment. 5, 23 These findings, together with the improved outcome rates from recent years, can serve as circumstantial evidence for the effectiveness of IA interventions in BAO, even in the absence of a randomized clinical trial.

All three studies were deemed to have serious-to-critical level of bias (Figure 1.1), including selection bias (possibly including contraindication to IVT as a reason why IVT was not administered in the control group) and a major risk of confounding (notably confounding by indication).

No formal meta-analysis was conducted due to not only serious but critical limitations of the available studies. The MWG concludes that there is insufficient evidence to provide evidence-based recommendations on this PICO question.

### Contact aspiration versus stent retriever thrombectomy for acute basilar artery occlusion (ANGEL-COAST): rationale and design of a multicentre, prospective, randomised, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial [^113pDECM]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Contact aspiration (CA) and stent retriever (SR) thrombectomy are two equally recommended first-line endovascular techniques for treating acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. Whether CA is more effective in achieving complete reperfusion compared with SR in patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (ABAO) remains unclear.

Aim

This study aims to compare the efficacy and safety of CA versus SR as the first-line strategy during endovascular treatment in improving the rates of first-pass effect (FPE) for patients with ABAO.

Methods and Design

The ANGEL-COAST study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised controlled, open-label, blinded-endpoint (PROBE) clinical trial. Patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to ABAO within 24 hours from symptom onset will be recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the CA or SR group. If the assigned treatment fails after three attempts, investigators may opt for alternative treatment strategies based on their clinical judgement.

Study Outcomes

The primary endpoint is the FPE rate, defined as eTICI (Extended Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction) 2C/3 recanalisation after the first thrombectomy attempt without any rescue strategy. Key secondary endpoints include rates of modified FPE (eTICI ≥ 2b50), successful recanalisation (eTICI ≥ 2b50, eTICI ≥ 2b67, eTICI3) within ≤ 3 passes with the assigned device on conclusion of the procedure, procedural duration, use of rescue techniques and functional outcomes at 90 days, including modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 0–2 and mRS ordinal shift analysis. Safety outcomes include the rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (sICH) at 36 ± 12 hours, all-cause 90-day mortality and procedure-related serious adverse events.

Discussion

This is a head-to-head randomised trial to directly compare CA and SR in ABAO. The findings will help establish the optimal first-line endovascular treatment strategy for ABAO, potentially improving clinical outcomes in this high-risk group.

### European Stroke Organisation and European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy guideline on acute management of basilar artery occlusion [^111mZHzh]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Analysis of current evidence

The literature search identified three RCTs addressing this PICO question. Only one trial recruited patients within 6 h of estimated symptom onset, while the other two recruited patients within 8 and 12 h.

BASICS (Endovascular Therapy for stroke due to Basilar-Artery Occlusion) was a multicentre, international, open-label with blinded outcome assessment RCT of EVT for BAO conducted at 23 centres in seven countries. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio within 6 h of the estimated time of onset to receive EVT (intervention) or BMT (control), which was IVT in 80% of patients. At the beginning of recruitment, patients were eligible if they were younger than 85 years of age and had an NIHSS score of 10 or more. After the inclusion of 91 patients, inclusion criteria were expanded to allow recruitment of patients, who were 85 years of age or older, those who had an NIHSS score of less than 10, and those who had contraindications to IVT. The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome, defined as a mRS score of 0–3. A total of 300 patients were enrolled (154 in the EVT group and 146 in the BMT group). There was no difference in the proportion of patients with a good outcome (mRS 0–3 at 3 months: 44% EVT vs. 38% BMT, RR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.92–1.50), favourable outcome (mRS 0–2) or distribution of mRS scores. sICH occurred in 4.5% of patients after EVT and in 0.7% of those after BMT (RR, 6.9; 95% CI: 0.9–53.0).

### Is more evidence needed for thrombectomy in basilar artery occlusion? The BASICS and BEST meta-analytical approaches [^116UtvFG]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Thrombectomy RCTs designed for the enrollment of BAO-associated stroke patients were eligible for inclusion. The only exclusion criterion was the endovascular intervention time window: only early (6–8 hours) thrombectomy was considered. The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched for articles in any language inception to October 2020. The descriptors ((basilar) OR (vertebrobasilar)) AND (stroke) AND (thrombectomy) were used within the filter 'RCT'. The ClinicalTrials.gov database was also searched.

A Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis was modelled with a prior choice of µ effect parameter based on the results of the HERMES collaboration, in which thrombectomy was associated with a higher odd of modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0–3 at 90 days (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.80 to 2.82). Thus, a Gaussian prior with mean 0.811 (2.25 in the logarithmic OR scale) and SD 0.414 (percentile 2.5 corresponding to the null effect, since a prior hypothesis of a thrombectomy deleterious effect was highly unlikely) was appropriate (online supplemental figure 1). A conservative prior distribution was chosen for the heterogeneity parameter τ (half-Normal, scale 0.5). The code (R language, bayesmeta 2.5) and data are available on request to the authors. The PRISMA guidelines was followed.

### Therapeutic basilar artery occlusion for management of medically refractory basilar artery stenosis: case report [^113gvhz1]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

To describe a novel therapeutic approach (endovascular basilar artery occlusion) to a notoriously difficult-to-manage clinical condition (actively symptomatic high-grade basilar artery stenosis) on the basis of assessment of the patient-specific mechanism of disease.

Clinical Presentation

An 81-year-old woman presented with recurrent episodes of brainstem ischemia refractory to aggressive medical therapy. Cerebral angiography revealed a high-grade proximal basilar artery stenosis. On the basis of clinical presentation and angiographic findings, the pathogenesis of this complex of symptoms was thought to be embolic rather than hemodynamic.

Intervention

Endovascular coil occlusion of the basilar artery was used, with excellent outcome (cessation of ischemic symptoms and independent level of functioning at 1 yr).

Conclusion

Successful endovascular management of intracranial occlusive disease requires understanding of the mechanism responsible for the patient's symptoms.

PICO 6

For adults with BAO-related acute ischemic stroke, does selection of reperfusion therapy (EVT or IVT) candidates based on advanced imaging criteria (perfusion, core, or collateral imaging) compared with no advanced imaging improve identification of patients with a therapy effect on outcomes?

Analysis of current evidence

The literature search did not identify any published RCTs addressing this PICO question, but identified one post-hoc analysisderived from a Chinese registry-based observational study.

The BASILAR registry has been described in PICO questions 2 and 3. Patients with evaluated Basilar Artery on CT Angiography (BATMAN) score were included in the analysis (n = 828). The primary efficacy outcome was good functional status, defined as mRS scores of 0 to 3 at 3 months. The secondary efficacy outcomes included functional independence defined as mRS score of 0 to 2 at 3 months, and successful reperfusion.

In all three categories of the BATMAN score (0–3, 4–6, and 7–10), EVT+BMT was associated with higher odds in achieving better outcomes and lower mortality compared with BMT (approximately 80% conventional treatment with antiaggregatory or anticoagulation). P-value for interaction was 0.52.

The study presented moderate confounding bias (figure 5), since there were several significant baseline differences between the different treatment groups.

Figure 5
PICO 6 - Risk of bias in an observational study.

Thus, the only study relevant to this PICO question evaluated the effect of collateral flow. No other advanced imaging criteria were found to be tested.

PICO 7

For adults with BAO-related AIS without contraindication for IVT, does direct EVT compared with EVT plus IVT improve outcomes?

Analysis of current evidence

The literature search identified no randomized trials and three prospective cohort studies as relevant for this PICO.

Nie et al. reported post-EVT outcomes in patients with and without concurrent IVT in a prospective multicenter RESCUE-RE cohort study accompanied by a meta-analysis of the existing literature. The RESCUE-RE study enrolled patients with AIS due to vertebrobasilar occlusion that were 18 years or older, had a pre-stroke mRS score of 0 to 2 and were followed up for 3 months. IVT, if indicated, was administered within 4.5 hours from symptom onset (0.9 mg alteplase/ kg). Between July 2018 to October 2020, 1701 patients were enrolled in the registry, of which 321 patients were included in the study.

### European Stroke Organisation and European Society for Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy guideline on acute management of basilar artery occlusion [^111f3mTP]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the quality of evidence and formulation of recommendations

The risk of bias of each included RCT was assessed with the Cochrane Rob2 tool. As recommended, the evidence synthesis did not use a quality 'score' threshold but classified overall risk of bias at study level and then in aggregate. The risk of bias of included NRSIs were assessed with the Cochrane ROBINS-I tool.

The results of the data analysis were imported into the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool (McMaster University, 2015; developed by Evidence Prime, Inc.). For each PICO question and the primary outcome, the following were considered: risk of bias based on available evidence (randomised or observational studies); considerations on inconsistency of results; indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and other possible bias. The GRADE evidence profiles/summary of findings tables were generated and used to prepare recommendations. 'Evidence-based Recommendations' were based on the GRADE methodology. The direction, strength and formulation of the recommendations were determined according to the GRADE evidence profiles and the ESO-SOP.

Finally, expert consensus statements were added whenever the MWG members considered that there was insufficient evidence available to provide evidence-based recommendations and where practical guidance is needed for routine clinical practice. The expert consensus statements were based on voting by 10 senior expert MWG members with voting rights. Importantly, these expert consensus statements should not be regarded as evidence-based recommendations, since they only reflect the opinion of the writing group.

Drafting of the document, revision and approval

Each PICO question is addressed in distinct sections in line with the updated ESO SOP.

First, 'Analysis of current evidence' summarises current pathophysiological considerations followed by a summary and discussion of the results of the identified RCTs and other studies.

Second, 'Additional information' was provided when more details on the studies referred to in the first section has been needed to provide information on key subgroup analyses of the included studies, on ongoing or future RCTs, and on other studies, which can provide important clinical guidance on the topic.

Third, an 'Expert Consensus Statement' paragraph has been added whenever the MWG considered that there is insufficient evidence to make evidence-based recommendations for situations in which practical guidance is needed for everyday clinical practice.

The Guideline document was reviewed several times by all MWG members and modified using a Delphi approach until a consensus was reached. The final submitted document was peer-reviewed by two external reviewers, two members of the ESO Guideline Board and one member of the ESO Executive Committee.

### Intra-arterial revascularization therapy for basilar artery occlusion-a systematic review and analysis [^117N1igV]. Neurosurgical Review (2016). Low credibility.

Acute basilar artery occlusion has been managed aggressively with various modalities due to its potentially debilitating outcome. While intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy with stentriever has established clear evidence for anterior circulation stroke with large vessel occlusion as an adjunct to intravenous thrombolysis or the sole modality in intravenous thrombolysis ineligible patients, similar high-level evidence was not available for intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy of posterior circulation stroke with acute basilar artery occlusion. We hence perform a systematic review of current literature to compare intra-arterial pharmacological thrombolysis (IA-P) and intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (IA-MT) for acute basilar artery occlusion. Forty-one studies published between 1996 and 2015 were compared and studied by odds ratio analysis using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratio estimation, and time trend analysis using meta-regression. Patients in the IA-MT group were older, presented with more severe stroke, and more likely received treatment more than 12 h since onset of stroke. At 3 months, survival and clinical outcome were superior in the IA-MT group than the IA-P group, associated with higher recanalization rate. There were no difference between proportion of dependent survivors, and rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage across groups. Intra-arterial thrombolysis with mechanical devices led to improved survival, better short-term clinical outcome and higher recanalization rate than intra-arterial pharmacological thrombolysis.

Results

PICO 1

For adults with BAO-related acute ischemic stroke presenting within 24 hours from time last known well, does intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) alone compared with no IVT improve outcomes?

Analysis of current evidence

The literature search did not identify any RCTs specifically addressing this PICO question, which focused on the comparison between IVT and no IVT. Although BAO was not an exclusion criterion in the pivotal IVT trials, it is very likely that the number of patients with BAO included in these trials was very small. This is primarily because the majority of patients enrolled in these trials did not undergo vascular imaging. Additionally, BAO accounts for only approximately 1–2% of all AISs and is often associated with a very severe neurological deficit, which was an exclusion criterion in the ECASS trials. Therefore, the results of the available IVT trials cannot be directly applied to patients with acute BAO.

Our literature search identified three observational studies (all with critical bias, as shown in figure 1) comparing IVT vs no IVT. These studies were included in a meta-analysis. The Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) international prospective registry recruited 592 consecutive patients with acute symptomatic BAO (mean age: 63, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score: 22) between 2002 and 2007. The treatment, which was left to the discretion of each investigator, was heterogeneous and divided into three groups for the main analysis: "antithrombotic therapy only" (antiplatelets or anticoagulation mostly by heparin; n = 183), "primary IVT" (n = 121) which included subsequent intra-arterial thrombolysis in 41 (33.9%) patients, and "intra-arterial therapy only" (n = 179). Functional outcome was assessed at 1 month and the presentation of the results was stratified by clinical severity (severe deficit: coma, locked-in state, tetraplegia; mild-to moderate severity: any other situation). Compared with "antithrombotic therapy only", patients in the "primary IVT" group tended to have a lower probability of mRS ≥ 4 at 1 month in case of severe deficit (adjusted RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.01) but not in case of mild-to-moderate deficit (adjusted RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.45; p for interaction not provided).

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) due to anterior cerebral, vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery occlusions within 6 hours — although the benefits are uncertain, the use of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers may be reasonable for carefully selected patients in whom treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset and who have causative occlusion of the anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or posterior cerebral arteries.

### Outcome in patients with basilar artery occlusion treated conventionally [^116HQQNJ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Most data on the outcome of basilar artery occlusion are from recent case series of patients treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis. The limited knowledge on the outcome after a conventional treatment approach comes from a few small case series of highly selected patients.

Objective

To provide more data on the outcome of conventional treatment.

Methods

Data were analysed on patients from three centres with symptomatic basilar artery occlusion treated conventionally. Conventional therapy was defined as treatment with antiplatelets, anticoagulation, or both.

Results

Data were available on 82 patients. The case fatality was 40%. Among survivors, 65% remained dependent (Rankin score 4–5). Patients younger than 60 years (odds ratio = 3.1 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 9.5)) and those with a minor stroke (OR = 3.1 (1.0 to 9.6)) were more likely to have a good outcome (Rankin score 0–3). Patients with a progressive stroke were less likely to have a good outcome (OR = 0.3 (0.08 to 1.2)) than patients with a maximum deficit at onset or fluctuating symptoms at presentation.

Conclusions

Conventional treatment of symptomatic basilar artery occlusion is associated with a poor outcome in almost 80% of patients, which emphasises the importance of the search for a more effective treatment approach.

### Acute basilar artery occlusion in the basilar artery international cooperation study: does gender matter? [^114ici31]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Randomized trials suggested a different benefit of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) between men and women with anterior circulation stroke because of a worse outcome of women in the control group.

Methods

We compared outcome and recanalization in men and women with basilar artery occlusion treated with antithrombotic treatment alone, IVT or combined IVT-IAT, or IAT in the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study.

Results

Overall, 389 male and 226 female patients were analyzed. In the antithrombotic treatment group, 68 of 111 (61%) men and 47 of 70 (67%) women had a poor outcome defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.24), in the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group, 47 of 77 (61%) men and 24 of 43 (56%) women (aRR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.89 to 1.60), and in the IAT group, 142 of 185 (77%) men and 71 of 102 (70%) women (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.17). Mortality was not different between men and women in the antithrombotic treatment group (aRR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.55 to 1.16), the IVT/combined IVT-IAT group (aRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.73), or in the IAT group (aRR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.36). Insufficient recanalization after combined IVT-IAT or IAT was similar in men and women (23% versus 22%; aRR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.46).

Conclusions

In patients with acute basilar artery occlusion, no significant gender differences for outcome and recanalization were observed, regardless of treatment modality.

### Endovascular treatment versus standard medical treatment for basilar artery occlusion: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114TUXFU]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Acute ischemic stroke caused by basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is devastating, but the optimal treatment for patients with BAO remains controversial. In this study, the authors aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment (ET) versus standard medical treatment (SMT) in patients with BAO.

Methods

The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The primary outcome was good functional outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0–3 at 90 days. The secondary efficacy outcome was excellent functional outcome defined as an mRS score of 0–2 at 90 days. The safety outcomes included mortality at 90 days and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH). Subgroup analyses were carried out based on race (Asian or non-Asian).

Results

Four RCTs of 988 patients (556 in the ET group and 432 in the SMT group) were included in this meta-analysis. The proportion of good functional outcome in the ET group was significantly higher than that in the SMT group (45.1% vs 29.6%; number needed to treat 6.45; RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16–2.06; p = 0.003, I2 = 60%). The subgroup analysis based on race showed a significant difference between Asian and non-Asian race in the primary outcome (p = 0.03, I2 = 78.5%). Patients in the ET group had a higher rate of excellent functional outcome at 90 days than those in the SMT group (34.9% vs 20.6%; RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07–3.12; p = 0.03, I2 = 80%). Patients in the ET group had a lower mortality at 90 days (35.6% vs 45.4%; RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66–0.89; p = 0.0007, I2 = 0%) but a higher rate of sICH (5.4% vs 0.5%; RR 8.29, 95% CI 2.49–27.66; p = 0.0006, I2 = 0%) than those in the SMT group.

Conclusions

ET may improve the functional outcome and reduce mortality at 90 days but increase the risk of sICH compared with SMT in patients with BAO. This conclusion needs to be confirmed in non-Asian populations in future studies. Systematic review registration no.: CRD42022357718 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with basilar artery occlusion (intravenous thrombolysis), ESMINT/ESO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV thrombolysis, if not contraindicated, in adult patients with basilar artery occlusion-related AIS presenting within 4.5 hours, 4.5–12 hours, or 12–24 hours from the time last known well without extensive ischemic changes in the posterior circulation (extensive bilateral and/or brainstem ischemic changes).

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) with anterior cerebral, vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral artery occlusion — uncertain benefit option: Although the benefits are uncertain, the use of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retrievers may be reasonable for carefully selected patients with AIS in whom treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset and who have causative occlusion of the anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery, or posterior cerebral arteries.

### Recanalization of acute basilar artery occlusion improves outcomes: a meta-analysis [^112QSuAi]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a catastrophe with high mortality and disability. Randomized controlled trial (RCT) data supporting/refuting reperfusion treatment are sparse in acute BAO. The study objective was to pool risk estimates for death or dependency (DoD), mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from published studies on BAO.

Methods

Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched through August 2013 for studies of reperfusion therapies in acute BAO. Two independent authors selected studies and abstracted the data. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and mean weighted probabilities (MWP) were calculated using random effects model.

Results

45 studies (n = 2056) met the inclusion criteria. Recanalization was associated with a lower risk of DoD (RR 0.67; number needed to treat (NNT) 3) and mortality (RR 0.49; NNT 2.5). ICH rate (MWP) with acute therapies was 13%. With recanalization, RR for DoD in those treated ≤ 12h was 0.63, and for those treated > 12h, it was 0.67. With recanalization, RR for DoD in the intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) subgroup was 0.68; in the intra-arterial/endovascular therapy (IA/EVT) subgroup, DoD RR was 0.67. Recanalization resulted in mortality RR of 0.46 in those treated ≤ 12h; for > 12h group, RR was 0.50. Recanalization resulted in mortality RR of 0.53 in the IVT subgroup, and RR of 0.48 in the IA/EVT subgroup. ICH rate for ≤ 12h was 10%; ICH rate for > 12h was 14%. With IVT, the ICH rate was 9%, and with IA/EVT the ICH rate was 14%.

Conclusions

Recanalization of acute BAO leads to reduction in mortality by two-fold and reduction in the risk of DoD by 1.5-fold. This study underscores the equipoise in acute BAO for comparing systemic and endovascular therapies, and testing different time windows through RCTs.

### Endovascular thrombectomy versus standard medical treatment for stroke patients with acute basilar artery occlusion: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ciPqG]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Whether endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is superior to standard medical treatment (SMT) for stroke patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of EVT with SMT for treating BAO patients.

Methods

Papers were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was favorable functional outcomes at 3 months (defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 3). A random effect model was used to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per outcome.

Results

Five articles, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four observational cohort studies, comprising 1484 patients (1024 in the EVT group and 460 in the SMT group), were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated no significant differences between the EVT and SMT groups in achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months (RR = 1.63, 95%CI 0.90, 2.96; p = 0.11). However, patients in the EVT group had higher rates for symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (RR = 6.22, 95%CI 2.06 to 18.76; p = 0.001) but lower mortality at 3 months (RR = 0.72, 95%CI 0.56 to 0.91; p = 0.007) than patients in the SMT group.

Conclusion

Among patients with BAO, EVT and SMT did not differ significantly in achieving favorable functional outcomes at 3 months, but BAO patients treated with EVT might have lower mortality at 3 months. RCTs are warranted to further assess the efficacy and safety of EVT for BAO patients.

### Basilar artery occlusion [^1123qE5Y]. The Lancet: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

The clinical presentation of basilar artery occlusion (BAO) ranges from mild transient symptoms to devastating strokes with high fatality and morbidity. Often, non-specific prodromal symptoms such as vertigo or headaches are indicative of BAO, and are followed by the hallmarks of BAO, including decreased consciousness, quadriparesis, pupillary and oculomotor abnormalities, dysarthria, and dysphagia. When clinical findings suggest an acute brainstem disorder, BAO has to be confirmed or ruled out as a matter of urgency. If BAO is recognised early and confirmed with multimodal CT or MRI, intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment can be undertaken. The goal of thrombolysis is to restore blood flow in the occluded artery and salvage brain tissue; however, the best treatment approach to improve clinical outcome still needs to be ascertained.

### Mechanical thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion: efficacy, outcomes, and futile recanalization in comparison with the anterior circulation [^111uajCF]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In selected patients treated with MT, similar outcomes can be achieved in BAO and ACLVO. Patients with BAO in whom recanalization could be achieved, had lower mortality and rate of sICH than those with unsuccessful recanalization, without effect heterogeneity in comparison with ACLVO. The aim of MT should be complete recanalization. RCTs comparing patient selection and interventional strategies to avoid futile interventions seem warranted.

### Endovascular treatment with or without intravenous alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke due to basilar artery occlusion [^113odvqt]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) accounts for about 2% of all stroke cases and has a high mortality rate and risk of disability, even after successful recanalisation. Reperfusion therapy might improve the prognosis of patients with BAO but with very limited evidence.

Pivotal randomised controlled trials (RCTs) confirmed that patients who had acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) with anterior-circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) could benefit from intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular treatment (EVT) up to 24 hours from stroke onset. Safety of EVT in patients with BAO has been proven in recent two RCTs. However, the efficacy of EVT was not superior to that of medical treatment in patients with BAO by the current evidence. Only one cohort study found that EVT had a marginal effect on improving functional outcomes. Most centres apply recanalisation therapies for BAO up to 12–24 hours after symptom onset, which is a substantially longer time window than the 6 hours recommended by current guidelines.

Recent RCTs indicated that direct endovascular treatment (DEVT) was non-inferior to bridging treatment within 4.5 hours of onset in patients who had AIS with an anterior-circulation LVO. However, the specific effect of IVT first followed by EVT in patients with posterior-circulation LVO remains unclear. The proportion of prior IVT ranged from 18.4% to 78.4% in the reported BAO trials, which is much lower than in the anterior-circulation LVO trials (approximately 80%). A recently published subgroup analysis of the Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS) illustrated that the efficacy of EVT was marginally better with bridging therapy in patients with BAO (OR, 1.16–2.70 (95% CI 0.88 to 8.11) vs 1.08 (95% CI 0.53 to 2.23)), but without statistical significance.

### Revascularization of arterial occlusions in posterior circulation acute ischemic stroke [^116pzyRe]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights the latest advancements achieved in the revascularization of arterial occlusions associated with an acute ischemic stroke affecting the posterior circulation. It delves into the frequency and outcomes based on specific arterial segments and presents current evidence supporting revascularization treatments, including intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy.

Recent Findings

Comprehensive evidence for treatment across major arterial segments of the posterior circulation — vertebral artery, basilar artery, posterior cerebral artery, cerebellar arteries, and multilevel posterior occlusions — is provided. Additionally, the latest findings from randomized clinical trials on basilar artery occlusion are explored alongside results from extensive retrospective analyses of isolated vertebral and posterior cerebral artery occlusions.

Summary

Current research supports the treatment decision in acute ischemic strokes of the posterior circulation using both intravenous thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. This review also emphasizes existing knowledge gaps in the management of these strokes and advocates for more randomized clinical trials, notably concerning the posterior cerebral artery (currently ongoing), isolated vertebral artery, and multilevel posterior circulation occlusions.

### Current concepts in imaging and endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke: implications for the clinician [^111BnbQM]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute basilar artery occlusion

Approximately 20% of all ischemic strokes occur in the posterior circulation; this group includes patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO), who have a very poor prognosis. For instance, in the prospective Basilar Artery International Cooperation Registry Study (BASICS), 402 (68%) out of the 592 analyzed patients had a poor clinical outcome, defined as a mRS of 4 or 5 or death at 1 month. The superiority of EVT over IV thrombolysis (IVT) was not supported in this study, and so the authors suggested to set up RCTs to evaluate the efficacy of EVT versus IVT only in patients with an acute BAO. Although mechanical thrombectomy in the basilar artery can be performed quite successfully (Fig. 7), EVT in BAO has not yet been studied in large RCTs. The follow-up of the BASICS registry, so-called BASICS trial, was designed as a multicenter open-label phase III interventional RCT, assessing the efficacy and safety of EVT in patients with BAO. Patients were randomized between additional EVT followed by optimal medical care versus optimal medical care alone. However, after inclusion of the first patient in October 2011, patient recruitment has been exceeding slow and the trial is still ongoing. It is not unthinkable that many patients, who should have been included in the study, are simply treated by EVT on an individual basis. It seems likely that patient selection is therefore skewed towards patients with a more doubtful prognosis; this can create a significant study bias resulting in a less favorable study outcome regarding EVT in BAO.

### Endovascular therapy for acute vertebrobasilar occlusion (VERITAS): a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^113VihtW]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Trials of endovascular therapy for basilar artery occlusion, including vertebral occlusion extending into the basilar artery, have shown inconsistent results. We aimed to pool data to estimate safety and efficacy and to explore the benefit across pre-specified subgroups through individual patient data meta-analysis.

Methods

VERITAS was a systematic review and meta-analysis that pooled patient-level data from trials that recruited patients with vertebrobasilar ischaemic stroke who were randomly assigned to treatment with either endovascular therapy or standard medical treatment alone. We included studies done between Jan 1, 2010, and Sept 1, 2023. The primary outcome was 90-day favourable functional status (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score 0–3, with a score of 3 indicating moderate disability). Safety outcomes were symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and 90-day mortality.

Findings

We screened 934 titles and abstracts. Of these, seven (< 1%) full texts were screened. We included four trials (ATTENTION, BAOCHE, BASICS, and BEST). The pooled data included 988 patients (556 [56%] in the intervention groups and 432 [44%] in the control groups; median age 67 years [IQR 58–74]; 686 (69%) were male and 302 (31%) were female). 904 (91%) patients were randomly assigned within 12 h of estimated stroke onset. Three RCTs were done in a Chinese population and one included European and Brazilian patients. The proportion of patients achieving favourable functional status was higher in the endovascular therapy than control group (90-day mRS score 0–3 in 251 [45%] participants vs 128 [30%]; adjusted common odds ratio 2.41 [95% CI 1.78–3.26]; p < 0.0001). Endovascular therapy led to an increase in functional independence (mRS score 0–2 in 194 [35%] participants vs 89 [21%]; 2.52 [1.82–3.48]; p < 0.0001) as well as a reduction in both the degree of overall disability (2.09 [1.61–2.71]; p < 0.0001) and mortality (198 [36%] of 556 patients vs 196 [45%] of 432; 0.60 [0.45–0.80]; p < 0.0001) at 90 days, despite higher rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (30 [5%] of 548 vs two [< 1%] of 413; 11.98 [2.82–50.81]; p < 0.0001). Heterogeneity of treatment effect was noted for baseline stroke severity (uncertain effect in baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale < 10) and occlusion site (greater benefit with more proximal occlusions) but not across subgroups defined by age, sex, baseline posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, presence of atrial fibrillation or intracranial atherosclerotic disease, and time from onset to imaging.

Interpretation

VERITAS supports the robust benefit of endovascular therapy in patients with vertebrobasilar artery occlusion with moderate to severe symptoms, with approximately 2.5-times increased likelihood of achieving a favourable functional outcome. Despite a significant increase in symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage risk, endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar artery occlusion was associated with a significant reduction in both overall disability and mortality. Although the benefit of endovascular therapy remains uncertain for patients vertebrobasilar artery occlusion presenting with mild stroke severity and extensive infarcts on neuroimaging, we found a significant clinical benefit across a range of patients with vertebrobasilar artery occlusion.

Discussion

This guideline has been developed following the GRADE methodology and it aims to assist physicians in decision-making in the acute management of BAO. All recommendations and Expert Consensus Statements are summarized in table 7. Whenever possible, we based our recommendations on RCTs or meta-analyses of RCTs. However, we found that randomized data were mostly scarce or lacking. This was expected given the catastrophic prognosis of BAO, due to which randomized trials of reperfusion therapies compared with conventional treatment (comprising antiplatelets or anticoagulation) may not be considered ethical. Hence, we also used data from NRSIs, which are more prone to selection bias and confounding, however, we followed the Cochrane recommendations for combining data from RCTs and NRSIs.

Table 7
Synoptic table of all recommendations and Expert Consensus Statements

Cochrane methodology, GRADE, is the cornerstone of ESO guidelines. The rigorous approach of this methodology can explain the very low quality of evidence for EVT in PICO 2 and 3. The robustness of this system is underscored by the fact that the same evaluation was performed in other available meta-analyses of the same RCTs, including investigators from China. According to a recent meta-analysis of RCTs, the associations reported in the Asian trials were not robust, as indicated by a low fragility index for every outcome and heterogeneity. We also want to point out some general observations. First, the few existing RCTs were mostly (3 out of 4 trials) performed in Asian populations with a high prevalence of ICAD compared with other populations. In these trials, EVT was compared with BMT, which included IVT only in every fourth to every third patient. According to the investigators, the latter was linked to the fact that some patients had to initially pay for the IVT. Furthermore, there might also be some differences in the system of care in patients who underwent EVT compared with those in the BMT arm. Two of these trials were positive, and one was neutral, with a very high crossover rate. In contrast, the BASICS trialrandomized patients in 23 centers, of which 20 were in Europe and three in Brazil. In this trial, 80% of patients in the BMT arm received IVT, and there was no difference in functional outcome between the arms. Second, no superiority of EVT was observed in the subgroup analyses of ATTENTION and BAOCHE RCTs, when BMT included solely IVT-treated patients. Third, the direction of the treatment effect in the forest plots of the RCTs and NRSIs were largely determined by the proportion of IVT in the BMT arms, which was further confirmed by interaction analyses. Finally, the ATTENTION and BAOCHE trials used more restrictive inclusion criteria and selected patients with a more favorable profile toward EVT-associated efficacy. This includes a prolonged time window, younger patients with minimum pre-stroke disability, and no significant ischemic changes on baseline imaging. Consequently, generalizing the findings to other patient populations may be questionable.

Materials and Methods

Decision Model

We developed a decision model using decision-analytic software (TreeAge Pro 2014, version 14.1.1.0; TreeAge, Williamstown, MA) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different imaging strategies for the diagnostic work-up of possible BAO in 63-year-old men(Figure 1). We assessed NECT, CTA, and MRI separately, as well as duplex US combined with CTA or MRI. MRI for the exclusion of BAO both consists of unenhanced sequences to exclude an intracranial hemorrhage, as well as time-of-flight MR angiography. In the combination strategies, CTA or MRI followed any abnormal duplex US result. Treatment was initiated if the test result of NECT, CTA, or MRI was positive. The time delay of treatment associated with each strategy, as well as other advantages and disadvantages were modeled. Treatment was with IV thrombolysis or antithrombotics if there were contraindications for IV thrombolysis. The 1-month modified rankin Scale (mRS) score was used to measure short-term outcome. A Markov model with a 1-year cycle length was developed to estimate long-term outcomes and costs. Further details about the decision model are given in the online-only Data Supplement.

### Significant period between presentation and diagnosis in basilar artery occlusion: five cases and the lessons learned [^1158hQGT]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Basilar artery occlusion remains a challenging pathological process. Time delay between presentation and diagnosis and treatment can be associated with poor outcome, but the low frequency and variable presentation in BAO makes rapid diagnosis difficult. Clinicians should maintain an index of suspicion for basilar artery occlusion in patients of any age who present with focal neurological symptoms that could be referable to the basilar artery. Timely vessel imaging is critical for the diagnosis and initiation of treatment in these patients.

### Intra-arterial thrombolysis for basilar artery thrombosis: trial it [^115A23dr]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

The poor prognosis for recovery of basilar artery thrombosis has led to the adoption at many institutions of intra-arterial thrombolysis as part of clinical care. However, because neither randomized clinical trials nor observational data provide evidence for treatment efficacy and there are substantial risks and costs associated with this procedure, this treatment should only be performed in the context of a randomized, controlled clinical trial subject to appropriate Institutional Review Board review and independent safety monitoring.

### Endovascular recanalization of basilar artery occlusion 80 days after symptom onset [^111he1Ju]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Acute basilar artery occlusion portends high risk of stroke and death. Thrombolysis or endovascular therapy has been limited to patients who present within hours of symptom onset. Without recanalization, acute basilar artery occlusion almost always results in death or severe disability.

Summary Of Case

We report a case of basilar artery occlusion and successful endovascular recanalization 80 days after symptom onset.

Conclusions

Endovascular therapy can be feasible and safe for symptomatic basilar artery occlusion at chronic stage.

### Mechanical thrombectomy as the primary treatment for acute basilar artery occlusion: experience from 5 years of practice [^113CKf5W]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Most studies of the treatment for acute basilar occlusion focus on intravenous or intra-arterial thrombolysis whereas data on mechanical thrombectomy as the preferred treatment for acute basilar occlusion are scarce. In this study, data are presented on 28 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy as the preferred treatment for basilar artery occlusion.

Methods

Retrospective study comprising all patients who were treated for acute basilar occlusion at the Karolinska University Hospital from September 2005 to November 2010. Favorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score of ≤ 2 at 3–8 months after thrombectomy.

Results

Of 28 patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, the proportion reaching a favorable outcome was 57% (95% CI 37% to 75%), and if there were no signs of acute infarction prior to treatment the proportion was 73% (95% CI 50% to 89%). Only 21% died (95% CI 8% to 41%).

Conclusions

The results for mechanical thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion were superior to those presented previously for intravenous and intra-arterial thrombolysis. The study suggests that mechanical thrombectomy is a method distinct from therapies based on thrombolysis and that any randomized clinical trial on treatment for acute basilar occlusion must consider mechanical thrombectomy as a separate entity.

### Adjunct intraarterial or intravenous tirofiban versus No tirofiban after successful recanalization of basilar artery occlusion stroke: the BASILAR registry [^114RhaeH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Accounting for nearly 1% of all forms of ischemic stroke, acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare and devastating neurological disorder. Across 4 randomized clinical trials, more than 40% of patients with BAO did not achieve long‐term favorable clinical outcomes with endovascular treatment (EVT) despite successful recanalization. In light of these data, exploring strategies to improve outcomes of patients with BAO is important.

Endothelial impairment, plaque disruption, and thrombus escape, which frequently occur during the process of mechanical recanalization, could lead to the activation of platelets and subsequent platelet aggregation in the cerebral vessels. Hence, use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist (eg, tirofiban) in patients with ischemic stroke has been regarded as a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists act by blocking the final pathway of platelet aggregation, decreasing the frequency of thromboembolic complications and preventing early arterial reocclusion. Though numerous studies have evaluated the role of tirofiban in patients with anterior circulation stroke, data regarding its use among BAO individuals undergoing EVT have been limited. Patients with BAO are characterized by a different clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and response to thrombolytics compared with patients with anterior circulation stroke. In addition, the heterogeneity of the administration routes of tirofiban may lead to disparate outcomes among patients with ischemic stroke. Intraarterial injection could provide higher local drug concentration and reduced time to reach effective concentration than intravenous route administration; however, it might also increase the frequency of adverse events. The optimal dosing and route of administration of tirofiban for patients with BAO receiving EVT remain unclear.

Therefore, based on our nationwide prospective BASILAR (Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion Study) registry, the present study sought to investigate the efficacy and safety of tirofiban as an adjunct therapy for patients with BAO who achieved recanalization by EVT. The optimal protocol of applying tirofiban was also explored by comparing outcomes among successfully recanalized patients with BAO receiving different administration routes of tirofiban (intraarterial+intravenous tirofiban versus intravenous tirofiban versus no tirofiban).

### Association between endovascular therapy time to treatment and outcomes in patients with basilar artery occlusion [^113riA1h]. Circulation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a devastating condition without definitive evidence to guide treatment. Whereas the association between faster treatment times with endovascular therapy (EVT) and better outcomes in anterior circulation is well established, whether this relationship exists for patients with BAO is not well delineated.

Methods

We used individual-level patient data from the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke nationwide US registry prospectively collected from January 2015 to December 2019. We identified individuals with BAO treated with EVT within 24 hours of symptom onset. The primary outcomes examined were in-hospital mortality, discharge home, ambulatory at discharge, independent at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2), substantial reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b or 3), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. Using logistic regression models, we evaluated the association between time from symptom onset to treatment with EVT and outcomes.

Results

Among 3015 patients with BAO treated with EVT, the mean age was 65.9 years, 38.8% were women, and the median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score at presentation was 17 (interquartile range, 8–26). Median onset to EVT time was 406 minutes (interquartile range, 252–688). From 2015 to 2019, there was an overall increase in the median onset to EVT times (380–411 minutes; P = 0.016) but no significant change in the proportion of patients treated within 6 hours of symptom onset (48.4%-44.0%; P = 0.17). After risk adjustment for patient and hospital-level factors, there were significantly lower odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.45–0.68]) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aOR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.32–0.84]) and significantly higher odds of ambulation at discharge (aOR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.37–2.16]), discharge home (aOR, 2.19 [95% CI, 1.73–2.77]), and independence at discharge (aOR, 2.21 [95% CI, 1.66–2.95]) when onset to EVT time was ≤ 6 hours compared with > 6 hours. The fastest decay in good outcomes per hour occurred within 6 hours of symptom onset.

Conclusions

Among patients receiving EVT for BAO, faster treatment from symptom onset was associated with improved outcomes. These findings support efforts to achieve rapid treatment with EVT for patients with BAO.

*Unadjusted studies.

For both critical outcomes (mortality and sICH) and one important outcome (mTICI 2B/3), the analyses favoured add-on antithrombotic treatment in studies including solely patients with BAO or BAO plus dominant vertebral artery occlusion, whereas no difference was noticed if we included studies, where BAO patients were only a part of posterior circulation strokes. However, it should be noted that the significant findings are mainly based on the study by Chen et al.in which no-tirofiban group had a very poor outcome (mortality 52%, sICH 10%). The authors discussed the reliability of their findings and speculated if this was due to higher frequency of previous anticoagulation, IVT, and IAT (even though the last two and cardioembolic aetiology were included as covariates in the adjusted analyses).

### Mechanical thrombectomy for basilar artery occlusion: efficacy, outcomes, and futile recanalization in comparison with the anterior circulation [^116o2TfA]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Corroborating our observations about the beneficial effect of successful recanalization, the meta-analyses by Kumar et al also reported that mortality was bisected in patients in whom successful recanalization (mTICI 2b or mTICI 3) was achieved. Although partially present on unadjusted analysis, the higher rates of moderate, favorable, and excellent functional outcome were not statistically significant after adjustment for confounders when recanalization was achieved in BAO, although this could be shown by others. The small number of patients in whom recanalization could not be achieved was associated with broad confidence intervals, which probably explains the lack of statistical significance. More importantly, the effect of achieving successful recanalization with respect to mortality rates and sICH was independent of IVT administration. Sensitivity analysis disclosed no interaction between IVT and recanalization success.

It is noteworthy that excellent recanalization (TICI 3) was more beneficial for all-cause mortality at day 90 compared with successful recanalization (TICI ≥ 2b), which could be also shown in ACLVO. Therefore, also in BAO, efforts should be made to improve the quality of recanalization by preventing or treating distal emboli.

Kumar et al concluded that the significant treatment effect of recanalization, confirmed by observational data and meta-analyses in this severe disease, would make a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare MT and the best medication-based treatment unethical. However, at least two such RCTs are currently being conducted. In our opinion, the most relevant question is not whether or not to treat patients with BAO with MT, but rather in which patients recanalization would be futile or cause long-term dependence. Therefore, RCTs comparing patient selection strategies with advanced imaging techniques and concomitant medical therapy are urgently warranted. Possible predictors for good outcome including stroke risk factors, stroke severity (NIHSS score), age, respiratory stability, thrombus length, atherosclerotic stenosis versus embolic occlusion, and collateral status have been published. They should be combined in a study protocol of patient selection in BAO to minimize the incidence of futile recanalization.

Assessment of the risk of bias is presented in Figure 3.1.

Figure 3.1.
PICO 3 – Risk of bias in randomised-controlled clinical trials.

Both trials, presented performance bias, as randomised participants and treating physicians were aware of the allocated intervention. Furthermore, minor deviations from the intended interventions were noted in both RCTs. In addition, the ATTENTION trialdid not clearly report the use of a minimization process to balance the two treatment groups with appropriate stratification, leading to some concerns about randomisation bias. Finally, the BAOCHE trialpresented minor concerns due to missing outcome data. The overall risk of bias was high both for ATTENTIONand BAOCHEtrials.

Data regarding patients presenting within 6–24 h from time last known well were available in one of the trials only as adjusted RRs with corresponding 95% CIs, without presenting the raw data. For that reason, we used a generic inverse variance meta-analysis to provide a pooled overall effect (Figure 3.2). Compared to patients randomised to BMT, the pooled adjusted RR for a good functional outcome in patients randomised to EVT was 1.90 (95% CI: 1.41–2.57; p < 0.01; I 2: 0%; Figure 3.2).

Analysis of current evidence

Currently, four large, prospective, multicentre RCTs demonstrated their results, including Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion: Endovascular Interventions vs Standard Medical Treatment (BEST), Basilar Artery International Cooperation Study (BASICS), Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion (ATTENTION) and Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular Trial (BAOCHE) trial. Among these studies, BEST (aOR 1.74, 95% CI 0.81 to 3.74) and BASICS (RR, 1.18, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.50) trials did not demonstrate the superiority of MT for achieving functional independent outcomes at 3 months (mRS 0–3) to BMM in patients with acute BAO within 8 hours or 6 hours of onset-to-puncture. In contrast, the ATTENTION trial (adjusted RR 2.06, 95% CI 1.46 to 2.91, p < 0.01) and BAOCHE trial (adjusted RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.26 to 2.60; p < 0.01) found that MT was significantly superior to BMM in achieving functional independence (mRS 0–3) at 3 months for patients with acute BAO treated within 12 hours or 6–24 hours of onset-to-puncture. The meta-analysis of the four RCTs also found that the functional independence outcomes of MT are superior to BMM for BAO (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.04; p < 0.01).

Recommendation

For patients with acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) within 12 h of onset that meet the inclusion criteria of the Endovascular Treatment for Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion and Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular Trial (BAOCHE) trials, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is recommended.

Level of evidence: A

Class of recommendation: I

For patients with acute BAO between 12 hours and 24 hours of onset that meet the inclusion criteria of the BAOCHE trials, MT is reasonable.

Treatment Decisions

In our cohort, 11 patients (11%) received IVT only, 45 patients additionally received MT (IVT + MT 47%), 30 patients received MT without thrombolysis (32%), and 10 patients received no acute recanalizing therapy in the form of MT or thrombolysis (10%; Fig. 2 b). Time windows from symptom onset to arrival at our comprehensive stroke center were not statistically significantly different between the treatment groups (Kruskal–Wallis test p = 0.5877; Supplemental Table S2). IVT initiation was often precluded by preexisting infarct demarcation (in 52.2% of the cases), prior anticoagulation, time window limitations, or bleeding risks (for details, see Supplemental Table S3). Anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy was adjusted based on individual risk profiles, including atrial fibrillation detection and stent placement. Detailed information on the secondary prevention strategies can be found in the supplementary material.

### Predictors of futile recanalization in patients with basilar artery occlusion with large versus nonlarge infarcts [^113QH2QG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Basilar artery occlusion is associated with high rates of disability and mortality, and despite advances in endovascular treatment, futile recanalization remains a challenge. This study aims to identify predictors of futile recanalization in patients with basilar artery occlusion, focusing on large and nonlarge infarcts.

Methods and Results

This multicenter retrospective study included patients from 65 centers across China. Patients were categorized based on posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT [Computed Tomography] Score (pc‐ASPECTS) into 2 groups: large infarcts (pc‐ASPECTS ≤ 6) and nonlarge infarcts (pc‐ASPECTS > 6). Predictors of futile recanalization — defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 at 90 days despite successful recanalization — were analyzed using logistic regression models. Among the 2075 patients, 1113 (53.6%) experienced futile recanalization. In patients with pc‐ASPECTS > 6, predictors of futile recanalization included older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.06–1.31]), higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores (OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.58–1.94]), and prolonged time from puncture to reperfusion (OR, 1.24 [95% CI, [1.12–1.38]). Intravenous thrombolysis (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, [0.77–0.94]) and achieving modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 3 (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, [0.74–0.90]) were associated with a lower likelihood of futile recanalization. In patients with pc‐ASPECTS ≤ 6, being male (OR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58–0.96]) and having higher pc‐ASPECTS scores (OR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48–0.85]) were protective against futile recanalization, whereas higher National Institute of Health Stroke Scale scores increased the risk (OR, 1.81 [95% CI, 1.42–2.32]).

Conclusions

This study identifies distinct predictors of futile recanalization in patients with basilar artery occlusion based on infarct size. The findings underscore the importance of individualized treatment strategies and timely intervention to optimize endovascular treatment outcomes in high‐risk patients.

Additional information

ICAD is a disease of major intracranial arteries with different manifestations, ranging from subtle arterial wall thickening to severe stenosis with vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. Depending on the study, the basilar artery is the most common or second most common affected intracranial vessel. ICAD prevalence shows marked racial/ethnical differences. In the Northern Manhattan Stroke Study, a prospective registry study of 714 patients, ICAD was the presumed cause of stroke in 9% of Caucasian patients, 15% of Hispanic, and 17% of African-American patients. ICAD is responsible for 10%–48% of all large-vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes; it is particularly common in Asia but even in Europe, up to 1 of 10 LVO strokes are caused by ICAD. In the Trevo endovascular registry, which included mainly European patients, ICAD accounted for only 10% of all EVT cases of BAO, while in the Chinese ATTENTION and BEST trials, atherosclerosis was the underlying stroke aetiology in 44%–56% of cases.

Studies comparing EVT in patients with BAO due to ICAD versus other stroke mechanisms found nominally higher numbers of rescue PTA and/or stenting in patients with underlying ICAD, – although proportions differed significantly only in one study. Despite these rescue treatments, EVT in BAO due to underlying ICAD was in most studies associated with poorer outcomes, longer procedure times and in some studies, less successful reperfusion compared to other stroke mechanisms, whereas one study found no difference in outcomes between BAO caused by ICAD compared to non-ICAD. ICAD-related occlusions are prone to re-occlude, occurring in up to 40% of patients. While the apposition thrombus that has formed adjacent to the atherosclerotic plaque can be removed by EVT alone, new thrombus may form at the thrombogenic plaque surface, thereby leading to re-occlusion This risk may be even higher after an endovascular attempt, as the traumatic fibrous cap disruption and vessel wall trauma caused by endovascular devices increase thrombogenicity even further. PTA with or without stenting can eliminate or reduce the stenosis caused by the atherosclerotic lesion, and in theory, stenting may reduce the risk of re-occlusion by covering the thrombogenic lesion. On the other hand, PTA/stenting may cause perforator occlusions by pushing plaque fragments into small perforator orifices, requiring dual antiplatelet therapy, which increases the risk of haemorrhage, particularly in cases with concomitant IVT.

Introduction

Ischaemic stroke caused by large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the vertebrobasilar arteries is a rare, but devastating, and often fatal subtype of occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Its natural course and outcome without treatment are generally regarded as dismal. For patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) not receiving reperfusion treatment, reported mortality rates in the immediate post-stroke period (0–3 months) vary between 40 and 86%. The introduction of reperfusion therapies such as intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial thrombolysis has not significantly altered mortality rates in this patient group.

Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for LVO in the anterior circulation has become standard treatment in the wake of a series of successful randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses showing superior outcome for patients treated with EVT vs conventional treatment.

In contrast, only a handful of registry studies, single- and multicentre studies, meta-analysis and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been published on endovascular treatment benefits and outcome in patients with BAO. The BEST RCT, which was stopped early due to poor recruitment and high crossover rate, did not show superiority of EVT over IVT. The newly published BASICS RCT was also neutral, although 29.9% of eligible patients were not randomized, which may have introduced selection bias, and 79% of non-randomized patients underwent EVT outside the trial. Thus, evidence is still unclear on the potential benefits of EVT for BAO. In fact, RCTs for BAO have been questioned in part on the grounds that they may result in treatment being withheld from patients who could potentially benefit, for being vulnerable to selection bias, and that the principles of EVT benefit have already been proven in RCTs in the anterior circulation. Views favouring RCTs emphasize the fact that differences in vascular anatomy between the anterior and posterior circulation may influence treatment response, making extrapolation of results from RCTs of the anterior circulation tenuous. Moreover, IVT for BAO may be more effective due to collateral flow, resulting in therapeutic effect on both ends of the thrombus. Lastly, observational studies showing superiority of EVT over IVT may also be biased (confounding by indication). Despite the limited RCT data, Swedish, European and American stroke guidelines recommend EVT in selected patients with BAO.

Combining data from two prospective registries with nationwide coverage, the present study aims to provide a comprehensive description of clinical characteristics, stroke workflow, treatment and outcome in patients receiving EVT for BAO, with stratification by lesion location.

### Recanalisation therapy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke caused by large artery occlusion: choice of therapeutic strategy according to underlying aetiological mechanism? [^114YeznU]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2015, the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) was documented in five clinical trials.MT mainly through stent retrieval has been recommended as the standard treatment for causative proximal large artery occlusion (LAO) of anterior circulation. The key criteria for MT include causative occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) or proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA), National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥ 6, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score of ≥ 6, and treatment can be initiated (groin puncture) within 6 hours of symptom onset. Use of MT was also considered reasonable for carefully selected patients who have causative occlusion of the M2 or M3 portion of the MCAs, anterior cerebral arteries, vertebral arteries, basilar artery or posterior cerebral arteries. Various mechanisms underlie causative LAO in patients with AIS. Cardioembolism (CE), in situ thrombosis (IST) on the surface of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque with severe or slight stenosis, chronic atherosclerotic occlusion, artery-to-artery embolism caused by a detached in situ thrombus or intrinsic component of a proximal atherosclerotic plaque and other rare causes such as vasculitis and dissection all can result in the similar clinical vignette of AIS associated with a LAO on angiographic imaging (figure 1). The pathophysiological changes and responses to MT and antithrombotic treatments including thrombolysis, antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy may vary among patients with different aetiological mechanisms of occlusion. However, aetiological mechanisms of LAO were not included in the recommended criteria for selecting recanalisation strategy. In this review, we summarised the pathophysiological features of causative LAO resulting from different aetiological mechanisms. Their possible impact on choice MT, antithrombotic therapeutic strategy and statin therapy was discussed.

### Revolution in acute ischaemic stroke care: a practical guide to mechanical thrombectomy [^117ERY27]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Rapid, safe and effective arterial recanalisation to restore blood flow and improve functional outcome remains the primary goal of hyperacute ischaemic stroke management. The benefit of intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator for patients with severe stroke due to large artery occlusion is limited; early recanalisation is generally less than 30% for carotid, proximal middle cerebral artery or basilar artery occlusion. Since November 2014, nine positive randomised controlled trials of mechanical thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation have led to a revolution in the care of patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Its efficacy is unmatched by any previous therapy in stroke medicine, with a number needed to treat of less than 3 for improved functional outcome. With effectiveness shown beyond any reasonable doubt, the key challenge now is how to implement accessible, safe and effective mechanical thrombectomy services. This review aims to provide neurologists and other stroke physicians with a summary of the evidence base, a discussion of practical aspects of delivering the treatment and future challenges. We aim to give guidance on some of the areas not clearly described in the clinical trials (based on evidence where available, but if not, on our own experience and practice) and highlight areas of uncertainty requiring further research.

We excluded one retrospective registry study on tirofiban vs no tirofiban for patients with vertebrobasilar occlusion (86% BAO) treated with endovascular approach within 24 hours of onsetdue to inconsistent reporting of the results. The authors were contacted several times for clarification, but they did not respond to the request.

The risk of bias is outlined in figure 9A Severity of the risk of confounding bias ranged from moderate to critical. The most common concern appearing in all observational studies was that the add-on antithrombotic agent was chosen based on periprocedural factors that differed systematically between the treatment groups, such as the number of passes or instant re-occlusion, in-situ thrombosis, or residual stenosis requiring emergency angioplasty or stenting.

Regarding another set of interaction analyses investigating the potential treatment-modifying effect on NIHSS scores, we would like to point out that the interaction analyses of this variable were typically reported in 2 or 3 categories with various cutoffs values between different studies. We observed a significant treatment-modifying effect stratified by a baseline NIHSS score of 10, favouring BMT for patients with NIHSS < 10. This is in line with a recently published meta-analysis of two RCTs. If we look at the data from the Asian RCTs, we notice that the majority of the recruited patients had extremely severe clinical symptoms on admission. In the BEST trial, the median NIHSS in the EVT arm was 32, which gives us a better understanding of the population of patients to whom the results of these trials apply. Indeed, the ATTENTION investigators stated that their results are not generalizable for patients with an NIHSS of less than 10. The effect of EVT was more visible in proximal and middle locations but less in distal occlusions.

### Computed tomography perfusion deficit volumes predict functional outcome in patients with basilar artery occlusion [^116WzBJo]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Basilar artery occlusion is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Optimal imaging and treatment strategy are still controversial and prognosis estimation challenging. We, therefore, aimed to determine the predictive value of computed tomography perfusion (CTP) parameters for functional outcome in patients with basilar artery occlusion in the context of endovascular treatment.

Methods

Patients with basilar artery occlusion who underwent endovascular treatment were selected from a prospectively acquired cohort. Ischemic changes were assessed with the posterior-circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early Computed Tomography Score on noncontrast computed tomography, computed tomography angiography (CTA) source images, and CTP maps. Basilar artery on CTA score, posterior-circulation CTA score, and posterior-circulation collateral score were evaluated on CTA. Perfusion deficit volumes were quantified on CTP maps. Good functional outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score ≤ 3 at 90 days. Statistical analysis included binary logistic regressions and receiver operating characteristics analyses.

Results

Among 49 patients who matched the inclusion criteria, 24 (49.0%) achieved a good outcome. In univariate analysis, age, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score on admission, posterior cerebral artery involvement, absence of or hypoplastic posterior communicating arteries, basilar artery on CTA score, posterior-circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early Computed Tomography Score, and perfusion deficit volumes on all CTP parameter maps presented significant association with functional outcome (P < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, Basilar artery on CTA score, posterior-circulation Acute Stroke Prognosis Early Computed Tomography Score (odds ratio range, 1.31–2.10 [95% CI, 1.00–7.24]), and perfusion deficit volumes on all CTP maps (odds ratio range, 0.77–0.98 [95% CI, 0.63–1.00]) remained as independent outcome predictors. Cerebral blood flow deficit volume yielded the best performance for the classification of good clinical outcome with an area under the curve of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.84–0.99). Age and admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale had lower discriminatory power (area under the curve, < 0.7).

Conclusions

CTP imaging parameters contain prognostic information for functional outcome in patients with stroke due to basilar artery occlusion and may identify patients with higher risk of disability at an early stage of hospitalization.

The Improving Reperfusion Strategies in Acute Ischaemic Stroke (IRIS)trial which was the pool analysis of the individual patient data level from the six RCTs did not find direct MT is non-inferior bridging MT (90-day mRS: cOR 0.89, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.04 p = 0.14).

Tenecteplase versus Alteplase Before Endovascular Therapy for Ischaemic Stroke (EXTEND-IA TNK)showed that among patients with confirmed LVO prior to planned MT, administering tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg) within 4.5 hours of onset leads to better functional outcomes at 3 months (lower median mRS) compared with alteplase treatment, with no significant differences in safety outcomes between the two.

Recommendation

Patients with indications for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) should undergo treatment as soon as possible. When meeting the criteria for thrombolysis, we recommend that alteplase should be initiated first, while simultaneously considering bridging to MT.

### Therapy of basilar artery occlusion: a systematic analysis comparing intra-arterial and intravenous thrombolysis [^116kbqc9]. Stroke (2006). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is an infrequent form of acute stroke, which invariably leads to death or long-term disability if not recanalized. A traditional recanalization approach based on historical controls and pathophysiological consideration is local intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) in eligible patients. This necessitates diagnostic evaluation and treatment in stroke centers equipped with an interventional neuroradiological service on a 24-hour basis, but its superiority to the technically simple intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) remains unproven.

Methods

We analyzed systematically published case series of substantial size reporting the outcome of BAO after IAT or IVT.

Results

In 420 BAO patients treated with IVT (76) and IAT (344), death or dependency were equally common: 78% (59 of 76) and 76% (260 of 344), respectively (P = 0.82). Recanalization was achieved more frequently with IAT (225 of 344; 65%) than with IVT (40 of 76; 53%; P = 0.05), but survival rates after IVT (38 of 76; 50%) and IAT (154 of 344; 45%) were equal (P = 0.48). A total of 24% of patients treated with IAT and 22% treated with IVT reached good outcomes (P = 0.82). Without recanalization, the likelihood of good outcome was close to nil (2%).

Conclusions

Recanalization occurs in more than half of BAO patients treated with IAT or IVT, and 45% to 55% of survivors regain functional independence. Although improved therapy forms for BAO are necessary, hospitals not equipped for IAT may set up IVT protocols. The effect of IVT is probably not much different from the effect of IAT. IVT represents probably the best treatment that can be offered to victims of acute BAO in such hospitals.

All three trials presented performance bias, as the randomised participants and the treating physicians were aware of the allocated intervention (Figure 2.1). Furthermore, minor deviations from the intended interventions were noted in two RCTs. In addition, the ATTENTION trial did not clearly report the use of a minimization process to balance the two treatment groups with appropriate stratification, leading to some concerns about randomisation bias. In the BEST trial, a high rate of crossover occurred, and the final sample size was only 38% of the planned target of 344 patients, resulting in an underpowered analysis. Furthermore, there may have been a selection bias, as one third of patients declined trial participation. Regarding indirectness, the BEST trial included patients with very severe symptoms (median NIHSS 32), while the ATTENTION trial included patients with at least 10 NIHSS points. In contrast, BASICS trial started with patients having NIHSS ⩾ 10, but the inclusion criteria were later modified to include the whole range of NIHSS scores. Furthermore, controls are not directly comparable between the three trials, because the proportion of IVT in BMT and timing of IVT administration differed significantly among the trials. Only the BASICS trial included patients with a time window of 6 h, whereas in the BEST and ATTENTION trials the time window was 8 and 12 h, respectively. However, there are remarkable differences in the definition of time windows among the trials.

### Effects of admission hyperglycemia and intravenous thrombolysis allocation in acute basilar artery occlusion after endovascular treatment: analysis of the ATTENTION registry [^112jggUw]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a devastating medical condition with a high morbidity and mortality rate. The benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) on patients with acute BAO has been confirmed in prospective registries and recent randomized clinical trials. The BAOCHE (the Basilar Artery Occlusion Chinese Endovascular trial) and ATTENTION (Endovascular treatment for acute basilar artery occlusion) demonstrated that EVT correlated with better functional outcomes compared to patients who were medically managed. While EVT is considered as an effective treatment for acute BAO, more than half of patients are left severely disabled. Therefore, early detection of patients who would benefit from EVT could enable clinicians to choose the best clinical strategy for each individual.

Hyperglycemia is a known risk factor for acute ischemic stroke (AIS), and may be associated with infarct volume expansion, secondary hemorrhage, high mortality, and poor outcome. The mechanism by which hyperglycemia may augment ischemic injury may be mediated by endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and impaired fibrinolysis. Several studies reported that large vessel occlusion (LVO) patients with hyperglycemia on admission who undergo EVT have a higher mortality rate and worse clinical outcomes than patients without hyperglycemia. A recent meta-analysis performed on AIS patients who had mechanical thrombectomy (MT) showed that higher glucose levels on admission were associated with worse long-term outcome. One study suggested that baseline serum glucose levels can be used as a modifiable parameter to increase the likelihood of improving functional outcome in BAO. Yet the findings of this study were limited by their sample size, and further analyses on larger cohorts of patients are needed. It remains uncertain whether hyperglycemia on admission has an effect on the clinical outcomes of acute BAO patients treated with EVT. Moreover, the modified effect of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) allocation was also unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate those effects in patients with acute BAO receiving EVT.
