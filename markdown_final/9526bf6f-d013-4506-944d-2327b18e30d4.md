## Question

what gestational ages can you do cell free dna testing

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking at what gestational ages cell-free DNA (cfDNA/NIPT) testing can be performed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the minimum gestational age at which fetal fraction is sufficient for reliable screening. Then, I should determine the most accurate early window and why. Next, I will check whether there is a maximum gestational age or merely a diminishing clinical utility later in pregnancy. After that, I need to consider maternal and fetal factors that shift the ideal timing, including strategies after a no-call. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and note confirmatory testing requirements and test-type nuances like fetal RHD typing and genomewide cfDNA panels.

> Let me first confirm the earliest gestational age when cfDNA testing is recommended; my initial thought was that some platforms might accept samples a bit before 10 weeks, but wait, I should verify because low fetal fraction before 10 weeks raises failure and false-negative risks. Multiple guidelines converge on 10 weeks as the minimum: SOGC advises cfDNA is highly effective when performed after 10 weeks, and ACOG/SMFM practice guidance recognizes cfDNA as the most sensitive screening test but within the framework of appropriate timing and counseling, which in practice aligns with starting at ≥ 10 weeks due to fetal fraction constraints; biologically, cfDNA from the placenta is detectable very early, yet the fetal fraction typically does not reliably clear the usual ≥ 4% threshold until around 9–10 weeks, making testing before 10 weeks prone to no-calls or inaccuracy [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo] [^112ee6d3].

> Next, I should review the optimal early window; I was going to say 10–12 weeks outright, but hold on, I should verify whether 11–13 weeks provides superior accuracy. The RHD population-based cohort demonstrated that performance becomes highly accurate from 11 weeks onward, with a marked drop in false negatives compared with testing before 11 weeks, supporting an 11–13 week sweet spot for robust fetal fraction and analytic reliability; in real-world aneuploidy screening, large prospective cohorts show median testing around 12.6 weeks, consistent with routine first-trimester practice and allowing time for follow-up diagnostic options if needed [^116CVYmM] [^115vpNdb].

> I will now examine whether there is a maximum gestational age; my first pass was to assume most programs cap at the early second trimester, but let me check if there is a hard upper limit versus a practical window. Clinical validation of cfDNA RHD typing confirms successful testing across a wide range, with gestations up to 36.7 weeks, indicating no absolute upper biological limit for cfDNA analytes, although routine aneuploidy screening is commonly undertaken between 10 and 20 weeks; the reason to prioritize earlier testing is that clinical utility wanes later because confirmatory procedures and downstream management options are more constrained in late second and third trimesters, though diagnostic amniocentesis remains feasible and informative even ≥ 24 weeks in selected scenarios [^116CVYmM] [^11236Z29].

> Let me consider factors that may shift timing within that window; I need to ensure I account for fetal fraction thresholds and determinants. Most laboratories require a minimum fetal fraction around 4% for confident analysis; higher maternal BMI correlates with lower fetal fraction, increasing no-call risk and sometimes necessitating later sampling or alternative approaches; medication and comorbidity factors, including heparin and aspirin use as well as chronic hypertension and pregestational diabetes, are associated with increased nonreportable rates; if the initial sample is a no-call due to low fetal fraction, redraw success improves with time between draws and is influenced by maternal weight and the first-draw fetal fraction; diurnal variation may also matter, with afternoon draws showing modestly higher fetal fraction than morning, which could aid borderline cases; in twins, timing is similar but achieving adequate combined fetal fraction can be more challenging, so aligning with first-trimester combined-screen results and ensuring expert counseling is prudent, with growing data supporting effective T21 screening performance in twin gestations [^112ee6d3] [^115Y1Hmt] [^111tKgJW] [^113Jd2kc] [^113xJG5f] [^112Qmq5H] [^111MuJKu].

> Hold on, I should verify test-type specific nuances; not all cfDNA applications share identical timing constraints. For fetal RHD genotyping, accuracy rises substantially from 11 weeks and remains high through later gestation, enabling use across pregnancy when clinically indicated; genomewide cfDNA screening for copy-number variants generally follows the same fetal-fraction principles and is often performed in the same early window to allow management pathways; for certain monogenic indications, specialized noninvasive approaches can be timed later if fetal fraction is higher, but they remain niche and method-dependent, often still leveraging similar biological constraints and confirmatory paradigms [^1134bxpc] [^116CVYmM] [^112JHep3] [^114McCeN].

> I should double-check that my practical recommendations align with guidelines and the evidence. Recommended protocol: earliest at 10 weeks 0 days, with an optimal window at about 11–12 weeks to maximize accuracy and leave time for confirmatory diagnostic testing when indicated; while many programs emphasize the first and early second trimester, testing can be performed later in pregnancy when clinically appropriate, understanding that management options narrow; testing before 10 weeks should be avoided due to inadequate fetal fraction and higher failure or false-negative risks; any screen-positive cfDNA result warrants genetic counseling and confirmatory diagnostic testing prior to irreversible decisions, and no-call results merit counseling, targeted ultrasound, and consideration of redraw or diagnostic testing given the elevated aneuploidy risk observed in failed assays [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo] [^1134bxpc] [^1121zAEb] [^113xJG5f].

> But wait, what if a late-presenting patient seeks screening in the third trimester; does that invalidate cfDNA utility? Hmm, wait a minute, while the absence of an absolute upper gestational limit means cfDNA can still yield results, the clinical value depends on whether results will change delivery planning or neonatal management; for RHD status in Rh-negative patients, late cfDNA testing can be directly actionable, whereas for aneuploidy screening, counseling should emphasize limitations and the potentially greater role for targeted ultrasound and, when acceptable and feasible, diagnostic testing even at advanced gestations [^116CVYmM] [^11236Z29] [^114q1utN].

> Final answer summary: cfDNA screening is reliably performed from 10 weeks' gestation onward, with the most favorable early accuracy and workflow achieved between 11 and 13 weeks; there is no strict upper limit biologically, with validated testing up to late third trimester, but the clinical utility is greatest in the first and early second trimesters when results can guide timely confirmatory diagnostics and management; testing before 10 weeks is not recommended due to low fetal fraction and increased no-call or false-negative risk; individualized timing should consider fetal fraction determinants, including maternal BMI, medications, twin gestation, and even timing of day, alongside strategies for redraw and confirmatory testing as per guideline-based counseling [^114CrwjL] [^1134bxpc] [^116CVYmM] [^112ee6d3] [^112Vo8Eo] [^113d5WDy].

---

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is recommended from 10 weeks gestation because fetal fraction is reliably sufficient for accurate results [^114CrwjL]. Testing before 10 weeks is discouraged due to low fetal fraction and higher no-call rates [^112ee6d3]. There is no strict upper gestational limit, but clinical utility declines after 24 weeks as management options narrow; cfDNA is most useful when performed between 10 and 20 weeks [^113d5WDy] [^1134bxpc]. If a no-call result occurs, a redraw after 1–2 weeks is reasonable, but persistent low fetal fraction may indicate placental dysfunction and warrants further evaluation [^113Jd2kc] [^114q1utN].

---

## Earliest gestational age for cfDNA testing

- **Earliest gestational age**: cfDNA testing is recommended from 10 weeks gestation, when fetal fraction is typically ≥ 4% and results are reliable [^114CrwjL] [^1134bxpc].

- **Rationale**: Before 10 weeks, fetal fraction is often too low, increasing no-call rates and reducing accuracy [^112ee6d3].

- **Clinical guidance**: SOGC 2024 and ACOG/SMFM 2020 recommend cfDNA as a highly effective screen for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 when performed after 10 weeks [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo] [^112Qmq5H].

---

## Optimal gestational age range for cfDNA testing

The optimal gestational age range for cfDNA testing is **10–20 weeks** [^114CrwjL], balancing accuracy with clinical utility; testing earlier in this window facilitates timely confirmatory diagnostics and management decisions [^112Vo8Eo]. Fetal fraction rises with gestational age [^1147v7gX], further improving test performance during this period [^113d5WDy].

---

## Upper gestational age limit for cfDNA testing

No strict **upper gestational age limit** exists for cfDNA testing [^1134bxpc], but clinical utility declines after 24 weeks as management options narrow. Testing can still be performed after this point, though results may have limited impact on management. Professional guidelines from SOGC and ACOG/SMFM emphasize early testing for maximal clinical benefit [^114CrwjL] [^112Vo8Eo].

---

## Factors influencing cfDNA testing accuracy by gestational age

- **Fetal fraction**: Increases with gestational age, improving accuracy [^112ee6d3]; low fetal fraction (< 4%) is a key cause of no-calls [^113d5WDy].

- **Maternal factors**: Higher BMI, heparin/aspirin use, chronic hypertension, and diabetes increase no-call rates [^111tKgJW].

- **Technical factors**: Sequencing depth and platform affect performance, especially at low fetal fraction [^113y7RnY] [^111F2cKv].

---

## Clinical implications of testing outside recommended gestational ages

- **Early testing (< 10 weeks)**: Higher no-call rates and reduced accuracy due to low fetal fraction [^112ee6d3].

- **Late testing (> 24 weeks)**: Limited clinical utility as management options narrow, though accuracy remains high if fetal fraction is adequate.

- **No-call results**: Often due to low fetal fraction; a redraw after 1–2 weeks is reasonable [^113Jd2kc], but persistent low fetal fraction may signal placental dysfunction and warrants further evaluation [^113xJG5f] [^114q1utN].

---

## Summary table: cfDNA testing by gestational age

| **Gestational age** | **Clinical utility** | **Accuracy** | **Recommendations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| < 10 weeks | Limited (low fetal fraction) | Lower (higher no-call rate) | Not recommended |
| 10–20 weeks | High (optimal window) | High (adequate fetal fraction) | Recommended |
| 20–24 weeks | Moderate (utility declines) | High (adequate fetal fraction) | Acceptable |
| > 24 weeks | Limited (fewer options) | High (if fetal fraction adequate) | Use selectively |

---

cfDNA testing is **best performed from 10 weeks** gestation, with optimal utility between 10 and 20 weeks; after 24 weeks, utility declines even though accuracy remains high if fetal fraction is sufficient.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^113xJG5f]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

Low fetal fraction (LFF) in prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is an important cause of test failure and no-call results. LFF might reflect early abnormal placentation and therefore be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. This review examines the available literature on the relationship between LFF in cfDNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

A systematic literature search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 1, 2020. Five studies met the criteria for inclusion; all were retrospective observational cohort studies. The cohort sizes ranged from 370 to 6375 pregnancies, with tests conducted in the first trimester or early second trimester.

- **Cutoff values for low fetal fraction**: A 4% cutoff for LFF was used in two studies; the other studies used the 5th and 25th percentiles, respectively, and one study used various cutoff values for LFF.

- **Associations observed**: LFF in prenatal cfDNA testing was associated with hypertensive disease of pregnancy, neonates small for gestational age, and preterm birth. Conflicting results were found regarding the association between LFF and gestational diabetes mellitus.

LFF in cfDNA testing is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, specifically pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, and impaired fetal growth related to placental dysfunction. Since the available evidence is limited, a large prospective cohort study on the relationship between fetal fraction and pregnancy outcomes is needed.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for aneuploidy and beyond: Challenges of responsible innovation in prenatal screening [^112ee6d3]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA in the blood of pregnant women is predominantly of maternal origin, with only a small proportion (~10%) deriving from the fetus, more precisely from the placenta. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) requires this 'fetal fraction' of cell-free DNA in maternal blood to be above a minimum level for adequate analysis; most laboratories set a limit at, for example, 4%. Although cell-free fetal DNA can be detected in maternal blood as early as 4 weeks of pregnancy, the fraction may not be sufficiently large if testing is conducted before nine or ten weeks. Earlier testing may therefore lead to inaccurate or failed results.

In later testing, the fetal fraction may still be too low due to maternal factors that require further investigation. A clearly established risk factor for a failed result is higher maternal body weight, which is attributed to a dilution effect and possibly increased adipocyte turnover in obese women. Reported failure rates vary considerably between laboratories, ranging from 0 to 5%. After a failed result, NIPT can be repeated, or alternative testing methods can be considered. However, this adds additional time to the screening and diagnostic process, which may influence further choices and potentially impact the feasibility of a non-surgical termination. More evidence regarding failure rates and risk factors for failed NIPT is necessary. There is also limited evidence concerning the performance of NIPT as a test for fetal aneuploidy in twin or triplet pregnancies.

### Factors associated with informative redraw after an initial no result in noninvasive prenatal testing [^113Jd2kc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) sometimes fails to provide a test result due to low cell-free DNA fetal fraction. We investigated how initial fetal fraction, maternal weight, gestational age, and time between blood sampling contribute to obtaining an informative result when a redraw is performed.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective data review of NIPT samples received between January and October 2016 by a commercial laboratory, where the initial blood draw did not yield a result, and a second sample was drawn between 5 and 28 days after the initial sampling. We included cases with fetal fraction less than 2.8% (the threshold for "no result" in this laboratory) and those with a higher fetal fraction but where the NIPT results could not be interpreted with high confidence.

- **Results**: For 4,018 cases in which a redraw was recommended, a result was obtained for the second sample in 2,835 cases (70.6%) (95% CI 69.1–72.0%). For the 2,959 cases with insufficient fetal fraction, there was a result for the second sample in 1,861 cases (62.9%) (95% CI 61.1–64.6%). For this subset, the average increase in fetal fraction was 1.2% with an average interval between draws of 14 days. Informative redraw rate was strongly dependent on maternal weight and fetal fraction measured at the first draw. Gestational age was not an important determinant. Informative redraw rate increased rapidly over the first 8 days after the initial draw and more slowly thereafter.

- **Conclusion**: Based on fetal fraction in the initial sample, maternal weight, and interval between blood sampling are crucial factors for an informative redraw.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^112Vo8Eo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for prenatal screening for chromosomal abnormalities, and more specifically with respect to the choice of screening test, the ACOG/SMFM 2020 guidelines recommend recognizing that cell-free DNA is the most sensitive and specific screening test for common fetal aneuploidies. However, it has the potential for false-positive and false-negative results and is not equivalent to diagnostic testing.

### Amniocentesis in pregnancies at or beyond 24 weeks: An international multicenter study [^11236Z29]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Amniocentesis for genetic diagnosis is traditionally performed between 15 and 22 weeks of gestation but can also be conducted at later gestational ages. The safety and genetic diagnostic accuracy of amniocentesis have been well-established through numerous large-scale multicenter studies for procedures before 24 weeks. However, comprehensive data on late amniocentesis remains sparse.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the indications, diagnostic yield, safety, and maternal and fetal outcomes associated with amniocentesis performed at or beyond 24 weeks of gestation.

- **Study design**: We conducted an international multicenter retrospective cohort study examining pregnant individuals who underwent amniocentesis for prenatal diagnostic testing at gestational ages between 24w0d and 36w6d. The study, spanning from 2011 to 2022, involved 9 referral centers. We included singleton or twin pregnancies with documented outcomes, excluding cases where other invasive procedures were conducted during pregnancy or where amniocentesis was performed for obstetric indications. We analyzed indications for late amniocentesis, types of genetic tests performed, their results, and the diagnostic yield, along with pregnancy outcomes and post-procedure complications.

- **Results**: Of the 752 pregnant individuals in our study, late amniocentesis was primarily performed for the prenatal diagnosis of structural anomalies (91.6%), followed by suspected fetal infection (2.3%) and high-risk findings from cell-free DNA screening (1.9%). The median gestational age at the time of the procedure was 28w5d, and 98.3% of pregnancies.

### Clinical validation of a prenatal cell-free DNA screening test for fetal RHD in a large U.S. cohort [^116mx54N]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

More recent ACOG guidance supports the use of noninvasive cell-free DNA screening for fetal RHD to prioritize RhD immune globulin use during the RhD immune globulin shortage, but also as an option in alloimmunized pregnancies at risk for having an RhD positive fetus and when amniocentesis is declined. This guidance is likely to lead to broader adoption of noninvasive cell-free DNA screening for fetal RHD in the United States.

- **Strengths of the study**: Include the large cohort size, the racially diverse study cohort, the availability of serologic truth on all newborns, and the evaluation of the three most common RHD variants.

- **Limitations**: Include the potential for sampling bias because the cohort was not random and consisted of patients with previous SNP-based cell-free DNA screening. As a clinical validation for determining fetal RHD status, we selected only samples in which a fetal RHD determination could be made. For our test, this includes only pregnant patients with RHD genotypes as listed in our inclusion criteria. In addition, the effects on alloimmunization rates, cost implications, and consumer acceptability were not evaluated.

This study demonstrates that a commercially available noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA screening test has high sensitivity and specificity in a diverse U.S. population and has the potential to transform the approach to management of Rh-negative pregnant patients in the United States.

### Effects of an animated educational video on knowledge of cell-free DNA screening among Thai pregnant women: a randomized control trial [^112G1j7A]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

In developing countries, pregnant women have insufficient knowledge about cell-free DNA screening. Reports from developed countries have found that various tools in prenatal genetic counseling can improve the knowledge of pregnant women who undergo cell-free DNA screening. Data are limited from developing countries where women have different baseline socio-educational backgrounds. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of an animated educational video combined with traditional counseling versus traditional counseling alone in changing pregnant women's knowledge of cell-free DNA screening.

- **Methods**: This study was a randomized control trial conducted at an antenatal clinic. Eligible subjects, who were Thai pregnant women, were randomized to either view or not view the 4-minute animated educational video explaining cell-free DNA screening. Both groups received traditional counseling. The women were asked to complete a Thai questionnaire assessing knowledge of the screening before and after the intervention. The questionnaire consisted of three sections: demographic data of the research participants and their existing awareness about cell-free DNA testing; performance and limitations of cell-free DNA screening; and participants' attitudes toward a positive screening. The primary outcome was the change in knowledge scores. Secondary outcomes included attitudes toward a positive screening test, levels of satisfaction with counseling, and screening acceptance rates.

- **Results**: Data from 83 women in the video group and 82 in the non-video group were analyzed. The knowledge scores were assessed to determine the impact of the intervention.

### Noninvasive inferring expressed genes and in vivo monitoring of the physiology and pathology of pregnancy using cell-free DNA [^114Waugt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Low credibility.

Noninvasive monitoring of fetal development and the early detection of pregnancy-associated complications pose significant challenges due to the limited understanding of the molecular spectrum during pregnancy. Recently, it was discovered that cell-free DNA in plasma reflects the global nucleosome footprint and the status of gene expression, showing potential for noninvasive health monitoring during pregnancy.

- **Objective**: We aimed to test the relationships between plasma cell-free DNA profiles and pregnancy biology, and evaluate the use of a cell-free DNA profile as a noninvasive method for physiological and pathological status monitoring during pregnancy.

- **Study design**: We utilized genome cell-free DNA sequencing data generated from noninvasive prenatal testing from a total of 2,937 pregnant women. For each physiological and pathological condition, features of the cell-free DNA profile were identified using the discovery cohort. Support vector machine classifiers were built and evaluated using independent training and validation cohorts.

- **Results**: We established nucleosome occupancy profiles at transcription start sites across different gestational trimesters, demonstrating the relationships between gene expression and cell-free DNA coverage at these sites. Furthermore, we showed that cell-free DNA profiles at transcription start sites represent the biological processes of pregnancy. Additionally, using cell-free DNA data, we identified nucleosome profiles of transcription factor binding sites that reflect the transcription factor footprint, which may aid in revealing molecular mechanisms.

### The effects of heparin, aspirin, and maternal clinical factors on the rate of nonreportable cell-free DNA results: a retrospective cohort study [^111tKgJW]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2023). High credibility.

Technological advances in the analysis of cell-free DNA in maternal serum have expanded prenatal screening possibilities for fetal aneuploidies. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of the assay are partly dependent on the amount of cell-free DNA present in maternal circulation. Therefore, it is important to identify fetal and maternal factors that influence cell-free DNA levels in maternal circulation. Maternal heparin use has been associated with an increase in nonreportable cell-free DNA results due to a low fetal fraction in some, but not all, previous studies. Additionally, other factors likely affect cell-free DNA levels that remain uncharacterized.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to determine whether heparins, low-dose aspirin, and maternal clinical factors affect the rate of nonreportable cell-free DNA testing results.

- **Study design**: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using pregnant individuals receiving cell-free fetal DNA testing from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2018. Data were collected on patient demographics, medical comorbidities, medication use, and cell-free DNA test results. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine which factors were independently associated with the rate of nonreportable results.

- **Results**: From an original sample of 1117 pregnant individuals, 743 met the inclusion criteria. The analysis revealed that maternal weight (odds ratio, 1.02), heparin use (odds ratio, 12.06), aspirin use (odds ratio, 4.70), chronic hypertension (odds ratio, 5.26), and pregestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 2.46) were significantly associated with nonreportable results.

### Diagnostic accuracy of routine antenatal determination of fetal RHD status across gestation: Population based cohort study [^1134bxpc]. BMJ (2014). High credibility.

In this population-based cohort study, previous research indicates that mass throughput RHD genotyping of cell-free fetal DNA is accurate if performed during the third trimester of pregnancy. We evaluated accuracy across a wider range of gestations and demonstrated that it is highly accurate starting from 11 weeks' gestation. Before this period, the percentage of babies falsely predicted as RhD negative increases.

For routine application of fetal RHD genotyping, false negative results, where the fetus is predicted to be RhD negative when it is actually RhD positive, pose the greatest concern. This miscalculation may prevent mothers from receiving prophylactic anti-RhD immunoglobulin, potentially leading to alloimmunization and placing babies in subsequent pregnancies at risk of considerable morbidity or mortality. As the sensitivity of the test improves with gestation, this risk can be mitigated by optimal timing of testing, repeating cell-free fetal DNA testing in women predicted to be carrying an RhD negative baby, or by testing cord blood of babies predicted to be RhD negative. These latter two interventions, however, could impact the cost-effectiveness and applicability of a large-scale program.

In our study, the incidence of false RHD negative results before 11 weeks' gestation was 16/865 (1.85%, 95% confidence interval 1.14% to 2.98%). This may be due to low concentrations of cell-free fetal DNA in early pregnancy. After 11 weeks, the incidence of false negative results was considerably lower; specifically, it was 1/956 between 11 and 13 weeks (0.1%, 0.02% to 0.59%) and did not decrease between 11 and 24 weeks, in line with recent evidence.

### Incidental detection of maternal malignancy by fetal cell-free DNA screening [^114SKn6b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA is an advancing technology with increasing applications in screening, diagnosis, and treatment for several disease processes. The shared physiological, genetic, and epigenetic characteristics of placental physiology and tumor development have become apparent to both clinicians and researchers. Maternal malignancy has been reported as a cause of false-positive prenatal cell-free DNA screening results. The detection of multiple aneuploidies or a single autosomal monosomy increases the chance for an underlying maternal malignancy when the result is discordant with fetal diagnostic testing.

There is currently no consensus guideline on counseling and evaluation of patients with concerns for malignancy from cell-free DNA testing. Furthermore, laboratories differ significantly in reporting policies, terminology, and strategies used for unexpected or incidental findings. The ordering practitioner is therefore tasked with understanding the policies of their laboratory of choice to provide adequate pretest and posttest genetic counseling.

- **Pretest counseling**: The potential for incidental or unexpected findings or nonreportable results should be explained.

- **Posttest counseling**: With an abnormal, unanticipated, or nonreportable result, it should include a description of possible fetal or maternal diagnoses, including malignancy. Health care professionals should explain options for further evaluation and management, including a recommendation for fetal diagnostic testing.

The medical workup recommended by various authors to evaluate cancer risk is based on comprehensive counseling and requires careful consideration of maternal health history and potential underlying malignancy risks.

### High-throughput fetal fraction amplification increases analytical performance of noninvasive prenatal screening [^113y7RnY]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

The percentage of a maternal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) sample that is fetal-derived (the fetal fraction; FF) is a key driver of the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS). On certain NIPS platforms, more than 20% of women with high body mass index, and over 5% overall, receive a test failure due to low FF (< 4%).

A scalable fetal fraction amplification (FFA) technology was analytically validated on 1,264 samples undergoing whole-genome sequencing (WGS)-based NIPS. All samples were tested with and without FFA. Zero samples had FF < 4% when screened with FFA, whereas 1 in 25 of these same patients had FF < 4% without FFA. The average increase in FF was 3.9-fold for samples with low FF (2.3-fold overall), and 99.8% had higher FF with FFA. For all abnormalities screened on NIPS, z-scores increased 2.2-fold on average in positive samples and remained unchanged in negative samples, thereby increasing the sensitivity and specificity of NIPS.

FFA transforms low-FF samples into high-FF samples. By combining FFA with WGS-based NIPS, a single round of NIPS can provide nearly all women with confident results about the broad range of potential fetal chromosomal abnormalities across the genome.

### Management of monochorionic twin pregnancy Green-Top Guideline No. 51 (2024 partial update) [^112Qmq5H]. BJOG (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for multiple gestations, particularly concerning screening for chromosomal abnormalities and noninvasive testing, the RCOG 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining cell-free fetal DNA testing (also known as NIPT) based on the results of the first-trimester combined test for major autosomal trisomies in twin pregnancies, including monochorionic twins.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^117Beubk]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

- **Classification of abnormalities**: Timing of detection of fetal abnormalities was divided into two groups, depending on whether they were diagnosed in pregnancies in which first-trimester anatomical screening (FTAS) was performed or not. Also, all abnormalities were classified based on the affected organ systems into the following groups: central nervous system, facial, thoracic abnormalities, gastrointestinal, abdominal wall, genitourinary, skeletal/limbs abnormalities, other abnormalities, and multiple congenital abnormalities (MCA). Cases with two structural abnormalities were classified based on the most severe one. Cases with more than two structural abnormalities in at least two different organ systems were labeled as MCA.

Ventriculomegaly was included as a structural abnormality when the atrial width was 10 mm or more during the second trimester. Microcephaly was included when the head circumference was less than the 2.3rd percentile. Hydronephrosis was included in case of pelvicalyceal dilatation with an anteroposterior (AP) diameter of 10 mm or more in the second trimester and an AP diameter of 15 mm or more in the third trimester.

An absent stomach on multiple ultrasounds was labeled as esophageal atresia, and an evident double bubble was labeled as duodenal atresia. Finally, diagnosed fetal abnormalities were classified into three groups depending on whether they were "always", "sometimes", or "never" detectable in the first trimester, according to the classification suggested by Syngelaki and colleagues. Cases with MCA were labeled as "always detectable" when at least one of the abnormalities belonged to the group of abnormalities that can always be detected.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^114ihT5i]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The search identified a total of 1571 publications (Figure 1), including works on applications of cfDNA testing outside prenatal testing, predominantly related to malignancies outside pregnancy. After removing duplicates, 876 records were screened by title and abstract, resulting in 29 potentially eligible studies. A total of five studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. No additional articles were found via cross-referencing the included studies. All five studies were retrospective observational cohort studies published between 2016 and 2020, with cohort sizes ranging from 370 to 6375 pregnancies. All tests were performed in the first trimester or early second trimester.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^114VsYMo]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

- **Material and methods**: We followed the statement on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.

- **Data sources and searches**: A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to November 1, 2020. Variations of entry terms for "fetal fraction", "cell-free (fetal) DNA", and "NIPT" were combined with the entry term "outcome" or the MeSH term "pregnancy outcome". The full detailed search entry is presented in Supporting Information S1.

- **Study selection and eligibility criteria**: Studies were eligible for inclusion if the fetal fraction was reported as "low" or below the commonly used cutoff of 4%, and the clinical outcome of the pregnancy was reported for adverse events. Adverse pregnancy outcome was defined as the presence of hypertensive disease of pregnancy (HDP; including pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, and HELLP syndrome), small for gestational age (SGA) neonates, PTB, and GDM. We included studies with more than 100 subjects with a singleton pregnancy at either low or high risk for aneuploidy and with testing performed on high-throughput platforms. Publication language was restricted to English and Dutch. Reviews, letters to the editor, case reports, and case series were excluded, as well as studies reporting on cfDNA testing for conditions other than the common aneuploidies or in multiple pregnancies. Four authors (PS, SW, EB, and MB) screened titles and abstracts and performed the final selection of the eligible studies based on full-text reviewing. Eligible studies were cross-referenced for publications not identified in the initial search.

### Overview of the impact of noninvasive prenatal testing on diagnostic procedures [^113hP5J2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2015). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had a profound influence in the field of prenatal diagnosis since the 1997 discovery of cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood. Research has progressed rapidly, with clinical data supporting laboratory studies showing that NIPT is highly sensitive and specific for fetal aneuploidy, resulting in marked uptake in the high-risk patient population. The superior accuracy of NIPT compared with conventional screening methods has led to significant decreases in the number of invasive diagnostic procedures, along with a concomitant decrease in the number of procedure-related fetal losses.

- **Disruptive innovation**: NIPT has been described as a 'disruptive innovation' due to the considerable changes it has commanded on prenatal screening and diagnostic practices.

This review summarizes both institutional and global experience with NIPT uptake, its effect on reducing diagnostic invasive procedures, and the unique challenges that reduced procedural volume may have on physician and trainee proficiency, cytogenetic laboratories, and neonatal outcomes.

### Delivering an accredited non-invasive prenatal diagnosis service for monogenic disorders and recommendations for best practice [^113fJCeQ]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2018). Low credibility.

The identification of cell-free fetal DNA circulating in maternal blood, combined with technological developments — particularly next-generation sequencing — is enabling the development of safer prenatal diagnosis. While this technology has been widely applied as a highly sensitive screening test for aneuploidy, there has been relatively little clinical application for the diagnosis of monogenic disorders. In the UK, we have established non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) as a clinical service for a range of inherited disorders. The results from NIPD do not require confirmation by invasive testing and are welcomed by patients and health professionals alike.

- **Technical approaches used**: We describe the technical approaches employed and outline recommendations for best practice when delivering an NIPD service from an accredited laboratory.

### Association between low fetal fraction in cell-free DNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcome: A systematic review [^117Pix2M]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2021). Low credibility.

Low fetal fraction (LFF) in prenatal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing is an important cause of test failure and no-call results. LFF might reflect early abnormal placentation and thus be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. This review explores the existing literature on the relationship between LFF in cfDNA testing and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 1, 2020. Five studies met the criteria for inclusion; all were retrospective observational cohort studies. The cohort sizes ranged from 370 to 6375 pregnancies, with all tests conducted in the first trimester or early second trimester. A 4% cutoff for LFF was used in two studies, while two studies used the 5th and 25th percentiles, respectively, and one study employed a variety of cutoff values for LFF.

LFF in prenatal cfDNA testing was related to hypertensive disease of pregnancy, small for gestational-age neonates, and preterm birth. However, conflicting results emerged concerning the relationship between LFF and gestational diabetes mellitus.

In conclusion, LFF in cfDNA testing is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders, preterm birth, and impaired fetal growth due to placental dysfunction. Given the limited available evidence, a large prospective cohort study on the relationship between fetal fraction and pregnancy outcomes is necessary.

### Committee opinion no. 545: Noninvasive prenatal testing for fetal aneuploidy [^1119Lyur]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing utilizing cell-free fetal DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers tremendous potential as a screening tool for fetal aneuploidy. Cell-free fetal DNA testing should be an informed patient choice following pretest counseling and should not be part of routine prenatal laboratory assessments. It is not recommended for low-risk women or those with multiple gestations, as it has not been sufficiently evaluated in these groups. A negative cell-free fetal DNA test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for genetic counseling and should be offered invasive prenatal diagnosis to confirm test results.

### Committee opinion summary No. 640: Cell-free DNA screening for fetal aneuploidy [^114q1utN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal screening that uses cell-free DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers tremendous potential as a screening method for fetal aneuploidy. A number of laboratories have validated different techniques for the use of cell-free DNA as a screening test for fetal aneuploidy. All tests have high sensitivity and specificity for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21, regardless of the molecular technique used. Women whose results are not reported, indeterminate, or uninterpretable (a "no call" test result) should receive further genetic counseling and be offered comprehensive ultrasound evaluation and diagnostic testing because of an increased risk of aneuploidy.

Patients should be counseled that cell-free DNA screening does not replace the precision obtained with diagnostic tests, such as chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, and therefore, is limited in its ability to identify all chromosome abnormalities. Cell-free DNA screening does not assess the risk of fetal anomalies such as neural tube defects or ventral wall defects. Patients who are undergoing cell-free DNA screening should be offered maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening or ultrasound evaluation for risk assessment. The cell-free DNA screening test should not be considered in isolation from other clinical findings and test results. Management decisions, including termination of the pregnancy, should not be based on the results of the cell-free DNA screening alone. Patients should be counseled that a negative cell-free DNA test result does not ensure an unaffected pregnancy.

### Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in a family with neonatal diabetes [^111wV3P5]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). High credibility.

An early genetic diagnosis of neonatal diabetes guides clinical management and results in improved treatment in approximately 40% of patients. In the offspring of individuals with neonatal diabetes, a prenatal diagnosis allows for accurate estimation of the risk of developing diabetes and eventually determines the most appropriate treatment for the baby. In this study, we performed non-invasive prenatal genetic testing for a fetus at risk of inheriting a paternal 11 p.R201C mutation causing permanent neonatal diabetes.

- **Methods**: A droplet digital polymerase chain reaction assay was used to detect the presence of the mutation in cell-free circulating DNA extracted from maternal plasma at 12 and 16 weeks' gestation.

- **Results**: The mutation was not detected in the cell-free DNA samples, suggesting that the fetus had not inherited the 11 p.R201C mutation. The fetal fraction was estimated at 6.2% and 10.7%, which is above the detection limit of the assay. The result was confirmed by Sanger sequencing after the baby's birth, confirming that the baby's risk of developing neonatal diabetes was reduced to that of the general population.

- **Conclusions**: We report the first case of non-invasive prenatal testing in a family with neonatal diabetes. A prenatal diagnosis in families at high risk of monogenic diabetes informs both prenatal and postnatal management. Although the clinical impact of this novel technology still needs to be assessed, its implementation in clinical practice — including cases at risk of inheriting mutations from the mother — will likely have a positive impact on the clinical management of families.

### Clinical validation of a noninvasive prenatal test for genomewide detection of fetal copy number variants [^112JHep3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA assessment of fetal chromosomes does not analyze and report on all chromosomes; hence, a significant proportion of fetal chromosomal abnormalities are not detectable by noninvasive methods. This study reports the clinical validation of a novel noninvasive prenatal test (NIPT) designed to detect genomewide gains and losses of chromosomal material ≥ 7 Mb and losses associated with specific deletions < 7 Mb.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study is to provide a clinical validation of the sensitivity and specificity of a novel NIPT for the detection of genomewide abnormalities.

- **Study design**: This retrospective, blinded study included maternal plasma collected from 1,222 study subjects with pregnancies at increased risk for fetal chromosomal abnormalities. These were assessed for trisomy 21 (T21), trisomy 18 (T18), trisomy 13 (T13), sex chromosome aneuploidies (SCAs), fetal sex, genomewide copy number variants (CNVs) ≥ 7 Mb, and select deletions < 7 Mb. Performance was assessed by comparing test results with findings from G-band karyotyping, microarray data, or high-coverage sequencing.

- **Results**: Clinical sensitivity within this study was determined to be 100% for T21 (95% confidence interval, 94.6–100%), T18 (95% CI, 84.4–100%), T13 (95% CI, 74.7–100%), and SCAs (95% CI, 84–100%), and 97.7% for genomewide CNVs (95% CI, 86.2–99.9%). Clinical specificity was determined to be 100% for T21 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), T18 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), and T13 (95% CI, 99.6–100%), and 99.9% for SCAs and CNVs (95% CI, 99.4–100% for both).

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^113Gef27]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

A minority of these cases (n = 31, 6.3%) were referred due to fetal abnormalities suspected at the dating ultrasound (mean gestational age at referral: 11.4 weeks). Of these 31 cases, 29 (93.5%) were classified as "always detectable", which included: 5 cases of anencephaly, 1 case of holoprosencephaly, 6 cases of omphalocele, 4 cases of gastroschisis, 6 cases of megacystis, 1 case of body-stalk anomaly, 1 case of Pentalogy of Cantrell, 1 case of omphalocele-exstrophy-imperforated anus-spinal defects (OEIS complex), and 4 cases of MCA. The remaining 2 cases (6.5%) were categorized as "sometimes detectable", both involving MCA.

### Have we done our last amniocentesis? Updates on cell-free DNA for Down syndrome screening [^114aMeYZ]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Prenatal aneuploidy screening changed significantly in 2012 when cell-free fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was introduced as a noninvasive prenatal test. A noninvasive prenatal test detects cell-free fragments of fetal DNA from the placenta circulating in maternal blood, coexisting with cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of maternal origin. Using next-generation sequencing, the noninvasive prenatal test compares maternal and fetal cfDNA ratios for chromosomes of interest (i.e. 21, 18, 13, X, and Y) to assess chromosomal aneuploidy.

Compared to traditional screening using ultrasound and serum markers, the noninvasive prenatal test has superior test characteristics, including a higher detection rate and positive predictive value, and a lower false-positive rate. The noninvasive prenatal test is already used for primary screening in high-risk women and is rapidly expanding to all women. Given its increasing use, understanding the noninvasive prenatal test's limitations is critical. Discordant results (i.e. noninvasive prenatal test is positive for aneuploidy with a normal fetal karyotype) can occur because of biological processes such as aneuploidy confined to the placenta, a vanished twin, maternal aneuploidy, or maternal cancer.

Use of the noninvasive prenatal test for screening beyond the most common aneuploidies is not recommended. The noninvasive prenatal test is a major advance in prenatal aneuploidy screening, but it is not diagnostic and does not replace invasive testing (i.e. chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis) for confirmation of fetal chromosomal disorders.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing for sex chromosome abnormalities: A source of confusion [^111tk9ZK]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Cell-free fetal DNA has received significant attention for the purposes of prenatal genetic testing in the past decade. Fetal DNA testing is a new and promising method for many applications, such as aneuploidy screening, prenatal diagnosis, and prediction of preeclampsia. A 37-year-old primigravida, with a pregnancy conceived by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), was offered non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) due to advanced maternal age. NIPT performed at 23 weeks' gestation reported a diagnosis of monosomy X. She was offered an amniocentesis, which revealed a euploid fetus with no sex chromosome abnormalities.

Even with single nucleotide polymorphism-based NIPT, the positive predictive value for detecting sex chromosome abnormalities is around 50%. Positive results of NIPT should be approached with caution, and an invasive diagnostic procedure should be performed, especially for rare chromosomal abnormalities and sex chromosome abnormalities where NIPT performs subpar compared to its performance for detecting trisomy 21.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^115Y1Hmt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

The discovery of fetal cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics through non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which depends on accurately measuring the fetal fraction (FF) in maternal plasma. While FF is known to be influenced by maternal and fetal factors, the impact of intraday rhythms remains unclear. This study investigated whether FF varies based on blood draw timing.

Data from 2,519 euploid singleton pregnancies undergoing NIPT were analyzed. Key variables included maternal age, BMI, gestational age, fetal sex, and blood draw timing (06:50–21:00). FF was measured using the Harmony Prenatal IVD Test. Multiple linear regression identified independent predictors of FF, while intraday variation was assessed using Mann‐Whitney U tests and boxplots.

Results showed a significant positive relationship between FF and blood draw timing (β = 0.00176 per hour, p < 0.005), with afternoon values approximately 10% higher than morning values (∼0.01 difference). Other predictors included BMI (negative), gestational age (positive), and fetal sex (higher in females). Blood draw timing appeared to be a stronger predictor of FF than gestational age or fetal sex, second only to BMI.

This novel finding demonstrates diurnal variation in FF, suggesting that optimizing blood draw timing could improve NIPT accuracy, particularly in borderline cases. Further research is needed to confirm the clinical implications.

### Implementation of non-invasive prenatal testing by semiconductor sequencing in a genetic laboratory [^1147v7gX]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Gestational age and maternal weight are key characteristics that influence the fetal DNA fraction. Because a low fetal fraction leads to a dramatic decrease in sensitivity, fetal fraction assessment is of utmost importance. The most convenient measurement of fetal fraction is based on the presence of the Y chromosome in the plasma sample (FF-Y). Evidently, this fetal fraction calculation is only possible for pregnancies with a male fetus.

Other methods for fetal fraction measurements rely on single nucleotide polymorphism differences between maternal and fetal DNA. These calculations, however, mostly require additional testing, hence rendering the overall test more costly. Interestingly, fetal cell-free DNA fragments are overall shorter than the corresponding maternal cell-free DNA fragments. This inherent information can be used for fetal DNA fraction measurements and eliminates the need for an additional test for fetal fraction measurement.

Recently, Kim et al. developed a new strategy, called seqFF, for fetal fraction calculation. This method is based on the fact that the genomic origin or representation of cfDNA from fetal and maternal origin differs slightly. The method being described uses the sequence data that are investigated for the NIPT analysis itself, making an extra test for fetal fraction calculation redundant. More importantly, fetal fraction can be determined for pregnancies with male as well as female fetuses.

In addition to the issues raised concerning sensitivity and specificity for NIPT, the use of cell-free DNA…

### Preface: In silico pipeline for accurate cell-free fetal DNA fraction prediction [^112W1kNf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has evolved into an important routine clinical practice. Numerous variations on experimental and in silico procedures have been shown to reliably detect fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, primarily concerning trisomies 13, 18, and 21. The accuracy of NIPT seems high; however, as fetal fragments are scattered throughout a more abundant maternal background in blood plasma, individual performance highly depends on the fraction of fetal-derived cell-free DNA (FF). Indeed, the minimal FF for reporting unilateral conclusions has often been debated to be 4%, though lower limits are alleged.

- **Fetal gender-independent methodologies**: Several methodologies have been described to assess FF without considering fetal gender. Prior parental genomic information often facilitates some of these procedures. For example, paternal or maternal homozygous loci that are partly heterozygous in maternal blood during pregnancy form a precise platform to quantify FF. Nonetheless, parental priors are not always required. Using binomial mixture modeling, fetal and maternal clusters of single nucleotide polymorphisms also reflect FF, yet a higher sequencing depth is necessary.

- **Different inputs for FF prediction**: Different inputs such as molecule size — cell-free fetal DNA fragments are often shorter — and methylation patterns — some fetal sites are hypermethylated — enable FF prediction.

### Cell-free DNA screening in twin pregnancies: A more accurate and reliable screening tool [^1131AuoL]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: Historically, twin gestations have posed unique challenges to aneuploidy detection during pregnancy. Traditional serum screening is complicated by the presence of two fetuses contributing varying levels of analytes in maternal blood, resulting in a less sensitive screening test in twins compared to singleton gestations. Additionally, traditional screening methods are often focused solely on the detection of Down syndrome, excluding other chromosomal abnormalities.

Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening for aneuploidy in multifetal gestations has been validated and clinically available since 2012. This screening approach allows for the evaluation of multiple aneuploidies, with validation studies suggesting increased sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional serum screening.

Despite the growing use of this test by clinicians, professional societies have not yet broadly supported cfDNA screening for multifetal pregnancies. In a recent Practice Bulletin, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) stated: "Noninvasive prenatal testing that uses cell-free fetal DNA from the plasma of pregnant women offers potential as a screening tool for fetal aneuploidy. However, more information is needed before use of this test can be recommended in women with multifetal gestations". The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) does not overtly endorse cfDNA screening for multiples. Rather, ACMG recommends, "In pregnancies with multiple gestations and/or donor oocytes, testing laboratories should be contacted ".

### Obstetrical provider knowledge and attitudes towards cell-free DNA screening: Results of a cross-sectional national survey [^115HJuDk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) based on cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in the maternal plasma has recently gained significant attention. It promises patients and healthcare providers a prenatal genetic screening test for aneuploidy that is more accurate than ultrasound and placental analyte screening modalities, and safer than invasive diagnostic testing. Prenatal genetic screening methods have utilized non-invasive maternal serum screening protocols such as the first trimester combined or integrated approaches, which identify up to 95% of trisomies with a false positive rate of 5–23% in the general population. Given a screen-positive risk result (as determined by the test's 'cut-off' number), patients are offered invasive diagnostic procedures like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, which carry a 0.5–1% risk of miscarriage.

cfDNA screening represents a significant clinical advancement over alternative screening modalities, demonstrating an overall detection rate (DR) of 99.7% and a false positive rate (FPR) of 0.04% for trisomy 21. Various professional societies, including the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada (SOGC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), recognize cfDNA screening as a highly effective method for early prenatal screening of common trisomies (21, 18, 13) after 10 weeks' gestation. However, several limitations to this screening test exist. cfDNA screening is a rapidly evolving field and at the time we constructed our survey, detection rates for individual aneuploidies were not fully established.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^111Cv1Tr]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

This study has some limitations. Although the classification of abnormalities into "always", "sometimes", and "never" detectable in the first trimester is based on the largest and most comprehensive cohort available in the literature, there may be a variance between theoretically expected and observed detection rates. This study also clearly shows that not all anomalies can be diagnosed at the STAS. In fact, in 123 (25%) cases, the referral took place following a later ultrasound examination, after STAS.

This confirms the findings of the study by Syngelaki et al. that about 20% of all the structural anomalies present in a fetal cohort will be diagnosed after the STAS, either in the late second or third trimester or even after birth. These late diagnoses concern especially gastrointestinal and some renal and skeletal anomalies. The goal of this study was not to assess the diagnostic ability of ultrasound, but rather to identify the moment of diagnosis of anomalies in pregnancy and correlate this to a reported pattern of diagnosis in the first trimester.

### Impact of noninvasive prenatal testing in regionally dispersed medical centers in the United States [^1135gRQU]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free DNA is a new alternative to screen for common fetal aneuploidies. It is not known what impact regional location may play on noninvasive prenatal testing implementation and downstream invasive prenatal procedure use in the United States.

- **Study design**: Six different regionally based centers collected data on noninvasive prenatal testing indication and results between February and November 2012, as well as their invasive prenatal procedure rates before and after offering noninvasive prenatal testing. Statistical analyses were performed using the two-proportion Z-test.

- **Results**: Of 1,477 patients who underwent noninvasive prenatal testing, 693 (47%) were from centers in the West, 522 (35.3%) from centers in the East, and 262 (17.7%) from one center in the Midwest. Statistically significant differences were observed between West Coast and non-West Coast sites for gestational age (14.1 weeks; P ≤ .0001). Advanced maternal age (AMA-only) was the most frequent indication in five of six sites (range, 21.8–62.9%). A total of 98 invasive prenatal procedures were performed on 94 (6.4%) patients, of which 64 (65.3%) were performed at centers in the West. More invasive procedures were performed following negative noninvasive prenatal testing results (n = 61) than abnormal noninvasive prenatal testing results (n = 30). The overall rate of patients undergoing invasive procedures after an abnormal noninvasive prenatal testing result was 32.6% (30 of 92). All six centers reported a decrease in invasive procedure volume after noninvasive prenatal testing.

### The clinical utility of genome-wide non invasive prenatal screening [^116BA1Nv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). High credibility.

In this study, we expanded conventional cell-free fetal DNA (cfDNA)-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to cover the entire genome. Our aim was to compare the performance of the two tests in a large general population of pregnant women to assess the clinical utility of genome-wide screening.

- **Method**: Genome-wide cfDNA analysis was offered to 12,114 pregnant women undergoing NIPT for common fetal aneuploidy. Sequencing data were analyzed using an algorithm optimized to identify aneuploidies and subchromosomal aberrations.

- **Results**: Genome-wide screening allowed detection of 12 (7.4%) potentially viable clinically relevant chromosomal abnormalities, which would have remained overlooked if only conventional NIPT had been performed. This resulted in a statistically significant higher sensitivity (100% vs. 92.64%, p < 0.001) than did standard screening. This was achieved without sacrificing the specificity of the test, which was similar to that obtained with standard cfDNA testing (99.87% vs. 99.77%, p = 0.064).

- **Conclusion**: Genome-wide cfDNA analysis represents an enhanced screening tool for prenatal detection of chromosomal abnormalities, allowing identification of clinically relevant imbalances not detectable by conventional cfDNA testing. The results of this study demonstrate the clinical utility of genome-wide cfDNA analysis. This level of screening provides significantly higher sensitivity compared to standard screening while maintaining high specificity, with the potential to improve overall pregnancy management. © 2017 John Wiley.

### Cell-free fetal DNA testing and its correlation with prenatal indications [^113sh3gK]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Low credibility.

The prenatal test of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) is also known as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and is characterized by high sensitivity and specificity. This study aims to evaluate the performance of NIPT and its clinical relevance with various clinical indications.

- **Methods**: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 14,316 pregnant women with prenatal indications, including advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years), maternal serum screening abnormalities, thickened nuchal translucency (≥ 2.5 mm), other ultrasound abnormalities, twin pregnancy/IVF-ET pregnancy, etc. The whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of maternal plasma cffDNA was employed in this study.

- **Results**: A total of 189 (1.32%) positive NIPT cases were identified, and 113 out of 189 (59.79%) cases were confirmed by invasive prenatal testing. Abnormal serological screening (53.14%) was the most common indication, followed by elderly pregnancy (23.02%). The positive predictive values for T21, T18, T13, sex chromosome abnormalities, other autosomal aneuploidy abnormalities, and CNV abnormalities were 91.84%, 68.75%, 37.50%, 66.67%, 14.29%, and 6.45%, respectively. The positive rate and the true positive rate of nuchal translucency (NT) thickening were the highest (4.17% and 3.33%), followed by the voluntary requirement group (3.49% and 1.90%) among the various prenatal screening indications. The cffDNA concentration was linearly correlated with gestational age (≥ 10 weeks) and the Z-score values of the positive NIPT group.

- **Conclusions**: Whole-genome sequencing of cffDNA has extremely high sensitivity and specificity for T21 and high sensitivity for T18.

### The implications of non-invasive prenatal testing failures: a review of an under-discussed phenomenon [^1121zAEb]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA in maternal blood is a relatively new screening modality for the common trisomies of chromosomes 21, 18, and 13, as well as sex chromosome aneuploidies. For some patients, however, results are not reported due to laboratory technical issues such as low fetal fraction and sequencing failures. This review discusses the clinical implications of NIPT test failures.

- **Methods**: A Medline search was performed for all studies on NIPT that include more than 1000 samples. The failure rates were assessed by technology.

- **Results**: Methods based on massive parallel sequencing have been found to have the lowest failure rate (1.58%), while tests based on single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis have the highest failure rate (6.39%).

- **Conclusions**: Recent publications suggest that patients who receive a 'no call' result are at increased risk of aneuploidy. Consequently, some professional societies have recommended that these patients undergo genetic counseling and be offered invasive diagnostic testing. NIPT technology with a high failure rate may increase the false positive rates, decrease the positive predictive value, and increase the procedure-related pregnancy loss. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Cell-free DNA screening for trisomy 21 in twin pregnancy: A large multicenter cohort study [^111MuJKu]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Analysis of cell-free DNA from maternal blood provides effective screening for trisomy 21 in singleton pregnancies. Data on cell-free DNA screening in twin gestations are promising, although limited. In previous twin studies, cell-free DNA screening was primarily performed in the second trimester, and many studies did not report chorionicity.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to evaluate the screening performance of cell-free DNA for trisomy 21 in twin pregnancies in a large, diverse cohort. A secondary aim was to evaluate screening performance for trisomy 18 and trisomy 13.

- **Study design**: This was a retrospective cohort study of twin pregnancies from 17 centers where cell-free DNA screening was performed from December 2011 to February 2020 by one laboratory using massively parallel sequencing technology. Medical record review was conducted for all newborns, and data on the birth outcome, the presence of any congenital abnormalities, phenotypic appearance at birth, and any chromosomal testing undertaken in the antenatal or postnatal period were extracted. Cases with a possible fetal chromosomal abnormality with no genetic test results were reviewed by a committee of maternal-fetal medicine geneticists. Cases with a vanishing twin and inadequate follow-up information were excluded. A minimum of 35 confirmed cases of trisomy 21 was required to capture a sensitivity of at least 90% with a prevalence of at least 1.9% with 80% power. Test characteristics were calculated for each outcome.

- **Results**: A total of 1764 samples were sent for twin cell-free DNA screening.

### Cell-free DNA testing: future applications in gastroenterology and hepatology [^114yRdCb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

The success of prenatal genetic testing may be a glimpse into the future potential of cfDNA testing in gastroenterology and hepatology. Noninvasive prenatal genetic testing is a cfDNA technology now widely used by pregnant women. These tests are extremely reliable, with sensitivities and specificities for most abnormalities being on the order of 95.8–99.7% and approximately 99.86–99.96%, respectively. This reliability is achieved even though it is estimated that fetal DNA concentrations in maternal plasma are on the order of 1–6 ng/ml. In fact, women undergoing in vitro fertilization are now able to have sequencing performed on a single cell harvested from blastomeres to determine which blastomeres to use prior to implantation.

In addition, proof-of-concept studies have shown that entire fetal genomes can be sequenced from fetal cfDNA in the maternal plasma. Taken together, the commercial and clinical success of noninvasive prenatal genetic testing demonstrates that it is clinically feasible with the ability to detect disease in small fractions of cfDNA and do so in a highly reliable fashion at an acceptable cost. All of these excellent qualities could easily be translated into the diagnosis and management of digestive and liver diseases.

As the technology itself matures, the main barrier to routine use will be research to develop markers with robust clinical applicability. cfDNA markers must add meaningfully to diagnosis, prognosis, and disease management. For instance, clinicians must be able to develop reliable algorithms regarding actions to take upon findings of high levels of mutant KRAS.

### Cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 in pregnancies at low and high risk for aneuploidy with genetic confirmation [^115vpNdb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Cell-free DNA noninvasive prenatal screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 has been rapidly adopted into clinical practice. However, previous studies are limited by a lack of follow-up genetic testing to confirm the outcomes and accurately assess test performance, particularly in women at a low risk for aneuploidy.

- **Objective**: To measure and compare the performance of cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 between women at a low and high risk for aneuploidy in a large, prospective cohort with genetic confirmation of results.

- **Study design**: This was a multicenter prospective observational study at 21 centers in 6 countries. Women who had single-nucleotide-polymorphism-based cell-free DNA screening for trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were enrolled. Genetic confirmation was obtained from prenatal or newborn DNA samples. The test performance and test failure (no-call) rates were assessed for the cohort, and women with low and high previous risks for aneuploidy were compared. An updated cell-free DNA algorithm blinded to the pregnancy outcome was also assessed.

- **Results**: A total of 20,194 women were enrolled at a median gestational age of 12.6 weeks (interquartile range, 11.6–13.9). The genetic outcomes were confirmed in 17,851 cases (88.4%): 13,043 (73.1%) low-risk and 4808 (26.9%) high-risk cases for aneuploidy. Overall, 133 trisomies were diagnosed (100 trisomy 21; 18 trisomy 18; 15 trisomy 13). The cell-free DNA screen positive rate was lower in the low-risk versus the high-risk group (0.27% vs. 2.2%; p < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity were similar between the groups.

### Increasing maternal age is not a significant cause of false-positive results for monosomy X in non-invasive prenatal testing [^1132VPbt]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). High credibility.

The accuracy of cell-free DNA aneuploidy screening varies by the chromosome assessed. The positive predictive value is consistently low for monosomy X (MX), at less than 30%. This study aims to investigate maternal age and other possible predictors of false-positive MX screening results in order to guide pre-test and post-test counselling.

- **Methods**: A total of 52,499 NIPT samples were tested over 69 months, across three specialist obstetric services. Outcome data were available for 96 out of 107 cases high risk for MX. Cytogenetic outcomes were compared to clinical and demographic data to look for trends that may indicate a higher likelihood of a false-positive NIPT result.

- **Results**: The likelihood of a false-positive MX result significantly increased with the absence of ultrasound features suggestive of MX and with lower PAPP-A levels. Non-significant trends towards false-positive results were identified with increased maternal age, increased body mass index, and Caucasian ethnicity.

- **Conclusion**: Maternal age is not a reliable predictor of a false-positive result. Assessment of ultrasound findings and placental serology in the first trimester is important for appropriate post-test counselling and should continue to be a part of screening even when NIPT is used as a first-tier screening test.

### Clinical validation of a prenatal cell-free DNA screening test for fetal RHD in a large U.S. cohort [^116CVYmM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

A total of 655 maternal samples met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The median maternal age was 32 years (range 16.0–46.0 years), and the median weight was 70 kg (range 41.7–170.1 kg) at the time of noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing. Race and ethnicity as documented in the medical record were as follows: 485 (74.0%) were White, 46 (7.0%) were Black, 14 (2.1%) were Asian, 4 (0.6%) were other, and 106 (16.2%) were of unknown races; 90 (13.7%) were Hispanic or Latina, 444 (67.8%) were non-Hispanic, and 121 (18.5%) had unknown ethnicities. The median gestational age at the time of testing was 12 weeks (range 9.0–36.7 weeks), and the median fetal fraction was 8.3% (range 2.8–32.0%). Newborn sex was split between male (51.2%) and female (47.8%). Most pregnancies were singleton (99.1%); 5 (0.8%) were monozygotic twin pregnancies; and 1 fetus (0.2%) was conceived through egg donation.

### Identification of fetal unmodified and 5-hydroxymethylated CG sites in maternal cell-free DNA for non-invasive prenatal testing [^117NEM94]. Clinical Epigenetics (2020). Low credibility.

Epigenetic profiling determines fetal fraction in cfDNA. It is well known that very low or exceptionally high fetal fractions in maternal cfDNA may affect the accuracy of subsequent non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) tests. Having established that the uTOP-seq and hmTOP-seq signals are higher among pregnant women, we further sought to determine the correlation between the signal strength and fetal fraction.

We first used whole genome sequencing and the SeqFF algorithm to establish a reference fetal fraction in cfDNA samples. SeqFF is a widely used approach that relies on an increased proportion of short cfDNA fragments, which are more likely of fetal origin, and is independent of fetal sex. We applied SeqFF on the uTOP-seq and hmTOP-seq data and observed a high correlation between the predicted and reference fetal fractions (Pearson |r| = 0.86, p = 3.2 × 10–4 and |r| = 0.9, p = 3.9 × 10–4 for uCG and 5hmCG, respectively; Fig. 2).

Importantly, a simple linear regression revealed that an increase of the reference fetal fraction by 0.01 corresponded to an increase in the fetal fraction predicted from uCG profiles by 0.079. For 5hmCG data, the predicted fetal fraction decreased by 0.226 for every 0.01 increase of the reference fraction. Interestingly, an increasing fetal fraction would acquire increasing read counts in uTOP-seq but decreasing read counts in hmTOP-seq. Such an inverse relationship in hmTOP-seq most likely indicates that the regions used by SeqFF are highly enriched in uCGs but depleted in 5hmCGs in cffDNA.

### Offering non-invasive prenatal testing as part of routine clinical service. Can high levels of informed choice be maintained [^1142mWVN]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2017). Low credibility.

Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell-free DNA in maternal blood is an advanced screening test demonstrated to be highly accurate for Down syndrome, with detection rates of over 99% and false positive rates of less than 0.1% for singleton pregnancies. The test can also screen for trisomies 13 and 18, as well as sex chromosome aneuploidies; however, detection rates are slightly lower. The lower predictive value means that NIPT is not considered diagnostic, and invasive testing is recommended to confirm positive NIPT results.

Non-invasive prenatal testing has become widely available in recent years through the private sector, and several studies have been conducted to address implementation within a national prenatal care setting. Clinical advantages include improved accuracy rates in comparison to combined screening, reduction in the need for invasive tests that carry a small risk of miscarriage, early information about risk status, and the opportunity for early reassurance for low-risk women. Nevertheless, a number of disadvantages have been identified, such as the smaller diagnostic yield in comparison to invasive testing with array comparative genomic hybridisation and the potential for test failures or inconclusive results.

### Timing of diagnosis of fetal structural abnormalities after the introduction of universal cell-free DNA in the absence of first-trimester anatomical screening [^114oGV9E]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

All remaining anomalies (n = 461, 93.7%) were suspected at or after second-trimester anatomical screening (STAS). The mean gestational age (GA) at diagnosis in this group was 22.8 weeks (SD 4.1). A total of 37 (8.0%) belonged to the group of abnormalities "always detectable" in the first trimester and were diagnosed at a GA of 21.4 weeks (SD 3.2). These included 3 cases of anencephaly, 1 case of holoprosencephaly, 4 cases of encephalocele, 3 cases of tricuspid atresia, 4 cases of pulmonary atresia, 7 cases of omphalocele, 5 cases of gastroschisis, 1 case of megacystis, 1 body-stalk anomaly, and 8 cases of middle cerebral artery (MCA) abnormalities.

- **Sometimes detectable group**: 301 (65.3%) abnormalities belonged to the first trimester "sometimes detectable" group and were diagnosed at a mean of 22.4 weeks (SD 3.3). These were mainly cardiac abnormalities (n = 141, 46.8%) and skeletal abnormalities (n = 46, 15.3%). Additionally, we diagnosed 47 (15.6%) cases of renal abnormalities, 2 (0.7%) cases of bladder exstrophy, 19 (6.3%) cases of central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities, 12 (4.0%) cases of facial abnormalities, 11 (3.6%) cases of thoracic abnormalities, 10 (3.3%) cases of generalized edema, 12 (4.0%) cases of MCA abnormalities, and 1 (0.3%) tumor.

- **Never detectable group**: Finally, 123 (26.6%) of the abnormalities diagnosed following the STAS belonged to the "never detectable" group in the first trimester. Abnormalities were referred and diagnosed at later ultrasound examinations, with a mean GA of 25.3 weeks (SD 4.9).

- **Transient findings**: In the cohort, 20 (3.6%) diagnoses appeared to be transient findings that were not confirmed at follow-up ultrasound.

### Cell-free placental DNA: What do we really know [^113hXeWh]. PLOS Genetics (2024). High credibility.

Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in maternal circulation during gestation. CfpDNA carries great potential as a research and clinical tool, providing a means to investigate the placental (epi)genome across gestation, which previously required invasive placenta sampling procedures. CfpDNA has been widely implemented in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Despite this, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. This review examines the knowledge of cfpDNA, including its origins and molecular characteristics, highlights gaps in knowledge, and discusses future research directions.

### Sequencing cell-free fetal DNA in pregnant women with GCK-MODY [^114McCeN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Individuals with monogenic diabetes due to inactivating glucokinase (GCK) variants typically do not require treatment, except potentially during pregnancy. In pregnancy, fetal GCK genotype determines whether treatment is indicated, but noninvasive methods are not clinically available.

- **Objective**: This work aims to develop a method to determine fetal GCK genotype noninvasively using maternal cell-free fetal DNA.

- **Methods**: This was a proof-of-concept study involving three pregnant women with a causal GCK variant. It utilized information from 1) massive parallel sequencing of maternal plasma cell-free DNA, 2) direct haplotype sequences of maternal genomic DNA, and 3) the paternal genotypes to estimate relative haplotype dosage of the pathogenic variant-linked haplotype. Statistical testing of variant inheritance was performed using a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT).

- **Results**: In each of the three cases, plasma cell-free DNA was extracted once between gestational weeks 24 and 36. The fetal fraction of cell-free DNA ranged from 21.8% to 23.0%. Paternal homozygous alleles that were identical to the maternal GCK variant-linked allele were not overrepresented in the cell-free DNA. Paternal homozygous alleles that were identical to the maternal wild-type-linked allele were significantly overrepresented. Based on the SPRT, we predicted that all three cases did not inherit the GCK variant. Postnatal infant genotyping confirmed our prediction in each case.

- **Conclusion**: We have successfully implemented a noninvasive method to predict fetal GCK genotype using cell-free DNA in three pregnant women.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^115ui7ee]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

The discovery of fetal cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has revolutionized prenatal diagnostics through non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which depends on accurately measuring the fetal fraction (FF) in maternal plasma. While FF is known to be influenced by maternal and fetal factors, the impact of intraday rhythms remains unclear. This study investigated whether FF varies based on blood draw timing.

- **Methods**: Data from 2519 euploid singleton pregnancies undergoing NIPT were analyzed. Key variables included maternal age, BMI, gestational age, fetal sex, and blood draw timing (06:50–21:00). FF was measured using the Harmony Prenatal IVD Test. Multiple linear regression identified independent predictors of FF, while intraday variation was assessed using Mann-Whitney U tests and boxplots.

- **Results**: FF showed a significant positive relationship with blood draw timing (β = 0.00176 per hour, p < 0.005), with afternoon values approximately 10% higher than morning values (∼0.01 difference). Other predictors included BMI (negative), gestational age (positive), and fetal sex (higher in females). Blood draw timing appeared to be a stronger predictor of FF than gestational age or fetal sex, second only to BMI.

- **Conclusion**: This novel finding demonstrates diurnal variation in FF, suggesting that optimizing blood draw timing could improve NIPT accuracy, particularly in borderline cases. Further research is needed to confirm the clinical implications.

### Preface: In silico pipeline for accurate cell-free fetal DNA fraction prediction [^117HGRTj]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2019). Low credibility.

During routine noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), cell-free fetal DNA fraction is ideally derived from shallow-depth whole-genome sequencing data, preventing the need for additional experimental assays. The fraction of aligned reads to chromosome Y enables proper quantification for male fetuses, unlike for females, where advanced predictive procedures are required. This study introduces PREdict FetAl ComponEnt (PREFACE), a novel bioinformatics pipeline to establish fetal fraction in a gender-independent manner.

- **Methods**: PREFACE combines the strengths of principal component analysis and neural networks to model copy number profiles.

- **Results**: For sets of roughly 1100 male NIPT samples, a cross-validated Pearson correlation of 0.9 between predictions and fetal fractions according to Y chromosomal read counts was noted. PREFACE enables training with both male and unlabeled female fetuses. Using our complete cohort (n female = 2468, n male = 2723), the correlation metric reached 0.94.

- **Conclusions**: Allowing individual institutions to generate optimized models sidelines between-laboratory bias, as PREFACE enables user-friendly training with a limited amount of retrospective data. In addition, our software provides the fetal fraction based on the copy number state of chromosome X. We show that these measures can predict mixed multiple pregnancies, sex chromosomal aneuploidies, and the source of observed aberrations.

### Clinical validation of a prenatal cell-free DNA screening test for fetal RHD in a large U.S. cohort [^114AucSK]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

For this study, we identified clinical cases with previous commercial single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)–based noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing that were evaluated between April 1, 2022, and September 30, 2022, and had residual samples in the Natera, Inc. proprietary research sample bank. These samples were matched to clinical outcomes using data collected as part of Natera's clinical quality improvement program, through which serologic RhD phenotypes were available for both the pregnant patient and their newborn.

Only pregnant patients with RhD-negative serology were included in this study. Additional inclusion criteria for use in this clinical validation were as follows: the residual sample passed quality metrics; a previously reported noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA result for fetal aneuploidy; documented RhD-negative serologic results for the pregnant person; documented serologic results for the RhD antigen in the newborn for the pregnancy of interest; maternal genotype identified as RHD deletion or RHD-CE-D hybrid (r's); and identification of the pregnancy as a singleton or monozygotic twin pregnancy based on SNP-based noninvasive prenatal cell-free DNA testing.

Demographics such as race and ethnicity, maternal age, and maternal weight, as well as clinical characteristics, were collected to evaluate the generalizability of the validation results to the U.S. population. Commercially obtained samples stored in Natera's biorepository were analyzed under a waiver of informed consent through Natera's IRB-approved protocol.

### Cell-free DNA fetal fraction in twin gestations in single-nucleotide polymorphism-based noninvasive prenatal screening [^116s2rgh]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Where appropriate, data evaluation included descriptive statistics, two‐sided t‐test, and one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the 5% significance level. No Bonferroni correction for multiple tests was applied to minimize type II (false negative) associations.

The study was based on a retrospective analysis of deidentified data and therefore fell under an IRB exemption protocol, as determined by Ethical & Independent Review Services, Corte Madera, CA (E&I) protocol #: 17113‐02.

### Analysis of cell-free fetal DNA for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis in a family with neonatal diabetes [^113uADAk]. Diabetic Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

This article describes the first case of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis using cell-free fetal DNA in a family with neonatal diabetes. The test showed that the baby had not inherited the neonatal diabetes mutation, providing reassurance to the parents at mid-gestation that this baby was not at high risk of neonatal diabetes. This information helped inform the management of the pregnancy, delivery, and newborn care accordingly.

### Cell-free DNA screening in twin pregnancies: A more accurate and reliable screening tool [^111P2avu]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Another limitation of this analysis involves the filtering of cfDNA specimens for inclusion in the study. Samples were selected based on the number of fetuses indicated on the test requisition by the ordering provider. This information may not accurately reflect the gestational status of the ongoing pregnancy. There are documented cases in this cohort of pregnancies that began as a twin gestation and spontaneously or selectively reduced to a singleton fetus prior to screening or diagnostic testing. Likewise, the data set may contain cases documented as twins that had reduced from a triplet gestation at some point prior to testing. These scenarios could increase the chance of discordant results, translating to reduced specificity in this cohort.

As previously discussed, the cohort of patients analyzed in this study was a subset of patients from a much larger population presenting for cfDNA screening. It is important to note that the findings from this study may not necessarily represent the larger screening group. To determine test performance in the broader screening group, outcome data on all cfDNA tests would be needed. For instance, from voluntary clinician feedback, it is known that additional false positive and false negative results were reported in a previously published study of over 23,000 twin samples submitted to the same laboratory for cfDNA screening during a partially overlapping timeframe and that these cases may not have been fully captured in the study derived solely from laboratory data.

### Cell free DNA testing-interpretation of results using an online calculator [^1155QhDb]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

All pregnant women, regardless of age, should be offered screening or invasive testing for chromosomal abnormalities before 20 weeks' gestation. Noninvasive prenatal screening for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a method that provides high sensitivity and specificity in validation studies, significantly reducing the need for unnecessary invasive procedures. Laboratories typically market and report a test's sensitivity and specificity to describe the test's accuracy. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) of a screening test — which is the proportion of positive results that are truly positive — depends on the prevalence of the condition in a population and often is not reported in direct-to-patient advertising.

False-positive cfDNA screening tests have been reported, and evidence suggests some women decide to terminate their pregnancy without confirmatory testing. We believe laboratories should disclose the patient-specific PPV of cfDNA screening for aneuploidy on result reports. To aid in counseling patients about the benefits, risks, and limitations of aneuploidy screening using cfDNA, and to illustrate the relationship between an a priori risk and PPV, we developed a web-based calculator. This tool estimates the PPV for the four commercially available cfDNA testing platforms for which data have been published. Estimates are generated using a patient's age and gestational age-related risk of trisomy 21, 18, and 13 or an a priori risk based on other findings. This web-based calculator serves as an essential aid for providers and genetic counselors.

### A 2-year review of publicly funded cell-free DNA screening in Ontario: Utilization and adherence to funding criteria [^117UBHxd]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Low credibility.

Ontario offers a publicly funded modified contingent model of prenatal screening for aneuploidy in which cell-free DNA (cfDNA) screening is covered for pregnancies at higher risk of fetal aneuploidy. The objective of this study was to review the utilization of provincially funded cfDNA screening and adherence to the criteria laid out in Ontario prenatal screening guidelines.

This was a descriptive cohort study using data collected by Ontario's prescribed maternal and child registry. The study population included all pregnant individuals who received cfDNA screening from January 2016 to December 2017.

- **Results**: The most common criteria for provincially funded cfDNA screening were advanced maternal age ≥ 40 years (37.7%), positive multiple marker screen (34.1%), modifying risk factors such as ultrasound soft markers (7.1%), and previous aneuploidy (5.5%). The audit demonstrated that 2.9% of funded cfDNA screening tests did not meet funding criteria, and 11.4% of self-paid cfDNA screens could have been publicly funded.

Reviewing and auditing the application of criteria for funded cfDNA screening using prescribed registry data provides an opportunity to identify areas where targeted education may improve adherence to standardized screening protocols. It also offers a basis for reassessment of the funding model.

### Noninvasive prenatal exome sequencing diagnostic utility limited by sequencing depth and fetal fraction [^111F2cKv]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Low credibility.

Sequencing cell-free DNA now allows the detection of large chromosomal abnormalities and dominant Mendelian disorders in the prenatal period. Improving these methods would enable newborn screening programs to start with prenatal genetics, ultimately enhancing the management of rare genetic disorders.

- **Methods**: As a pilot study, we performed exome sequencing on the cell-free DNA from three mothers with singleton pregnancies to assess the viability of broad sequencing modalities in a noninvasive prenatal setting.

- **Results**: We found poor resolution of maternal and fetal genotypes due to both sampling and technical issues.

- **Conclusion**: We find broad sequencing modalities inefficient for noninvasive prenatal applications. Alternatively, we suggest a more targeted path forward for noninvasive prenatal genotyping.

### Diurnal effects on the fraction of fetal cell-free DNA in maternal plasma [^113d5WDy]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Low credibility.

Non‐invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has revolutionized prenatal care by enabling early and accurate detection of fetal chromosomal abnormalities (such as trisomy 13, 18, and 21) through the analysis of cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. cfDNA in maternal blood comprises a mix of small genomic DNA fragments (< 200 base pairs) released primarily from the mother's hematopoietic system and organs, while the smaller fetal DNA fraction is derived mainly from syncytiotrophoblast cell turnover in the placenta. Fetal fraction (FF), defined as the ratio of fetal cfDNA to total circulating cfDNA in maternal plasma, is a critical parameter for ensuring NIPT accuracy and interpreting clinical outcomes. Estimates of FF can vary significantly between and within pregnancies but generally range between 0.10 and 0.15 during gestational weeks 10–20 (the most common period for NIPT).

In general, higher FFs allow greater statistical separation between aneuploid and euploid pregnancies, enhancing test performance. Conversely, low FFs reduce detection rates and may lead to uninformative or "no call" outcomes if the FF does not meet the assay‐specific minimum threshold, typically ranging from 0.02 to 0.04. Although most NIPT tests yield successful results, approximately 1%–8% of pregnant women receive uninformative or no-call outcomes, primarily due to insufficient FF. Such cases pose significant challenges for clinical management, as they often necessitate either a repeat test using a second blood sample or invasive procedures such as amniocentesis, which carry additional risks.
