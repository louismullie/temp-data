## Question

timing for antiplatelet therapy after initial myocardial infarction in a 50 year old male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the timing of antiplatelet therapy after an initial myocardial infarction in a 50-year-old male. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is STEMI or NSTEMI. Then, I should verify immediate initiation details for aspirin and P2Y12 inhibitors. Next, I will examine duration of dual antiplatelet therapy and how it varies by bleeding and ischemic risk. After that, I need to check what to do after DAPT ends and whether extended therapy is indicated. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like fibrinolysis, surgery, and perioperative management, and close with a concise, risk-stratified recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. At age 50, the baseline ischemic risk is typically high after an MI, and bleeding risk is usually lower than in older adults, which supports standard-duration DAPT unless there are specific bleeding risk factors, so I should not jump to conclusions about shortening therapy solely based on age alone [^2bcb10e3].

> I need to verify immediate aspirin timing. Current ESC and ACC/AHA guidance recommend aspirin as soon as possible in ACS, with a loading dose of 150–300 mg orally, followed by 75–100 mg daily long term, and this applies regardless of STEMI or NSTEMI presentation, so I should confirm that this was given in the emergency phase and continue it indefinitely if tolerated [^716ac271] [^3199846b] [^94afc891].

> Next, I should review P2Y12 inhibitor initiation. For ACS, guidelines advise adding a P2Y12 inhibitor promptly: prasugrel 60 mg load then 10 mg daily if proceeding to PCI and not contraindicated, ticagrelor 180 mg load then 90 mg twice daily as an alternative, or clopidogrel 300–600 mg load then 75 mg daily if prasugrel/ticagrelor are unsuitable or if bleeding risk is high; I should double-check that the loading dose was actually administered and document the timing relative to PCI or fibrinolysis [^ec3b1df7] [^d798b8e6] [^0cd08f3b].

> Hold on, I should verify duration of DAPT. Standard duration after ACS is 12 months of aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, with consideration of shorter courses in high bleeding risk and longer courses in selected high ischemic risk patients; importantly, recent network meta-analyses suggest that 1 month of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduces bleeding without increasing MACCE, and 3 months followed by P2Y12 monotherapy may optimize the balance of ischemia and bleeding, so I need to align duration with the patient's bleeding and ischemic risk profiles rather than use a fixed 12 months for everyone [^ec3b1df7] [^846c5e63] [^c5bb6e29].

> Let me consider bleeding risk stratification. High bleeding risk includes age ≥ 75, low body weight, prior bleeding, oral anticoagulation, or planned surgery; in such cases, shortening DAPT to 1–3 months followed by single antiplatelet therapy is reasonable, whereas low bleeding risk supports the standard 12-month DAPT; I should confirm whether any of these factors are present before finalizing duration [^2bcb10e3] [^40a9a4c9] [^1695537e].

> I should confirm what happens after DAPT ends. Once DAPT is completed, lifelong single antiplatelet therapy is recommended, typically with aspirin 75–100 mg daily; however, in selected patients at high ischemic and low bleeding risk, extended DAPT with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily plus aspirin for up to 3 years can be considered to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events, so I need to reassess risk at 12 months to decide on extension [^1b89b217] [^8dd5df7e].

> But wait, what if the patient received fibrinolysis rather than primary PCI. I need to check fibrinolysis-specific guidance: clopidogrel should be started with a 300 mg load if age < 75 years and without a load if ≥ 75 years, and if PCI is performed after fibrinolysis, ticagrelor or prasugrel can be used with attention to timing and contraindications; I should verify that these nuances were applied if relevant [^92d52f98] [^83c16254].

> Next, I should review perioperative and procedural considerations. If elective surgery is planned, delaying procedures and interrupting P2Y12 therapy according to agent-specific intervals is advised, with cangrelor bridging considered in select cases; for urgent procedures, multidisciplinary planning is essential to balance bleeding and ischemic risk, and I should confirm the timing of interruption and resumption to mitigate stent thrombosis [^e163e005] [^96ab1908].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified plan for this 50-year-old. Immediate aspirin 150–300 mg load then 75–100 mg daily indefinitely, plus a P2Y12 inhibitor load and 12 months of DAPT if bleeding risk is low; if bleeding risk is high, consider 1–3 months of DAPT followed by single antiplatelet therapy, preferably a P2Y12 inhibitor for 12 months; after 12 months, continue aspirin monotherapy and reassess for extended ticagrelor-based DAPT if ischemic risk remains high and bleeding risk low; I should document the risk assessment and shared decision-making at each step [^716ac271] [^ec3b1df7] [^846c5e63] [^8dd5df7e].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed the core question about timing. The answer is that antiplatelet therapy should begin immediately upon presentation with aspirin loading, with a P2Y12 inhibitor added as early as feasible depending on PCI timing and bleeding risk, and the duration of DAPT should be individualized to bleeding and ischemic risk rather than fixed, which is the most evidence-aligned approach for a 50-year-old after an initial MI [^716ac271] [^ec3b1df7] [^846c5e63].

Start antiplatelet therapy **immediately** after an initial MI in a 50-year-old male: give aspirin 150–300 mg loading dose [^716ac271] [^3199846b] followed by 75–100 mg daily [^94afc891], and add a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel 300 mg load [^ec3b1df7] then 75 mg daily, or ticagrelor 180 mg load then 90 mg twice daily) [^0c948873] as soon as possible [^0cd08f3b]. Continue **dual antiplatelet therapy for 12 months** [^ec3b1df7] if there is no high bleeding risk, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or a P2Y12 inhibitor) [^1b89b217] for long-term secondary prevention. If bleeding risk is high, shorten DAPT to 6 months [^391fdb7d] or consider P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 1 month [^e934220a] [^846c5e63]. Immediate DAPT reduces recurrent MI, stroke, and death [^0c948873] [^2bcb10e3]; tailor duration to ischemic versus bleeding risk [^2ee96922].

## Immediate initiation of antiplatelet therapy

### Aspirin

- **Loading dose**: 150–300 mg orally as soon as possible [^716ac271] [^3199846b].
- **Maintenance dose**: 75–100 mg daily indefinitely [^1b89b217] [^94afc891].
- **Rationale**: Early aspirin reduces vascular mortality, reinfarction, and stroke by ~23% without excess hemorrhagic stroke or major bleeding [^28676d1d].

---

### P2Y12 inhibitor

- **Clopidogrel**: 300 mg loading dose, then 75 mg daily [^ec3b1df7].
- **Ticagrelor**: 180 mg loading dose, then 90 mg twice daily [^0c948873].
- **Prasugrel**: 60 mg loading dose, then 10 mg daily (5 mg if ≥ 75 years or < 60 kg) [^d798b8e6].
- **Timing**: Initiate as early as possible; pretreatment before PCI reduces ischemic events without excess bleeding [^1153f148].

---

## Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

Standard duration is **12 months** of aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor after ACS [^ec3b1df7] [^0cd08f3b], balancing ischemic benefit against bleeding risk [^2bcb10e3]. Shorter DAPT (6 months) is reasonable for patients at **high bleeding risk** [^391fdb7d] [^40a9a4c9], whereas **extended DAPT** (> 12 months) may be considered for patients at high ischemic and low bleeding risk [^8dd5df7e] [^3a2519bf].

---

## Transition to single antiplatelet therapy

After 12 months of DAPT, transition to **single antiplatelet therapy** — aspirin 75–100 mg daily [^1b89b217] or a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel 75 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily) [^172ff6fc] — for long-term secondary prevention. In patients at high bleeding risk, consider switching to single antiplatelet therapy after 1–3 months of DAPT [^391fdb7d] [^e934220a].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting immediate antiplatelet therapy

Immediate aspirin reduces vascular mortality, reinfarction, and stroke by ~23% [^28676d1d]. Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor further reduces cardiovascular events after ACS [^0c948873] [^2bcb10e3]. Early P2Y12 inhibitor pretreatment before PCI reduces ischemic events without increasing bleeding [^1153f148].

## Risks and benefits of immediate antiplatelet therapy

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Reduced recurrent MI, stroke, and death [^0c948873] [^2bcb10e3] | Increased bleeding risk, especially with DAPT [^2bcb10e3] [^b99cea60] |
| Improved coronary patency and reduced stent thrombosis [^7a0e2201] | Gastrointestinal bleeding (mitigated by PPIs) [^12ea6f33] |
| Enhanced myocardial salvage and reduced infarct size [^notfound] | Rare intracranial hemorrhage [^000d0fef] |

---

## Special considerations

- **High bleeding risk**: Use shorter DAPT (6 months) or P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after 1 month [^391fdb7d] [^e934220a].
- **High ischemic risk**: Consider extended DAPT (> 12 months) if bleeding risk is low [^8dd5df7e] [^3a2519bf].
- **Perioperative management**: Interrupt P2Y12 inhibitors 3–7 days pre-procedure based on agent; resume ASAP post-procedure [^e163e005] [^96ab1908].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Antiplatelet agent** | **Loading dose** | **Maintenance dose** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Aspirin | 150–300 mg | 75–100 mg daily | Indefinitely |
| Clopidogrel | 300 mg | 75 mg daily | 12 months (6 months if high bleeding risk) |
| Ticagrelor | 180 mg | 90 mg twice daily | 12 months (6 months if high bleeding risk) |
| Prasugrel | 60 mg | 10 mg daily (5 mg if ≥ 75 years or < 60 kg) | 12 months (6 months if high bleeding risk) |

---

Immediate antiplatelet therapy with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor is **essential after an initial MI** in a 50-year-old male [^716ac271] [^ec3b1df7]. Continue DAPT for 12 months if bleeding risk is acceptable, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy for long-term prevention [^1b89b217]. Tailor duration to individual ischemic and bleeding risk profiles [^2ee96922].

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^1e8a8bd1]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

### Oral antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome… [^0c948873]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance Acute coronary syndrome is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with an annual incidence of approximately 1 million. Dual antiplatelet therapy, consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor reduces cardiovascular event rates after ACS. Observations In 2016, the updated guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association recommended aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months for patients with ACS. Since these recommendations were published, new randomized clinical trials have studied different regimens and durations of antiplatelet therapy. Patients at higher risk are 65 years old or older; have low body weight, diabetes, or prior bleeding; or take oral anticoagulants.

The newest P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, are more potent, with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity of about 3% vs 30% to 40% with clopidogrel and act within 30 minutes compared with 2 hours for clopidogrel. The ISAR-REACT-5 trial found that prasugrel reduced rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year compared with ticagrelor among patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with no significant difference in bleeding. Recent trials suggested that discontinuing aspirin rather than the P2Y12 inhibitor may be associated with better outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces rates of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Specific combinations and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be based on patient characteristics — risk of bleeding myocardial ischemia. Kamran H, Jneid H, Kayani WT, et al.

### Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy during coronary thrombolysis [^879240be]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Plasminogen activators reduce mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction primarily by inducing reperfusion at a time when the myocardium is still viable. Consequently, important determinants of the clinical response to thrombolytic therapy include the patency rate, the timing of reperfusion, and the frequency of coronary reocclusion. With present thrombolytic agents, coronary patency is not achieved in 30%-50% of patients and reperfusion is often delayed for more than 60 min after initiating thrombolytic therapy. Even in those that achieve patency, reperfusion flow, an important determinant of myocardial salvage, may be limited by incomplete clot lysis and residual coronary stenosis. Finally, reocclusion has been reported in 15%-25% of patients and has serious clinical consequences. Experimental and clinical evidence suggests that many of these problems reflect ongoing platelet activation and thrombosis. Thus, there is a rational basis to assume that the clinical benefit of thrombolytic therapy will be enhanced by the addition of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents.

### How do cardiologists select patients for dual antiplatelet therapy continuation beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction? Insights from the EYESHOT post-MI study [^a90b167c]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this contemporary, nationwide, real‐world study on consecutive patients managed by cardiologists 1 to 3 years after a MI, risk scores recommended by current guidelines for guiding decisions on DAPT duration have been used in a small number of cases. A PCI with multiple stents and a history of PAD resulted as the clinical variables more frequently associated with DAPT continuation beyond 1 year from the index MI. These findings may have important implications for educational programs to improve adherence to current guidelines.

### Challenges of long-term dual antiplatelet therapy use following acute coronary syndromes [^046b97e1]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

An acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event is associated with a high risk of recurrent ACS, stroke, and death. To ameliorate the risk of subsequent events, current guidelines for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and non-ST-segment elevation ACS recommend long-term management strategies for secondary prevention including risk factor modification and anti-ischemic and antiplatelet therapies. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), comprising aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor, is a critical component of secondary prevention therapy following ACS. However, despite the importance of DAPT for secondary prevention after ACS, questions remain over the optimal duration of therapy. Clinical evidence is emerging that maintenance DAPT > 12 months lowers the risk of recurrent ACS events; however, this benefit must be considered against any potential risks of prolonged DAPT such as bleeding. Several tools for bleeding risk assessment have shown promise; however, their limited accuracy and discriminative power necessitates further development. Assessment of patient ischemic risk should consider the complexity of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure, anatomic burden of coronary artery disease, and additional underlying risk factors. Consequently, identifying patients in whom the risk:benefit ratio favors prolonged DAPT may prove invaluable for clinicians in deciding which patients should continue or stop taking DAPT at 12 months after PCI, or consider P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy as an option. This article reviews the most recent information about the risks and benefits of DAPT continued for > 12 months after ACS and provides critical guidance to assist physicians in identifying patients most likely to benefit from a secondary prevention strategy with DAPT.

### Antiplatelet therapy after acute myocardial infarction… [^9af06e22]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Prevention of thrombus formation after plaque rupture is thought to reduce further cardiovascular events after myocardial infarction. Studies report a 25 percent reduction in vascular events with short-term antiplatelet therapy and a 35 percent reduction with long-term warfarin therapy. Van Es and colleagues used a Dutch family-practice research network to compare three anticoagulation regimens following acute myocardial infarction. Patients planning a revascularization procedure and those with anemia or a history of stroke also were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned to therapy with low-dosage aspirin; warfarin, with a target International Normalized Ratio of 3. 0 to
4. 0; or low-dosage aspirin plus anticoagulants, with a target INR of 2. 0 to 2.
5. The mean age of the 993 patients for whom data were analyzed was 61 years, and approximately 75 percent of participants were men.

Myocardial infarction was diagnosed in more than 85 percent, and 13 percent of patients were diagnosed with unstable angina. The prevalence of risk factors was high. About one half of the patients were smokers, 36 to 40 percent had hypercholesterolemia, 20 to 27 percent had hypertension, and more than 30 percent had a family history of cardiovascular disease. The three treatment groups were comparable in demographic and significant clinical variables. During the study, 10 percent of the aspirin group, 19 percent of the warfarin group, and 20 percent of the combination-therapy group discontinued treatment. Mean INR levels in the target range were obtained in about one half of patients taking high-intensity warfarin and in about 40 percent of those taking combination therapy. The rates of vascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke were significantly lower in patients who took warfarin or combination therapy than in patients who took aspirin alone.

The authors conclude that either high-intensity warfarin therapy or the combination of aspirin plus medium-intensity oral anticoagulants is more effective than aspirin alone in reducing death and serious cardiovascular events following myocardial infarction. The combination therapy was, however, associated with a doubling of rare major bleeding events and a tripling of minor bleeding complications.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration — mortality signal and stent thrombosis lethality is described as follows: In completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), "the 21% increase in mortality rate with prolonged DAPT" is reported, with additional analyses showing "a significant 19% increase," "a significant 22% increase," "a significant 30% increase," and "a borderline 26% increase in mortality rate." Stent thrombosis lethality varies by timing, with "mortality rates approaching 50%" for acute and subacute events and "approximately 10%" for late and very late events; registry data show "a mortality rate of 39%" within 30 days versus "mortality rates of 12% (P < 0.001)" for 30 days to 1 year and > 1 year. Given these time-dependent risks, "extension of DAPT beyond 12 months may simultaneously reduce MI and stent thrombosis without influencing mortality rate."

### Coronary artery revascularization in the older adult population: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^f003f52f]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

St-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) reperfusion in older adults — preferred strategy, timelines, and key adjuncts: American and European society guidelines recommend primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) as the preferred reperfusion strategy in all acute STEMI when symptom onset to first medical contact is < 12 hours, with door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes or anticipated transfer to reperfusion time < 120 minutes (Class 1; Level of Evidence A). If pPCI is not possible, it is recommended that older patients should receive fibrinolysis when appropriate; trials demonstrated the importance of half-dose fibrinolytic therapy in patients ≥ 75 years and that in elderly patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset when pPCI was not available within 1 hour, half-dose fibrinolysis had similar safety and efficacy compared with pPCI. As adjunctive therapy with fibrinolysis, clopidogrel should be considered the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor, with patients > 75 years receiving an initial dose of 75 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 75 mg once daily; for access during pPCI, transradial access has been proven safe in older patients and should be considered the preferred access site to lower bleeding, vascular complications, acute kidney injury, and perhaps death in STEMI.

### Long-term antiplatelet therapy following myocardial infarction: implications of PEGASUS-TIMI 54 [^3a2519bf]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is standard treatment for patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), typically comprising the use of aspirin with either an irreversible thienopyridine P2Y12 inhibitor, clopidogrel or prasugrel, or reversibly binding ticagrelor. Pivotal studies led to guidelines recommending DAPT for up to 12months post-ACS. Despite this, there remains a significant burden of coronary artery disease (CAD)-related events up to and after this period. Recent meta-analyses, including both patients with ACS and patients with stable CAD treated with DAPT following percutaneous coronary intervention, have suggested that long-term thienopyridine-based DAPT reduces the risks of myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis but may paradoxically increase all-cause mortality risk. The PEGASUS-TIMI 54 (Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared to Placebo on a Background of Aspirin - Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 54) study examined the effects of long-term DAPT with aspirin and ticagrelor, compared with aspirin alone, on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and complications, including bleeding in patients with prior history of MI. It showed that, over a 3-year period, ticagrelor reduced the risk of MACE but increased non-fatal bleeding risk. Overall, the PEGASUS-TIMI 54 results demonstrate that patients with a history of ACS deemed to be at high risk of further ischaemic events, particularly those in whom the risks of ischaemic events and cardiovascular death outweigh the risk of life-threatening bleeding, may benefit from prolonged ticagrelor-based DAPT. Guidelines are emerging which reflect this. The relationship between aspirin and ticagrelor, particularly with regard to aspirin dosing, remains to be fully elucidated and attention has recently been turned to the option of ticagrelor monotherapy. Future studies will explore optimal individualised strategies for long-term antiplatelet therapy.

### Early and sustained dual oral antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention: a randomized controlled trial [^7a0e2201]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), short-term clopidogrel therapy in addition to aspirin leads to greater protection from thrombotic complications than aspirin alone. However, the optimal duration of combination oral antiplatelet therapy is unknown. Also, although current clinical data suggest a benefit for beginning therapy with a clopidogrel loading dose prior to PCI, the practical application of this therapy has not been prospectively studied.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefit of long-term (12-month) treatment with clopidogrel after PCI and to determine the benefit of initiating clopidogrel with a preprocedure loading dose, both in addition to aspirin therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The Clopidogrel for the Reduction of Events During Observation (CREDO) trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 2116 patients who were to undergo elective PCI or were deemed at high likelihood of undergoing PCI, enrolled at 99 centers in North America from June 1999 through April 2001.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose (n = 1053) or placebo (n = 1063) 3 to 24 hours before PCI. Thereafter, all patients received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, through day 28. From day 29 through 12 months, patients in the loading-dose group received clopidogrel, 75 mg/d, and those in the control group received placebo. Both groups received aspirin throughout the study.

Main Outcome Measures

One-year incidence of the composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in the intent-to-treat population; 28-day incidence of the composite of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization in the per-protocol population.

Results

At 1 year, long-term clopidogrel therapy was associated with a 26.9% relative reduction in the combined risk of death, MI, or stroke (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9%-44.4%; P = 0.02; absolute reduction, 3%). Clopidogrel pretreatment did not significantly reduce the combined risk of death, MI, or urgent target vessel revascularization at 28 days (reduction, 18.5%; 95% CI, -14.2% to 41.8%; P = 0.23). However, in a prespecified subgroup analysis, patients who received clopidogrel at least 6 hours before PCI experienced a relative risk reduction of 38.6% (95% CI, -1.6% to 62.9%; P = 0.051) for this end point compared with no reduction with treatment less than 6 hours before PCI. Risk of major bleeding at 1 year increased, but not significantly (8.8% with clopidogrel vs 6.7% with placebo; P = 0.07).

Conclusions

Following PCI, long-term (1-year) clopidogrel therapy significantly reduced the risk of adverse ischemic events. A loading dose of clopidogrel given at least 3 hours before the procedure did not reduce events at 28 days, but subgroup analyses suggest that longer intervals between the loading dose and PCI may reduce events.

### Incidence, time trends, and predictors of intracranial hemorrhage during long-term follow-up after acute myocardial infarction [^000d0fef]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Despite the marked increase in use of dual antiplatelet treatment over the course of the study, the incidence of ICH within 1 year of discharge after AMI was stable, at ≈0.35%, which is approximately 2 times higher than the incidence measured in a matched reference population. Advanced age, decreased renal function, previous ischemic stroke, and, most important, previous hemorrhagic stroke are all predictors of increased ICH risk, and therefore they need to be taken into account when making decisions regarding antithrombotic therapy upon hospital discharge. A previous ischemic stroke is associated with a higher risk of ICH when anticoagulant therapy, and possibly dual antiplatelet therapy, is used. Further research is needed to clarify the impact on ICH risk of the length of delay between onset of stroke and initiation of antithrombotic therapy.

### Ticagrelor or clopidogrel dual antiplatelet therapy following a pharmacoinvasive strategy in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^c1818dee]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Moreover, in the TREAT study, the median time of randomization was 11.4 h (interquartile range, 5.8–18.2 h) after fibrinolysis with antiplatelet study medications administered thereafter. In the current analysis, the median time from fibrinolysis to switching to ticagrelor was less than 10 h with a broad range including one quarter of all patients switched within 3 h of fibrinolysis. Acknowledging the small sample of patients, there was no associated increased risk of major bleeding in patients switched early after fibrinolysis. While clinicians may feel more comfortable switching from clopidogrel to ticagrelor further from the time of fibrinolysis, such as at the time of scheduled angiography and PCI for those with successful pharmacological reperfusion, roughly one‐third of patients will require rescue or urgent intervention. Our data is useful in this context as we have demonstrated no difference in bleeding events when switched early, that is, for rescue PCI or urgent PCI. While provocative, our findings do require confirmation in an appropriately powered clinical trial – however in the absence of such a study, this novel finding may assist practicing clinicians in switching earlier to ticagrelor at the time of rescue or urgent PCI following fibrinolysis.

The current analysis demonstrates a similar pattern of clinical practice to the Platelet inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) study where ticagrelor was administered at full loading dose early after STEMI diagnosis in patients with prior clopidogrel therapy; although it is acknowledged that PLATO indeed excluded the exact patients, we have studied. In patients post stent implantation there is substantial interest in: (1) the optimal timing of potent antiplatelet administration, (2) the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy and (3) switching to less potent antiplatelet strategies to minimize bleeding risk and decrease costs., Although many guidelines still recommend 1 year of potent dual antiplatelet therapy following acute myocardial infarction, the recent TicAgrelor versus cLOpidogrel in Stabilized patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction (TALOS‐AMI) suggested sustained efficacy and enhanced safety converting from ticagrelor to clopidogrel based dual antiplatelet therapy at 1 month following myocardial infarction with stenting. In the future, head to head comparisons of the multiple antiplatelet strategies in a large scale appropriately powered megatrial would help guide clinical care.

1.2 Guideline recommendations for invasive and antiplatelet treatment of patients with NSTEMI

The standard of care for patients with NSTEMI at high ischemic risk is an early invasive strategy with cardiac catheterization within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms, with prompt revascularization using PCI or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery as clinically indicated. 13, 14, 15 Major international guidelines also recommend initiation of at least 12 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor (ticagrelor, prasugrel, or clopidogrel) in patients with NSTEMI who are managed with medical therapy and/or who are treated with revascularization (ie, irrespective of initial treatment strategy), unless there are previous or ongoing contraindications. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Ticagrelor is recommended over clopidogrel for patients with NSTEMI, including those pretreated with clopidogrel (which should be discontinued when ticagrelor is started). Ticagrelor is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Prasugrel is recommended for patients with NSTEMI who have received angiography and are undergoing PCI. However, prasugrel is not recommended for patients in whom coronary anatomy is unknown and an indication for PCI is not clearly established; patients who are 75 years of age or older; or patients with a body weight of less than 60 kg. Prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with previous intracranial hemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, or ongoing bleeds. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18 Clopidogrel is a less potent P2Y 12 inhibitor than ticagrelor and prasugrel; it is recommended for patients who cannot receive ticagrelor or prasugrel, or who require oral anticoagulation. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18

Clinical risk scores, such as the DAPT score, can help guide decisions around whether to continue antiplatelet therapy beyond 1 year, by providing a risk‐benefit ratio based on age, smoking status, comorbidity, and medical history. 19 For patients with NSTEMI who are elderly and have a high comorbidity burden, conservative treatment could be a reasonable approach. 16, 19

### Oral antiplatelet therapy after acute coronary syndrome: a review [^2bcb10e3]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States with an annual incidence of approximately 1 million. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) reduces cardiovascular event rates after ACS.

Observations

In 2016, the updated guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) recommended aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor for at least 12 months for patients with ACS. Since these recommendations were published, new randomized clinical trials have studied different regimens and durations of antiplatelet therapy. Recommendations vary according to the risk of bleeding. If bleeding risk is low, prolonged DAPT may be considered, although the optimal duration of prolonged DAPT beyond 1 year is not well established. If bleeding risk is high, shorter duration (ie, 3–6 months) of DAPT may be reasonable. A high risk of bleeding traditionally is defined as a 1-year risk of serious bleeding (either fatal or associated with a ≥ 3-g/dL drop in hemoglobin) of at least 4% or a risk of an intracranial hemorrhage of at least 1%. Patients at higher risk are 65 years old or older; have low body weight (BMI < 18.5), diabetes, or prior bleeding; or take oral anticoagulants. The newest P2Y12 inhibitors, prasugrel and ticagrelor, are more potent, with high on-treatment residual platelet reactivity of about 3% vs 30% to 40% with clopidogrel and act within 30 minutes compared with 2 hours for clopidogrel. Clinicians should avoid prescribing prasugrel to patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack because of an increased risk of cerebrovascular events (6.5% vs 1.2% with clopidogrel, P = 0.002) and should avoid prescribing it to patients older than 75 years or who weigh less than 60 kg. The ISAR-REACT-5 trial found that prasugrel reduced rates of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke at 1 year compared with ticagrelor among patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (9.3% vs 6.9%, P = 0.006) with no significant difference in bleeding. Recent trials suggested that discontinuing aspirin rather than the P2Y12 inhibitor may be associated with better outcomes.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dual antiplatelet therapy reduces rates of cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Specific combinations and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy should be based on patient characteristics-risk of bleeding myocardial ischemia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### New heparin dosing recommendations for patients with acute coronary syndromes [^62e16f36]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Despite major innovations in antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy, unfractionated intravenous heparin is widely used to treat acute coronary syndromes. Recommendations for unfractionated heparin dosing in acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina have been issued in two recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines. An initial heparin bolus of 60 U/kg (maximum, 4000 U) followed by a 12-U/kg/h infusion (maximum 1000 U/h) is recommended with alteplase for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. When intravenous heparin is administered for myocardial infarction with non-ST elevation and unstable angina, an initial bolus of 60 to 70 U/kg (maximum, 5000 U) followed by a 12- to 15-U/kg/h infusion is recommended. The goal is to achieve an activated partial thromboplastin time of 50 to 70 seconds. Here, we review these new dosing regimens and explain the rationale for their use. We also review the risk of bleeding with heparin, especially when administered concurrently with aspirin, thrombolytic agents, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists, and the relationship between activated partial thromboplastin time and cardiac events.

### Timing, selection, modulation, and duration of P2YInhibitors for patients With acute coronary syndromes Undergoing PCI [^7a7cff83]. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and the oral P2Y 12 inhibitor clopidogrel as the cornerstone of treatment for patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was firstly established in 2001. Soon thereafter, the newer-generation P2Y 12 inhibitors prasugrel and ticagrelor became commercially available. The clinical management of ACS patients undergoing PCI has evolved significantly in the last 2 decades, with a shift toward more rapid invasive management, broader use of drug-eluting stents, and the increasing recognition that major bleeding due to antiplatelet therapy is detrimental. In this ever-changing scenario, numerous studies have addressed 4 main questions regarding P2Y 12 inhibition in ACS patients undergoing PCI: timing, selection, modulation, and duration. This paper reviews the latest evidence surrounding these topical questions, with a focus on efficacy and safety data, practice guidelines, and residual areas of uncertainty.

### Single and dual antiplatelet therapy in elderly patients of medically managed myocardial infarction [^cef63183]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Antiplatelet therapy has been considered the standard treatment for secondary prevention of ischemic events and mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been established in the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial, which showed improved outcomes among patients with non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) after treatment with DAPT. Among patients with AMI, DAPT limits early steps of platelet aggregation and adhesion in the formation of coronary arteries thrombi, and improves clinical outcomes regardless of different reperfusion strategies.

In the era of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the benefit of primary PCI or early invasive management do exist along with DAPT. Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients with NSTEMI in clinical practice were managed medically, with low rate of prescriptions of DAPT. Among the elderly AMI patients, conflicting results have emerged from different studies regarding to different PCI strategies, such as early aggressive versus initially conservative strategies. In addition, the elderly AMI patients are frequently under-represented in clinical trials. Thus, there is uncertainty about efficacy and safety of DAPT in elderly AMI patients. As a result, elderly population are less likely to receive evidence-based therapies, but are apt to be managed medically.

Less than one-half of medically managed patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) received clopidogrel on discharge. A relatively lower use of aspirin associated with increasing age was noted as well. The impact of different anti-platelet strategies among medically managed elderly patient with AMI remains unclear. We therefore examined the effectiveness of DAPT and single antiplatelet therapy (aspirin only or clopidogrel only) in a real-world, community-based cohort of very elderly patients (above 85 years of age) who were medically managed after AMI.

### Shorter dual antiplatelet therapy for older adults after percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^69bef4da]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study was focused on ascertaining the optimal duration of DAPT; the optimal choice of subsequent SAPT remains a matter of debate. The included RCTs differed on the agent used for SAPT; thus, the choice of agent for post-DAPT SAPT remains a source of heterogeneity. A meta-analysis showed that compared with DAPT, both aspirin monotherapy and P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduced major bleeding to a similar degree, but patients receiving post-DAPT aspirin monotherapy had a higher risk of MI compared with patients receiving post-DAPT P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. A recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association endorsed clopidogrel as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor for older patients with ACS due to clopidogrel's lower bleeding profile compared with ticagrelor or prasugrel, while leaving ticagrelor for those patients with the highest ischemic risk. Further studies will be required to confirm the optimal SAPT for older adults.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for stented patients: an update for the clinician [^09f2c53a]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention is a complex decision. Randomized controlled trials have shown that while shorter durations of DAPT may lower the risk of bleeding, longer durations of DAPT can reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis and ischemia-related events. In this review article, we will discuss the current guidelines, review contemporary trial data that have evaluated short and extended durations of DAPT, and address common clinical questions. Ultimately, the determination of the optimal duration of DAPT is an individualized decision that requires clinicians to assess each patient's risk for bleeding and recurrent ischemic events.

Adjunctive antithrombotic and antiplatelet pharmacology in women — treatment standards and sex effects: Antithrombotic therapy is the cornerstone of treatment in patients undergoing coronary revascularization, and studies have suggested that women are undertreated with guideline-recommended therapies; despite pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic sex differences, randomized controlled trials indicate that both women and men have similar therapeutic benefits. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the standard of care for preventing thrombotic events after PCI; although increased platelet reactivity has been shown among women receiving aspirin and reductions in ischemic events with oral P2Y12 inhibitors have been shown to be greater in men, most studies have shown no significant interactions between specific P2Y12 inhibitor treatment and sex, sex has not been shown to be an independent predictor of bleeding complications with use of specific agents, and the minimum required duration of use for an oral P2Y12 receptor inhibitor varies according to the clinical setting.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

### Antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndrome… [^620f8df7]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute coronary syndrome presents as unstable angina pectoris and non–ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction. This syndrome has high short-term morbidity and mortality rates. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association revised guidelines in 2002 to diagnose and pharmacologically treat patients with ACS. The guidelines provide documentation of the levels of evidence for various treatment recommendations. Boden reviewed the most recent ACC/AHA guidelines. The diagnosis of non–ST-segment elevation ACS is based on the usual methods of symptom history, physical examination, electrocardiographic changes at presentation, and abnormal serum cardiac markers, including troponins and creatine kinase MB isoforms. The role of other, more recently studied, markers is uncertain.

Risk stratification of patients with ACS for recurrent ischemic events or death is based on conventional information or risk-stratification models such as the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction risk score. Evidence supports treatment with newer antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents for all patients with ACS. Clopidogrel in combination with aspirin is recommended for intermediate- and high-risk patients and all patients with an added glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. High-risk patients require invasive investigation. Treatment with a loading dose of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin before percutaneous coronary intervention appears to have a beneficial effect. Fixed-dose warfarin therapy is reserved for patients with ACS who also have an established indication, such as atrial fibrillation or severe left ventricular dysfunction. Coronary bypass surgery remains an option for patients who have left main or multivessel coronary artery disease.

If this course is being considered, early treatment with antiplatelet medications before catheterization may be delayed. Platelet transfusion can be administered to patients who have received an early loading dose of anti-platelet medication and later require coronary bypass surgery. The author concludes that the ACC/AHA guidelines can improve the outcomes of patients with ACS. Secondary prevention strategies include the use of aspirin, clopidogrel, beta blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, if indicated.

### How do cardiologists select patients for dual antiplatelet therapy continuation beyond 1 year after a myocardial infarction? Insights from the EYESHOT post-MI study [^d3fb5e08]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Current guidelines suggest to consider dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) continuation for longer than 12months in selected patients with myocardial infarction (MI).

Hypothesis

We sought to assess the criteria used by cardiologists in daily practice to select patients with a history of MI eligible for DAPT continuation beyond 1 year.

Methods

We analyzed data from the EYESHOT Post-MI, a prospective, observational, nationwide study aimed to evaluate the management of patients presenting to cardiologists 1 to 3years from the last MI event.

Results

Out of the 1633 post-MI patients enrolled in the study between March and December 2017, 557 (34.1%) were on DAPT at the time of enrolment, and 450 (27.6%) were prescribed DAPT after cardiologist assessment. At multivariate analyses, a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with multiple stents and the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) resulted as independent predictors of DAPT continuation, while atrial fibrillation was the only independent predictor of DAPT interruption for patients both at the second and the third year from MI at enrolment and the time of discharge/end of the visit.

Conclusions

Risk scores recommended by current guidelines for guiding decisions on DAPT duration are underused and misused in clinical practice. A PCI with multiple stents and a history of PAD resulted as the clinical variables more frequently associated with DAPT continuation beyond 1 year from the index MI.

### Bleeding after initiation of multiple antithrombotic drugs, including triple therapy, in atrial fibrillation patients following myocardial infarction and coronary intervention: a nationwide cohort study [^aa6be69c]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Uncertainty remains over optimal antithrombotic treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation presenting with myocardial infarction and/or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We investigated the risk and time frame for bleeding following myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation according to antithrombotic treatment.

Methods and Results

Patients with atrial fibrillation and admitted with myocardial infarction or for percutaneous coronary intervention between 2000 and 2009 (11 480 subjects, mean age 75.6 years [SD ± 10.3], males 60.9%) were identified by individual level linkage of nationwide registries in Denmark. Fatal or nonfatal (requiring hospitalization) bleeding was determined according to antithrombotic treatment regimen: triple therapy (TT) with vitamin K antagonist (VKA)+aspirin+clopidogrel, VKA+antiplatelet, and dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin+clopidogrel. We calculated crude incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios by Cox regression models. Within 1 year, 728 bleeding events were recorded (6.3%); 79 were fatal (0.7%). Within 30 days, rates were 22.6, 20.3, and 14.3 bleeding events per 100 person-years for TT, VKA+antiplatelet, and dual antiplatelet therapy, respectively. Both early (within 90 days) and delayed (90–360 days) bleeding risk with TT exposure in relation to VKA+antiplatelet was increased; hazard ratio 1.47 (1.04;2.08) and 1.36 (0.95;1.95), respectively. No significant difference in thromboembolic risk was observed for TT versus VKA+antiplatelet; hazard ratio, 1.15 (0.95;1.40).

Conclusions

High risk of bleeding is immediately evident with TT after myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation. A continually elevated risk associated with TT indicates no safe therapeutic window, and TT should only be prescribed after thorough bleeding risk assessment of patients.

Fibrinolytic-treated STEMI antiplatelet dosing and PCI alternatives — In CLARITY-TIMI 28, adding clopidogrel to aspirin in STEMI patients who were < 75 years and received fibrinolytic therapy reduced the odds of an occluded infarct-related artery and the 30-day composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischemia requiring urgent revascularization. In COMMIT among suspected myocardial infarction (93% STEMI, 54% fibrinolytic-treated) receiving aspirin, clopidogrel 75 mg/day (without a loading dose) significantly lowered the composite of death, reinfarction, or stroke and mortality alone, with no significant excess in bleeding versus placebo. Based on the design of these trials, when administered concurrently with fibrinolytic therapy, clopidogrel is recommended to be administered with a loading dose (300 mg, then 75 mg daily) for patients < 75 years of age and starting without a loading dose (75 mg daily) for patients ≥ 75 years of age. For patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent who undergo subsequent PCI, either clopidogrel or ticagrelor (age < 75 years, within 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) or prasugrel (> 24 hours after a fibrinolytic agent) are alternatives to support PCI. In a trial of 3799 fibrinolytic-treated STEMI patients, 89% of whom also received clopidogrel, ticagrelor initiated at a median of 11.4 hours (interquartile range, 5.8–18.2 hours) after fibrinolysis was noninferior to clopidogrel for major bleeding.

### Extended dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor 60 mg in patients with prior myocardial infarction: the design of ALETHEIA, a multi-country observational study [^c1840005]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Fourth, the 5000 person‐years on treatment threshold is considered as the minimum number required for sufficient precision in clinical outcome assessment. While this threshold is expected to be met, person‐years on treatment is a function of both time on treatment and number of patients, and is thereby influenced by the databases' available duration of longitudinal data as well as their national coverage.

Fifth, to allow contextualization of patient characteristics, reference cohorts of nonticagrelor patients will be described at a similar time point from their qualifying MI as will be observed among the patients initiating ticagrelor 60 mg. In routine clinical practice, patients treated for ACS may continue being prescribed a P2Y 12 inhibitor more than 12 months after an MI, despite not being intended for extended antiplatelet treatment. To limit the inclusion of such patients in the nonticagrelor P2Y 12 inhibitor cohort, categorization of patients into either reference cohort will be based on their treatment at a minimum of 15 months after their qualifying MI. Exposure to nonticagrelor P2Y 12 inhibitors or lack of exposure to P2Y 12 inhibitors may therefore be assessed after the index date for some patients, introducing a survival bias to patients in the reference cohort. Although the extent of this bias cannot be quantified a priori, the impact is likely minimal given the short maximum timeframe between the index date (≥ 12 months post‐MI) and the time of treatment assessment (≥ 15 months post‐MI). Sixth, while the primary analyses will be conducted using an on‐treatment approach, reflecting events that occur when patients are receiving ticagrelor 60 mg, censoring at treatment discontinuation may introduce bias due to informative censoring. This could occur if the risk of discontinuing treatment is related to the events of interest, thus violating the key assumption in survival analyses that censoring events are random. While difficult to properly account for, the likelihood of such bias being introduced will be assessed by investigating baseline factors associated with discontinuation. To further assess the potential risk of informative bias, event rates will also be calculated using an intention‐to‐treat approach.

In conclusion, despite the increasing recognition of observational studies to inform healthcare decision‐making, knowledge about treatment patterns and associated outcomes in patients treated with ticagrelor 60 mg in routine clinical practice is limited. The multi‐country, observational ALETHEIA study is designed to address this gap. The study objectives and the a priori specified stepwise approach used for outcomes analyses are expected to generate useful insights for clinical decision‐making and treatment optimization.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation [^ef1ce93d]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet pharmacotherapy reduces ischemic events at the cost of excess bleeding in patients who underwent coronary stenting. The currently recommended treatment period is based on trials held some 20 years ago and not relevant to current clinical practice. In recent years, numerous clinical trials have tried to answer the question of what is the optimal duration of therapy to maximize clinical benefit. These trials showed 2 seemingly conflicting answers-on one hand, shorter treatment duration seems to be safer in reducing bleeding while not increasing ischemic events, and on the other hand, longer duration is superior in terms of preventing ischemic events albeit at the cost of increased bleeding rates. In this review, we summarize the evidence favoring each approach, highlight the limitations of the various pivotal clinical trials in this field, review future directions of research and changes in practice that may influence the duration of antiplatelet therapy, and attempt to propose a personalized approach to achieve maximal benefit for the individual patient.

### ACC / AHA guideline update for the management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^98adfec0]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association, in collaboration with the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, have issued an update of the 2004 guideline for the management of patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses and accepts this guideline as its policy. Early recognition and prompt initiation of reperfusion therapy remains the cornerstone of management of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Aspirin should be given to symptomatic patients. Beta blockers should be used cautiously in the acute setting because they may increase the risk of cardiogenic shock and death. The combination of clopidogrel and aspirin is indicated in patients who have had ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A stepped care approach to analgesia for musculoskeletal pain in patients with coronary heart disease is provided. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increase mortality risk and should be avoided. Primary prevention is important to reduce the burden of heart disease. Secondary prevention interventions are critically important to prevent recurrent events in patients who survive.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery revascularization — areas for further research include determining the optimal role and timing for revascularization in cardiogenic shock; methods and techniques for coronary artery bypass graft; the use of mechanical support for high-risk PCI; the role of drug-coated balloons; and the optimal duration of antiplatelet therapy after PCI and in atrial fibrillation. Additional priorities note that new devices for PCI require research to define safety and effectiveness in real-world populations, and that the role of chronic total occlusion therapies on long-term outcomes such as death, heart failure events, and optimal case selection needs further study. Evidence to date indicates that in selected patients with chronic coronary disease, an initial strategy of guideline-directed medical therapy alone, compared with guideline-directed medical therapy plus revascularization, has similar effects on outcomes including death, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and hospitalization for unstable angina, with investigations needed to compare long-term effects, identify subgroups that may have a mortality benefit from early revascularization, and assess effects on symptoms and quality of life. Physiologic assessment by invasive techniques such as fractional flow reserve and instantaneous wave-free ratio has shown that for some stenoses revascularization may be safely deferred, while more research is needed on noninvasive computed tomographic coronary angiography to assess coronary flow reserve and predict long-term outcomes. Further needs include research on myocardial preservation during surgery, alternative conduits for repeat procedures, hybrid procedures, and identification of gender-based differences in responses to therapies.

1 Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the cornerstone of medical therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DAPT reduces recurrent ischemic events, most notably in‐stent thrombosis, the risks of which are markedly elevated following PCI. With appropriate treatment, the risk of ischemic events generally decreases over the 1−3 months after intervention, whereas the risk of bleeding persists and is proportional to the intensity and duration of treatment. The reductions of these ischemic events like, stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, must be weighed against the increased bleeding risks associated with these DAPT, as both recurrent ischemia and bleeding are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Weighing these risks, both US and European guidelines currently recommend 6‐ and 12‐month durations of DAPT following PCI with drug‐eluting stents (DES) for stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respectively, in patients without high bleeding risk, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) indefinitely.

The risk‐benefit equation of DAPT after PCI has evolved, however, with the development of new medical and interventional therapies, like more potent P2Y12 inhibitors and newer generation DES. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have brought into question the appropriate duration of DAPT following PCI and suggest it may be shorter than current recommendations. Despite these trials, multiple questions remain unclear, such as the optimal duration of DAPT after PCI, the choice of agent in SAPT, and which specific populations may benefit most from shorter durations of DAPT. To answer these questions, we conducted a meta‐analysis of RCTs examining a shorter duration of DAPT.

### Optimizing monotherapy selection, aspirin versus P2Y12 inhibitors, following percutaneous coronary intervention [^2b2fd3ce]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) reduces ischemic and thrombotic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Initial reports of higher myocardial infarction and mortality rates prompted guideline committees to choose 12-month duration of DAPT after PCI. However, higher bleeding rates with DAPT remain a major concern. Since these guidelines were published, there have been improvements in stent design, deployment techniques, and antiplatelet therapies, which have reduced ischemic events. To address bleeding concerns, trials were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of short-duration DAPT. Two main strategies were employed: (1) aspirin monotherapy after a short-duration DAPT, and (2) P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after a short-duration DAPT. In this review, we outline all the major trials on short-duration DAPT that have examined the previously mentioned strategies and propose a new individualized treatment algorithm for which monotherapy to choose or remove after PCI. In conclusion, while removing the P2Y12 inhibitor after a short DAPT appears to be safe in the low-risk population, removing aspirin and continuing the P2Y12 inhibitor as monotherapy would be the preferred strategy in intermediate- to high-risk patients to mitigate the bleeding risk.

### One-year outcomes of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^c5bb6e29]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), though the optimal duration is unclear. DAPT reduces stent thrombosis, repeat myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death, though at the cost of increased bleeding events. Currently, both European and American guidelines recommend a 6‐month duration of DAPT following PCI with drug‐eluting stents (DES) for stable coronary disease and a 12‐month regimen following PCI for acute coronary syndrome. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) suggest a shorter duration of DAPT may be acceptable. PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were queried from inception to June 2025 to identify RCTs comparing short (≤ 3 months) with traditional durations of DAPT following PCI with DES and reporting outcomes of interest at 1 year, including major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and net adverse clinical events (NACE). Individual endpoints including mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, significant bleeding, and target vessel revascularization were analyzed. Effect estimates were pooled using a random‐effects model and reported as risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals. Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria, reporting results on 53,421 patients, of whom 26,712 patients were in the short DAPT cohort and 26,719 in the traditional DAPT cohort. Duration of DAPT ranged from 1 to 3 months. Ten studies used P2Y12 inhibitors as the single antiplatelet agent following DAPT, whereas three studies used aspirin. Patients were 76.0% male, mean age 64.0 years, and 64.9% with ACS on presentation. Shorter duration of DAPT significantly decreased NACE (RR: 0.80; [0.71, 0.91], p < 0.001) without impacting MACE (RR: 0.98; [0.89, 1.07], p = 0.64) at 1 year following PCI with DES. A 3‐month duration of DAPT demonstrated favorable results over shorter durations, and monotherapy with a high‐potency P2Y12 inhibitor was preferable over aspirin or a low‐potency P2Y12 inhibitor. In patients who underwent a PCI with DES placement, a 3‐month duration of DAPT decreased NACE without impacting other MACCE compared to guideline‐directed DAPT durations.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy for at least 12 months to reduce bleeding risk in selected patients with chronic coronary disease treated with PCI and a drug-eluting stent completed a 1-3-month course of dual antiplatelet therapy.

### A 43-year-old man with angina, elevated troponin, and lateral ST depression: management of acute coronary syndromes [^0cce692e]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Each year, approximately 2 million people in the United States experience acute coronary syndromes related to thrombosis and ulceration of atherosclerotic plaque within a coronary artery. The case of Mr C, a 43-year-old man with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, which is most often caused by subtotal thrombosis, illustrates the complex decision-making process involved in selecting treatment for each patient and in determining whether invasive procedures are warranted. Cardiac catheterization is performed in moderate- and high-risk individuals to define the extent of disease so the proper strategy — medications alone, percutaneous revascularization, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery — can be selected. Medications to disrupt platelet function as well as the coagulation system are used. Treatments are designed to minimize the extent of infarction and prevent reinfarction, thereby improving outcomes. The timing of cardiac catheterization, for whom catheterization is indicated, and the rationale for medication treatment are discussed.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Limitations of the analyses — Heterogeneity in bleeding definitions and lack of individual-level data for a common definition (e.g. TIMI major or minor) may limit interpretation; RCTs in DES recipients generally enrolled low-risk patients with 8 of 11 trials reporting lower than expected event rates, resulting in imprecise MI and bleeding estimates with wide confidence intervals; although follow-up rates were 92% to 95%, these must be considered alongside bleeding and mortality rates of 1% to 4% over the trials.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics Benefiting From Extended‐Duration DAPT

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

### Antiplatelet therapy changes for patients with myocardial infarction with recurrent ischemic events: insights into contemporary practice from the TRANSLATE-ACS (treatment with ADP receptor inhibitors: longitudinal assessment of treatment patterns and events after acute coronary syndrome) study [^edc6cfa6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy for 1 year after myocardial infarction (MI), yet little guidance is provided on antiplatelet management for patients with recurrent ischemic events during that year. We describe changes in P2Y 12 inhibitor type among patients with recurrent ischemic events in the first year after MI.

Methods and Results

The TRANSLATE-ACS (Treatment With ADP Receptor Inhibitors: Longitudinal Assessment of Treatment Patterns and Events After Acute Coronary Syndrome) study enrolled 12 365 patients with MI treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. We examined whether P2Y 12 inhibitor choice changed among patients with recurrent MI, stent thrombosis, and/or unplanned revascularization during the first year after MI, and modeled factors associated with P2Y 12 inhibitor intensification (changing clopidogrel to prasugrel or ticagrelor). In the first year after MI, 1414 patients (11%) had a total of 1740 recurrent ischemic events (771 recurrent MIs, 969 unplanned revascularizations, and 165 stent thromboses). Median time to the first recurrent ischemic event was 154 days (25th-75th percentiles, 55–287 days). Of those with recurrent ischemic events, 101 of 1092 (9.3%) occurring in clopidogrel-treated patients led to P2Y 12 inhibitor intensification. Recurrent events involving stent thrombosis or MI were the strongest factors associated with P2Y 12 inhibitor intensification, yet only 40% of patients with stent thrombosis and 14% of patients with recurrent MI had P2Y 12 inhibitor intensification. Increasing age and longer time from the index MI were associated with lower likelihood for intensification.

Conclusions

Few patients after MI with a recurrent ischemic event who were taking clopidogrel switched to a more potent P2Y 12 inhibitor, even after stent thrombosis events. Specific guidance is needed for patients who have recurrent ischemic events, particularly when closely spaced.

### Balancing the risks and benefits of long-term antiplatelet therapies for cardiovascular disease: clinical, research, and regulatory implications [^6d92e0a9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

The results from the different subgroups of the TRA 2°P trials have been reported previously, but the data contained within this paper represent the first report of the unique composite patient cohort that led to the approval of vorapaxar by the FDA for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. These results deserve closer consideration for a number of reasons. –

First, the optimal combinations of antiplatelet therapies and the preferred duration of antiplatelet treatment for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease are being reconsidered in light of other studies. The most recent version of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) non‐ST elevation acute coronary syndrome practice guidelines published in September 2014 recommends DAPT with aspirin plus a P2Y12 antagonist (clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor for specific indications) for up to 12 months after non‐ST‐segment elevation MI (with shorter durations to be considered for patients with a high bleeding risk) and indefinite aspirin therapy. Conversely, the most recent version of the PAD guidelines, published in April 2013, recommends either aspirin or clopidogrel monotherapy for the long‐term treatment of PAD. Both sets of practice guidelines were published before or just after the FDA recommendation for vorapaxar was announced, so currently there are no clear recommendations from professional societies on the use of vorapaxar for the secondary prevention after MI or following the identification of PAD. Newly published data for prolonged DAPT from 12 to 30 months following coronary stent placement from the Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT) trialand for extended DAPT beyond 12 months for patients with a prior MI from the Prevention of Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Prior Heart Attack Using Ticagrelor Compared with Placebo on a Background of Aspirin (PEGASUS) trial – suggest that prolonged DAPT with aspirin plus a P2Y12 antagonist may receive a strong endorsement in future guideline recommendations for the secondary prevention of patients with cardiovascular disease. Within this context, the positioning of vorapaxar in combination with other antiplatelet therapies is expected to be nuanced, especially because vorapaxar has not been studied with the more potent P2Y12 antagonists (prasugrel and ticagrelor).

Clopidogrel efficacy and safety in CAPRIE — A single large phase 3 trial compared clopidogrel 75 mg/d with aspirin 325 mg/d and included three groups each involving ~6,400 patients (recent stroke, recent myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral arterial disease), with an overall population of 19,185 high-risk patients in whom clopidogrel reduced the relative risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or vascular death by 8.7% and the absolute risk by 0.51%. Both clopidogrel and medium-dose aspirin were well tolerated in CAPRIE, with early permanent discontinuation due to adverse events 12% in both groups and the overall incidence of hemorrhagic events 9.3% in both groups, with no excess neutropenia and identical thrombocytopenia between clopidogrel and aspirin. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is rare but can occur after initiation of clopidogrel therapy, and when TTP occurs its onset is usually within 2 weeks of initiation of treatment. Because clopidogrel and aspirin act on distinct and complementary platelet activation pathways, combination therapy has been evaluated in high-risk settings, and the CURE trial randomly assigned 12,562 patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) without ST-segment elevation.

### Individualizing dual antiplatelet therapy duration: prediction tools, genomics, and clinical judgment [^0eefa1f0]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on average reduces the risk of subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) but increases major bleeds. Individualizing duration of DAPT based on the DAPT trial's net benefit prediction tool would likely optimize outcome beyond population average recommendations. Individualizing agent selection and duration of therapy based on genomic data may further improve outcomes. Clinical judgment remains the most important tool to tailor DAPT duration based on a large array of additional relevant factors not captured by predition rules or genomics.

### Age-specific risks, severity, time course, and outcome of bleeding on long-term antiplatelet treatment after vascular events: a population-based cohort study [^12ea6f33]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

Lifelong antiplatelet treatment is recommended after ischaemic vascular events, on the basis of trials done mainly in patients younger than 75 years. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding is a serious complication, but had low case fatality in trials of aspirin and is not generally thought to cause long-term disability. Consequently, although co-prescription of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces upper gastrointestinal bleeds by 70–90%, uptake is low and guidelines are conflicting. We aimed to assess the risk, time course, and outcomes of bleeding on antiplatelet treatment for secondary prevention in patients of all ages.

Methods

We did a prospective population-based cohort study in patients with a first transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, or myocardial infarction treated with antiplatelet drugs (mainly aspirin based, without routine PPI use) after the event in the Oxford Vascular Study from 2002 to 2012, with follow-up until 2013. We determined type, severity, outcome (disability or death), and time course of bleeding requiring medical attention by face-to-face follow-up for 10 years. We estimated age-specific numbers needed to treat (NNT) to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding with routine PPI co-prescription on the basis of Kaplan-Meier risk estimates and relative risk reduction estimates from previous trials.

Findings

3166 patients (1582 [50%] aged ≥ 75 years) had 405 first bleeding events (n = 218 gastrointestinal, n = 45 intracranial, and n = 142 other) during 13509 patient-years of follow-up. Of the 314 patients (78%) with bleeds admitted to hospital, 117 (37%) were missed by administrative coding. Risk of non-major bleeding was unrelated to age, but major bleeding increased steeply with age (≥ 75 years hazard ratio [HR] 3·10, 95% CI 2·27–4·24; p < 0·0001), particularly for fatal bleeds (5·53, 2·65–11·54; p < 0·0001), and was sustained during long-term follow-up. The same was true of major upper gastrointestinal bleeds (≥ 75 years HR 4·13, 2·60–6·57; p < 0·0001), particularly if disabling or fatal (10·26, 4·37–24·13; p < 0·0001). At age 75 years or older, major upper gastrointestinal bleeds were mostly disabling or fatal (45 [62%] of 73 patients vs 101 [47%] of 213 patients with recurrent ischaemic stroke), and outnumbered disabling or fatal intracerebral haemorrhage (n = 45 vs n = 18), with an absolute risk of 9·15 (95% CI 6·67–12·24) per 1000 patient-years. The estimated NNT for routine PPI use to prevent one disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleed over 5 years fell from 338 for individuals younger than 65 years, to 25 for individuals aged 85 years or older.

Interpretation

In patients receiving aspirin-based antiplatelet treatment without routine PPI use, the long-term risk of major bleeding is higher and more sustained in older patients in practice than in the younger patients in previous trials, with a substantial risk of disabling or fatal upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Given that half of the major bleeds in patients aged 75 years or older were upper gastrointestinal, the estimated NNT for routine PPI use to prevent such bleeds is low, and co-prescription should be encouraged.

Stent thrombosis (ST) — definition, incidence, outcomes, and classification are described: ST is an acute or subacute thrombotic occlusion that usually presents as an acute myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality; the overall incidence of ST is 0.5% to 1.0% in the first year and 0.2% to 0.6% in every subsequent year, with lower rates for elective stent placement (0.3%-0.5%) but higher in acute coronary syndrome (3.4%); in contemporary practice, the observed mortality rate (~30%) is high, although studies with systematic autopsy confirmation suggest that it may be < 10%; stent thrombosis is classified by the Academic Research Consortium criteria with timing acute, subacute, early, late, and very late, defined as within 24 hours (acute), 24 hours to 30 days (subacute), 30 days to 1 year (late), and > 1 year (very late), and early ST is defined as occurring within 30 days; approximately 20% of patients with a first ST experience a recurrent ST episode within 2 years; and premature or patient-initiated termination of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), sometimes because of bleeding or preoperative concerns, is responsible for most cases of ST.

### Primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^e8eef82b]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Background

This guideline focuses on long-term administration of antithrombotic drugs designed for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, including two new antiplatelet therapies.

Methods

The methods of this guideline follow those described in Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines in this supplement.

Results

We present 23 recommendations for pertinent clinical questions. For primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, we suggest low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/d) in patients aged > 50 years over no aspirin therapy (Grade 2B). For patients with established coronary artery disease, defined as patients 1-year post-acute coronary syndrome, with prior revascularization, coronary stenoses > 50% by coronary angiogram, and/or evidence for cardiac ischemia on diagnostic testing, we recommend long-term low-dose aspirin or clopidogrel (75 mg/d) (Grade 1A). For patients with acute coronary syndromes who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement, we recommend for the first year dual antiplatelet therapy with low-dose aspirin in combination with ticagrelor 90 mg bid, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, or prasugrel 10 mg/d over single antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B). For patients undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, we recommend aspirin (75–325 mg/d) and clopidogrel for a minimum duration of 1 month (bare-metal stents) or 3 to 6 months (drug-eluting stents) (Grade 1A). We suggest continuing low-dose aspirin plus clopidogrel for 12 months for all stents (Grade 2C). Thereafter, we recommend single antiplatelet therapy over continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (Grade 1B).

Conclusions

Recommendations continue to favor single antiplatelet therapy for patients with established coronary artery disease. For patients with acute coronary syndromes or undergoing elective PCI with stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy for up to 1 year is warranted.

### Incidence, predictors, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction [^ed4b6046]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Flow restoration in the infarct‐related artery by means of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for potent platelet inhibition are the cornerstones for management of patients with acute ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 1, 2 Compared with clopidogrel, prasugrel provides rapid‐onset, more potent and consistent inhibition of platelet aggregation, 3 and reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality and stent thrombosis in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). 4 Prasugrel is recommended over clopidogrel following primary PCI 1, 2 and is used increasingly in real‐world clinical practice. 5

Nonadherence to recommended antiplatelet therapy following PCI is not uncommon and increases the risk of adverse ischemic events. 6, 7, 8 Notably, different modes of DAPT cessation (either driven by physician recommendation, patient noncompliance, or interventions necessitating temporary treatment withdrawal) appear to have varying effects on patient outcomes. 6 Previous studies assessing premature cessation of antiplatelet therapy focused primarily on more stable clinical settings and clopidogrel rather than novel, potent P2Y 12 ‐inhibitors, and they often did not account for the temporal relation between treatment cessation and subsequent outcomes. 9, 10 While STEMI is characterized by elevated ischemic risk compared with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and is an independent predictor of stent thrombosis, 11 there are limited data on the adherence to guideline‐recommended antiplatelet treatment following primary PCI. Moreover, although certain aspects of prasugrel treatment might adversely affect long‐term compliance, including greater treatment cost or accentuated risk of bleeding, little is known about adherence to prasugrel in patients with STEMI. Against this background, we sought to address the incidence, underlying reasons, and clinical impact of early prasugrel cessation in a sizable, contemporary cohort of patients with STEMI treated by current standards (ie, primary PCI with predominantly new‐generation drug‐eluting stents [DES]).

### Timing of P2YInhibitor administration in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI [^1153f148]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The optimal timing of P2Y 12 inhibitor administration in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has not been completely elucidating.

Objectives

This analysis from a prospective multicenter registry sought to assess the safety and effectiveness of P2Y 12 inhibitor pretreatment in patients transferred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within a regional STEMI network.

Methods

Pretreatment was defined as P2Y 12 inhibitor administration before coronary angiography. Endpoints were major adverse cardiac events (MACE), major bleeding, and net adverse clinical events, a composite of MACE or major bleeding, within 30 days of index admission. Association of P2Y 12 inhibitor pretreatment with outcomes was modeled using doubly robust weighted estimators based on propensity score analysis.

Results

Of 1,624 patients included, 1,033 received P2Y 12 inhibitors before angiography and 591 in the catheterization laboratory (cath lab). The non-pretreated cohort more often had history of coronary artery disease and were more likely to receive antiplatelet therapy before the index admission. After adjustment for confounding and dependent censoring, pretreatment with P2Y 12 inhibitors predicted lower risk of MACE (adjusted HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37–0.76), without increasing bleeding risk (adjusted HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.36–1.05), resulting in superior net clinical benefit (adjusted HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.26–0.86) compared with in-cath lab administration of P2Y 12 inhibitors. There was a significant treatment-by-time interaction for MACE risk, whereby the observed benefits of pretreatment only became apparent when time between P2Y 12 inhibitor administration and PCI was longer than 80 minutes.

Conclusions

In contemporary patients with STEMI transferred for primary PCI, pretreatment with P2Y 12 inhibitors was associated with a significant time-dependent reduction of 30-day MACE without increasing bleeding risk.

### Long-term outcomes and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary intervention with second-generation drug-eluting stents: the veterans affairs extended DAPT study [^ec96bcf0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The limitations of our cohort study include the observational design and the potential for other factors confounding the relationships of increased risks of cause‐specific deaths in the small proportion of patients who discontinued DAPT before 9 months. We have studied this group previously and found greater frailty and other less optimal health habits that likely drive this risk of death from cardiac and noncardiac sources rather than DAPT discontinuation per se. As a result, we cannot assess the relationship of DAPT duration of < 9 months with this cohort. We have more confidence in our finding of a lower risk of death, cardiac death, MI, and major bleeding with stopping DAPT after 9 months, even in patients with ACSs. This finding is consistent with smaller clinical trials showing no benefit for extending DAPT to ≥ 12 months in patients receiving second‐generation drug‐eluting stents and extends this observation beyond prior studies up to 13 years after PCI. We were unable to assess the risk of single antiplatelet therapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors, but this practice became more in vogue after our follow‐up period. Although there were 670 women in our cohort, our results reflect the predominantly male population in the VA Healthcare System.

In conclusion, we find that patients who had PCI with second‐generation drug‐eluting stents had lower long‐term risks of death, cardiac death, MI, and bleeding by stopping DAPT after 9 months following PCI, and the results do not support extending DAPT beyond this time frame. More recent randomized trials support even shorter durations of DAPT with second‐generation drug‐eluting stents, particularly in patients at high bleeding risk and low ischemic risk. Our results support current guidelines toward shorter DAPT duration in a wider national population of patients followed up for > 10 years after PCI with second‐generation drug‐eluting stents.

### Short-term dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stenting in patients with acute coronary syndromes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^846c5e63]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains under debate.

Objectives

To analyze the efficacy and safety of DAPT strategies in patients with ACS using a bayesian network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and LILACS databases were searched from inception to April 8, 2024.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing DAPT duration strategies in patients with ACS undergoing PCI were selected. Short-term strategies (1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors, 3 months of DAPT followed by aspirin, and 6 months of DAPT followed by aspirin) were compared with conventional 12 months of DAPT.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This systematic review and network meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. The risk ratio (RR) with a 95% credible interval (CrI) was calculated within a bayesian random-effects network meta-analysis. Treatments were ranked using surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE); the primary safety end point was major bleeding.

Results

A total of 15 RCTs randomizing 35 326 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [11.1] years; 26 954 male [76.3%]; 11 339 STEMI [32.1%]) with ACS were included. A total of 24 797 patients (70.2%) received potent P2Y12 inhibitors (ticagrelor or prasugrel). Compared with 12 months of DAPT, 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors reduced major bleeding (RR, 0.47; 95% CrI, 0.26–0.74) with no difference in MACCE (RR, 1.00; 95% CrI, 0.70–1.41). No significant differences were observed in MACCE incidence between strategies, although CrIs were wide. SUCRA ranked 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as the best for reducing major bleeding and 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as optimal for reducing MACCE (RR, 0.85; 95% CrI, 0.56–1.21).

Conclusion and Relevance

Results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis reveal that, in patients with ACS undergoing PCI with DES, 1 month of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduction in major bleeding without increasing MACCE when compared with 12 months of DAPT. However, an increased risk of MACCE cannot be excluded, and 3 months of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was ranked as the best option to reduce MACCE. Because most patients receiving P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy were taking ticagrelor, the safety of stopping aspirin in those taking clopidogrel remains unclear.
