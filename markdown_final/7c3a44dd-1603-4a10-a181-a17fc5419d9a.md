## Question

What age can parathyroidectomy be offered for child with MEN syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate age to offer parathyroidectomy in a child with MEN1-associated primary hyperparathyroidism, and how to weigh timing, indications, and surgical strategy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the natural history and penetrance of PHPT in MEN1 and how early it can present. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about screening and whether they define a minimum surgical age. Next, I will examine pediatric surgical series to see the actual ages at which parathyroidectomy has been performed. After that, I need to balance the risks of early surgery versus observation, including hypoparathyroidism and recurrence. Then, I should review the optimal surgical approach in children with MEN1. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, individualized recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and timing of onset. PHPT is the most common manifestation of MEN1, with near-complete penetrance by adulthood and a mean age of onset around the early 20s, but it can present much earlier. Clinically relevant manifestations are already seen in pediatric ages, and PHPT has been diagnosed as early as 8 years, with prospective screening detecting early biochemical disease even before symptoms in many carriers [^117KmXN3] [^113nfmpZ] [^115ezF48] [^116jPNKu].

> Wait, let me verify what the guidelines actually recommend regarding age and timing of surgery. The 2012 Endocrine Society MEN1 guideline states surgery is the treatment of choice but explicitly notes insufficient evidence to define optimal timing, emphasizing individualized decisions and experienced surgical care, while the 2025 AACE consensus recommends annual biochemical screening from early childhood and supports subtotal parathyroidectomy as the standard approach when surgery is indicated, again without specifying a minimum age for operation [^115v6sVJ] [^1149UPwr] [^1174Lm6r] [^1154Gjbk].

> I should confirm what pediatric surgical cohorts show about real-world ages at operation. In a tertiary-center series of 38 patients under 18 with PHPT, the median age at diagnosis was 15 years and several underwent parathyroidectomy in mid-adolescence; importantly, preoperative recognition of MEN1 guided more complete initial operations and lower recurrence, suggesting that mid-to-late adolescence is a common window for intervention when disease is present [^1128T5FU]. Another series reported parathyroidectomy as early as age 16 in genetically positive MEN1 carriers, reinforcing that surgery in the teenage years is not unprecedented when clinically indicated [^115mabYN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about operating very young. I need to balance benefits and risks. Early surgery can prevent ongoing skeletal demineralization and renal complications from persistent hypercalcemia, but MEN1 is multiglandular and recurrence is common, so children may face multiple neck operations over a lifetime; moreover, subtotal parathyroidectomy carries a meaningful risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism, which can be particularly burdensome over decades, and contemporary reviews emphasize that timing remains controversial with no pediatric consensus, especially for mild, asymptomatic disease [^114AB1hL] [^116WMGHJ] [^116fUYJe]. But wait, what if we delay too long? Observational data in adults suggest that very early parathyroidectomy correlates with worse survival, likely reflecting more aggressive disease biology rather than harm from the procedure itself, so I should be cautious not to over-interpret that signal in pediatrics while still respecting that early disease may denote severity [^1133YEpR] [^113YbPTb].

> Next, I should review the optimal surgical strategy in children with MEN1. The standard of care is bilateral cervical exploration with subtotal parathyroidectomy removing 3 to 3.5 glands plus transcervical thymectomy to mitigate recurrence and address supernumerary or ectopic tissue. Minimally invasive focused approaches are generally discouraged for initial MEN1 surgery because multigland disease is expected, though some centers debate a selective unilateral strategy in very young patients to preserve parathyroid function, a trade-off that increases persistent disease risk and remains controversial [^115v6sVJ] [^1154Gjbk] [^117DFu4A] [^114AB1hL]. I should double-check that this approach aligns with outcomes data: meta-analytic evidence shows subtotal parathyroidectomy reduces persistence and recurrence compared with less-than-subtotal resections, albeit with a higher risk of hypoparathyroidism, supporting the conventional subtotal approach when operating [^116WMGHJ].

> Let me consider concrete triggers for proceeding to parathyroidectomy in a child with MEN1. I would favor surgery when there is symptomatic hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis, reduced bone mineral density or vertebral fragility, significant hypercalciuria, or biochemical severity such as calcium more than about 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal, recognizing that adult thresholds inform but do not rigidly dictate pediatric decisions. In mild, asymptomatic cases, close observation with interval reassessment of calcium, PTH, renal imaging, and bone health is reasonable, especially in younger children, provided there is reliable follow-up and rapid escalation if complications emerge [^115qS1Pq] [^114AB1hL] [^116fUYJe]. I should confirm that this aligns with pediatric data: children with PHPT often present with symptoms and end-organ damage, underscoring the need to act when complications are present rather than relying on age alone [^112ey2ng].

> Now, synthesizing an age-based answer, I need to ensure I am precise. There is no universally mandated minimum age for parathyroidectomy in MEN1; decisions should be individualized based on disease severity, symptoms, skeletal and renal involvement, and the child's developmental context. Practically, most pediatric parathyroidectomies in MEN1 occur from mid-adolescence onward, typically around ages 14 to 18, when disease is more likely to be manifest and the risks of hypoparathyroidism may be more acceptable, while surgery in children under about 10 years is uncommon unless there is severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia or compelling complications; in all cases, surgery should be performed at a high-volume center with pediatric endocrine surgery expertise and genetic counseling integrated into care [^1128T5FU] [^115ezF48] [^1154Gjbk] [^114AB1hL]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought guidelines might specify a hard lower age threshold, but I should correct that: major guidelines emphasize screening from early childhood and individualized surgical timing rather than a fixed minimum operative age, reinforcing a case-by-case approach anchored in clinical severity and complications [^1174Lm6r] [^115v6sVJ].

> Finally, I should outline surveillance and follow-up so we close the loop. For children with MEN1, annual calcium and PTH screening should begin by about age 8, with clinical assessment of renal and skeletal health and age-appropriate imaging for other MEN1 tumors; after parathyroidectomy, check calcium at 6 months to confirm normocalcemia and then monitor annually given the high recurrence risk, recognizing that an elevated PTH with normal calcium may herald recurrence and that lifelong endocrine follow-up is required [^1174Lm6r] [^116rDx8t] [^114RhhYD]. Hold on, I should verify that this cadence matches consensus: the AACE table supports early childhood biochemical screening and structured long-term surveillance, which aligns with this monitoring plan [^1174Lm6r].

Parathyroidectomy in children with MEN1 is indicated when there is **symptomatic or progressive PHPT** [^116fUYJe] (hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, bone disease, or neurocognitive symptoms) or when **calcium > 1 mg/dL above normal** [^115qS1Pq]. There is **no absolute age threshold**; surgery is based on disease severity and complications, not age alone [^111MjcUH]. For mild, asymptomatic PHPT, observation with close monitoring is reasonable [^114AB1hL]; surgery is deferred until symptoms or complications arise. The standard approach is subtotal parathyroidectomy (3–3.5 glands) [^1154Gjbk] with cervical thymectomy [^1154Gjbk]; total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation is reserved for extensive or recurrent disease [^116fUYJe]. Management should be individualized by a multidisciplinary team at a specialized center [^1128T5FU].

## Indications for parathyroidectomy in pediatric MEN1

Parathyroidectomy is indicated in pediatric MEN1 based on **clinical severity, biochemical abnormalities, and complications**, rather than age alone [^111MjcUH]. The following factors guide surgical decision-making:

- **Symptomatic hypercalcemia**: Symptoms such as nephrolithiasis, bone pain, fractures, polyuria, polydipsia, or neurocognitive symptoms warrant surgical intervention [^116fUYJe].

- **Significant biochemical hypercalcemia**: Calcium levels greater than 1 mg/dL above the upper limit of normal are a strong indication for surgery [^115qS1Pq].

- **Progressive disease**: Increasing calcium levels, rising PTH, or developing complications despite conservative management indicate the need for surgery [^111MjcUH].

- **Asymptomatic patients**: Mild, stable hypercalcemia without complications may be managed conservatively with close monitoring, deferring surgery until symptoms or complications arise [^114AB1hL].

---

## Age considerations

There is **no absolute age threshold** for parathyroidectomy in pediatric MEN1 [^114AB1hL]. The decision to operate is based on disease severity, biochemical abnormalities, and complications rather than chronological age. However, certain age-related trends and considerations are relevant:

- **Early onset**: PHPT in MEN1 often manifests in adolescence or early adulthood, with reported cases as early as 8 years of age [^117KmXN3] [^116jPNKu].

- **Adolescence**: Most pediatric cases undergo parathyroidectomy during adolescence (typically 13–18 years) [^1128T5FU], coinciding with the onset of symptomatic disease or significant biochemical abnormalities [^111MjcUH].

- **Younger children**: Surgery may be considered in younger children (≤ 10 years) if there is severe symptomatic hypercalcemia or significant complications, although this is less common [^114AB1hL].

---

## Surgical approach

The **standard surgical approach** for pediatric MEN1-associated PHPT is subtotal parathyroidectomy (removal of 3–3.5 glands) [^117DFu4A] with bilateral cervical exploration and transcervical thymectomy [^1154Gjbk]. This approach balances the risk of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism with the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism [^116WMGHJ]. Alternatively, **total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation** is reserved for patients with extensive disease, severe hypercalcemia, or recurrent PHPT, but carries a higher risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism [^116fUYJe].

---

## Risks and benefits

Parathyroidectomy in pediatric MEN1 patients carries both risks and benefits:

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Correction of hypercalcemia and prevention of renal and skeletal complications [^111MjcUH] | Permanent hypoparathyroidism requiring lifelong calcium and vitamin D supplementation [^116fUYJe] |
| Improvement in growth and development [^notfound] | Recurrent hyperparathyroidism requiring reoperation [^112VbvV5] |
| Reduction in neurocognitive symptoms | Surgical complications (e.g. recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, infection) |

---

## Long-term outcomes

Long-term outcomes after parathyroidectomy in pediatric MEN1 patients are generally favorable, with **correction of hypercalcemia** and improvement in renal and skeletal complications [^112ey2ng]. However, recurrence of hyperparathyroidism is common, occurring in approximately 20–60% of patients within 10 years, necessitating ongoing surveillance and potential reoperation [^11345Hkg] [^112VbvV5].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines and expert consensus emphasize **individualized decision-making** based on disease severity, biochemical abnormalities, and complications, rather than age alone [^111uBPnN]. Regular surveillance and multidisciplinary care at specialized centers are recommended for optimal outcomes [^114q7rfG].

Parathyroidectomy in pediatric MEN1 patients is indicated based on disease severity and complications, **not age alone** [^111MjcUH]. Surgery is recommended for symptomatic or progressive PHPT, with individualized decision-making and multidisciplinary care at specialized centers [^116fUYJe].

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) future directions — testing and surveillance: future genetic testing may incorporate modified next-generation sequencing to detect low-level mosaicism (allele frequency < 10%) that may be present among genotype-negative individuals with ≥ 3 cardinal MEN1 tumors. Menin immunostaining, particularly in parathyroid adenomas, may be used to support MEN1 variant pathogenicity and to identify individuals who are appropriate or inappropriate for germline testing. It is anticipated that surveillance guidelines for patients with GN–MEN1 and their first-degree family members will be modified to account for the apparent reduced risk for new MEN1-related tumors, and clarification of treatment benefits, including surgery versus active surveillance, is needed; given the rarity of MEN1, larger collaborative prospective research consortia would likely be required.

### Guidelines for diagnosis and therapy of MEN type 1 and type 2 [^112nATwD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2001). Low credibility.

This is a consensus statement from an international group, mostly of clinical endocrinologists. MEN1 and MEN2 are hereditary cancer syndromes. The commonest tumors secrete PTH or gastrin in MEN1, and calcitonin or catecholamines in MEN2. Management strategies improved after the discoveries of their genes. MEN1 has no clear syndromic variants. Tumor monitoring in MEN1 carriers includes biochemical tests yearly and imaging tests less often. Neck surgery includes subtotal or total parathyroidectomy, parathyroid cryopreservation, and thymectomy. Proton pump inhibitors or somatostatin analogs are the main management for oversecretion of entero-pancreatic hormones, except insulin. The roles for surgery of most entero-pancreatic tumors present several controversies: exclusion of most operations on gastrinomas and indications for surgery on other tumors. Each MEN1 family probably has an inactivating MEN1 germline mutation. Testing for a germline MEN1 mutation gives useful information, but rarely mandates an intervention. The most distinctive MEN2 variants are MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). They vary in aggressiveness of MTC and spectrum of disturbed organs. Mortality in MEN2 is greater from MTC than from pheochromocytoma. Thyroidectomy, during childhood if possible, is the goal in all MEN2 carriers to prevent or cure MTC. Each MEN2 index case probably has an activating germline RET mutation. RET testing has replaced calcitonin testing to diagnose the MEN2 carrier state. The specific RET codon mutation correlates with the MEN2 syndromic variant, the age of onset of MTC, and the aggressiveness of MTC; consequently, that mutation should guide major management decisions, such as whether and when to perform thyroidectomy.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) tumor treatment outcomes — MEN1-associated tumors are often multiple and have poorer outcomes than non-MEN1 disease: only approximately 15% of MEN1 patients, compared with approximately 45% of non-MEN1 patients, are free of disease immediately after surgery, and at 5 yr this decreased to approximately 5% in MEN1 patients, compared with approximately 40% in non-MEN1 patients; subtotal parathyroidectomy has resulted in persistent or recurrent hypercalcemia within 10 yr in 20–60% of MEN1 patients, as opposed to approximately 4% in non-MEN1 patients; metastases are present in up to 50% of MEN1-associated insulinomas, whereas less than 10% of non-MEN1 insulinomas metastasize; and anterior pituitary tumors show greater size and invasiveness, with approximately 85% vs 64% being macroadenomas at diagnosis, approximately 30% showing invasion compared with 10% in non-MEN1, and more than 45% having persistent hormonal oversecretion after appropriate therapy compared with between 10 and 40% in non-MEN1 patients.

### Should routine analysis of the MEN1 gene be performed in all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism under 40 years of age? [^1141pBcA]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Familial hyperparathyroidism, especially Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, is more likely to present with primary hyperparathyroidism (1 degrees HPT) at a young age, mandating bilateral exploration of the parathyroid glands. However, the majority of young patients will not be gene carriers or have a family history. Recent evidence suggests that young adults under 40, in whom there is no suspicion of family history, can be managed with the same pre- and perioperative strategy as used for sporadic primary HPT of any age. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of mutations in the MEN1 gene in young adults under 40 who present with apparent sporadic 1 degrees HPT.

Methods

A retrospective review was undertaken of all patients who underwent surgery for 1 degrees HPT between 1993 and 2004. From a total of 1253 patients, 87 (6.2%) were under the age of 40. Thirty-three patients provided informed consent to a detailed personal and family history, physical examination, and genetic analysis of the MEN1 gene. Twelve patients were subsequently excluded as they were known gene carriers prior to surgery (10 MEN1 and 2 MEN2A patients). Twenty-one patients underwent genetic analysis.

Results

Of the 21 patients who consented to genetic analysis, the mean age was 30.8 years (range = 18–39 years with 43% younger than 30). These patients had no suspicious family or personal histories suggestive of a MEN phenotype. Fifteen patients presented with symptomatic hypercalcemia. All 21 patients underwent parathyroid surgery by conventional cervicotomy (12) or endoscopic parathyroidectomy in cases (9) where the parathyroid gland was localized preoperatively. Nineteen patients (91%) had uniglandular disease. Surgical cure was achieved in all patients. Of the 21 patients, only one patient (4.7%) was found to have a MEN1 gene mutation (exon 3, at codon 190, c;680_681delGGinsC). This patient was found to have double adenomas at surgery with subsequent histological confirmation. The overall prevalence of MEN1 mutation in all patients under 40 was 13%.

Conclusion

Although young age is often the only criterion to suspect MEN1, our results do not support routine MEN1 analysis in patients under 40. We propose that these patients be managed with the same preoperative and surgical approach as those presenting with sporadic 1 degrees HPT of any age.

### Clinical genetic testing and early surgical intervention in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) [^115mabYN]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

We sought to develop a comprehensive program for clinical genetic testing in a large group of extended families with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1), with the ultimate aim of early tumor detection and surgical intervention.

Summary Background Data

Germline mutations in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene are responsible for the MEN 1 syndrome. Direct genetic testing for a disease-associated MEN1 mutation is now possible in selected families. The neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas/duodenum and the intrathoracic neuroendocrine tumors that occur in MEN 1 carry a malignant potential. Importantly, these tumors arise in otherwise young healthy patients and are complicated by the potential for multifocality and involvement of multiple target tissues. The optimal screening methods and indications for early surgical intervention in genetically positive patients have yet to be defined.

Methods

Nine MEN 1 kindreds were included in the study. The mutations for each kindred were initially identified in the research laboratory. Subsequently, mutation detection was independently validated in the clinical Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory. Each patient in the study underwent formal genetic counseling before testing.

Results

Genetic testing was performed in 56 at-risk patients. Patients were stratified according to risk: Group I (n = 25), 50% risk, younger than 30 years old; Group II (n = 20), 50% risk, 30 years old or older; Group III (n = 11) 25% risk. Seven patients (age, 12 to 42 years; mean, 20.6 ± 3.8 years) had a positive genetic test. Patients with a novel positive genetic test were in either Group I (n = 6) or Group II (n = 1) and have been followed for 35.8 ± 2.0 months. Of the 7 genetically positive patients, hypercalcemia was either present at the time of diagnosis or developed during the period of follow-up in 6 patients. Four patients have undergone parathyroidectomy as early as age 16 years. One genetically positive patient has not yet developed hyperparathyroidism. Intensive biochemical screening in this select group of patients identified an elevated pancreatic polypeptide level and pancreatic tail mass lesion in a 15-year-old male who is asymptomatic and currently normocalcemic.

Conclusions

Genetic testing identifies patients harboring an MEN1 mutation before the development of clinical signs or symptoms of endocrine disease. When genetically positive patients are carefully studied prospectively, biochemical evidence of neoplasia can be detected an average of 10 years before clinically evident disease, allowing for early surgical intervention. Genetically positive individuals should undergo focused cancer surveillance for early detection of the potentially malignant neuroendocrine tumors that account for most of the disease-related morbidity and mortality.

Regarding medical management for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, more specifically with respect to management of parathyroid tumors, ES 2012 guidelines recommend to perform surgery by an experienced endocrine surgeon as the treatment of choice in patients with parathyroid tumors. Insufficient evidence to recommend an optimum timing for surgery.

### Revised American Thyroid Association guidelines for the management of medullary thyroid carcinoma [^114Mubgz]. Thyroid (2015). Medium credibility.

Central neck dissection considerations in MEN2B children: In infants with MEN2B, the decision to perform a central neck dissection should be based on whether parathyroid glands can be identified and preserved or autotransplanted, and the surgeon should consider foregoing central neck dissection if the parathyroids cannot be identified. For very young children, delayed thyroidectomy has been theorized but has not been evaluated; in older children with a palpable MTC and elevated calcitonin, central neck dissection is favored due to high lymph node risk.

AACE MEN1 consensus methods — The task force addressed MEN1-related parathyroid tumors; MEN1-related pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (pitNETs); MEN1-related duodenal and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (dpNETs); other MEN1-related endocrine tumors (adrenal, thoracic neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], breast, cutaneous, meningioma, leiomyoma, and ependymoma); and MEN1 genetic testing. Evidence searches of PubMed yielded 829 abstracts for review, and through initial screening 182 articles were selected for full text review. The task force agreed to minimize inclusion of reviews, small case studies, and pediatric populations, and members identified additional relevant studies not captured by the literature searches.

### Advances in risk-oriented surgery for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [^113fbS9d]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Genetic association studies hinge on definite clinical case definitions of the disease of interest. This is why more penetrant mutations were overrepresented in early multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) studies, whereas less penetrant mutations went underrepresented. Enrichment of genetic association studies with advanced disease may produce a flawed understanding of disease evolution, precipitating far-reaching surgical strategies like bilateral total adrenalectomy and 4-gland parathyroidectomy in MEN2. The insight into the natural course of the disease gleaned over the past 25 years caused a paradigm shift in MEN2: from the removal of target organs at the expense of greater operative morbidity to close biochemical surveillance and targeted resection of adrenal tumors and hyperplastic parathyroid glands. The lead time provided by early identification of asymptomatic MEN2 carriers under biochemical surveillance delimits a 'window of opportunity', within which (i) pre-emptive total thyroidectomy alone is adequate, circumventing morbidity attendant to central node dissection; (ii) subtotal 'tissue-sparing' adrenalectomy is sufficient, trading the risk of steroid dependency for the risk of a second pheochromocytoma in the adrenal remnant and (iii) parathyroidectomy is limited to enlarged glands, trading the risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism for the risk of leaving behind hyperactive parathyroid glands. Future research should delineate further the mutation-specific, age-dependent penetrance of pheochromocytoma and primary hyperparathyroidism to refine the risk-oriented approach to MEN2. The sweeping changes in the management of MEN2 since the new millenium hold the hope that death and major morbidity from this uncommon disease can be eliminated in our lifetime.

### Prophylactic thyroidectomy in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A in children: a single centre experience [^114fHiPp]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background To describe the complications and long-term results in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) syndrome in whom a prophylactic thyroidectomy was performed, in relation to the recommendations of the American Thyroid Association (ATA). Methods A retrospective study of 14 patients with MEN 2A thyroidectomized between 2000 and 2017. We reviewed demographic, clinical, analytical and radiological data. Postoperative complications and long-term follow-up were analyzed. Results We treated eight boys and six girls with a median age of 5 years old (range 2–10). The predominant genetic mutation belonged to codon 634 (8/14, 57.14%). Total thyroidectomy (TT) without cervical lymphadenectomy was performed in all patients. A right upper parathyroidectomy was performed in one patient due to intraoperative suspicion of increased volume. Histological study revealed no alterations. Two patients presented transient hypocalcemia postoperatively and no patient had permanent hypocalcemia or nerve damage. Pathological anatomy confirmed medullary thyroid microcarcinoma in 5/14 patients: all carrying codon 634 mutation and three of them with preoperative basal calcitonin levels < 20 pg/mL. No recurrences or metastases have been detected after a mean follow-up of 8 years. A patient with codon 634 mutation developed a unilateral pheochromocytoma at 25 years of age. No patient has presented hyperparathyroidism. Conclusions Prophylactic thyroidectomy without cervical lymphadenectomy is an effective and safe preventive treatment in patients with MEN 2A syndrome when it is performed by experienced surgeons in reference centers.

### Factors predicting outcome of total thyroidectomy in young patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2: a nationwide long-term follow-up study [^111pmNZb]. World Journal of Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This case control study was performed in the cohort of all Dutch patients with a germline RET mutation who were operated on in one of the eight university hospitals in the Netherlands from 1980 up until 2006. Inclusion criteria were MEN 2 syndrome, 19 years or younger at the time of surgery, and had undergone a total thyroidectomy.

The participating centers were the Free University Medical Center Amsterdam (n = 4), Leiden University Medical Center (n = 5), Academic Hospital Maastricht (n = 8), Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen (n = 8), Academic Medical Center Amsterdam (n = 9), Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam (n = 12), University Medical Center Groningen (n = 19), and University Medical Center Utrecht (n = 28).

In total, 93 patients were identified and data were collected retrospectively from hospital records in the participating centers by two authors (JMJS and MRV). Patients were divided into those who were operated on up to 1994 when predictive genetic testing became available ("pre- RET era") and those after 1994 (" RET era"). The follow-up of the patients included in this study was part of regular medical care.

The approaches described in this article did not involve any randomization, experimental intervention, or questionnaire, and the anonymity of patients was not breached. Therefore, this article meets the conditions required under Dutch law (WGBO) for making medical and/or personal data available for statistical or other scientific research.

Surgery

Almost all 93 patients were operated on by a team consisting of a pediatric surgeon and an endocrine surgeon. All patients underwent total thyroidectomy. An additional prophylactic lymph node dissection of the central zone of the neck was not performed routinely. A central or lateral neck dissection was performed in case a suspicious lymph node was present during the surgery or on preoperative imaging. In the "pre- RET " era (until 1994), patients were operated on based on family history and/or elevated basal and/or stimulated calcitonin levels. In the " RET era" (after 1994), most patients were operated on based on the mutation analysis. Whenever possible, the parathyroid glands were left in situ.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) parathyroid tumors — Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common feature of MEN1 and occurs in approximately 90% of patients; biochemical testing reveals hypercalcemia usually with increased circulating PTH concentrations, the hypercalcemia is usually mild and severe hypercalcemia or parathyroid cancers is rare; compared with non-MEN1 disease there is earlier onset (20 to 25 yr vs. 55 yr) with an equal male/female ratio (1:1 vs. 1:3); and preoperative imaging with neck ultrasound and Tc99m-sestamibi parathyroid scintigraphy is of limited benefit because all glands may be affected and neck exploration is required irrespective of localization studies.

### Invited commentary: less than subtotal parathyroidectomy for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 primary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Hm8Ta]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with an MEN1 genetic mutation nearly all present biochemical evidence of primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) in their teens. By definition these patients have unpredictably metachronous multiple gland parathyroid disease. Since nearly all pHPT patients are young there can be no doubt that a parathyroidectomy is indicated to counter the long-term deleterious effects of the excess parathyroid hormone on the bone, renal and cardiovascular systems. However, the timing of surgery, in other words at what point in the disease natural history to operate, and what operation to perform remain somewhat less categorically agreed.

The issue of timing of the parathyroid surgery is debated because whilst early intervention limits the risk of end organ damage it tends to be associated with macroscopically more subtle disease and a longer life span for recurrence to occur. Earlier intervention also provides a longer length of patient life to live with the any adverse surgical outcome, in particular hypoparathyroidism. The accepted consensus appears to be that surgery should ideally happen before end organ damage is present, before the biochemistry becomes severe and before a pregnancy in female patients. Once the decision to perform a parathyroidectomy has been taken, usually a joint decision between the patient, the endocrinologist and the surgeon, the optimal surgical strategy in MEN1 patients has also to be agreed.

### Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 parathyroid adenoma development over time [^116PQnJq]. World Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple gland parathyroid disease is one of the hallmarks of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1. Often mislabeled parathyroid hyperplasia, the process is actually the development of multiple adenomas. Some clinicians have reported results of selective parathyroidectomy in this group, removing only grossly enlarged glands. We argue that all the glands are at risk and should be addressed at any planned parathyroid intervention. Our hypothesis is that, given sufficient time, patients would all develop adenomas in each of the parathyroid glands. Our available data to address this issue are the parathyroidectomy results from a single institution series. Patients who had initial parathyroid exploration for hyperparathyroidism in the setting of MEN-1 were reviewed. This study includes those patients who had the weights of the resected glands documented; 23 men and 21 women met the criteria. The total weight of the parathyroid glands did not vary with the age of the patient at operation. However, the number of normal glands identified did vary significantly with age (p < 0.02), with older patients being less likely to have any normal parathyroid glands. Although total parathyroid weight may correlate with development of hypercalcemia and indications for operation, the involvement of multiple parathyroid glands in MEN-1 is a function of time, as independent events in each gland must occur. Given time, MEN-1 patients all develop multiple gland disease, and this reality must be used in planning operative management for patients with this syndrome.

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2

MEN is defined by the occurrence of tumors involving 2 or more endocrine glands within a single patient. MEN2 accounts for the majority (95%) of the hereditary cancer syndromes associated with MTC. In MEN2, although MTC is usually the first tumor to develop, 50% of patients will also develop pheochromocytomas and 20% and 30% primary hyperparathyroidism. Penetrance for MTC in MEN2 has been reported at 70% at 70 years of age, and 90% of MEN2 carriers will eventually develop MTC irrespective of variant. Crucially, there is a strong genotype–phenotype relationship, particularly for age of onset and overall penetrance, and these data help determine timing of risk-reducing thyroidectomy as per ATA guidelines (Fig. 1).

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 3

MEN3 (formerly MEN2B) is a more aggressive phenotype with a higher penetrance and very early–onset MTC (> 90%). The phenotype includes MTC and pheochromocytoma (but not hyperparathyroidism) together with Marfanoid habitus, mucosal neuromas, medullated corneal fibers, and intestinal autonomic ganglion dysfunction, often leading to multiple diverticulae and megacolon. In MEN3, MTC often presents in infancy and can metastasize early. Nearly all MEN3 occurs de novo, but for familial cases diagnosed with germline RET p. Met918Thr, risk-reducing thyroidectomy is recommended in the first year of life. While 95% of MEN3 cases are due to germline RET p. Met918Thr, 5% are associated with RET p. Alal883Phe, and this cohort may fare better clinically with a more indolent course of MTC.

MEN1 pediatric and carrier management — Such mutational analysis may be undertaken in children within the first decade because children with MEN1 tumors have been reported by the age of 10 yr, and one study of 12 children under the age of 20 yr from MEN1 families has reported that more than 40% of children will have developed one or more MEN1-associated tumors. These studies suggest that early identification of at risk individuals through mutation testing may be beneficial, and a DNA test identifying an individual, who may be an asymptomatic relative of a patient with MEN1, as a mutant gene carrier is likely to lead to earlier and more frequent biochemical and radiological screening rather than to immediate medical or surgical treatment, whereas those relatives who do not harbor the MEN1 mutation have their risk of developing MEN1-associated endocrine tumors markedly decreased from one in two for an autosomal dominant disorder, to that of the general population.

### Surgery in MEN 2A patients older than 5 years with micro-MTC: outcome at long-term follow-up [^114kcyxJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

In multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2A (MEN 2A), early total thyroidectomy (TT; performed before the age of 5 years) is the best option to prevent medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) development, but the management of MEN 2A patients diagnosed after childhood is still under debate. Seventeen consecutive patients diagnosed with MEN 2A after the age of 5 years (mean age, 23.3 years) with a pathologic diagnosis of micro-MTC without nodal involvement were enrolled. All patients underwent TT with thymectomy and central compartment lymph node dissection. During surgery, parathyroid tissue removal occurred in 14 patients. No major postoperative complications nor persistent hypoparathyroidism was observed. After a mean follow-up of 16.6 years, no patient developed primary hyperparathyroidism or disease recurrence. Even if TT is recommended before the age of 5, when MEN 2A diagnosis is performed after this age in micro-MTC without nodal involvement, TT with thymectomy and central compartment lymphadenectomy can provide good oncologic and functional results.

Main manifestations

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)

PHPT is the most common manifestation in MEN1 patients, reaching a penetrance of almost 100%, with age at diagnosis as early as 10 years of age but typically at an older age, as the median age at presentation is 31 years. Screening includes calcium level with or without PTH level (Table 3), and those that screen positive undergo a complete PHPT diagnostic workup according to PHPT guidelines in the general population. PHPT in patients with MEN1 usually manifests with mild hypercalcemia, yet with common secondary insults such as hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis and reduced bone density. The diagnosis and surgical intervention criteria for PHPT in MEN1 are similar to those for the general population. However, allocation of the involved parathyroid glands in MEN1 requires special consideration: Multiple parathyroid gland hyperplasia is common, with higher rates of ectopic gland location and parathyroid carcinoma compared with PHPT in the general population, with 20% chance of ectopic gland location in patients with MEN1 requiring reoperation for recurrent PHPT.

The first line of treatment for PHPT in MEN1 is surgical intervention. The classic surgical approach for patients with MEN1 dictates open bilateral exploration with either subtotal (ST, 3–3.5 glands) removal or total parathyroidectomy with partial gland auto-transplantation (TP/AT). Other surgical approaches include unilateral clearance (side of surgery determined based on imaging findings) or a selective resection, as in non-MEN1 PHPT with intraoperative PTH measurement.

There is controversy regarding performing preoperative imaging for parathyroid localization in MEN1. The expected multigland hyperplasia questions the utility of imaging preoperatively, as the surgical approach is not expected to change regardless of imaging results, as detailed below. However, the possible ectopic location and supernumerary parathyroid glands that may occur in MEN1 suggest the usefulness of imaging. If performed, the recommended imaging modalities are neck ultrasound and 99Tc-MIBI scintigraphy. A recent retrospective study demonstrated some advantages of preoperative localization by 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT with a 73% detection rate compared with 61% and 58% detection rates using 99Tc-MIBI scintigraphy and ultrasound, respectively. We recommend performing preoperative localization imaging, including a neck ultrasound and 99Tc-MIBI scintigraphy, for all patients with MEN1 before PHPT surgery. The rationale is to assess whether there are identifiable additional/ectopic parathyroid glands and if some of the glands appear less hyperplastic than others, enabling better surgical planning.

### The changing face of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A: from symptom-based to preventative medicine [^113hm4To]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Context

Early genetic association studies yielded too high risk estimates for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2A), suggesting a need for extended surgery.

Objective

The objective was to delineate temporal changes in MEN2A presentation by birth cohort analyses.

Methods

Birth cohort analyses (10-year increments; ≤ 1950 to 2011–2020) of carriers of rearranged during transfection (RET) mutations who underwent surgery for MEN2A.

Results

Included in this study were 604 carriers (155 index, 445 nonindex, 4 additional patients), with 237 carriers harboring high-risk mutations, 165 carriers moderate-high risk mutations, and 202 carriers low-moderate risk mutations. With increasing recency of birth cohorts, there was a continual decline in index patients from 41–74% to 0% (P < .001) and of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) from 96–100% to 0–33% (P < .001). Node metastases diminished from 62–70% to 0% (P ≤ .001; high and low-moderate risk mutations), whereas biochemical cure after thyroidectomy surged from 17–33% to 100% (P ≤ .019; high and low-moderate mutations). Surgical interventions for MEN2A-related tumors were performed increasingly earlier, causing median carrier age to fall: from 51–63 to 3–5 years at thyroidectomy (P < .001); from 46–51 to 24–25 years at first adrenalectomy (P ≤ .013; high and moderate-high risk mutations); and from 43.5–66 to 16.5–32 years at parathyroidectomy. MTC diameters were more effectively decreased from 14–32 to 1–4 mm (P ≤ 002) than pheochromocytoma diameters (nonsignificant).

Conclusion

These insights into MEN2A presentation, adjusted by birth year, illustrate the shift from reactive to preventative medicine, enabling less extensive risk-reducing surgery.

### Multiple endocrine neoplasia: genetics and clinical management [^115n9RKY]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes is critical for optimal clinical outcomes; before the MEN syndromes can be diagnosed, they must be suspected. Genetic testing for germline alterations in both the MEN type 1 (MEN1) gene and RET proto-oncogene is crucial to identifying those at risk in affected kindreds and directing timely surveillance and surgical therapy to those at greatest risk of potentially life-threatening neoplasia. Pancreatic, thymic, and bronchial neuroendocrine tumors are the leading cause of death in patients with MEN1 and should be aggressively considered by at least biannual computed tomography imaging.

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^115WXweb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

9 CONCLUSION

In the last two decades, we gained more insight in the natural course of manifestations of the MEN1 syndrome and the consequences for treatment and follow‐up. Patient outcomes have improved, but much is still to be achieved. What seems to be appropriate for patients on a group level might not be suitable for the individual patient. For care tailored to the needs of the individual patient and improving outcomes on an individual basis, studies are now needed to define predictors of tumour behaviour and effects of more individualized interventions. Patients with MEN1 should therefore be treated in centres dedicated to care and research in MEN1. These centres can collaborate in the structured collection of uniform clinical data and biospecimen for research in patient cohorts of sufficient size to further improve care and outcomes for this rare disease.

### Multiple endocrine neoplasia: paediatric perspective [^113Lhcxb]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Neuroendocrine tumours constitute a heterogeneous association of neoplasms, originated from a common precursor cell population. They include endocrine glands, such as the pituitary, the parathyroids, the cells of the neuroendocrine adrenals, endocrine islets within glandular tissue (thyroid, pancreas) and dispersed cells (diffuse endocrine system). Neuroendocrine tumours can occur sporadically or in a familial context, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. These are inherited autosomal dominant cancer syndromes, transmitted with 100% penetrance. They are categorized into MEN type 1 and type 2. The dream of each physician who treats cancer is to develop a strategy that will have a significantly favourable impact on morbidity and mortality associated with malignant tumours. This has been achieved as a result of improved screening and early treatment strategies in MEN. MEN 2 and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) are of special relevance in childhood, because they require urgent and early diagnosis and treatment. The explication of the genetic basis of MTC has revolutionised management of the familial forms of this tumour.

### Progress report on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^115UBhX6]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a germline pathogenic variant in the MEN1 tumor suppressor gene. Patients with MEN1 have a high risk for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) with a penetrance of nearly 100%, pituitary adenomas (PitAd) in 40% of patients, and neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) of the pancreas (40% of patients), duodenum, lung, and thymus. Increased MEN1-related mortality is mainly related to duodenal-pancreatic and thymic NEN. Management of PHPT differs from that of patients with sporadic disease, as the surgical approach in MEN1-related PHPT includes near-total or total parathyroidectomy because of multigland hyperplasia in most patients and the consequent high risk of recurrence. NEN management also differs from patients with sporadic disease due to multiple synchronous and metasynchronous neoplasms. In addition, the lifelong risk of developing NEN requires special considerations to avoid excessive surgeries and to minimize damage to the patient's function and well-being. This progress report will outline current insights into surveillance and management of the major clinical manifestation of MEN1 syndrome in children and adults with MEN1 diagnosis. In addition, we will discuss MEN1-like clinical presentation with negative MEN1 -genetic workup and future clinical and research directions.

### Hyperparathyroidism in hereditary syndromes: special expressions and special managements [^115upgeJ]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in its hereditary variants assumes special forms, has special associations, and requires special managements. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH or FBHH) and neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism (NSHPT) reflect heterozygous or homozygous mutations, respectively, in the calcium-sensing receptor. FHH and NSHPT represent the mildest and severest variants of HPT. Both cause hypercalcemia from birth and atypical HPT that always and uniquely persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. Their HPT is likely polyclonal and nonneoplastic. In contrast, mono- or oligo-clonal parathyroid neoplasia underlays most other HPT variants: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT). Familial-isolated HPT combines several diagnoses, including occult forms of the above syndromes. Each neoplastic variant has tumors in multiple parathyroids and a delayed, but still early age of onset for HPT (average age, 25–35 years). Each justifies special and similar approaches to parathyroidectomy: typically, identification of four glands, subtotal parathyroidectomy, rapid intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) assays, and parathyroid cryopreservation. Outcomes of parathyroidectomy remain suboptimal in each. Each syndrome of parathyroid neoplasia associates with characteristic cancer(s): enteropancreatic neuroendocrine or foregut carcinoid tissues (MEN1), thyroidal C cells (MEN2A), or parathyroid (HPT-JT). HPT has promoted gene discovery more through its rare hereditary variants than through common adenoma; the main genes causing four of six hereditary variants are known. The RET mutation test became essential in management of MEN2A. The MEN1 test is less urgent, because it rarely guides a major patient benefit. The CASR test, perhaps least urgent, has largely been unavailable. Further progress in molecular genetics will enhance understandings, diagnosis, and therapy of HPT.

### Focused image-guided parathyroidectomy in the current management of primary hyperparathyroidism [^1157arKg]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) in childhood and adolescence has been considered a different disease to that seen in adults, with predominantly familial aetiology mandating open exploration to exclude parathyroid hyperplasia in contrast to the adoption of focused image-guided parathyroidectomy (FP) in adults.

Study Design

A retrospective cohort study in a tertiary referral hospital setting of all children and adolescents (< 18 years) undergoing parathyroid surgery for PHPT. Data were obtained from a dedicated endocrine surgery database and hospital medical records.

Results

Over the 35-year study period (1980–2014), there were 31 patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for PHPT. 3 patients were from known multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome (MEN1) families, 3 had an isolated family history of PHPT and 25 were sporadic. In the sporadic group, 24 (96%) presented with symptomatic hypercalcaemia, affecting the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, genitourinary or neuropsychiatric systems. In the 25 patients with sporadic PHPT, nine (36%) had FP with a single adenoma removed with a 100% initial cure rate. Sixteen patients (64%) in the sporadic group had an open exploration: 14 had single gland disease while 2 patients required a second procedure to achieve a final cure rate of 100%. Of the three patients with MEN1, one was cured, one has persistent hyperparathyroidism after FP and the third has permanent hypoparathyroidism after open exploration.

Conclusions

The majority of children and adolescents with PHPT have symptomatic disease due to a single adenoma. They can therefore be managed in a similar fashion to their adult counterparts with preoperative localisation studies aiming to permit FP in a day case setting.

### Approach to the patient with primary hyperparathyroidism in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^111MjcUH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disorder in which patients develop multiple endocrine tumors simultaneously. Among these, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is the most common and often the earliest manifestation. All patients with MEN1 and hypercalcemia should have surgery, with most patients requiring surgical treatment before the age of 50. The timing of parathyroid surgery mainly depends on hypercalcemia and the presence of renal or skeletal complications. The goals of treatment are to correct hypercalcemia, prevent target organ damage, and minimize the risk of postoperative hypoparathyroidism as much as possible. Currently, the most widely recommended surgical approach is subtotal parathyroidectomy via cervical approach (removal of 3 or 3.5 glands). With advances in imaging technology, patients with clearly localized lesions-particularly younger patients-may be candidates for individualized unilateral resection (i.e., removal of both glands on the affected side). In addition, recurrent hypercalcemia after surgery is relatively common in MEN1 patients. The management of the remaining glands remains challenging, such patients usually need reoperation, calcimimetic therapy or clinical observation. For patients requiring repeated parathyroid surgeries, in addition to searching for multifocal lesions, the possibility of ectopic parathyroid glands should also be taken into account. Ectopic parathyroid adenoma, caused by abnormal embryonic migration, complicates surgery in both sporadic and MEN1-related PHPT. However, in MEN1, their higher frequency and multiglandular distribution make localization even more challenging, often leading to incomplete resection and recurrence.

Talk to your child's doctor about the tests and procedures needed to check for signs of cancer and how often they should be done. MEN2A syndrome may cause medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, or parathyroid gland disease. MEN2A syndrome is also called Sipple syndrome. A diagnosis of MEN2A syndrome may be made when the patient or the patient's parents, brothers, sisters, or children have two or more of the following conditions: Treatment of Childhood MEN1 Syndrome Hyperparathyroidism is the most common sign of MEN1 syndrome. Children with MEN1 syndrome and primary hyperparathyroidism may have surgery to remove at least three parathyroid glands and the thymus. Treatment is also given for pancreatic islet cell and pituitary tumors, and other conditions linked to MEN1 syndrome as needed. Use our clinical trial search to find NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are accepting patients.

You can search for trials based on the type of cancer, the age of the patient, and where the trials are being done. General information about clinical trials is also available. Treatment of Childhood MEN2A Syndrome Medullary thyroid cancer is linked to MEN2A syndrome. Children with MEN2A syndrome and certain changes in the RET gene usually have surgery to remove the thyroid before the child is 5 years old to diagnose cancer or to lessen the chance cancer will form or spread. Treatment is also given for pheochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism as needed.

### Prophylactic thyroidectomy in children with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [^1114iGw5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndrome, genetic testing offers early diagnosis, stratifies the risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) and informs the timing of thyroidectomy. The efficacy of treatment, which depends on timely and safe surgery, is not well established.

Methods

This was a retrospective review of diagnostic and clinicopathological outcomes of prophylactic thyroidectomy in children with MEN2 between 1995 and 2013 in the UK. American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2009 guidelines were used as a benchmark for adequate treatment.

Results

Seventy-nine children from 16 centres underwent total thyroidectomy. Thirty-eight patients (48 per cent) underwent genetic testing and 36 (46 per cent) had an operation performed above the age recommended by the ATA 2009 guidelines; pathology showed MTC in 30 patients (38 per cent). Late surgery, above-normal preoperative calcitonin level and MTC on pathology correlated with late genetic testing. Twenty-five children had lymphadenectomy; these patients had more parathyroid glands excised (mean difference 0.61, 95 per cent c.i. 0.24 to 0.98; P = 0.001), and were more likely to have hypocalcaemia requiring medication (relative risk (RR) 3.12, 95 per cent c.i. 1.54 to 6.32; P = 0.002) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (RR 3.24, 1.29 to 8.11; P = 0.010) compared with those who underwent total thyroidectomy alone. Age did not influence the development of complications.

Conclusion

Late genetic testing may preclude age-appropriate surgery, increasing the risk of operating when MTC has already developed. Early genetic testing and age-appropriate surgery may help avoid unnecessary lymphadenectomy and improve outcomes.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — postoperative surveillance states that for multigland disease, lifelong cure may not be possible and the goal of surgery may be defined as normal calcium homeostasis and an extended time to recurrence rather than cure; postoperatively, serum calcium should be checked at 6 months to confirm normocalcemia; some patients may have an elevated PTH with normal serum calcium after surgery, which may indicate an increased risk of recurrent PHPT; therefore, annual and long-term follow-up with serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and PTH may be appropriate.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism as the first clinical manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A in a 5-year-old child [^117CYzXH]. Thyroid (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs in only 10%-30% of patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), rarely as the sole clinical manifestation, and is usually diagnosed after the third decade of life.

Summary

A 5-year-old girl was referred for prophylactic thyroidectomy as she carried the p.C634R RET mutation. She was clinically asymptomatic, with a normally palpable thyroid and with the cervical region free of lymphadenopathy or other nodules. Preoperative tests revealed hypercalcemia associated with elevation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) (calcium = 11.2mg/dL, calcium ion = 1.48mmol/L, phosphorus = 4.0mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase = 625U/L, parathyroid hormone (PTH) PTH = 998pg/mL). A thyroid ultrasound was normal and parathyroid scintigraphy with (99m)Tc-Sestamibi revealed an area of radioconcentration in the upper half of the left thyroid lobe suggesting hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue. She underwent total thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy and developed hypocalcemia. The anatomopathological examination showed no histopathological changes in the thyroid tissue and an adenoma of the parathyroid gland, confirming the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.

Conclusions

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be a precocious manifestation of MEN2A. This case report highlights that asymptomatic hypercalcemia should be scrutinized in children related to patients with MEN2A who carry a mutation in the RET proto-oncogene, especially mutations in the codon 634, before the currently recommended age of 8 years.

This study was conducted to examine whether carriers of out-of-frame/truncating and in-frame MEN1 mutations differ in age-related tumour penetrance.

Design

A multicentre study with biochemical, hormonal and radiological screening for MEN1-associated tumours.

Patients

A total of 258 MEN1 carriers from six major German tertiary referral centres averaging 43 years of age at last follow-up.

Measurements

Main outcome measure was time to first diagnosis of MEN1-associated tumours.

Results

Independent of the year of birth and observation period, time to first tumour diagnosis did not vary much by the type of MEN1 germline mutation or endocrine organ system, and perhaps not even by the type of endocrine tumour when the amount of time was considered by which the diagnosis probably has been advanced through the manifestation of hormonal symptoms. Parathyroid hyperplasia and adenomas developed almost twice as often as enteropancreatic and pituitary tumours (77%vs. 49–32%), and more than five to sevenfold as often as adrenal cortical tumours and carcinoids (77%vs. 15–10%), reaching penetrance rates of up to 90%, 60%, 40%, 26% and 17%, respectively. The heterogeneity of tumour penetrance was marked, ranging from 9 years to 25 years for the earliest, and from 68 years to 77 years for the latest tumour manifestation.

Conclusions

Because of our inability of predicting tumour penetrance and malignant transformation individually, life-long follow-up of MEN1 carriers is warranted to prevent tumour morbidity.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — treatment notes that open bilateral neck exploration is recommended, and subtotal parathyroidectomy (i.e. removal of ≤ 3.5 glands) has led to persistent or recurrent hypercalcemia within 10 to 12 yr after surgery in 40 to 60% of patients and hypocalcemia requiring long-term therapy in 10 to 30% of patients; recurrence in non-MEN1 after parathyroidectomy is lower, with recurrent hypercalcemia 4 to 16% and hypocalcemia 1 to 8%. The presence of functioning autotransplanted parathyroid tissue leads to recurrent hypercalcemia in more than 50% of patients, and one study reported that using approximately 10 fresh parathyroid pieces 1 mm3 in size helps reduce recurrence and hypoparathyroidism rates. Subtotal parathyroidectomy is suggested as the initial treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN1, while total parathyroidectomy may be reserved for extensive disease; persistent hypocalcemia is treated with oral calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). One recommendation is that parathyroidectomy be reserved for symptomatic hypercalcemic patients with MEN1 and that asymptomatic hypercalcemic patients do not undergo surgery but have regular assessment, at which time subtotal parathyroidectomy with transcervical thymectomy should be undertaken; calcimimetics (e.g. cinacalcet) have been used when surgery failed or was contraindicated.

### Prospective study of surgery for primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in multiple endocrine neoplasia-type 1 and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: long-term outcome of a more virulent form of HPT [^117CZPqY]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is caused by parathyroid hyperplasia. Surgery for parathyroid hyperplasia is tricky and difficult. Long-term outcome in ZES/MEN1/HPT is not well known.

Methods

Eighty-four consecutive patients (49 F/35 M) with ZES/MEN1/HPT underwent initial parathyroidectomy (PTX) and were followed at 1- to 3-year intervals.

Results

Age at PTX was 36 ± 2 years. Mean follow-up was 17 ± 1 years. Before PTX, mean Ca = 2.8 mmol/L (normal level (nl < 2.5), PTH i = 243 pg/mL (nl < 65), and gastrin = 6950 pg/mL (nl < 100). Sixty-one percent had nephrolithiasis. Each patient had parathyroid hyperplasia. Fifty-eight percent of patients had 4 parathyroid glands identified. Nine of 84 (11%) had 4 glands removed with immediate autograft, 40/84 (47%) 3 to 3.5 glands, whereas 35/84 (42%) < 3 glands removed. Persistent/recurrent HPT occurred in 42%/48% of patients with < 3 glands, 12%/44% with 3 to 3.5 glands, and 0%/55% with 4 glands removed. Hypoparathyroidism occurred in 3%, 10%, and 22%, respectively. The disease-free interval after surgery was significantly longer if > 3 glands were removed. After surgery to correct the HPT, each biochemical parameter of ZES was improved and 20% of patients no longer had laboratory evidence of ZES.

Conclusions

HPT/MEN1/ZES is a severe form of parathyroid hyperplasia with a high rate of nephrolithiasis, persistent and recurrent HPT. Surgery to correct the hypercalcemia significantly ameliorates the ZES. Removal of less than 3.5 glands has an unacceptably high incidence of persistent HPT (42%), whereas 4-gland resection and transplant has a high rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism (22%). More than 3-gland resection has a longer disease-free interval. The surgical procedure of choice for patients with HPT/MEN1/ZES is 3.5-gland parathyroidectomy. Careful long-term follow-up is necessary as a significant proportion will develop recurrent HPT.

3 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

pHPT is the most frequent manifestation of MEN1 and often the first manifestation of the disease. In paediatric patients who are prospectively screened, at least half already have early signs of pHPT, which is mostly asymptomatic and rarely seen before the age of 10. Symptomatic pHPT is usually not seen before the third decade of life. pHPT in MEN1 is a multiglandular disease, although glands are often affected asymmetrically and asynchronously. Patients with MEN1‐related pHPT have a lower bone mineral density (BMD) than patients with sporadic pHPT. Furthermore, urolithiasis is seen frequently and at a young age, and patients with MEN1 aged 20–59 appeared to have a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease stage 3 compared to the general US population. It is therefore important to monitor patients with MEN1‐related pHPT for these complications. The treatment of pHPT is surgical, and the aim of initial parathyroidectomy is achieving eucalcemia for as long as possible, while preventing hypoparathyroidism and facilitating potential reoperative surgery. Since the publication of the guidelines and publication of additional studies, most experts agree that the preferred initial operation in MEN1 is a bilateral cervical exploration, identifying all four parathyroid glands and performing a subtotal parathyroidectomy with concomitant cervical thymectomy. This provides the best balance between rates of persistent/recurrent disease and postoperative hypoparathyroidism. In recent years it has been debated if for young people with MEN1‐related pHPT, a stepwise approach to parathyroid surgery should be offered in the form of unilateral clearance (resection of all parathyroids and cervical thymus on one side) as initial operation. The rationale for considering this in those with unilateral disease on preoperative imaging, is to provide several years of eucalcemia allowing to accumulate peak bone mass, while not being subjected to the risk of hypoparathyroidism. Others are fiercely opposed such an approach, due to unacceptable failure rates. As currently, no consensus exists, if such an approach is considered, the risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient and/or parents. Another topic that becomes increasingly important with more widespread use of predictive testing and prospective screening is the timing of initial parathyroidectomy when pHPT is mild and asymptomatic at diagnosis, especially in children. Arguments favouring initial observation are to avoid the risk of symptomatic hypoparathyroidism, multiple operations and making the glands more easily identifiable if the disease progressed a bit more. Others advocate early intervention based on early bone and renal complications. In children, the effect of mild pHPT on peak BMD or development in general is unknown as is the effect of hypoparathyroidism. Decisions are therefore different in children compared to adults and currently no consensus exists.

### Parathyroid surgery in familial hyperparathyroid disorders [^111ewtF8]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The management of hyperparathyroidism (HPT) in the setting of familial HPT differs between the specific syndromes and is generally complex because of the underlying disease, which predisposes patients to persistent and recurrent HPT. The basic principles of surgery include achieving and maintaining normocalcaemia for the longest time possible, avoiding both iatrogenic hypocalcaemia and operative complications, and facilitating future surgery for recurrent disease. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is treated with either subtotal parathyroidectomy or total parathyroidectomy with immediate heterotopic autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue. MEN2A, familial isolated HPT and HPT-associated with the hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumour (HPT-JT) syndrome typically can be treated with parathyroidectomy, i.e. subtotal or less. The increased risk of parathyroid cancer in HPT-JT requires special attention. Parathyroid surgery in familial HPT syndromes in the setting of underlying mutations in the calcium receptor (CASR) gene involves radical subtotal parathyroidectomy. Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurements may help guide the extent of parathyroid resection, particularly in the case of multigland HPT. The vast majority of patients with familial HPT who require surgery are best served with bilateral cervical explorations. However, minimally invasive parathyroidectomy (MIP) techniques that have become routine for sporadic HPT at selected institutions may be extrapolated to a subset of cases of familial HPT.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in young people. when should we perform genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN-1)? [^114YHLeo]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN-1) is a rare, autosomal dominant inherited disorder. Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is the most frequent and usually the earliest expression of MEN-1, with typical age of onset at 20–25 years. Early detection of the disease and correct treatment are therefore of great importance.

Case Presentation

A 31-year-old woman with osteogenesis imperfecta was incidentally found also to have hypercalcemia and elevated PTH (pHPT). Exploratory neck surgery showed multiglandular parathyroid affection; she turned out to have MEN-1, but she was diagnosed 7 years after her debut of pHPT.

Objective and Methods

The aim was to search literature on indications for performing mutational analysis in young patients with pHPT and no family history of MEN-1. PubMed was searched for English language articles, and words used were: MEN1 OR MEN-1 OR MEN type 1 OR multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 OR multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 AND Mutational analysis OR genetic testing OR testing OR Hyperparathyroidism, primary [majr]. A total of 625 abstracts were reviewed.

Results and Discussion

Whether to perform screening of patients with pHPT under the age of 30, 35, or 40 years is controversial. According to international guidelines from 2001, genetic testing is indicated only in patients with pHPT below the age of 30 years. However, in updated guidelines from 2012, it is suggested to perform genetic testing in patients with pHPT below the age of 30 years, but also at any age in patients presenting with multigland parathyroid disease.

Conclusions

The reviewed literature and the presented case illustrate the importance of this change in international guidelines, but they also raise concern for a potential underdiagnosing of patients before year 2012.

PHPT syndromes

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN1)

Clinical Features

MEN1 has a reported prevalence of 1 in 30,000 individuals and is characterised by the combined occurrence of parathyroid, pituitary and pancreatic endocrine tumours. Some patients may develop additional tumours including thymic and bronchial carcinoid tumours and adrenocortical tumours. PHPT occurs with almost complete penetrance (> 95% by age 50 years) and is the first manifestation of disease in ~75% of cases, occurring with a mean age of onset of ~20 years, although cases have been reported as early as 4-years of age. The biochemical features of PHPT are typically mild and patients are frequently asymptomatic. Characteristically, there is synchronous or asynchronous involvement of all 4 parathyroid glands, with histology demonstrating chief cell hyperplasia. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice although its timing and extent remain controversial. Notably, hypercalcaemia may exacerbate gastrin secretion in those with concurrent PHPT and gastrinoma, and restoration of normocalcaemia (e.g. by successful parathyroidectomy) may improve symptoms in a proportion of patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

MEN1 variants — Families with MEN1 variants appear to develop only some manifestations of MEN1, including kindreds with parathyroidism as the sole endocrinopathy termed familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP); MEN1 mutations have been reported in 42 FIHP kindreds with 38% missense and fewer than 31% nonsense or frame-shift mutations, contrasting significantly (P < 0.01) with MEN1 patients in whom more than 65% of germ-line mutations are protein-truncating and about 23% are missense.

### Patient quality of life and prognosis in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 [^115q4x4M]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) refers to the autosomal-dominant neuroendocrine tumour syndromes, MEN type 2A (MEN2A) and MEN type 2B (MEN2B). They are typified by the development of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), phaeochromocytoma and parathyroid hyperplasia in MEN2A and MTC, phaeochromocytomas, ganglioneuromatosis and skeletal abnormalities in MEN2B. The aggressiveness of MTC is variable according to genotype, and although it is still the major cause of mortality in both conditions, prognosis has improved dramatically in those diagnosed and treated at a young age thanks to predictive genetic testing. Nevertheless, metastatic MTC, ganglioneuromatosis and a variety of other negative clinical and psychosocial impacts on quality of life and/or prognosis in MEN2 persist. In the absence, at the time of writing, of any large-scale research into quality of life specifically in MEN2, this review includes data from patient surveys and anonymised patient anecdotes from the records of the Association for Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Disorders (AMEND), for whom the authors work. We recommend that these patients are cared for only in centres of expertise able to provide expert diagnosis, treatment and continuity of care, including psychological and transition support. Only in this way can the clinical advances of the last two and half decades be built upon further to ensure that the care of these complex, lifelong patients can be considered truly holistic.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) diagnosis — A diagnosis of MEN1 may be established in an individual by one of three criteria: occurrence of two or more primary MEN1-associated endocrine tumors (parathyroid adenoma, enteropancreatic tumor, and pituitary adenoma); occurrence of one MEN1-associated tumor in a first-degree relative of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN; or identification of a germline MEN1 mutation in an individual who may be asymptomatic and has not yet developed serum biochemical or radiological abnormalities indicative of tumor development.

### Predictors of mortality in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^113YbPTb]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

This study has identified early parathyroidectomy and early detection of hypergastrinaemia, liver lesions and adrenal lesions as being associated with significantly decreased median survival among patients with MEN 1. However, subjects in whom these disease features manifested later in life had comparable survival to those who did not. This study did not detect any impact on survival based on sex or calendar year of birth. There was also no difference in survival according to the timing of diagnosis of pancreatic lesions or primary hyperparathyroidism.

The association between early parathyroidectomy and poorer survival may reflect parathyroidectomy at an earlier age indicating onset of more severe disease at a young age, and therefore a longer cumulative period of exposure over a lifetime to hypercalcaemia, which has been associated with diabetes and increased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The procedure itself appears unlikely as an explanation as surgical mortality associated with parathyroidectomy was not observed. There was no difference in survival between those who had their first parathyroidectomy after the age of 45 and those who never had a parathyroidectomy. In addition, the MLE was well above the age 45 cut point. These factors combined suggest that this association is more reflective of early onset disease severity rather than procedural mortality. In contrast, the lack of a significant association between early diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and mortality may reflect that early diagnosis does not reflect disease severity, and that primary hyperparathyroidism, if mild, can be medically or conservatively managed.

While severe hypergastrinaemia and its association with Zollinger‐Ellison syndrome may causally explain increased mortality in such cases, lesser degrees of hypergastrinaemia might best be considered a predictive biomarker of increased patient mortality risk. The mechanism of causation remains less clear. Additionally, as hypercalcaemia is a secretagogue for gastrin and exacerbates hypergastrinaemia in patients with concurrent enteropancreatic disease, hypergastrinaemia is an indication for parathyroidectomy in patients with hyperparathyroidism. The early detection of liver lesions as a strong predictor of mortality was unsurprising given the majority of these lesions are metastatic gastrinomas. Interestingly, compared with those who had never been diagnosed with a liver lesion, those diagnosed after age 45 years had similar survival. This might suggest that tumours that present later in life behave more indolently.

### Predictors of mortality in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^114hTUYY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, MEN 1 patients presenting an earlier diagnosis of adrenal nodularity, hypergastrinaemia and liver lesions demonstrate reduced median survival. As opposed to hypergastrinaemia and liver disease, the explanation for nonsecretory, benign adrenal macronodular hyperplasia being associated with diminished life expectancy is unclear. The optimal timing of parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism in MEN 1 also remains to be determined.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^115v6sVJ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Medium credibility.

MEN1 — Parathyroid tumors diagnosis and treatment: Screening for primary hyperparathyroidism should include annual assessment of plasma calcium and PTH concentrations. Surgery performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon is the treatment of choice, although the optimum timing has not been defined. Conventional open bilateral exploration with subtotal parathyroidectomy (at least 3.5 glands) or total parathyroidectomy is recommended, and concurrent transcervical thymectomy is also suggested at the time of surgery. Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation may be considered, whereas minimally invasive parathyroidectomy is usually not recommended because multiple glands are typically affected.

### Childhood multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes… [^113rGPjn]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend that screening for patients with MEN1 syndrome begins by age 5 years and continues throughout life. The tests for screening are age specific and may include yearly serum calcium, parathyroid hormone, gastrin, glucagon, secretin, proinsulin, chromogranin A, prolactin, and IGF-1. Radiological screening should include magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and computed tomography of the abdomen every 1 to 3 years. One study documented the initial presentation of MEN1 syndrome occurring before age 21 years in 160 patients. Of note, most patients had familial MEN1 syndrome and were monitored using an international screening protocol. Patients had the following symptoms and conditions: Primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common symptom, was found in 75% of patients, usually only in those with biological abnormalities.

Primary hyperparathyroidism diagnosed outside of a screening program is extremely rare, most often presents with nephrolithiasis, and should lead the clinician to suspect MEN1. P = 0.081).
- In the moderate-risk category, medullary thyroid carcinoma was seen in 1 of 9 children aged 3 years or younger, 1 of 26 children aged 4 to 6 years, 3 of 26 children aged 7 to 12 years, and 7 of 16 children aged 13 to 18 years (. MEN2A syndrome For children with MEN2A syndrome, thyroidectomy is commonly performed by approximately age 5 years or older if that is when a RET variant is identified. The outcomes for patients with MEN2A syndrome are generally good, although medullary thyroid carcinoma and. Young children who are relatives of patients with MEN2A syndrome undergo genetic testing before the age of 5 years. Carriers undergo total thyroidectomy as described above, with autotransplant of one parathyroid gland by a certain age.

### Medullary carcinoma in children… [^117FVqYu]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

- Early diagnosis and surgical treatment of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid in children is essential to decrease the likelihood of metastatic spread. To determine the optimal timing of screening and surgery, we reviewed all children younger than 16 years old who were undergoing surgical treatment. From 1970 to 1988, 33 children 6 months old to 15. 9 years old with MCT or C-cell hyperplasia or both underwent total thyroidectomy. Follow-up was 4 months to 15 years after surgery. Six of 31 patients presented with a neck mass. Basal immunoreactive calcitonin level was increased in 3 of 7 patients with C-cell hyperplasia alone, in 10 of 18 patients with nonmetastatic MCT, and in all 5 patients with metastatic MCT. At the time of surgery, 7 patients had C-cell hyperplasia, 19 patients had MCT without metastasis, and 7 patients had MCT with metastases. All children with metastasis were more than 12 years old.

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was seen as early as age 6 months in a child with multiple endocrine neoplasia type IIb and age 3 years in a child with MEN-IIa. At follow-up, 25 patients were free of disease and 8 had had recurrent disease. Two of the 8 patients with MEN-IIb had died. All 6 children with a neck mass at presentation had recurrent disease. Of 27 patients diagnosed by screening, 25 had no evident disease and 2 had persistent disease. Thus, in children with MEN-II syndromes, screening studies are highly effective in detecting MCT. All children with MEN-IIb should be studied shortly after birth, and those with MEN-IIa should be studied by 1 year old. Telander RL, Zimmerman D, Sizemore GW, van Heerden JA, Grant CS.

In recent years, timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy in asymptomatic carriers of germline RET gene mutations has been customized based on the age and type of mutation. In an effort to further optimize the management of these children, we conducted a nationwide study, including all Dutch patients who underwent total thyroidectomy in childhood in the past 25 years. We set out to study the differences in treatment for patients operated on at the age recommended by the current guidelines and those operated on at an older age. The second purpose of this study was to assess any differences in treatment and outcome in patients treated in the era before and after genetic testing became available. Finally, our aim was to analyze prognostic risk factors for recurrent MTC in these patients.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) genotype–phenotype correlations and familial clustering — care implications are as follows: genotype-phenotype correlations for MEN1 are inconsistently found and should not be used to guide patient care; missense and in-frame insertion/deletion variants show variable association with attenuated phenotype and may be overrepresented in familial isolated primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), yet many familial isolated PHPT–associated variants have been associated with the full disease spectrum. Familial clustering has been observed for thymic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), pituitary tumors, and adrenal tumors; given the strong heritability estimate of thymic NETs (97%) and the high morbidity/mortality, rigorous guideline implementation (medical imaging and thymectomy with parathyroid surgery) should be emphasized in families with thymic NET.

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^113qbbCY]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This review provides an overview of novel insights in the clinical management of patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, focusing on the last decade since the last update of the MEN1 guidelines. With regard to Diagnosis: Mutation‐negative patients with 2/3 main manifestations have a different clinical course compared to mutation‐positive patients. As for primary hyperparathyroidism: subtotal parathyroidectomy is the initial procedure of choice. Current debate centres around the timing of initial parathyroidectomy as well as the controversial topic of unilateral clearance in young patients. For duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), the main challenge is accurate and individualized risk stratification to enable personalized surveillance and treatment. Thymus NETs remain one of the most aggressive MEN1‐related tumours. Lung NETs are more frequent than previously thought, generally indolent, but rare aggressive cases do occur. Pituitary adenomas are most often prolactinomas and nonfunctioning microadenomas with an excellent prognosis and good response to therapy. Breast cancer is recognized as part of the MEN1 syndrome in women and periodical screening is advised. Clinically relevant manifestations are already seen at the paediatric age and initiating screening in the second decade is advisable. MEN1 has a significant impact on quality of life and US data show a significant financial burden. In conclusion, patient outcomes have improved, but much is still to be achieved. For care tailored to the needs of the individual patient and improving outcomes on an individual basis, studies are now needed to define predictors of tumour behaviour and effects of more individualized interventions.

8] In contrast, penetrance ranged from 41% to 65% when it was solely based on MTC clinical presentation. This difference suggests that individuals with MEN2 have MTC with varying natural history, penetrance, and aggressiveness. As research continues, the understanding of genotype-phenotype correlations and recommendations for the optimal age for thyroidectomy continue to change. MTC is generally the first manifestation of MEN2A. In asymptomatic at-risk individuals, stimulation testing may reveal elevated plasma calcitonin levels and the presence of CCH or MTC. In families with MEN2A, the biochemical manifestations of MTC generally appear between the ages of 5 years and 25 years. A series of 56 patients with MEN2-related hyperparathyroidism has been reported by the French Calcitonin Tumors Study Group.

The median age at diagnosis was 38 years, documenting that this disorder is rarely the first manifestation of MEN2. MEN2B The MEN2B subtype comprises about 5% of MEN2 cases. MEN2B is characterized by the development of aggressive MTC at a young age, the presence of mucosal neuromas, gastrointestinal ganglioneuromatosis, medullated corneal nerve fibers, and distinct physical features. PHEOs occur in about 50% of MEN2B cases. About half of these cases have multiple PHEOs, which are often bilateral. Clinically apparent parathyroid disease is very uncommon in individuals with MEN2B. Patients with MEN2B who do not undergo thyroidectomy at approximately age 1 year are likely to develop metastatic MTC at an early age. Before intervention with early risk-reducing thyroidectomy, the average age at death in patients with MEN2B was 21 years.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN-1) consists of endocrine tumors of the parathyroid, the endocrine pancreas-duodenum, and the pituitary. Surveillance and screening for the endocrinopathies is recommended in gene carriers. Surgery for MEN-1-related hyperparathyroidism is generally performed as radical subtotal parathyroidectomy, because less surgery is likely to result in persistent or recurrent disease. Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN-2) consists of medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. Prophylactic thyroidectomy based on DNA testing in the MEN-2 syndrome is considered one of the greater achievements in cancer treatment, because it may be performed before thyroid carcinoma development and provides cure for the patient.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) — core tumor frequencies, inheritance, and prognosis — shows parathyroid tumors occurring in approximately 95% of MEN1 patients, pancreatic islet tumors occurring in approximately 40–70% of MEN1 patients, and anterior pituitary tumors occurring in approximately 30–40% of patients; MEN1 is inherited as an autosomal-dominant disorder in families, with a nonfamilial (sporadic) form in 8 to 14% and de novo MEN1 mutations in approximately 10% of all patients; untreated MEN1 is associated with a 50% probability of death by the age of 50 yr and death in 50–70% is usually due to malignant tumor process or sequelae, while prognosis improved considerably after the introduction of acid-suppressive therapies for gastrinoma and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.

1 Introduction

Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1 (MEN 1) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with a high degree of penetrance. Clinical disease develops in the context of a germline inactivating mutation of MEN1, a tumour suppressor gene encoding the protein menin. The typical MEN 1 phenotype involves hyperplasia or neoplasia of parathyroid tissue, pancreatic islet cells and the pituitary gland.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the earliest and most common manifestation of MEN 1. It develops in 95% of patients by age 30 years, and typically manifests as asymptomatic hypercalcaemia. Recurrence is common following a subtotal parathyroidectomy. Enteropancreatic lesions are detected in 50%–70% of patients, of which the most commonly diagnosed are gastrinomas. Pituitary tumour prevalence ranges from 19%–72% in patients with MEN 1. Prolactinoma are the most frequently detected manifestation followed by nonfunctioning adenoma, growth hormone‐secreting adenoma and thyrotrophinoma. Compared to sporadic pituitary lesions in the general population, pituitary disease associated with MEN 1 is more likely to be aggressive and resistant to medical therapy.

Adrenal lesions develop in approximately one‐third of patients with MEN 1, typically as benign, nonfunctional macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (MAH). This almost exclusively occurs in those with pancreatic endocrine tumours, and MAH‐related lesions in MEN 1 have been noted to retain heterozygosity at the MEN1 gene locus, suggesting the potential for a secondary hyperplasia rather than primary neoplastic aetiology. Although adrenocortical carcinomas have developed in rare cases of MEN 1, it is unclear whether they develop from a pre‐existing benign adrenal lesion or de novo from normal adrenal tissue.

Life expectancy in MEN 1 is reduced relative to that of the general population. In historical cohorts, 44%–58% of patients with probable or untreated MEN 1 succumbed to MEN 1‐related causes, the most common being complications of hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. In patients with recognised and treated MEN 1, only 28% of deaths were directly related to MEN 1. The most common cause of MEN 1‐related death in these cohorts was malignant gastroenteropancreatic tumours.

### Treatments for MEN1-associated endocrine tumours: three systematic reviews and a meta-analysis [^116WMGHJ]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare hereditary disorder characterised by the combined occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic, and pituitary tumours. Current treatments are based on very low-quality evidence. Our aims were to determine treatment outcomes in patients with MEN1 for: subtotal parathyroidectomy versus less than subtotal parathyroidectomy for primary hyperparathyroidism (Q1); surgery versus active surveillance for non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm or less (Q2); and dopamine agonist responses of prolactinomas in patients with MEN1 versus patients without MEN1 (Q3).

Methods

We conducted three systematic reviews and one meta-analysis. Four electronic databases (MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) were searched from Dec 1, 2001, to Feb 13, 2023, with no language restrictions. Study designs included randomised controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case-controlled and case series. Adults and children with MEN1-associated tumours were included in all three systematic reviews. For each clinical question, three pairs of authors independently screened abstracts and assessed the full text for final inclusion, discordant views were resolved by senior authors. Dichotomous outcomes were calculated using risk ratios or hazard ratios for time-to-event analyses, with 95% CIs. Continuous outcomes were ascertained using mean difference with 95% CIs. Where feasible, outcomes from individual studies were analysed through meta-analysis, using a random-effects model. The systematic reviews were prospectively registered (PROSPERO reference numbers CRD42023409912, CRD42023409936, and CRD42023409949).

Findings

For primary hyperparathyroidism (Q1), 990 non-duplicate records were screened for title and abstract, of which 23 studies with 1073 patients were eligible for meta-analysis. These studies showed that subtotal parathyroidectomy had a significantly lower risk of persistent primary hyperparathyroidism (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.20–0.52; I² = 0%) and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism (RR 0.78, 0.62–0.97; I² = 27%), when compared with less than subtotal parathyroidectomy, although the risk of post-operative hypoparathyroidism was higher (RR 2.64, 1.63–4.29; I² = 0%). For non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm and less (Q2), 1583 non-duplicate records were screened for title and abstract, of which three cohort studies were eligible for analysis. These studies showed that combined metastatic disease and mortality rates were comparable between patients in the surgery group (two [7%] of 27 to three [20%] of 15) and patients in the active surveillance group (one [3%] of 33 to four [8%] of 50]). For prolactinomas (Q3), 475 non-duplicate records were screened for title and abstract, of which ten studies with 505 patients were eligible for analysis. These studies showed that dopamine agonist treatment failure rates to normalise serum prolactin were similar between patients with MEN1 (zero of one to one [33%] of three) and patients without MEN1 (four [6%] of 68 to nine (82%) of 11), n = 23 studies). GRADE certainty scores for all were low or very low.

Interpretation

In patients with MEN1, subtotal parathyroidectomy achieved greater reductions in persistence and recurrence of primary hyperparathyroidism than less than subtotal parathyroidectomy; for non-functioning pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours sized 2 cm or less, the few available studies suggest that active surveillance might be comparable to surgical resection; and for prolactinomas, dopamine agonist therapy appears to have comparable efficacy as in patients without MEN1.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^111RztdQ]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) clinical genetics — indications and timing for evaluation and testing include: clinical MEN1 diagnosis; a first-degree relative with MEN1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant (PV/LPV); primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) before 30 years; PHPT, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (dpNET), or pituitary adenoma (PA) with a first-degree relative also with PHPT, dpNET, or PA; multiglandular PHPT; gastrinoma; multiple pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs); ≥ 2 MEN1-associated tumors insufficient for clinical diagnosis (one of which is PHPT, dpNET, or PA); neuroendocrine tumor (NET) of bronchus, thymus, or stomach (age < 40 years); and identified MEN1 PV/LPV on somatic testing. For at-risk individuals, genetic testing is recommended between 5–10 years of age, when tumor surveillance should be initiated, and genetic testing should be performed promptly beyond 10 years to avoid delayed diagnoses. Natural history data note the first MEN1-associated symptoms or biochemical abnormality rarely occur before age 5 (0.5%) or 10 years (2.2%); however, by 15 years of age ~10% have evidence of disease. Germline MEN1 testing may be considered when anticipated PV/LPV diagnostic yield is ≥ 5% for NET of the bronchus, thymus, or stomach (age < 40 years), for pNET, or when an MEN1 PV/LPV is identified by somatic tumor sequencing.

7 MEN1 IN CHILDREN

Current practice guidelines recommend DNA testing for the familial MEN1 mutation in children at the earliest opportunity, but at least in the first decade, based on the earliest documented manifestations of MEN1 in the literature up until then. In those who are carriers of the familiar mutation, the recommended age for initiation of biochemical and radiological screening for the different manifestations is based on the earliest reported case in the literature combined with the experience of the expert authors of the guidelines. The recommendation for early DNA testing and initiation of screening has increased the knowledge of the spectrum of MEN1 in children, and since the publication of the guidelines five cohorts have been published on the clinical picture of MEN1 in childhood, which are summarized in Table 1. In addition, a study from Brazil reported a 42% prevalence of PanNETs in 19 patients with MEN1 age 12–20and a series from Italy (same centre as Vannucci et al.) reported on pHPT (63%) among 30 patients genetically diagnosed before age 20. These combined data show that 12%–70% of children with MEN1 already have manifestations at the paediatric age (although different age cut‐offs are used). The wide range can partly be explained by different screening practices as Goudet et al.found that 73% of those following a screening program < 21 years had manifestations diagnosed at the paediatric age, while overall in their cohort this was only 17%. Median age at first manifestation in the five cohorts was 14–17 years. pHPT is highly prevalent at the paediatric age (45%–92% in those who have manifestations), but mostly asymptomatic (80%–91%) and leading to intervention at the paediatric age only in 31%–55% of the cases. PAs are seen in approximately one‐third of the children who have manifestations, mostly prolactinomas followed by NFPAs, and lead to intervention more often., dpNETs are seen in 17%–40% of those with manifestations, mostly insulinomas and NF‐PanNETs, while gastrinomas are rare. Insulinomas are symptomatic in all cases and were resected in all cases. NF‐PanNET are asymptomatic, leading to intervention in 22%–67% of the cases. Thoracic NETs are rare at the paediatric age, as are adrenal manifestations. Frank malignancy is reported at the paediatric age in two of the five cohorts, although it is rare with two ACCs and four malignant NETs (pancreas [2], gastrinoma and thymus). Therefore, the most important manifestations in childhood are pHPT, prolactinomas, NFPAs, NF‐PanNETs and insulinomas and parents and children should be educated as to their symptoms. Initiating biochemical and radiological screening in the second decade of life seems appropriate, based on currently available evidence. To be able to formulate true evidence‐based guidelines for the management of MEN1 at the paediatric age, long‐term outcome data are needed for those children who underwent screening from their first decade.

The identification of the genetic causes of the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes 1 and 2, and associated genotype-phenotype relationships, has revolutionised the clinical care of affected patients. A genetic diagnosis can be made during infancy and careful clinical surveillance, coupled with early intervention, has the potential to improve both morbidity and mortality. These developments have seen the management of patients with MEN move into the arena of paediatric medicine. In this review article, we consider the genetic causes of MEN together with the clinical manifestations and management of these syndromes.

Results

Demographic and clinical characteristics

Demographic and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A total of 32 PHPT patients who underwent surgical treatment with a median age of 14.7 ± 2.5 years old (range 9–18 years old) were included. Of 32 patients, 14 (43.8%) were female. Preoperative PTH and calcium levels were 926.60 ± 864.95 pg/ml and 3.03 ± 0.39 mmol/l, respectively. The median lesion size was 2.85 cm (range 1.00–5.80 cm). All 32 patients (100%) had single-gland disease. Of the 32 children in our series, 5 (15.6%) were also diagnosed with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Most lesions (21/32, 65.6%) were parathyroid adenoma, followed by atypical adenoma (5/32, 15.6%) and hyperplasia (6/32, 18.8%). No ectopic lesions were reported. All patients achieved operative success and the curative rate was 100%. Of the five MEN1 patients, three had recurrent lesions during 1–7 years of follow-up after the initial parathyroidectomy.

### Hyperparathyroidism and multiple endocrine neoplasia [^113mR59H]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes comprise the group of heritable endocrinopathies, MEN 1, MEN 2A, and MEN 2B. Primary hyperparathyroidism caused by multiglandular involvement is usually the initial manifestation in MEN 1, occurring in more than 90% of patients. In patients with MEN 2A, hyperparathyroidism develops less commonly and is usually milder than in MEN 1. Advances in genetics and molecular biology aid in confirming the diagnosis and screening relatives who are carriers or at risk for the disease. Surgery plays an important role in the management of hyperparathyroidism in both MEN 1 and MEN 2A, although the timing and extent of surgery are areas of controversy. Long-term follow-up reveals a high rate of recurrent hyperparathyroidism in MEN 1 despite surgical intervention.

3.2 Predictors of Survival

The overall MLE was 70.8 years. The impact of age at MEN 1 phenotype diagnosis on survival is presented in Table 2. First parathyroidectomy (Figure 1A) occurring before, compared with after age 45 years was predictive of shorter survival (MLE 68.9 vs 75.1 years, HR 2.31 (1.16–4.61), p < 0.01). The association between early parathyroidectomy and reduced survival remained significant when age at first parathyroidectomy was analysed as a continuous variable (p = 0.02) and adjusted for sex (p < 0.01).

### Multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes [^1158bkFx]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

The multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes are rare autosomal-dominant conditions that predispose affected individuals to benign and malignant tumors of the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroids, adrenals, endocrine pancreas, paraganglia, or nonendocrine organs. The classic MEN syndromes include MEN type 1 and MEN type 2. However, several other hereditary conditions should also be considered in the category of MEN: von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, the familial paraganglioma syndromes, Cowden syndrome, Carney complex, and hyperparathyroidism jaw-tumor syndrome. In addition, researchers are becoming aware of other familial endocrine neoplasia syndromes with an unknown genetic basis that might also fall into the category of MEN. This article reviews the clinical features, diagnosis, and surgical management of the various MEN syndromes and genetic risk assessment for patients presenting with one or more endocrine neoplasms.

For broader MEN1 features, "Periodic biochemical screening with serum calcium and PTH may also be considered", and "In patients with MEN1 without PHPT, annual biochemical screening is recommended (Table 1)". Early onset is noted: "MEN1 manifestations have been identified as early as 5 years of age, and PHPT has been diagnosed as early as 8 years of age; as such, some have suggested screening for PHPT in early childhood".

### Update on the clinical management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^117PQ4vo]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Medium credibility.

This review provides an overview of novel insights in the clinical management of patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1, focusing on the last decade since the last update of the MEN1 guidelines. With regard to Diagnosis: Mutation-negative patients with 2/3 main manifestations have a different clinical course compared to mutation-positive patients. As for primary hyperparathyroidism: subtotal parathyroidectomy is the initial procedure of choice. Current debate centres around the timing of initial parathyroidectomy as well as the controversial topic of unilateral clearance in young patients. For duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), the main challenge is accurate and individualized risk stratification to enable personalized surveillance and treatment. Thymus NETs remain one of the most aggressive MEN1-related tumours. Lung NETs are more frequent than previously thought, generally indolent, but rare aggressive cases do occur. Pituitary adenomas are most often prolactinomas and nonfunctioning microadenomas with an excellent prognosis and good response to therapy. Breast cancer is recognized as part of the MEN1 syndrome in women and periodical screening is advised. Clinically relevant manifestations are already seen at the paediatric age and initiating screening in the second decade is advisable. MEN1 has a significant impact on quality of life and US data show a significant financial burden. In conclusion, patient outcomes have improved, but much is still to be achieved. For care tailored to the needs of the individual patient and improving outcomes on an individual basis, studies are now needed to define predictors of tumour behaviour and effects of more individualized interventions.

### Less than subtotal parathyroidectomy for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 primary hyperparathyroidism: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115tvc6a]. World Journal of Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1)-associated primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) is classically associated with an asymmetric and asynchronous parathyroid involvement. Subtotal parathyroidectomy (STP), which is currently the recommended surgical treatment, carries a high risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism. The results of less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (LSTP) are conflicting, and its place in this setting is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to identify the place of LSTP in the surgical management of patients with MEN-associated pHPT.

Methods

A systematic literature review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines, for studies comparing STP and LSTP for MEN1-associated pHPT. The results of the two techniques, regarding permanent hypoparathyroidism, persistent hyperparathyroidism and recurrent hyperparathyroidism were computed using pairwise random-effect meta-analysis.

Results

Twenty-five studies comparing STP and LSTP qualified for inclusion in the quantitative synthesis. In total, 947 patients with MEN1-associated pHPT were allocated to STP (n = 569) or LSTP (n = 378). LSTP reduces the risk of permanent hypoparathyroidism [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.17–0.49)], but exposes to higher rates of persistent hyperparathyroidism [OR 4.60, 95% CI 2.66–7.97]. Rates of recurrent hyperparathyroidism were not significantly different between the two groups [OR 1.26, CI 95% 0.83–1.91].

Conclusions

LSTP should not be abandoned and should be considered as a suitable surgical option for selected patients with MEN1-associated pHPT. The increased risk of persistent hyperparathyroidism could improve with the emergence of more efficient preoperative localization imaging techniques and a more adequate patients selection.

### American association of clinical endocrinology consensus statement on management of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^1154Gjbk]. Endocrine Practice (2025). High credibility.

MEN1 primary hyperparathyroidism — parathyroidectomy approach and imaging considerations include that imaging has no role in the diagnosis of PHPT and negative imaging results do not preclude surgery; preoperative localization for an initial open bilateral neck exploration may be of limited benefit in MEN1-associated PHPT, with only 7% of patients estimated to have a different procedure based on preoperative localization, though many parathyroid surgeons consider 7% significant; optimal surgery is a bilateral neck exploration with identification of all 4 parathyroid glands and removal of 3.5 glands with a bilateral cervical thymectomy, and recurrent PHPT risk increases if less than subtotal parathyroidectomy (≤ 3.5 glands) is performed; intraoperative PTH monitoring may have limited benefit because it will not alter the operative strategy, and referral to a high-volume center is crucial to optimize outcomes.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism in pediatric patients… [^112ey2ng]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective. Primary hyperparathyroidism is unusual in children. We reviewed our experience with HPT to better characterize these children. Methods. The retrospective review of patients < 19 years old who underwent parathyroid resection for primary HPT from 1970 to 2000 was performed at a single institution. Results. Fifty-two patients were identified. Median age was 16. 8 years with a female-to-male ratio of 3:
2. Eighty-five percent had an elevated parathyroid hormone level, and 15% had an inappropriately normal PTH level during hypercalcemia. Serum calcium was elevated in all patients except for 2 with multiple endocrine neoplasma -IIA and 1 with familial non-MEN HPT, but both had elevated PTH levels. Alkaline phosphatase levels were significantly higher in children with documented bone involvement.

At presentation 41 patients were symptomatic and end-organ damage occurred in 23 patients. Thirty-four patients had a single adenoma; hyperplasia was identified in 16 patients, and of these cases, 57% occurred in patients diagnosed with MEN-I. Short-term complications included transient hypocalcemia in 29 patients and transient vocal cord paralysis in 2 patients. Long-term complications were significant for permanent hypocalcemia in 2 patients and no recurrent laryngeal nerve injuries. No parathyroid abnormalities were identified during exploration in 4 children. Long-term follow-up was achieved in 98% of patients for a mean and median of 13 years. Resolution of hypercalcemia was achieved in 94% of cases. Conclusion. The diagnosis of primary HPT in pediatric patients is frequently delayed, is commonly symptomatic, and has significant morbidity.

For children in whom HPT is suspected, evaluation of serum calcium and PTH levels is diagnostic in 100% of children. Parathyroid resection is effective at restoring normal serum calcium, has few complications, and is the treatment of choice for children with primary hyperparathyroidism. Comments.

### Progress report on multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 [^112VbvV5]. Familial Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical outcomes, the recurrence rate of PHPT in MEN1 is as high as 53% after an average ten-year follow-up, compared with up to 5% recurrence in the general population after surgery. Recurrence is 24% for ST and 13% for TP/AT, with 12% and 7% hypoparathyroidism rates for ST and TP/AT, respectively, and reoperation rates of 24% for ST and 7% for TP/AT. There is limited data on the optimal treatment of PHPT recurrence after surgery. The reoperation surgical approach includes neck exploration, with the possible advantage of measuring intraoperative PTH levels to assess adequate endocrine control. Another invasive option is ethanol ablation, with one study reporting reaching normocalcemia in 73% of patients for a mean duration of two years but with an 8% risk for hypoparathyroidism. Non-interventional treatment includes oral calcimimetics, with two randomized controlled trials of patients with MEN1 and PHPT demonstrating a significant reduction in serum calcium level and another study showing 32% serum calcium normalization in patients with PHPT recurrence. The threshold for surgical intervention, the choice of imaging modalities (if used at all), and the surgical approach varies between different centers and depends on local expertise. Further data are required to establish the optimal treatment approach for PHPT recurrence.

### Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1): recommendations and guidelines for best practice [^111uBPnN]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterised by combined occurrence of parathyroid tumours, duodenopancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, and anterior pituitary adenomas. Some patients might also develop thymic and bronchopulmonary neuroendocrine tumours, and adrenal tumours. MEN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the tumour-suppressor gene MEN1, which encodes a scaffold protein, menin. Without treatment, patients with MEN1 have high morbidity and premature mortality, which can be mitigated by early tumour detection and intervention. Identification of individuals at high risk for MEN1 can be facilitated by genetic testing of patients and their first-degree relatives, and undertaking periodic clinical, biochemical, and radiological screening in patients and MEN1 mutation carriers. However, no consensus exists regarding the optimal assessment and management of MEN1. To provide such recommendations, a multidisciplinary group was convened to undertake systematic reviews and a meta-analysis of the literature, and to use a Delphi approach for the development of consensus statements. 55 clinical recommendations were developed to guide clinicians, patients, and stakeholders about approaches for MEN1 in adults and children.

Due to the rarity of familial HPT and its different presentation within and between the familial syndromes and individual kindreds, treatment recommendations based on high levels of evidence cannot be made. However, based on the molecular genetic studies and case series from institutions with significant experience, important management principles (grade C recommendations) have been developed.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of the literature using evidence-based criteria.

Results

Issue 1: initial operation in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), a grade C recommendation can be made for subtotal parathyroidectomy. Issue 2: initial surgery in MEN 2A, a grade C recommendation can be made for excision of enlarged glands only. Issue 3: surgery in familial isolated HPT and HPT-jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome may be treated with parathyroidectomy that is subtotal or less, although the risk of parathyroid cancer in HPT-JT requires attention (no grade of recommendation). Issue 4: parathyroid surgery in familial HPT syndromes in the setting of underlying mutations in the calcium receptor (CASR) gene involves subtotal parathyroidectomy (no grade of recommendation). Issue 5: the use of intraoperative PTH measurements in familial HPT may guide the extent of parathyroid resection (no grade of recommendation).

Conclusions

The goals of parathyroidectomy in familial HPT are to achieve and maintain normocalcemia for the longest time possible, avoid both iatrogenic hypocalcemia and operative complications, and facilitate future surgery for recurrent disease.

### Preoperative multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 diagnosis improves the surgical outcomes of pediatric patients with primary hyperparathyroidism [^1128T5FU]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is uncommon in children. The surgical management of PHPT in children has evolved over the past two decades.

Methods

A retrospective study of patients who underwent parathyroidectomy for PHPT diagnosed at age < 18 years and managed at a tertiary referral center for endocrine and familial disorders.

Results

Thirty-eight patients met eligibility criteria (1981–2012). Median age at PHPT diagnosis was 15 years. Two-thirds of patients were symptomatic (68%, n = 26), most commonly from nephrolithiasis. Twenty-six (68%) patients underwent a standard cervical exploration while 32% underwent a focused unilateral parathyroidectomy. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) was diagnosed preoperatively in 22/26 patients. Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of MEN1 were more likely to undergo a complete initial operation (≥ 3 gland parathyroidectomy with transcervical thymectomy, 13/22, 59% vs. 0/4, 0%; P = 0.03) and less likely to have recurrent disease (10/22, 45% vs. 3/4, 75%; P < 0.001) during follow up than patients diagnosed postoperatively.

Conclusions

Children with PHPT should raise suspicion for MEN1. Preoperative MEN1 evaluation helped guide the extent of initial parathyroidectomy and was associated with lower rates of recurrence in sporadic and familial PHPT in pediatric patients. Management should occur at a high volume center with experienced clinicians and genetic counseling services.

### Clinical practice guidelines for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) [^116YrrFA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim was to provide guidelines for evaluation, treatment, and genetic testing for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).

Participants

The group, which comprised 10 experts, including physicians, surgeons, and geneticists from international centers, received no corporate funding or remuneration.

Process

Guidelines were developed by reviews of peer-reviewed publications; a draft was prepared, reviewed, and rigorously revised at several stages; and agreed-upon revisions were incorporated.

Conclusions

MEN1 is an autosomal dominant disorder that is due to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene MEN1, which encodes a 610-amino acid protein, menin. Thus, the finding of MEN1 in a patient has important implications for family members because first-degree relatives have a 50% risk of developing the disease and can often be identified by MEN1 mutational analysis. MEN1 is characterized by the occurrence of parathyroid, pancreatic islet, and anterior pituitary tumors. Some patients may also develop carcinoid tumors, adrenocortical tumors, meningiomas, facial angiofibromas, collagenomas, and lipomas. Patients with MEN1 have a decreased life expectancy, and the outcomes of current treatments, which are generally similar to those for the respective tumors occurring in non-MEN1 patients, are not as successful because of multiple tumors, which may be larger, more aggressive, and resistant to treatment, and the concurrence of metastases. The prognosis for MEN1 patients might be improved by presymptomatic tumor detection and undertaking treatment specific for MEN1 tumors. Thus, it is recommended that MEN1 patients and their families should be cared for by multidisciplinary teams comprising relevant specialists with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with endocrine tumors.

MEN1 mutational analysis in young patients with nonfamilial single endocrine tumors — occurrence rates of germline MEN1 mutations are 1% in sporadic, nonfamilial parathyroid adenomas, 5% in gastrinomas, 1% in prolactinomas, and 2% in foregut carcinoids; in sporadic parathyroid tumors before age 40 yr, only three of 36 patients had germline MEN1 mutations and all three had multigland disease, whereas the majority (~95%) without MEN1 mutations had solitary adenomas; we suggest performing MEN1 mutational testing in patients below 40 yr with primary hyperparathyroidism due to multigland disease, and we suggest that MEN1 mutational analysis should also be considered in those with gastrinoma or multiple pancreatic NET.

Surgical procedure considerations and outcomes in MEN2 children — When the "window of opportunity" is missed and neck lymph node dissection is required, immediate biochemical cure declines: "cure rates are only 57% to 31% with 1 to 10 node metastases and merely 0% to 4% with > 10 node metastases". These findings were "confirmed in a recent study in 79 children who received late genetic testing", where surgeries "were performed after the ages recommended by the guidelines, and they required cervical lymph node dissections, which resulted in more permanent hypoparathyroidism and reduced cure rates". Younger children are especially vulnerable, as "children aged 3 years and younger have higher vulnerability and more often develop transient and permanent hypoparathyroidism, particularly when they carry RET 918". To mitigate risk, the text notes that "it may be prudent to enlist a high-volume surgeon to apply optical magnification, bipolar forceps coagulation, and nerve-monitoring devices and to preserve the parathyroid glands in situ as much as possible".

### Clinical features of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 4: novel pathogenic variant and review of published cases [^113hoJwN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we report a large family with several individuals characterized by development of primary hyperparathyroidism and other endocrine tumors, and these features of MEN segregated with a pathogenic variant in CDKN1B over two generations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest family of patients with MEN4 reported to date. With 30 previously reported carriers of presumed pathogenic CDKN1B variants, our 13 cases in the present report expand our knowledge of the clinical presentation of MEN4 considerably.

The present and previous reports on the clinical presentation of MEN4 support that hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism develops in the majority of, if not all, patients with MEN4 (Tables 1 and 3). This is in accordance with the clinical presentation of MEN1, which is associated with an estimated penetrance of primary hyperparathyroidism of 90%. Primary hyperparathyroidism appears to be indolent in patients with MEN4, as mild hypercalcemia was observed in most of the cases. However, one case was hypercalcemic after subtotal parathyroidectomy, and recurrent primary hyperparathyroidism has previously been reported. The lowest age at diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism in the family reported in this study was 29 years (IV:17), but this specific manifestation of MEN4 has been diagnosed in a 15-year-old individual in a previous case report. However, information regarding the age of development of MEN4-related tumors is limited. Based on known cases, guidelines advocate that screening for primary hyperparathyroidism in patients with MEN1 is initiated at the age of 8 years. Pending further publication of clinical reports on the development of disease manifestations in patients with MEN4, it appears prudent to initiate screening of calcium and PTH levels in patients with MEN4 from the age of 15 years.

### Updated recommendations for pediatric surveillance in hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasias, hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, and Carney complex [^114s6dzB]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary endocrine neoplasia syndromes comprise multiple entities associated with increased risk for development of endocrine and non-endocrine neoplasms and other systemic manifestations. These syndromes typically demonstrate autosomal dominant inheritance, and each syndrome is associated with unique genetic predisposition to a distinct spectrum of tumor susceptibility. Moreover, genotype-phenotype associations within each syndrome may impact the spectrum, penetrance and age of onset of associated tumors. Since many endocrine tumors are benign and/or indolent, a careful approach to monitoring is necessary, wherein the nature, timing of initiation, and frequency of pre-symptomatic surveillance balances the goal of detecting tumors at a point where intervention would limit tumor-associated morbidity, against the physical, emotional and financial burdens of surveillance. Herein, we summarize changes in knowledge and practice recommendations related to children with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (types 1, 2A, 2B, 4 and 5), hyperparathyroidism jaw-tumor syndrome and Carney complex, since an initial summary in 2017. These updates reflect the evolving understanding of these complex genetic disorders and aim to improve patient care and outcomes.
