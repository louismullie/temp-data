## Question

What are the contraindications for VBAC?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the contraindications to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline anchors to frame absolute versus relative contraindications. Then, I should verify uterine scar-related factors that truly preclude VBAC. Next, I will review prior uterine surgery and rupture history. After that, I need to check the number of prior cesareans and how guidelines diverge. I will then examine general contraindications to vaginal birth that still apply. I should also consider special situations like twins, breech, and macrosomia. Finally, I will integrate facility and intrapartum requirements that, while not patient-level contraindications, are essential for safety and may functionally limit access to VBAC [^116UnbrQ] [^112Lmg29].

> Let me first confirm the anchor guidelines so I don't overstate anything. ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 205 and RCOG Green-top Guideline are the most authoritative sources for defining absolute contraindications and counseling frameworks, and FIGO's 2025 good practice recommendations provide contemporary international consensus and nuance, so I will lean on these to structure the list and reconcile any discrepancies [^112ZPkAP] [^116Z9fMa] [^112Lmg29].

> Now, I should verify uterine scar-related absolute contraindications because these drive the risk of catastrophic rupture. Prior classical cesarean incision, inverted T or J incisions, or any incision extending into the upper contractile segment are absolute contraindications to VBAC due to markedly elevated rupture risk; planned repeat cesarean is recommended in these cases, and I need to ensure I don't conflate low vertical incisions confined to the lower segment with classical incisions, as the latter is the critical distinction [^112Lmg29] [^113fA9Lc] [^116Z9fMa].

> Hold on, I should verify the stance on prior uterine rupture and extensive transfundal surgery. Prior uterine rupture is an absolute contraindication to VBAC across ACOG and RCOG, and extensive transfundal uterine surgery, such as a full-thickness myomectomy entering the cavity, is also considered a contraindication because of compromised myometrial integrity; I need to ensure I include both rupture history and extensive transfundal procedures explicitly [^113fA9Lc] [^116Z9fMa].

> Next, I will examine the number of prior cesareans, and I should double-check the evolving guidance. Initially, I thought two prior cesareans might be an absolute contraindication, but wait, let me verify the current consensus: FIGO notes that while VBAC is generally not recommended after two prior cesareans, in highly selected women with prior vaginal birth and appropriate resources, VBAC may be considered after thorough counseling; ACOG similarly allows TOLAC after two prior low-transverse cesareans in appropriate candidates, whereas three or more prior cesareans are typically not recommended for VBAC due to limited safety data, so I should correct my earlier absolutist framing and present this as a relative contraindication with stringent selection criteria [^112Lmg29] [^112Uib77] [^111RxSVc].

> I need to ensure I cover general contraindications to vaginal birth that remain operative regardless of prior cesarean. Placenta previa with complete coverage, active genital herpes, transverse lie, and other mechanical or infectious contraindications to vaginal delivery preclude VBAC as well; I should confirm that these are consistently listed across guideline-based exclusion criteria in VBAC studies and protocols [^113fz1ag] [^1155kaGZ] [^116Z9fMa].

> Let me consider special situations that are not absolute contraindications but warrant caution and careful counseling. Twin gestation is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC; success rates are comparable to singletons in selected settings, though neonatal risks may differ, so shared decision-making and continuous monitoring are essential. Breech presentation is not an absolute contraindication either, and external cephalic version can be considered in appropriate candidates. Suspected fetal macrosomia alone is not a contraindication, but estimated fetal weight above 4500 g increases the likelihood of failed VBAC and may shift the balance toward planned repeat cesarean after counseling; I should confirm these thresholds and emphasize individualized risk assessment [^112Lmg29] [^112F8tCb] [^115AHvsb].

> But wait, what about facility and intrapartum requirements that, while not patient-level contraindications, are indispensable for safe VBAC. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring, one-to-one nursing, immediate availability of surgical and anesthesia teams, and blood products are standard-of-care prerequisites; home birth is contraindicated for TOLAC, and epidural analgesia is not contraindicated and may be used. I should also flag that misoprostol for cervical ripening or induction is contraindicated in the third trimester due to increased rupture risk, whereas mechanical methods or oxytocin, used judiciously, are acceptable with counseling about increased rupture risk during induction [^112Lmg29] [^116dcdXx] [^113bok9X].

> Let me synthesize a practical categorization to avoid ambiguity. Absolute contraindications include prior classical, inverted T or J incisions, prior uterine rupture, extensive transfundal uterine surgery, and any standard contraindication to vaginal birth such as complete placenta previa or transverse lie. Relative contraindications, where VBAC may be considered only with exceptional counseling and full resource readiness, include two prior cesareans with favorable factors, unknown scar type with high suspicion of classical incision, and interdelivery interval shorter than 18 months, which increases rupture risk though it is not an absolute barrier. I should confirm that this framing aligns with ACOG, RCOG, and FIGO positions before concluding [^113fA9Lc] [^116Z9fMa] [^112Lmg29].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have not overlooked any commonly cited but incorrect "contraindications". Single-layer closure of a prior low-segment transverse incision is not an absolute contraindication, diabetes is not a contraindication though it may reduce success, and advanced maternal age alone is not a contraindication; these factors influence probability of success and risk but do not preclude a trial of labor after appropriate counseling and risk stratification [^112Lmg29] [^116784gk].

---

Absolute contraindications to VBAC include **prior classical or T-shaped uterine incision** [^113fA9Lc], **previous uterine rupture** [^116Z9fMa], and **inadequate surgical resources** for emergency cesarean delivery [^111f11pu]. Relative contraindications include **two prior cesareans without prior vaginal delivery** [^112Lmg29], **interdelivery interval < 18 months** [^notfound], and **estimated fetal weight ≥ 4,500 g** [^112Lmg29]. VBAC is generally safe after one low transverse cesarean [^112Lmg29] if no contraindications are present, but careful counseling and continuous fetal monitoring are essential [^112Lmg29].

---

## Absolute contraindications

Absolute contraindications are conditions in which VBAC should **not be attempted** due to unacceptably high risks of maternal and neonatal complications [^113fA9Lc].

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Prior classical (upper segment) uterine incision or T-shaped incision | Increased risk of uterine rupture (approximately 4–9%) [^112Lmg29] |
| Previous uterine rupture | Extremely high risk of recurrence (approximately 4–12%) [^113fA9Lc] |
| Inadequate surgical resources for emergency cesarean delivery | Lack of immediate access to emergency cesarean delivery increases maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality [^112Lmg29] [^116dcdXx] |

---

## Relative contraindications

Relative contraindications are conditions in which VBAC may be considered only under **careful counseling and with appropriate resources** due to increased risks.

| **Condition** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Two prior cesarean deliveries without prior vaginal delivery | Increased risk of uterine rupture and failed VBAC [^112Lmg29] [^1128CgBr] |
| Interdelivery interval < 18 months | Higher risk of uterine rupture and failed VBAC [^112Lmg29] [^111rCAzv] |
| Estimated fetal weight ≥ 4,500 g | Increased risk of shoulder dystocia, uterine rupture, and failed VBAC [^112Lmg29] [^112thLJ7] |
| Maternal obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²) | Higher risk of failed VBAC and complications [^112thLJ7] [^113DKkrf] |
| Maternal age ≥ 40 years | Increased risk of failed VBAC and uterine rupture [^113DKkrf] [^112thLJ7] |

## Conditions requiring careful consideration and counseling

Certain conditions are **not absolute contraindications** but require careful consideration, thorough counseling, and close monitoring during labor [^112Lmg29].

- **Two prior cesarean deliveries with prior vaginal delivery**: May be considered in highly selected cases with appropriate resources and counseling [^112Lmg29] [^112Uib77].
- **Twin gestation**: Not an absolute contraindication, but requires careful monitoring due to increased risk of uterine rupture [^112Lmg29] [^112F8tCb].
- **Breech presentation**: External cephalic version may be attempted if conditions are favorable [^112Lmg29].
- **Induction of labor**: Mechanical methods (e.g. transcervical Foley catheter) are preferred; misoprostol is contraindicated due to increased risk of uterine rupture [^112Lmg29] [^113bok9X].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **VBAC is generally safe and recommended** for women with one prior low transverse cesarean delivery, provided there are no contraindications [^116784gk] [^112Lmg29].
- **Absolute contraindications** include prior classical or T-shaped incision, previous uterine rupture, and inadequate surgical resources [^113fA9Lc] [^116Z9fMa].
- **Relative contraindications** include two prior cesareans without prior vaginal delivery, short interdelivery interval, macrosomia, maternal obesity, and advanced maternal age [^112Lmg29] [^112thLJ7].
- **Careful counseling, individualized risk assessment, and continuous fetal monitoring** are essential for safe VBAC attempts [^112ZPkAP] [^112Lmg29].

---

VBAC is a **safe alternative** to repeat cesarean delivery for appropriately selected women, but **careful patient selection, counseling, and monitoring** are essential to minimize risks and optimize outcomes [^112ZPkAP] [^112Lmg29].

The rising global rate of cesarean section (CS) has prompted renewed focus on vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) as a safe and effective alternative to repeat CS in properly selected women. The FIGO good practice recommendations provide evidence-based recommendations to guide VBAC care. Success rates for VBAC range from 60% to 80%, with the highest likelihood in women with prior vaginal birth, non-recurrent CS indications, interbirth intervals ≥ 18months, BMI < 30kg/m 2, and spontaneous labor onset. While uterine rupture is the primary concern, its risk remains low at approximately 0.3%-0.7% for women with one prior low transverse CS. Comparisons show that VBAC generally results in similar or better maternal and neonatal outcomes than planned repeat CS, including lower maternal mortality, fewer infections, and shorter hospital stays. This article emphasizes appropriate patient counseling, facility readiness for emergency CS, and continuous fetal monitoring during labor. With proper implementation, VBAC offers a valuable strategy to reduce unnecessary repeat surgeries, improve outcomes, and support informed maternal choice.

8 SUMMARY OF FIGO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR VBAC

Fetal macrosomia Fetal macrosomia alone is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC, but women with macrosomic fetuses planning VBAC should be counseled regarding the higher likelihood of failure and possible increased risk of uterine rupture. While VBAC can potentially be offered up to an estimated fetal weight of 4500 g, a fetal weight of ≥ 4000 g increases the likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC. Planned repeat CS should be offered when estimated fetal weight is > 4500 g. Favorable factors that increase the likelihood of success in women with suspected fetal macrosomia undergoing VBAC include one previous low transverse CS for a non‐recurrent indication, a prior vaginal birth and prior VBAC, singleton pregnancy, cephalic presentation, term gestation, and spontaneous onset of labor.
Number of previous cesarean sections 5 Women with a single previous CS may be offered VBAC in the absence of any contraindication to vaginal birth. This should be accompanied by appropriate counseling and close intrapartum monitoring. 6 VBAC is generally not recommended after two previous CSs. However, if a woman with two prior CSs and a vaginal birth strongly desires a VBAC, the patient should receive thorough counseling from a senior obstetrician on the associated risks and potential complications, including the increased likelihood of VBAC failure, cesarean birth, and uterine rupture. If the patient still wishes to consider VBAC, this option may be available in some high‐resource facilities. These facilities must have the following prerequisites: one‐to‐one nursing/midwifery care. continuous fetal monitoring. on‐site availability of blood products and transfusion services. immediate access to surgical theater facilities. presence of a surgeon capable of performing emergency hysterectomy on site. 7 There are limited data on the risks of uterine rupture and overall safety to recommend VBAC in women with three or more previous CSs. Therefore, a planned repeat CS is recommended at three or more previous CSs.
Type of uterine incision for previous cesarean section 8 VBAC is safe and associated with low absolute risks of uterine rupture in women with a previous low transverse or low vertical uterine incision (usually described as a vertical incision on the lower (non‐contractile) uterine segment). 9 VBAC is contraindicated in women with previous classical CS (a vertical incision on the upper (contractile) uterine segment), inverted T or J incisions, and previous incisions that extend into the upper uterine segment. A planned repeat CS is recommended in these cases due to the higher risk of uterine rupture.
Method of closure of uterine incision at previous cesarean section 10 Single‐layer closure of a previous low‐segment CS is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC.
Interbirth interval 11 An interbirth interval of at least 18 months is recommended for VBAC for optimal maternal and neonatal outcomes. 12 Women with an interbirth interval of < 18 months who are attempting VBAC should be counseled on the higher likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC and adverse outcomes.
Prediction of uterine rupture and VBAC success 13 Routine use of antenatal lower uterine segment thickness measurements for the prediction of uterine rupture in women undergoing VBAC is not recommended, as no ideal thickness cutoff value has been defined for clinical use. Clinical applicability of lower uterine segment thickness measurement in counseling patients whether to attempt VBAC needs to be assessed in prospective observational studies using a standardized method of measurement. 14 Routine use of prediction models to predict VBAC success is not recommended as many of the models lack external validation and are at high risk of bias, hindering generalizability and applicability.
Multiple pregnancy 15 Twin pregnancy is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC. 16 VBAC can be a safe alternative to a planned repeat CS in women with twin gestation and a history of one previous CS with a low transverse incision in the presence of other favorable factors for VBAC, with careful counseling and monitoring. 17 A planned repeat CS is recommended for women with higher order multiple pregnancy with a previous CS.
Breech presentation and external cephalic version 18 Breech presentation is not an absolute contraindication to VBAC in women with a single fetus in breech presentation and a history of one previous low transverse CS, who are otherwise good candidates for VBAC. 19 External cephalic version can be safely attempted in women with a singleton breech presenting fetus and a prior low transverse uterine incision, who are good candidates for VBAC and external cephalic version.
Induction and augmentation of labor during VBAC 20 Induction of labor is not contraindicated in women with one previous low uterine incision, who are otherwise good candidates for VBAC. 21 Women should be well informed that induction of labor is associated with a lower VBAC success, as well as increased risk of uterine rupture. 22 When indicated in women with a previous CS, induction of labor should be performed between 39 and 41 weeks of gestation to increase the chances of success and minimize the risk of uterine rupture. 23 Mechanical methods such as amniotomy and transcervical Foley catheter are recommended for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS. 24 Misoprostol (prostaglandin E 1) should not be used for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS because it is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture. Prostaglandins can be considered if labor induction is indicated in the second trimester. 25 Use of oxytocin for induction of labor or augmentation of labor is not contraindicated in women undergoing VBAC. It should, however, be used cautiously and women should be counseled on the increased risk of uterine rupture.
Assisted vaginal birth during VBAC 26 In carefully selected women undergoing VBAC, a trial of low forceps or outlet forceps, or vacuum, may be attempted by a skilled obstetrician in an operating theater, where immediate recourse to CS can be undertaken, in case of any complication. This is discussed in detail, with recommendations for practice, in an upcoming paper on assisted vaginal birth from the FIGO Committee on Childbirth and PPH.
Facility requirements and intrapartum care during VBAC 28 VBAC should only be performed in facilities with resources for 24‐h emergency CS, blood bank, and NICU backup owing to associated maternal and neonatal risks. 29 Supportive one‐to‐one midwifery/nursing care in labor and continuous electronic fetal monitoring are recommended, as fetal heart rate abnormality is the most common sign of uterine rupture. 30 Epidural analgesia is not contraindicated during VBAC. 31 The same standards and recommendations for evaluating labor progress in women without a previous CS apply to women undergoing VBAC. 32 Routine uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended in a hemodynamically stable patient with no abnormal vaginal bleeding. 33 Surgical repair of asymptomatic uterine scar dehiscence suspected by uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended.

### Factors associated with successful vaginal birth after a cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113fz1ag]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Inclusion criteria

The target population of the study included women of child-bearing ages, with a single gestation and, one previous cesarean delivery, and that were candidates for attempted vaginal birth.

The following criteria were required for eligibility: 1) mean and SD of the continuous factors and N in women with successful VBAC and failed VBAC, or 2) unadjusted and/ or adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the binary factors in women with successful VBAC and failed VBAC, or 3) raw N for the 2*2 tables to calculate the OR and 95% CI for the binary factors in women with successful VBAC and failed VBAC.

Exclusion criteria

We excluded women with more than one previous cesarean delivery; known previous classical uterine incision or T-incision, prior uterine rupture, or extensive transfundal uterine surgery, multiple gestations, and those in whom vaginal delivery is otherwise contraindicated (e.g., those with placenta previa).

Data extraction

Two authors (YW and YK) examined studies on the basis of inclusion and exclusion. Studies were initially reviewed on titles and abstracts, and those deemed relevant were reviewed in full text. Disparities in selection were resolved through discussion and ultimately by the third reviewer (CE). In cases of study duplication, the more recent studies were selected for inclusion. Data were extracted by two authors (YW and YK) to verify the accuracy.

Assessment of risk of bias

The quality of each study was evaluated and scored independently by two authors (YW and CE) using the nine-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Studies were evaluated based on selection, comparability, exposure, and outcome, and scored by a maximum of nine points. Scores above five indicate moderate to high study quality. The NOS for cohort and case-control studies was retrieved from:

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^114JH54y]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Background

For women who have a caesarean section in their preceding pregnancy, two care policies for birth are considered standard: planned vaginal birth and planned elective repeat caesarean. Currently available information about the benefits and harms of both forms of care are derived from retrospective and prospective cohort studies. There have been no randomised trials, and recognising the deficiencies in the literature, there have been calls for methodologically rigorous studies to assess maternal and infant health outcomes associated with both care policies. The aims of our study are to assess in women with a previous caesarean birth, who are eligible in the subsequent pregnancy for a vaginal birth, whether a policy of planned vaginal birth after caesarean compared with a policy of planned repeat caesarean affects the risk of serious complications for the woman and her infant.

Design

Multicentered patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial.

Inclusion Criteria

Women with a single prior caesarean presenting in their next pregnancy with a single, live fetus in cephalic presentation, who have reached 37 weeks gestation, and who do not have a contraindication to a planned VBAC. Trial Entry & Randomisation: Eligible women will be given an information sheet during pregnancy, and will be recruited to the study from 37 weeks gestation after an obstetrician has confirmed eligibility for a planned vaginal birth. Written informed consent will be obtained. Women who consent to the patient preference study will be allocated their preference for either planned VBAC or planned, elective repeat caesarean. Women who consent to the randomised trial will be randomly allocated to either the planned vaginal birth after caesarean or planned elective repeat caesarean group. Treatment Groups: Women in the planned vaginal birth group will await spontaneous onset of labour whilst appropriate. Women in the elective repeat caesarean group will have this scheduled for between 38 and 40 weeks. Primary Study Outcome: Serious adverse infant outcome (death or serious morbidity).

Sample Size

2314 women in the patient preference study to show a difference in adverse neonatal outcome from 1.6% to 3.6% (p = 0.05, 80% power).

### Predicting the likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^112BeZtz]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Vaginal delivery after Cesarean section score (VBAC score)" for labor dystocia, induction of labor and vaginal delivery.

The VBAC score, or Vaginal Birth After Cesarean section score, is a clinical calculator used in obstetrics. It is specifically designed for pregnant women who have had a previous cesarean section and are considering a trial of labor for their current pregnancy. The VBAC score helps to predict the likelihood of a successful vaginal delivery, which can aid in shared decision-making between the patient and healthcare provider.

The score takes into account various factors including maternal age, body mass index (BMI), gestational age, history of vaginal delivery, and the indication for the previous cesarean section. The higher the score, the greater the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after cesarean.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the VBAC score may include contraindications to vaginal delivery such as placenta previa, active herpes infection, or a transverse lie of the fetus. Additionally, it may not be applicable in cases where the previous cesarean section was performed due to a non-recurring indication (e.g., breech presentation).

The VBAC score calculator is designed to assess the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after a previous Cesarean delivery by evaluating five key factors related to a woman's medical and delivery history. Each factor is assigned a specific numerical value based on predefined criteria, which collectively contribute to a total score. This score serves as an indicator of the probability of successfully having a vaginal birth after a Cesarean.

The scoring criteria for each factor are as follows:

- Maternal age less than 40 years:

- Yes: 2 points
- No: 0 points

- Vaginal birth history:

- Vaginal birth before and after the first cesarean delivery: 4 points
- Vaginal birth after the first cesarean delivery: 2 points
- Vaginal birth before the first cesarean delivery: 1 point
- No previous vaginal birth: 0 points

- Reason for first cesarean delivery other than failure to progress:

- Yes: 1 point
- No: 0 points

- Cervical effacement at admission:

- Greater than 75%: 2 points
- Between 25% and 75%: 1 point
- Less than 25%: 0 points

- Cervical dilation of 4 cm or more at admission:

- Yes: 1 point
- No: 0 points

The total score is the sum of the points from each factor, with a possible range from 0 to 10. This total score translates into the probability of a successful VBAC, as interpreted below:

- A score between 0 and 2 suggests a 49% chance of successful VBAC.
- A score of 3 indicates a 60% probability.
- A score of 4 corresponds to a 67% probability.
- A score of 5 signifies a 77% probability.
- A score of 6 suggests an 88% probability.
- A score of 7 corresponds to a 93% probability.
- A score of 8 or higher indicates a 95% probability of success.

The calculator provides both the computed score and its corresponding interpretation to give a clear understanding of the likelihood of a successful vaginal birth after Cesarean, enabling informed decision-making.

9 CONCLUSION

VBAC can be an effective way to reduce the rising global CS rate. It can be performed with low absolute maternal and neonatal risks after one previous CS, in the absence of contraindications to VBAC and vaginal birth.

Maternal and neonatal outcomes of VBAC after one CS are comparable with planned repeat CS according to available current literature, and VBAC has the advantage of obviating the short‐ and long‐term risks of repeat CS.

In the presence of favorable factors, success rates of VBAC range from 60% to 80%, with a previous vaginal birth (particularly a VBAC) being the single best predictor of success.

Measures to safely increase VBAC attempt rates should be pursued globally, to stem the increasing tide of CS rates worldwide, and to ensure women have access to truly informed choice and decision‐making.

7 REQUIREMENTS FOR VBAC

These include antenatal assessment and counseling, infrastructure and setting, and intrapartum management.

7.1 Antenatal assessment and counseling

Review of the operative notes from the previous CS is important so that clinicians are aware of the indication for the CS, location, type, and method of closure of the uterine incision. The obstetric history and antenatal records of the patient should also be reviewed to exclude any contraindications to VBAC and vaginal birth. The patient should be thoroughly counseled on the risks and benefits of VBAC versus planned repeat CS. The chance of a successful VBAC and the risk of uterine rupture should be evaluated before deciding whether to attempt VBAC. Several prediction models for VBAC success exist but many lack external validation and are at high risk of bias, hindering generalizability and applicability.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^112ZPkAP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) refers to a planned attempt to deliver vaginally by a woman who has had a previous cesarean delivery, regardless of the outcome. This method provides women who desire a vaginal delivery the possibility of achieving that goal-a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level, VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies as well as a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate at the population level (). However, although TOLAC is appropriate for many women, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which in turn is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity when compared with a successful trial of labor (ie, VBAC) and elective repeat cesarean delivery (). Therefore, assessing the likelihood of VBAC as well as the individual risks is important when determining who is an appropriate candidate for TOLAC. Thus, the purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and to provide practical guidelines for counseling and management of patients who will attempt to give birth vaginally after a previous cesarean delivery.

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines. guidelines for vaginal birth after previous caesarean birth. number 155 (replaces guideline number 147), February 2005 [^116784gk]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide evidence-based guidelines for the provision of a trial of labor (TOL) after Caesarean section.

Outcome

Fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality associated with vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC) and repeat Caesarean section.

Evidence

MEDLINE database was searched for articles published from January 1, 1995, to February 28, 2004, using the key words "vaginal birth after Caesarean (Cesarean) section". The quality of evidence is described using the Evaluation of Evidence criteria outlined in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Exam.

Recommendations

1. Provided there are no contraindications, a woman with 1 previous transverse low-segment Caesarean section should be offered a trial of labor (TOL) with appropriate discussion of maternal and perinatal risks and benefits. The process of informed consent with appropriate documentation should be an important part of the birth plan in a woman with a previous Caesarean section (II-2B). 2. The intention of a woman undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section should be clearly stated, and documentation of the previous uterine scar should be clearly marked on the prenatal record (II-2B). 3. For a safe labor after Caesarean section, a woman should deliver in a hospital where a timely Caesarean section is available. The woman and her health care provider must be aware of the hospital resources and the availability of obstetric, anesthetic, pediatric, and operating-room staff (II-2A). 4. Each hospital should have a written policy in place regarding the notification and (or) consultation for the physicians responsible for a possible timely Caesarean section (III-B). 5. In the case of a TOL after Caesarean, an approximate time frame of 30 min should be considered adequate in the set-up of an urgent laparotomy (IIIC). 6. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring of women attempting a TOL after Caesarean section is recommended (II-2A). 7. Suspected uterine rupture requires urgent attention and expedited laparotomy to attempt to decrease maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality (II-2A). 8. Oxytocin augmentation is not contraindicated in women undergoing a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 9. Medical induction of labor with oxytocin may be associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should be used carefully after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 10. Medical induction of labor with prostaglandin E2 (dinoprostone) is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture and should not be used except in rare circumstances and after appropriate counseling (II-2B). 11. Prostaglandin E1 (misoprostol) is associated with a high risk of uterine rupture and should not be used as part of a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 12. A foley catheter may be safely used to ripen the cervix in a woman planning a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2A). 13. The available data suggest that a trial of labor in women with more than 1 previous Caesarean section is likely to be successful but is associated with a higher risk of uterine rupture (II-2B). 14. Multiple gestation is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 15. Diabetes mellitus is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 16. Suspected fetal macrosomia is not a contraindication to TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 17. Women delivering within 18–24 months of a Caesarean section should be counseled about an increased risk of uterine rupture in labor (II-2B). 18. Postdatism is not a contraindication to a TOL after Caesarean section (II-2B). 19. Every effort should be made to obtain the previous Caesarean section operative report to determine the type of uterine incision used. In situations where the scar is unknown, information concerning the circumstances of the previous delivery is helpful in determining the likelihood of a low transverse incision. If the likelihood of a lower transverse incision is high, a TOL after Caesarean section can be offered (II-2B).

Validation

These guidelines were approved by the Clinical Practice Obstetrics and Executive Committees of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada.

### Evaluating professional society guidelines on vaginal birth after cesarean [^1148XRmh]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective was to compare national guidelines regarding vaginal birth after cesarean. Along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists practice bulletin, guidelines from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada were reviewed and compared. Although the 3 organizations agree on most of the risk factors for uterine rupture and failed vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC), there were some variances in the recommendations to women with 2 previous cesareans and those who required oxytocin augmentation. A disagreement was also present in regard to the availability and requirement of resources to allow a trial of labor after a previous cesarean. Although concerns could be raised about how the literature is synthesized, the 3 organizations recognized the potential biases in published reports and the lack of randomized trials.

### VBAC – is it worth the risk? [^115MbbGL]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Enthusiasm for vaginal birth after cesarean section has waned. As a result, the cesarean birth rate is again on the rise. As a medical community and society we must decide whether the most appropriate question is "What is safest for my baby?" or "Is the risk associated with vaginal birth after cesarean acceptable?" There are risks associated with vaginal birth after cesarean, but in a hospital setting with appropriate resources these risks are low and would still seem to be acceptable.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^1155kaGZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Methods/Design

Study Design

Multicentred patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial.

Inclusion Criteria

Women with a single prior caesarean presenting in their next pregnancy with a single, live fetus in cephalic presentation, who have reached 37 weeks gestation, and who do not have a contraindication to a planned VBAC are eligible.

Exclusion Criteria

Women with any of the following are ineligible: more than one prior caesarean birth, vertical, inverted T or unknown uterine incision, previous uterine rupture, previous uterine surgery (including hysterotomy or previous myomectomy involving entry of the uterine cavity or excessive myometrial dissection), previous uterine perforation, multiple pregnancy, any contraindication to vaginal birth (including placenta praevia, transverse lie, active genital herpes infection), cephalo-pelvic disproportion as judged by the clinician, lethal congenital anomaly, fetal anomaly associated with mechanical difficulties at birth (such as hydrops, fetal ascites, hydrocephalus, omphalocele or cystic hygroma).

The inclusion/exclusion criteria are based on guidelines recommended by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement, and the National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness, UK.

Trial Entry

Ethical approval for this study has been obtained from each of the participating collaborating hospitals. Women at the collaborating hospitals who may be eligible for the study will be given the study information sheet during their pregnancy and a copy of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists information pamphlets 'Vaginal birth after caesarean section – a guide for women' and 'Caesarean birth'. Women will discuss their birth options with their primary caregiver.

Written information that contains a brief summary of the benefits and risks of vaginal birth and elective repeat caesarean given to women with a prior caesarean has been shown to be as effective as a more detailed prenatal education and support program on the proportion of women having a planned VBAC. To maximise the likelihood that women will receive their planned choice for birth care or care allocated at randomisation, eligible women can be recruited from 37 weeks gestation onwards. As it is important to ensure that women in the 'restricted' prospective study who choose a planned elective repeat caesarean would have been eligible for a planned VBAC an obstetrician will confirm that the woman is eligible for a planned vaginal birth at the time of study entry.

Shared decision-making

For women with a previous CD, the decision to proceed with a repeat cesarean section or attempt a vaginal delivery will be based on multiple factors. First steps in the decision-making process should be consultation with a healthcare provider regarding maternal and neonatal benefits and risks, for both VBAC (induction/spontaneous onset of labor) and scheduled CD options. Triaging women for VBAC (i.e. women without contraindications) must include maternal characteristics and obstetric history to assist in the prediction of a successful vaginal delivery. Family planning plays a key role. Women who have had one or more prior cesarean deliveries may opt for a trial of vaginal birth or elect to have another CD; this maternal decision impacts future pregnancies and delivery due to the increased risk of abnormal placentation secondary to the additional uterine surgeries. Unexpected severe adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (e.g. maternal mortality) are important for patient-level counselling and decision-making.

Each woman should be given the opportunity to be counselled early in pregnancy on her available options, with provision of written or on-line patient information literature (e.g. VBAC clinical care pathway, decision aids) to help inform decision-making throughout her pregnancy for optimal delivery outcomes and patient satisfaction.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 205 summary: vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^1171wqxN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) refers to a planned attempt to deliver vaginally by a woman who has had a previous cesarean delivery, regardless of the outcome. This method provides women who desire a vaginal delivery the possibility of achieving that goal-a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level, VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies as well as a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate at the population level (1–3). However, although TOLAC is appropriate for many women, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which in turn is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity when compared with a successful trial of labor (ie, VBAC) and elective repeat cesarean delivery (4–6). Therefore, assessing the likelihood of VBAC as well as the individual risks is important when determining who is an appropriate candidate for TOLAC. Thus, the purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and to provide practical guidelines for counseling and management of patients who will attempt to give birth vaginally after a previous cesarean delivery.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^111RxSVc]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based guidelines comparison from the US (2010 version), Canada (2005 version) and United Kingdom (2007 version) show similarities and differences in recommendations for VBAC process. Uterine rupture is identified as the most serious complication among women attempting a trial of labor; however, there is recognition that differences in the definition may contribute to the reported incidence rates. With regards to induction of labor, all three guidelines agree that induction and augmentation of labor is an option for women attempting a VBAC, but there is an increased risk of uterine rupture with inappropriate use of oxytocin. Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and SOGC recommend against PGE1 for the same outcome, with the SOGC guideline recommending PGE2 only in rare circumstances. All three guidelines agree that women with a history of one or two uncomplicated low-transverse CD and no contraindications to VBAC should be educated, counselled and offered a TOLAC. The SOGC's updated guidelines (July 2019) continue to support the previous recommendation of offering women (without contraindications) the option of a TOLAC. The new guideline provides details on the likelihood of VBAC (greater among women with spontaneous labor, lower among women with factors that negatively affect this likelihood), the risk of uterine rupture (baseline risk of 0.47% among women with a prior CD; higher relative risk of uterine rupture, but low absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; risk greatest for women over 40 weeks of gestation; use of fetal monitoring is recommended as an indicator of the presence of uterine rupture), risk of other outcomes (higher relative risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity, but lower absolute risks for women attempting TOLAC compared with elective repeat cesarean section; higher relative risk of maternal death for elective cesarean section), and recommends against using ultrasonographic measurements of the lower uterine segment to counsel patients on the possibility of a TOLAC.

Number of previous cesarean sections

Whereas a history of two previous CSs is often regarded as an absolute contraindication to VBAC, more recent evidence suggests that women — in highly selected cases — with two prior CSs may be considered for an attempt at VBAC if there is appropriate emergency obstetric care immediately available, in a high‐resource setting, and where the woman herself has a strong conviction and is well‐informed about the associated risks.

A retrospective cohort study compared outcomes between 82 women with two prior CSs who attempted VBAC (including those with a previous vaginal birth) and 711 women with two prior CSs who underwent planned repeat CS. In the attempted VBAC group, 69.5% achieved a successful vaginal birth. In comparison to those who had an unsuccessful VBAC, women who had a successful VBAC had a lower mean BMI at admission (31.0 kg/m 2 vs. 34.5 kg/m 2; P = 0.04), lower mean neonatal birth weight (3351 g vs. 3681 g; P = 0.01), and a higher likelihood of a previous vaginal birth and a previous successful VBAC. Induction or augmentation of labor was associated with a greater likelihood of unsuccessful VBAC. There was one case of uterine rupture in the VBAC group (1/82) and none in the planned repeat CS group (0/711). However, there was one unplanned hysterectomy in the planned repeat CS group. Maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality were not significantly different between the groups.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 115: vaginal birth after previous cesarean delivery [^117ACKLh]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Trial of labor after previous cesarean delivery (TOLAC)* provides women who desire a vaginal delivery with the possibility of achieving that goal — a vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). In addition to fulfilling a patient's preference for vaginal delivery, at an individual level VBAC is associated with decreased maternal morbidity and a decreased risk of complications in future pregnancies. At a population level, VBAC also is associated with a decrease in the overall cesarean delivery rate (1, 2). Although TOLAC is appropriate for many women with a history of a cesarean delivery, several factors increase the likelihood of a failed trial of labor, which compared with VBAC, is associated with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity (3–5). Assessment of individual risks and the likelihood of VBAC is, therefore, important in determining who are appropriate candidates for TOLAC. The purpose of this document is to review the risks and benefits of TOLAC in various clinical situations and provide practical guidelines for managing and counseling patients who will give birth after a previous cesarean delivery.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^1148Eb56]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Planned Vaginal Birth After Caesarean Group

Women who plan to have a vaginal birth or are randomised to this care group will await the spontaneous onset of labour, whilst appropriate. At the time of onset of labour the woman should be reassessed as to her eligibility for a planned VBAC. If a complication arises necessitating caesarean section (eg fetal distress) or if exclusion criteria for a vaginal birth occur after study entry (eg malpresentation or suspected cephalopelvic disproportion due to increased fetal size) a caesarean should be undertaken. The guidelines for intrapartum care for women in the planned VBAC group are based on those recommended by the SOGC, ACOG, RCOG.) and NICE. Other aspects of care will follow the institutional guidelines at the hospital. Hospitals agreed to follow the following care recommendations.

Induction of labour

The need for induction of labour for medical or obstetric indications will be assessed and determined by the obstetrician caring for the woman. If induction is considered necessary, this will be performed according to the local hospital guidelines where the woman has planned to give birth. The judicious use of oxytocin is not contraindicated in the presence of a previous caesarean but requires close monitoring. The guidelines issued by the RCOG on induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean highlight a sparsity of data specifically reporting the use of prostaglandin preparations in women with a previous caesarean, thereby precluding an ability to make specific recommendations for clinical care.). The risk of uterine rupture is higher after an induced labour and highest after induction with prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E 2 gel for induction is therefore not recommended for use for women in this study.

Augmentation of labour

The judicious use of oxytocin for augmentation of labour is not contraindicated in the presence of a prior caesarean section but requires close monitoring.

Fetal heart rate monitoring

All women undergoing a planned VBAC are advised to have continuous fetal heart rate monitoring as recommended in the RCOG guidelines for the use of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring. The presence of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing will be managed by performing fetal scalp pH sampling when clinically possible, or emergency caesarean as appropriate.

Analgesia/Anaesthesia

Analgesia and anaesthesia should be available according to the woman's choice. Epidural analgesia may be used as requested.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cesarean section (CS) rates are increasing globally and are expected to continue to increase unless intervening measures are taken. It is projected that by 2030, nearly 30% of women globally will give birth by CS. In many countries, primarily in urban areas, primary CS on maternal request, supported by obstetricians, is increasing in frequency. Primary CS is considered a rapid and safe procedure, with favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes; however, as with any other surgical procedure, CS does carry short‐ and long‐term risks for the mother, baby, and subsequent pregnancies. These risks include severe maternal morbidities (hemorrhage requiring hysterectomy or blood transfusion, uterine rupture, anesthetic complications, shock, cardiac arrest, acute renal failure, assisted ventilation, venous thromboembolism, major infection, or in‐hospital wound disruption or hematoma), which are increased three‐fold for CS compared with vaginal birth. The incidence of placenta accreta spectrum increases with each subsequent CS, from 1% with one prior CS to 3% with three or more prior CSs. After three CSs, the risk that placenta previa will be complicated by placenta accreta is almost 40%.

Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) avoids repeat CS and the associated potential short‐ and long‐term risks. VBAC is generally attempted after one previous CS; however, it may be considered after two prior CSs in carefully selected patients. Four key components of VBAC counseling include the individualized risk of uterine rupture, the individualized likelihood of successful VBAC (or risk of intrapartum CS), a patient's future reproductive plans, and patient preference. These components are discussed in these good practice recommendations, which take into account the complexities of VBAC and language sensitivities. The term "trial of labor after cesarean" (TOLAC) has not been used, following feedback from women that this can be perceived as offensive. To provide clarity on the outcomes of VBAC, these are referred to as "successful" and "unsuccessful".

### Quality initiative to reduce failed trial of labor after cesarean using calculated VBAC success likelihood [^116yUkoH]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vaginal birth after cesarean can reduce morbidity associated with multiple cesarean deliveries. Failed vaginal birth after cesarean is associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity. The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Vaginal Birth After Cesarean calculator is a validated tool to predict the likelihood of successful trial of labor after cesarean. Predicted likelihood < 60% has been associated with increased maternal and neonatal morbidity. We sought to determine if formal incorporation of calculated vaginal birth after cesarean likelihood into patient-centered counseling would reduce failed vaginal birth after cesarean.

Study Design

This is a quality improvement intervention at a single tertiary-care academic medical center, in which standardized patient counseling was implemented, facilitated by an electronic medical record template featuring patient-specific likelihood of vaginal birth after cesarean success. Term singleton pregnancies with history of one to two cesareans were included; those with contraindication to labor were excluded. Historical controls (January 2016-December 2018, n = 693) were compared with a postimplementation cohort (January 2019-April 2020, n = 328). Primary outcome was failed vaginal birth after cesarean.

Results

Fewer patients in the postintervention cohort had a history of an arrest disorder (PRE: 48%, 330/693 vs. POST: 40%, 130/326, p = 0.03); demographics were otherwise similar, including the proportion of patients with < 60% likelihood of success (PRE: 39%, 267/693, vs. POST: 38%, 125/326). Following implementation, induction of labor in patients with a < 60% likelihood of successful vaginal birth after cesarean decreased from 17% (45/267) to 5% (6/125, p < 0.01). The proportion of failed vaginal birth after cesarean decreased from 33% (107/329) to 22% (32/143, p = 0.04). Overall vaginal birth after cesarean rate did not change (PRE: 32%, 222/693, vs. POST: 34%, 111/326, p = 0.52).

Conclusion

An intervention targeting provider counseling that included a validated vaginal birth after cesarean success likelihood was associated with decreased risk of failed trial of labor after cesarean without affecting overall vaginal birth after cesarean rate.

Key Points

· Labored cesarean increases maternal morbidity. · Application of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) calculator to antenatal counseling decreased labored cesarean. · Application of the MFMU calculator to antenatal counseling did not decrease overall vaginal birth after cesarean rate.

To increase attempt rates of VBAC, widespread information for women on the risks and benefits of VBAC is important. Furthermore, obstetricians should be trained on how to perform a VBAC safely, with backup systems available on site if patient transfer is required. Patient preference, combined with best available evidence, must be taken into consideration when deciding whether a planned primary CS is clinically indicated. This is important because unnecessary CSs place a major burden on the hospital system, surgical team, and operating room, and require advanced equipment and prolonged postoperative care. Medicolegal frameworks to protect obstetricians and maternity staff from litigation in case of adverse outcomes following VBAC should be instituted, especially as apprehension over litigation remains a significant reason why obstetricians hesitate to offer patients VBAC. Any woman scheduled for VBAC should be adequately counseled on the indication, alternative(s), benefits, and potential risks and complications. Patient understanding of and agreement on the indication, risks, and benefits of VBAC, prior to VBAC performance, may minimize litigations in the event of adverse outcomes.

### Factors associated with success of vaginal birth after one caesarean section (VBAC) at three teaching hospitals in addis ababa, Ethiopia: a case control study [^113GjNbE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Caesarean delivery is an operation done to deliver a baby through an incision in the uterus. It is the most frequently performed surgical procedure worldwide. Even though, variation exists in rates of caesarean delivery across countries; currently the rate ranges from 10% to 40%. This high caesarean section rate has put burden on the economy of nations and individuals.

Previous caesarean section has been found to be the commonest cause of increased caesarean section rate in many parts of the world. Because of increased risk of maternal complications with repeat caesarean section and safety of VBAC, trial of labour for selected group of patients with previous scar has become a preferred strategy.

In1988 ACOG recommended that, in the absence of a contraindication, a woman with one previous low-transverse cesarean delivery be counseled to attempt labor in a subsequent pregnancy.

Vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC) is associated with shorter maternal hospitalizations, less blood loss and fewer transfusions, fewer infections, and fewer thrombo-embolic events than cesarean delivery. Several reports have indicated that the absolute risk of uterine rupture attributable to a trial of labor is about 1 per 1000.

A 60 to 80% success rate of vaginal birth after previous caesarean section has been reported by many authors if the primary caesarean was done for nonrecurring indications. Some of the non recurring indications for caesarean section are: poor labour progress, foetal distress, placenta previa, transverse lie, breech presentation, oblique lie, pregnancy induced hypertension and twins.

The VBAC rate of hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa is between 37 to 97%. A Meta analysis done, in sub-Saharan countries showed a VBAC success rate of 63–75%.

### Predictors of successful vaginal birth after a cesarean section in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114CunFD]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that the cesarean section (CS) rate has increased in the world. Cesarean section is significantly increasing though the WHO recommended the optimal rate of cesarean section to be between 5 and 15%. Worldwide, about 21.1% of women gave birth by cesarean Sect. In Ethiopia, the prevalence of cesarean section among women who gave birth at health institutions was 29.55%.

Repeated cesarean section is associated with increased maternal complications, such as placenta previa, hysterectomy, adhesions, blood transfusions, and surgical injury. Furthermore, the risk of postpartum death is higher in mothers who gave birth by cesarean Sect.

Despite cesarean section a life-saving medical procedure and intervention, the reasons for the continued increase are not completely understood. However, obstetricians' uncertainty about the safety of the trial of vaginal birth after a previous caesarean section (VBAC), and unwilling of women to accept the trial of VBAC results in an increased cesarean delivery rate. Moreover, the decline in the rate of vaginal birth after cesarean section is the main reason for the rise in cesarean section rate.

Vaginal birth after a previous caesarean section is an intended trial of vaginal birth by a woman who has had a previous cesarean Sect. Choosing the route of delivery after one previous cesarean section depends on the preferences of women, and past and present obstetric history. Candidates for a VBAC are women with low transverse hysterotomy, and singleton pregnancy with no contraindication for vaginal delivery. Careful selection of women for trial of labour after cesarean section delivery (TOLAC) remains a wise clinical decision as failed VBAC has the worst maternal outcomes.

Existing evidence have shown that the rates of successful VBAC among women with one cesarean section scar have been increasing with minimal complication. Literature has also indicated that successful VBAC has improved maternal and fetal outcomes compared with delivery by repeated cesarean Sect. Furthermore, a successful VBAC shortens the length of hospital stay, avoids abdominal surgery, decreases the risk of infections and hemorrhage, and decreases injury of the bladder and bowel.

### Vaginal birth after cesarean: new insights on maternal and neonatal outcomes [^112JjDyF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the evidence about maternal and neonatal outcomes relating to vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).

Data Sources

Relevant studies were identified from multiple searches of MEDLINE, DARE, and the Cochrane databases (1980 to September 2009) and from recent systematic reviews, reference lists, reviews, editorials, Web sites, and experts.

Methods Of Study Selection

Inclusion criteria limited studies to the English-language and human studies conducted in the United States and developed countries specifically evaluating birth after previous cesarean delivery. Studies focusing on high-risk maternal or neonatal conditions, including breech vaginal delivery, or fewer than 10 patients were excluded. Poor-quality studies were not included in analyses.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

We identified 3,134 citations and reviewed 963 articles for inclusion; 203 articles met the inclusion criteria and were quality rated. Overall rates of maternal harms were low for both trial of labor and elective repeat cesarean delivery. Although rare in both elective repeat cesarean delivery and trial of labor, maternal mortality was significantly increased for elective repeat cesarean delivery at 0.013% compared with 0.004% for trial of labor. The rates of maternal hysterectomy, hemorrhage, and transfusions did not differ significantly between trial of labor and elective repeat cesarean delivery. The rate of uterine rupture for all women with prior cesarean was 0.30%, and the risk was significantly increased for trial of labor (0.47% compared with 0.03% for elective repeat cesarean delivery). Perinatal mortality was also significantly increased for trial of labor (0.13% compared with 0.05% for elective repeat cesarean delivery).

Conclusion

Overall the best evidence suggests that VBAC is a reasonable choice for the majority of women. Adverse outcomes were rare for both elective repeat cesarean delivery and trial of labor. Definitive studies are lacking to identify patients who are at greatest risk for adverse outcomes.

### New insights on vaginal birth after cesarean: can it be predicted? [^114mMQKs]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate existing vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) screening tools and to identify additional factors that may predict VBAC or failed trial of labor.

Data Sources

Relevant studies were identified through MEDLINE, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, and the Cochrane databases (1980-September 2009), and from recent systematic reviews, reference lists, reviews, editorials, web sites, and experts.

Methods Of Study Selection

Inclusion criteria limited studies to those of humans, written in English, studies conducted in the United States and developed countries, and those rated good or fair quality by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria. Studies of individual predictors were combined using a random effects model when the estimated odds ratios were comparable across included studies.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

We identified 3,134 citations and reviewed 963 papers, of which 203 met inclusion criteria and were quality-rated. Twenty-eight provided evidence on predictors of VBAC and 16 presented information on scored models for predicting VBAC (or failed trial of labor). Six of the 11 scored models for predicting VBAC (or failed trial of labor) were validated by separated dataset, cross-validation, or both. Whereas accuracy remained high across all models for predicting VBAC, with predictive values ranging from 88% to 95%, accuracy for predicting failed trial of labor was low, ranging from 33% to 58%. Individual predictors including Hispanic ethnicity, African-American race, advanced maternal age, no previous vaginal birth history, birth weight heavier than 4 kg, and use of either augmentation or induction were all associated with reduced likelihood of VBAC.

Conclusion

Current scored models provide reasonable predictability for VBAC, but none provides consistent ability to identify women at risk for failed trial of labor. A scoring model is needed that incorporates known antepartum factors and can be adjusted for current obstetric factors and labor patterns if induction or augmentation is needed. This would allow women and clinicians to better determine individuals most likely to require repeat cesarean delivery.

### Planning for labor and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery: guidelines from the AAFP [^1141meBG]. American Family Physician (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for cesarean delivery, more specifically with respect to vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery, indications for trial of labor, AAFP 2015 guidelines recommend to encourage females with a history of vaginal birth to plan for labor after Cesarean/vaginal birth after Cesarean unless specific contraindications exist. Discuss reasons for previous Cesarean delivery with patients, as there is limited evidence on other characteristics strongly affecting vaginal birth after Cesarean rates.

### Adjunct clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean rates: systematic review [^114fUgQh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A cesarean delivery is the most common surgery in Canada, with one of the main contributors being an elective cesarean delivery in subsequent pregnancies. Canadian cesarean delivery rates have increased from 18.7% in 1997 to 27.5% in 2014 and continue to increase globally, the result of an interplay of multiple factors including, but not limited to, shifting clinical environments, provider and patient preferences, and changing maternal demographics (e.g. obesity, chronic disease prevalence and advanced age). These factors can lead to higher-risk and more complex pregnancies and deliveries and an increased likelihood of a cesarean delivery.

Depending on the etiology or indication, a cesarean delivery contributes to short- and long-term risks for both mother and infant. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) recommends that a trial of labor be offered to women with one previous transverse low-segment cesarean section. A woman's willingness to undergo a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) may be influenced by a multitude of factors. While a vaginal birth after a cesarean (VBAC) may be desired by some women, the patient-level benefits associated with a VBAC from avoiding major abdominal surgery and risk of complications in future pregnancies must be weighed against the potential for serious harms such as a failed TOLAC and subsequent maternal and neonatal morbidity including an unplanned repeat cesarean delivery. For women with more than one previous cesarean delivery, a VBAC is likely to be successful, but with an estimated higher risk of uterine rupture (0.2 to 1.5% with a transverse uterine incision, 1.0 to 1.6% with a low-vertical uterine incision). This SOGC statement is consistent with recommendations from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG).

This systematic review aimed to evaluate adjunct clinical interventions that could be directed at or used by patients, families, healthcare providers, and hospitals/health systems to influence the uptake and success of VBAC.

### Oxytocin use in trial of labor after cesarean and its relationship with risk of uterine rupture in women with one previous cesarean section: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^112YEp5E]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Method

Design and registration

We conducted the review according to the registered protocol PROSPERO CRD42020152819 the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were the following: 1) participants: women with singleton pregnancy after 37 weeks of gestation and a previous low transverse cesarean section (CS), who volunteered and accepted a trial of labor after CS (TOLAC), and did not have any contraindications to TOLAC, such as previous uterine body incision, placenta previa or abnormal pelvimetry with a breech presentation; 2) intervention: oxytocin induction or augmentation during a TOLAC; 3) comparator: women not using oxytocin in TOLAC; 4) outcomes: the success rate of TOLAC (VBAC), the usage rate of oxytocin in TOLAC and the risk of uterine rupture; 5) type of studies: designed with case-control study or cross-sectional study.

The exclusion criteria were: 1) women with previous classical CS, history of more than one CS, major fetal anomalies, active labor before rupturing of membranes, scheduled elective CS, contraindications for spontaneous delivery (placenta previa, breech presentation, etc.), history of uterine rupture, and lack of information regarding the previous delivery; 2) duplication of previous publication(s). Two independent investigators finished the procedure; disagreement was solved by discussion.

Searching strategies

A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Clinical trial, and Google Scholar was conducted with no date restrictions. The following keywords were used: "vaginal birth after a cesarean section" OR "VBAC" AND "a trial of labor after the cesarean section" OR "TOLAC" OR "trial of labor" AND "oxytocin" OR "oxytocin infusion" OR "induction of labor" AND "uterine rupture" OR "maternal morbidity" (see Supplementary materials). Final literature searches were performed in June 2019. The hits were reviewed, and duplicates were eliminated. Then, inclusion and exclusion criteria were set for including records. Finally, the titles, abstracts, keywords, and whole texts of retrieved studies were checked to exclude irrelevant ones.

### Adjunct clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean rates: systematic review [^111zGb9b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

A methodologically rigorous systematic review of the literature was undertaken to capture a broad range of studies of adjunct clinical interventions directed at increasing maternal VBAC rates. However, several factors limit our confidence in effects of interventions, such as inclusion of non-randomized study designs, small number of studies per intervention category, and inconsistent results across heterogeneous studies. Moreover, many studies did not report important maternal baseline characteristics in a consistent manner, including antenatal history (e.g. parity, number of previous cesarean deliveries and vaginal births, medical history/risk factors) or indications (e.g. age, gestational age, fetal risk factors).

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^111Wggfk]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

Justification for a randomised trial and patient preference study of planned VBAC versus planned repeat caesarean

To date, there have been no randomised controlled trials comparing VBAC with elective repeat caesarean section, and the observational studies currently available have limitations. Although the randomised controlled trial is regarded as the 'gold standard' research methodology for assessing the effects of health care interventions, some research questions cannot be fully answered using this design, particularly in situations where patients may have strong treatment preferences and thus decline randomisation.

Patient preferences have been effectively incorporated into a prospective cohort study design previously. The inclusion of women with clear preferences for treatment improves generalisability of the study results, and this design has been used successfully in other studies relating to women's health issues.

Previous cohort studies relating to options for birth after a previous caesarean have been criticised for their striking methodological deficiencies, with strong recommendation that future studies avoid the following pitfalls: lack of comparability of groups, specifically the ERC group not guaranteed to be eligible for VBAC; failure to consider other important baseline comparability factors, poor specificity of the intervention and the importance of co-interventions, and lack of precise and standard outcome measures. In addition the recommendation was that future studies should assess women's views of care and evaluate women's process of decision-making. To specifically address these recommendations, the current research utilises rigorous methodology, using a 'restricted' prospective cohort study and a randomised clinical trial.

A 'restricted' prospective cohort study design utilises the rigour of recruitment, treatment schedules and follow up of the randomised controlled trial. Adoption of this methodology has not been shown to systematically overestimate the magnitude of the treatment effects when compared with the results of randomised controlled trials. Features of importance in the restrictive cohort design include the identification of a 'zero time' for determining a woman's eligibility and baseline features; use of inclusion and exclusion criteria similar to those of clinical trials; adjustment for differences in base-line susceptibility to the outcomes; and the use of statistical methods (eg intention-to-treat analysis) similar to randomised controlled trials.

Using this methodology, we will conduct a, patient preference study and a randomised clinical trial to compare the benefits and risks of a planned VBAC with planned elective, repeat caesarean. Eligible women who consent to be randomised will be entered into the randomised trial. Eligible women who decline randomisation and consent to be entered into the patient preference study will choose their treatment preference and follow the study protocol for that treatment group.

There is evidence to suggest that in carefully selected women undergoing VBAC, a trial of low forceps or outlet forceps or vacuum may be safely attempted by a skilled obstetrician in an operating theater, where immediate recourse to CS can be undertaken, in case of any complication. This is discussed in detail, with recommendations for practice, in an upcoming paper on assisted vaginal birth from the FIGO Committee on Childbirth and PPH.

### Planned elective repeat caesarean section versus planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth [^116EEh5q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

When a woman has had a previous caesarean birth, there are two options for her care in a subsequent pregnancy: planned elective repeat caesarean or planned vaginal birth. While there are risks and benefits for both planned elective repeat caesarean birth and planned vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC), current sources of information are limited to non-randomised cohort studies. Studies designed in this way have significant potential for bias and consequently conclusions based on these results are limited in their reliability and should be interpreted with caution.

Objectives

To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of a policy of planned elective repeat caesarean section with a policy of planned VBAC for women with a previous caesarean birth.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2013) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies who planned a repeat elective caesarean section with outcomes in women who planned a vaginal birth, where a previous birth had been by caesarean.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.

Main Results

Two randomised trials involving 320 women and their infants were included. However, data for maternal and infant clinical outcomes were available from one trial with very low event rates, involving 22 women only. For the primary outcomes maternal death or serious morbidity (one study; 22 women; risk ratio (RR) not estimable), and infant death or serious morbidity (one study; 22 women; RR not estimable), there were no statistically significant differences between planned caesarean birth and planned vaginal birth identified.

Authors' Conclusions

Planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned VBAC for women with a prior caesarean birth are both associated with benefits and harms. Evidence for these care practices is largely drawn from non-randomised studies, associated with potential bias. Any results and conclusions must therefore be interpreted with caution. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned vaginal birth for women with a previous caesarean birth.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^1164byVo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Over 103,000 cesarean deliveries (CDs) occurred in 2017 within Canadian hospitals. In Canada, CDs continue to be the leading inpatient surgery with elective/scheduled CD as a main contributor. Since 1997, the rate of CD has increased from 18.7 to 28.2% in 2017, and frequency of this delivery method continues on an upward trend. Globally, rates of cesarean sections are considered high at an estimated 21% of livebirths in 2015, based on data from 169 countries.

A number of factors influencing the increase of this surgical delivery method include changes in healthcare practice styles, patient preferences, pressures of malpractice and demographic influences (e.g. social, economic, cultural). These influences can affect delivery options/choice and may result in complex pregnancies that ultimately require a CD. Short- and long-term morbidity risks for the infant and mother are further influenced by the etiology or indication of their CD; however, overall risk of morbidity and mortality is more positively associated with CD compared to vaginal delivery. This risk warrants careful consideration of potential post-operative complications before scheduled CD, a major abdominal surgery. Recent 'Early Recovery After Cesarean' (ERAS) for CD guidelines (Part 1–3) have been published to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

For women who have undergone a prior CD, there is uncertainty regarding the choice of a repeat/scheduled CD or attempting a vaginal delivery for a successive pregnancy as both modes of birth have risks. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) recommend that a trial of labor be offered to women with one previous transverse low-segment CD. Vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) may be desired by some women, but the patient-level benefits associated with VBAC including avoiding repeat abdominal surgery and risk of complications in future pregnancies must be considered against the potential risks of a failed trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) with subsequent maternal and neonatal morbidity, including an unplanned repeat CD. While the risk for uterine rupture of the previous cesarean incision scar is low (single CD 0.72%; double CD 1.59%) there is maternal and neonatal risk.

While the studies show heterogeneity and certainty of evidence is low to very low, the uterine rupture and dehiscence rates among studies are very clinically equivalent to rates reported in the literature (ruptures, pharmacological/non-pharmacological/combined for each comparison group 0.56, 0.70%; 0, 0; 1.05, 0.65%, respectively and dehiscence, pharmacological/non-pharmacological/combined for each comparison group 2.10, 0.76%; 1.44, 0.72%; 1.21, 0.87%, respectively). These findings can support the safety of oxytocin use for ripening alone and in combination with mechanical methods to allow amniotomy as commented above.

Candidates for TOLAC

Various maternal characteristics, clinical history, and presenting labor indications associated with likelihood of VBAC have been reported in the literature. Factors associated with increased risk of maternal morbidity from a TOLAC include: prior classical cesarean section or T incision as a contraindication, previous low segment cesarean section where the uterus was closed in a single layer, less than 18-month inter-delivery interval, medical induction or augmentation of labor as compared to spontaneous labor, medical induction of labor with misoprostol or PGE2, and increasing number of prior CDs.

A previous successful trial of vaginal delivery is associated with greater likelihood of successful VBAC; alternatively, the history of a failed trial of vaginal delivery requires a CD. Multiple obstetrical indications for inducing labor or considering CD, also need to be considered (e.g. post-dates, hypertension, macrosomia, intra-uterine growth restriction, unfavorable cervix). Different induction methods may have differential effects on progress of labor, and the impact on mode of delivery. Limited evidence from RCTs on methods of labor induction have not been able to determine which method results in greater benefits and lower risks.

4 OUTCOMES OF VBAC COMPARED WITH PLANNED REPEAT CESAREAN SECTION

A retrospective cohort study of 3 047 401 women who birthed in Canada between 2003 and 2014 found an increased relative risk but low absolute rate of severe maternal morbidity and mortality with VBAC compared with planned repeat CS (10.7 vs. 5.65 per 1000 births; adjusted RR (aRR) 1.96, 95% CI 1.76–2.19). Increased relative risk but low absolute risk were also found for neonatal morbidity and mortality (20.8 vs. 14.5 per 1000 births; aRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.38–1.61). Comparisons between VBAC and planned repeat CS for some specific maternal and neonatal outcomes are discussed in this section. It must be emphasized that randomized controlled trials comparing VBAC with planned repeat CS are lacking due to ethical and feasibility concerns. As a result, the evidence is observational, which limits causal inference and introduces the potential for confounding.

4.1 Maternal outcomes

Maternal mortality

The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the Office of Medical Applications of Research of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a Consensus Development Conference in 2010 to discuss all available evidence related to VBAC. They found that maternal mortality was significantly higher for planned repeat CS than for women who underwent VBAC (13.4/100 000 vs. 3.8/100 000 live births: high grade of evidence). A literature review of nine studies by Fitzpatrick et al.including a median of 7755 women (range, 412–685 137), reported only four maternal deaths, all in women who underwent a planned repeat CS.

### Providers' perspective on vaginal birth after cesarean birth: a qualitative systematic review [^111YfwCC]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications

To cultivate positive perspective on VBAC, this birth mode should not be seen as a contributor to adverse birth outcomes. Also, consent form for TOLAC is needed prior the procedure to protect providers from the lawsuit caused by unexpectedly adverse birth outcomes. In addition, to reduce cesarean rate and raise successful VBAC rate, providers should be trained for conducting TOLAC which will increase their confidence in performing VBAC. Having standardized TOLAC protocols enables providers to offer optimal care, especially in countries where TOLAC is not widely practiced. Besides, having standardized guidelines for determining TOLAC candidacy allows providers to screen pregnant individuals having low risk for adverse birth outcome prior conducting TOLAC. Additionally, planning for TOLAC should be considered immediately after the first cesarean or first antenatal visit in order to counsel and provide information about TOLAC to pregnant individuals and their significant ones. The future research should compare successful VBAC rate between individuals counselled about VBAC promptly after the first cesarean and those counselled at the first antenatal visit.

### Qualitative website analysis of information on birth after caesarean section [^116jRvXB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Information bias (discourage (deter) vs encourage)

The way in which information was portrayed, and the language used in several websites appeared biased in support of or against VBAC/ERCS. Some sites adopted the 'persuasive' (positive) approach in advocating trial of labour, discussing VBAC as the default position (W7, W9, W10); ' Provided there are no contraindications, a woman with 1 previous transverse low-segment Caesarean section should be offered a trial of labour after Caesarean with appropriate discussion of maternal and perinatal risks and benefits' (9) and 'three out of four women will go on to have a vaginal delivery' (W10). Where content relating to trial of labour with minimal intervention, minimal risk (W1, W3, W7, W9, W10), and successful outcome of VBAC (W1, W5, W6, W9, W10) was given greater prominence, this was perceived as 'positive information provision': 'if you have a baby by caesarean section, this does not necessarily mean that any baby you have in the future will have to be delivered by caesarean section' (W4), and ' attempts at vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) have a high success rate and have many benefits' (W9).

The primary null hypothesis is that for women who meet the accepted eligibility criteria for planned VBAC, there is no difference in the risk of death or serious adverse outcome up to the time of primary hospital discharge for the infant in women who have a planned VBAC compared with a planned elective repeat caesarean section.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^114WFuiB]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

In the United States and other developed countries, the vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rate has been steadily declining for more than a decade. Only 8.2% of US women with a previous cesarean delivery attempted a vaginal birth in 2007, compared with 35.3% in 1997, despite evidence that 60% to 80% of VBACs are successful. A similar trend is apparent in Australia, where VBAC rates declined from 31% in 1998 to 19% in 2006. Although VBAC has been extensively validated as a safe option for most women with a previous cesarean, non-medical factors are thought to be driving the decline in rates since medical factors have changed little over the years.

Prior to the 1970s, the phrase "once a cesarean, always a cesarean" [, p. 1] dominated obstetrical practice in the United States and throughout much of the world. As surgical techniques became safer in the 1970s, however, cesarean rates began to rise. Concerns over the rising cesarean rate in the United States prompted the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to convene the first Consensus Development Conference Panel on Cesarean Childbirth in 1981. The panel recommended that a trial of labor was a safe and reasonable alternative to an elective repeat cesarean delivery for carefully selected women. During the 1980s and early 1990s, results from a number of large, multicenter prospective trials provided evidence to support the safety of VBAC. As a result, VBAC rates rose from 6.6% in 1985 to 28.3% in 1996. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) also published a series of VBAC guidelines that were successively less restrictive and suggested that a trial of labor be encouraged in women who were at low risk for complications. Interest by women and their providers resulted in an increased number of successful VBACs. Moreover, in the interest of cost savings, some institutions and insurers even required women to undergo a trial of labor.

### Factors associated with successful vaginal birth after a cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115R4Dy]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Cesarean delivery rates have increased dramatically worldwide. In the United States, cesarean section (CS) rates increased from 5% of all deliveries in 1970 to a high of 31.9% in 2016. Although efforts were made to reduce the number of CS, it failed to achieve the 15% rate recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

Repeat CS is the most significant factor contributing to overall increased CS rates. The primary indication of repeat CS is a prior CS. The trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) is an attempt to reduce CS rates. Several national medical associations have provided practice guidelines for vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC), but these differ across countries. Generally speaking, VBAC is relatively safe when compared with repeat CS. However, TOLAC rates have dropped significantly worldwide in recent years.

For women with a prior cesarean delivery, a trial of labor will often represent her last opportunity to experience a normal birth. However, a failed VBAC increases the risk of maternal and perinatal complications more than an elective repeat CS. A potential solution to the concerns related to VBAC would be a more accurate selection of patients opting for TOLAC. Early communication to discuss women's prospects for VBAC success and their attitudes towards future births might be valuable. The probability of successful vaginal birth is one of the most crucial factors in the decision-making process during the prenatal counseling of these women.

Two previous meta-analyses were published in 1990 (Rosen et al.) and in 2010 (Eden et al.). Rosen et al. focused on the indicators in the previous cesarean for VBAC success. Eden et al. focused on studies about predictors of VBAC, which were conducted in developed countries. They found that cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD) in the previous cesarean, previous breech, previous vaginal delivery, more than one previous cesarean, Hispanic ethnicity, advanced age, birth weight heavier than 4 kg, and use of either augmentation or induction affected the likelihood of VBAC. However, no previous meta-analysis has focused on the influences of obesity, diabetes, hypertensive disorders complicating pregnancy (HDCP), gestational weeks, and interdelivery interval on the chance of VBAC, which were conflicting.

Therefore, we aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published reports until 2018 of vaginal birth after one previous cesarean and maternal or fetal factors from the historical and current pregnancies, and to quantify the magnitude of each factor and the quality of the supporting data.

### Planned mode of birth after previous caesarean section and women's use of psychotropic medication in the first year postpartum: a population-based record linkage cohort study [^116ELoGn]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Caesarean section rates have increased in many parts of the world (Betran et al.), including the UK where around 30% of all births now occur by caesarean (Information Services Division Scotland; NHS Digital; Welsh Government). This has resulted in increasing numbers of pregnant women with a history of previous caesarean. Policy in many high-income countries supports giving such women a choice between planning another caesarean, known as an elective repeat caesarean section (ERCS) or planning a vaginal birth, known as a planned vaginal birth after previous caesarean (VBAC), provided they have no contraindications to VBAC. This contrasts with the general obstetric population in most high-income settings, where the majority of caesareans are performed because they are recommended for various obstetric or medical reasons. Clinical guidelines (American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists; National Institute for Health & Clinical Excellence; Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; The Royal Australian & New Zealand College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists,) advocate counselling women about the risks and benefits of planned VBAC compared to ERCS to help them make an informed decision about this choice. However, several significant limitations have been highlighted with the existing evidence (Guise et al.). These include uncertainty around whether women who would not have been advised to plan a VBAC due to obstetric/medical reasons were included in the ERCS group. There also remains a lack of evidence about certain outcomes, including the effect of planned mode of birth after previous caesarean on women's mental health.

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^114ma1eA]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

To systematically review the literature on clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rates.

Methods

We searched Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Wiley Cochrane Library, CINAHL via EBSCOhost; and Ovid PsycINFO. Additional studies were identified by searching for clinical trial records, conference proceedings and dissertations. Limits were applied for language (English and French) and year of publication (1985 to present). Two reviewers independently screened comparative studies (randomized or non-randomized controlled trials, and observational designs) according to a priori eligibility criteria: women with prior cesarean sections; any clinical intervention or exposure intended to increase the VBAC rate; any comparator; and, outcomes reporting VBAC, uterine rupture and uterine dehiscence rates. One reviewer extracted data and a second reviewer verified for accuracy. Meta-analysis was conducted using Mantel-Haenszel (random effects model) relative risks (VBAC rate) and risk differences (uterine rupture and dehiscence). Two reviewers independently conducted methodological quality assessments using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT).

Results

Twenty-nine studies (six trials and 23 cohorts) examined different clinical interventions affecting rates of vaginal deliveries among women with a prior cesarean delivery (CD). Methodological quality was good overall for the trials; however, concerns among the cohort studies regarding selection bias, comparability of groups and outcome measurement resulted in higher risk of bias. Interventions for labor induction, with or without cervical ripening, included pharmacologic (oxytocin, prostaglandins, misoprostol, mifepristone, epidural analgesia), non-pharmacologic (membrane sweep, amniotomy, balloon devices), and combined (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic). Single studies with small sample sizes and event rates contributed to most comparisons, with no clear differences between groups on rates of VBAC, uterine rupture and uterine dehiscence.

Conclusions

This systematic review evaluated clinical interventions directed at increasing the rate of vaginal delivery among women with a prior CD and found low to very low certainty in the body of evidence for cervical ripening and/or labor induction techniques. There is insufficient high-quality evidence to inform optimal clinical interventions among women attempting a trial of labor after a prior CD.

2 RATES OF SUCCESSFUL VBAC

Published data have reported successful vaginal birth rates of 60%–80% after a previous CS. The rate of successful VBAC is reported as 74.7% in the United States,76.6% in Canada,80.7% in Taiwan,62.8% in Norway,61.8% in Nigeria,57.6% in the Democratic Republic of Congo,69.4% in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and 69.4% in sub‐Saharan Africa. In counseling women for VBAC, obstetricians should always consider any patient‐specific characteristics that may increase or decrease the likelihood of success above or below the overall rate of 60%–80%; for example, while the success rate of VBAC can be as high as > 90% for a woman with one previous CS and a vaginal birth both before and after the CS, the success rate is < 60% for women with a recurrent indication for the previous CS, those with body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m 2, and those with fetal macrosomia. The factors affecting the probability of successful VBAC are discussed further in Section 5.

Despite the high overall success rates of VBAC, the attempt rate remains low in many countries. A prospective cohort study in Brazil revealed a primary CS rate of 49.5% that was followed by a second CS in 87.4% of cases. A large study in the United States, including 4.3 million births, showed that attempted VBAC increased only marginally over a decade, from 15.3% in 2010 to 21.7% in 2020. Another study of 39 236 775 live births in the United States, recorded between 2010 and 2019, showed that VBAC occurred in only 21.9%, 7.1%, and 4.8% of births with 1, 2, and ≥ 3 previous CSs, respectively. In a study of 74 043 singleton term births to women with ≥ 1 previous CSs in Scotland, only 38.4% of the women had VBAC. In Norway, a VBAC rate of 70% has been reported among women with cephalic presentation, singleton pregnancies at term.

### Delivery after a previous cesarean section reviewed [^115B5YUH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

At the start of the 20th century, cesarean section (CS) was uncommon in obstetrics. By the end of the century, CS rates had increased dramatically worldwide. Although the explanation for the increase is multifactorial, a major driver in the ongoing escalation is the increase in women who are delivered by repeat CS. This is due, in part, to the fact that there has been a sharp fall in vaginal birth after CS (VBAC) rates as fewer women are offered a trial of labor after CS (TOLAC), due principally to fears of a catastrophic intrapartum uterine rupture. This paper reviewed international VBAC policies and trends. A number of themes emerged. The risk of intrapartum rupture and its associated complications is low and may sometimes be overestimated. Individual maternity hospitals in both developed and developing countries are inadequately resourced to safely supervise a TOLAC. Efforts to mitigate the risks of TOLAC by careful patient selection and good clinical practices may be underutilized. Given the serious short-term and long-term consequences of rising CS rates for women and for maternity services generally, a review of TOLAC policies worldwide should be prioritized and consideration given to convening a Global Consensus Development Conference on Delivery after CS.

### Is vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) or elective repeat cesarean safer in women with a prior vaginal delivery? [^112aSs7F]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to determine whether vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) or elective repeat cesarean delivery is safer overall for a woman with a prior vaginal delivery.

Study Design

This retrospective cohort study of pregnant women from 1996 to 2000 who had a prior cesarean delivery, was conducted in 17 centers. Trained nurses extracted historical and maternal outcome data on subjects by using standardized tools. This planned secondary analysis examined the subcohort that had also previously undergone a vaginal delivery, comparing those who underwent a VBAC trial with those who elected to have a repeat cesarean delivery. Outcomes included uterine rupture, bladder injury, fever, transfusion and a composite (uterine rupture, bladder injury, and artery laceration). We performed bivariate and multivariable analyses.

Results

Of 6619 patients with a prior cesarean delivery who had also had a prior vaginal delivery, 5041 patients attempted a VBAC delivery and 1578 had an elective cesarean delivery. Although there was no significant difference in uterine rupture or bladder injury between the two groups, women who underwent a VBAC attempt were less likely to experience the composite adverse maternal outcome, have a fever, or require a transfusion.

Conclusion

Among VBAC candidates who have had a prior vaginal delivery, those who attempt a VBAC trial have decreased risk for overall major maternal morbidities, as well as maternal fever and transfusion requirement compared with women who elect repeat cesarean delivery. Physicians should make this more favorable benefit-risk ratio explicit when counseling this patient subpopulation on a trial of labor.

### Delivery after previous cesarean: long-term maternal outcomes [^1165v2MQ]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

Most studies of cesarean morbidity focus on short term, rather than long term complications. However, women undergoing cesarean delivery are at increased risk for a chronic problems as well. These include pain and surgical adhesions, as well as a possible increased risk for infertility or sub-fertility and perinatal complications in subsequent pregnancies. The most serious risk for women undergoing multiple repeat cesarean deliveries is a dramatically increased risk for life threatening hemorrhage and morbidity in the setting of placenta accreta. This chapter outlines these long term risks of cesarean delivery so that they may be factored into the risk:benefit ratio for women considering vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC).

Present obstetric circumstances

Even when a VBAC is planned early in pregnancy, the plan is often reviewed again as the woman approaches term and, in particular, if the pregnancy extends beyond the expected date of delivery. Although opinions varied on whether women should or should not be offered an induction of labour once the pregnancy is prolonged, clinicians expressed increasing concern about the associated risk of uterine rupture. Clinicians highlighted that even when a decision to induce labour is made, a level of uncertainty exists as to the best time to undertake the procedure.

I am happy to induce; are we happy to induce? I am in my own practice. I would prefer to induce them at T + 3 or 4 rather than let them go to T + 10 personally. I look at these women who have had one previous CS as normal, so I don't think about doing anything until they were postdates, as if they were normal. (IR)

Although there was some discussion regarding the potential of a maternal request for VBAC, not all clinicians thought that the women should have an automatic right to choose their preferred option without consideration of the associated obstetric risks involved.

I think that women shouldn't have a right to choose a vaginal birth after CS. The decision should be the result of an overall evaluation, which can't exclude vaginal birth. A process of assessment of suitability is necessary, leaving flexibility for the clinician. (IT)

A positive attitude to VBAC in all who are centrally involved

Clinicians indicated that for VBAC to be successful, the woman must be motivated and willing to consider the options. Clinicians in Ireland were keen to stress that even when a woman has an open mind towards VBAC, the final decision on the mode of birth cannot be made until late in the pregnancy. Clinicians in Italy suggested careful evaluation of the woman's suitability for VBAC is required. Clinicians in Ireland indicated they were positively disposed to supporting a woman to have a VBAC if they had laboured previously, and were enthusiastic about supporting these women to labour.

At the first visit, I always put down are they open minded about it or are they keen for CS. And if they are keen for another CS, I put down: "Not un-keen on another CS". If they are open minded, you can play along with them, like if they come in spontaneous labour. (IR)

Data extraction

One reviewer extracted data and another verified data from each included study using a pre-specified and piloted form. Data were extracted for relevant study characteristics (design features), population (number of previous cesarean deliveries, parity), intervention, comparator, outcome (TOLAC rate [the number of women with a previous cesarean delivery who attempt a vaginal delivery] and VBAC rate [the number of women with a previous cesarean delivery who undergo a successful vaginal delivery]), funding source, and setting.

Intention-to-treat results were extracted from individual studies whenever possible. For dichotomous data on rates of TOLAC and VBAC, we reported counts or proportions, and sample size, by study arm. Results of statistical tests (e.g. p -values) or summary statistics (e.g. odds ratio [OR], risk ratio [RR], with confidence intervals [CI]) were extracted whenever these were reported within the studies.

Assessment of methodological quality

Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of included studies; disagreements were resolved via consensus. All studies were assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), a tool designed for systematic reviews that include multiple study designs.

Data synthesis

Due to heterogeneity of interventions and comparators, pooling of data across studies for a meta-analysis was not appropriate; therefore, results were described narratively.

Assessment of overall quality of evidence

Data from studies were not pooled for summary effect estimates; therefore, assessment of the quality of the body of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was not conducted.

7.3 Intrapartum management

Labor progress should be assessed by the same standards as in women with an unscarred uterus as the available evidence shows that women attempting VBAC have similar labor patterns as women who have not had a prior CS. Management of the second and third stages of labor is not different in women undergoing VBAC but there should be a low threshold for assisted vaginal birth or emergency intrapartum CS if uterine rupture is suspected. In case of a retained placenta, abnormal placentation should be considered. Manual removal in such situations should be attempted in the operating room if placenta accreta spectrum disorders are confirmed. Bedside ultrasound can be used to evaluate the placentation before manual removal.

Routine uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended in a hemodynamically stable patient with no abnormal vaginal bleeding. However, excessive vaginal bleeding or signs of hypovolemia may indicate uterine rupture and should prompt a complete evaluation of the genital tract. If the uterus is explored and a dehiscence is diagnosed, and the patient is stable without abnormal vaginal bleeding, blood analysis should be performed to exclude intraperitoneal bleeding, which would be an indication for laparotomy and repair if confirmed. Surgical repair of asymptomatic uterine scar dehiscence suspected by uterine exploration after VBAC is not recommended, as it has not been shown to improve outcomes.

### Birth after caesarean study – planned vaginal birth or planned elective repeat caesarean for women at term with a single previous caesarean birth: protocol for a patient preference study and randomised trial [^115YcXTY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2007). Low credibility.

While there is considerable variation in the proportion of women who are offered and attempt VBAC, successful rates of between 56% and 80% are reported in the literature. British figures indicate that among women with a prior caesarean section, 33% will successfully achieve vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy, although again there was considerable variation across institutions, ranging from 6% to 64%. Rates of planned VBAC across sub-Saharan Africa are reported between 54 and 97%, with successful vaginal birth being achieved in 63 to 84% of women.

Despite widespread attempts to increase the proportion of women with a previous caesarean who attempt VBAC, the number of women attempting VBAC has declined markedly. This is highlighted by data from the United States, indicating a fall in the number of women attempting VBAC from 28.3% in 1996 to 12.7% in 2002. Further contributing to this decline in the proportion of women attempting VBAC are recent literature reports highlighting an increase in both maternal and infant risks associated with VBAC, including uterine rupture and perinatal death. These reports may have accelerated the declining trend in VBAC rates.

Public interest and debate over the relative safety of vaginal birth after caesarean continues, with calls from key international agencies for better quality evidence.

Benefits and harms associated with vaginal birth after caesarean and elective repeat caesarean section

Both repeat elective caesarean section and VBAC are associated with benefits and harms. Repeat elective caesarean birth is associated with an increase in the risk of maternal complications such as bleeding, need for blood transfusion, infection, damage to the bladder and bowel, and deep venous thrombosis. As the number of caesarean births for each individual woman increases, so does the difficulty in performing surgery due to adhesions, and the risk of damage to the bladder or bowel at the time of surgery. There may also be difficulties in conceiving a further child or the development of placenta praevia or placenta accreta/percreta. Infants born by caesarean may develop transient tachypnoea of the newborn, the risks of this relating to the use of general anaesthesia and gestational age at birth.

Methods

Patient identification

This retrospective study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsink and approved by the Ethics Committee of Ningbo Women and Children's Hospital (approval number: EC2017–003). The records/information of all women were anonymized and recorded before analysis. All of the participants provided written informed consent. Information related to maternal history and delivery was extracted from medical and surgical records. All women who met the inclusion criteria between December 2014 and December 2020 were included in the study. The inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) singleton delivery; and 2) had a previous CD but was scheduled for TOLAC. The exclusion criteria were as follow: 1) two or more previous CDs; 2) twin pregnancy; 3) contraindications to vaginal birth (breech presentation, placenta previa); 4) history of other uterine incisions such as myomectomy, "T", "J" or vertical incisions; 5) incomplete medical records; and patients request for repeat CD during labor (Fig. 1).

### Clinical interventions that influence vaginal birth after cesarean delivery rates: systematic review&meta-analysis [^116FEif3]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations of study

This systematic review of clinical interventions for influencing VBAC rates encompassed a broad range of study designs and strategies for cervical ripening and/or labor induction. The nature of the labor process and difficulty blinding women or healthcare providers to interventions lends few studies to an RCT design. Unsurprisingly, nearly 80% of the studies were cohort designs. However, observational studies have inherent biases due to confounding and there were concerns among the included cohorts regarding comparability of population characteristics between groups. Few studies adequately reported maternal characteristics. Some studies included women with only one CD while others enrolled women with multiple cesarean deliveries, a documented risk of increased uterine rupture among women attempting a VBAC. Additionally, few studies reported parity, type of previous uterine incision, prior vaginal delivery, prior VBAC, or indication(s) for previous CD. The concept of spontaneous labor among most studies is erroneously represented in that women in a comparator group (as opposed to the intervention group) are often managed expectantly, where they may or may not then progress to spontaneous labor. Further, spontaneous onset of labor is often used synonymously with spontaneous delivery. One outcome of induction of labor (versus expectant management) is induction success (or failed induction) distinguished from VBAC success. Ambiguous operationalization of these concepts may result in important differences in outcomes. Among women who were induced, studies often did not provide data for the number of women whose labor was augmented. While VBAC was reported by all studies, other perinatal outcomes were unreported or undefined despite following up women to delivery. Four (14%) studies did not report whether there were cases of uterine ruptures in their study population. Among studies that reported on uterine ruptures and/or uterine dehiscence, authors defined these outcomes inconsistently (and without a cited reference) or they were not explicitly differentiated from each other, or they were undefined altogether. Contextual and mediating factors, such as induction-to-labor interval or co-interventions were sparsely reported for women in all study arms.

### Prior childbirth experience and attitude towards subsequent vaginal birth after one caesarean delivery in lagos, Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [^11236jhW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prior caesarean delivery (CD) impacts CD rates in many parts of the world. Globally, the CD rate is high and increasing. An estimated 21·1% was recorded in 2015, almost double the proportion recorded in 2000 (12·1%). High CD rates of 25.7%, 39.3%, and up to 42.4% have been reported in Europe, the Americas and some Nigerian tertiary facilities respectively. The proportion of women attempting a trial of labour after one previous caesarean delivery (TOLAC) is relatively low and decreasing, especially in low and middle-income countries, and this contributes to high CD rates. The implication is that CD rates will continue to rise with more women having repeat CD rather than vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC). Decisive strategies need to be put in place to mitigate this.

For the woman who has had a prior CD, a successful trial of labour culminating in vaginal birth; a failed trial resulting in an emergency repeat CD; or an elective repeat CD are the three possible outcomes. Whichever approach is adopted, women who have undergone a prior CD should be informed about the maternal and neonatal risks and benefits associated with both planned VBAC and elective repeat caesarean delivery (ERCD) and those without contraindications to VBAC should be given an informed choice about the planned mode of birth after a previous CD.

Though regarded as a procedure with low risk, CD has intrinsic risks as studies indicate a 3 times higher risk of maternal death when compared to vaginal delivery and 50 times as much risk of maternal mortality in certain African countries than in high-income countries.

Risks may be related to its indication and may predispose to complications such as puerperal infection, haemorrhage, thromboembolism and anaesthetic complications. Furthermore, future pregnancies are associated with an increased risk of various complications such as the increased risk of placenta praevia, morbidly adherent placentation, and surgical complications such as hysterectomy, especially in repeated ERCD. Maternal morbidity increases with each additional caesarean section, especially for women with three or more caesarean sections who have a high risk of low insertion of the placenta, placenta accreta and hysterectomy. Regarding fetal complications, the CD can also lead to increased iatrogenic prematurity and neonatal respiratory distress rates when performed without appropriate justification.

### The immediately available physician standard [^112q2iRp]. Seminars in Perinatology (2010). Low credibility.

The promulgation of the immediately available physician standard has contributed to the rapid decline in vaginal birth after cesareans (VBACs). While having an immediately available obstetrician during a VBAC trial will reduce risk, it is not clear that similar advantage wouldn't also accrue to women without uterine scars. However, many hospitals can't staff up to that standard. In this article we suggest 1) set a goal of providing an immediately available team for all women in labor, 2) tailor informed consent to women's unique risks- unique because of their own risk profile (e.g., previous scar, hypertension, etc) or unique because of characteristics of the birthing site (e.g. a team is or is not available), 3) in smaller hospitals, if an immediately available team cannot be routinely provided, consideration should be given to bringing in a team for the occasional patient requesting a trial, and to allowing labor for lower risk trials.

### FIGO good practice recommendations for vaginal birth after cesarean section [^113LuixH]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

A limitation of studies reporting the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC is the different definitions of uterine rupture versus uterine dehiscence. While some studies include asymptomatic or minor scar separations, others include only full‐thickness ruptures with clinical consequences. Another limitation is selection bias due to retrospective study design, given that candidates for VBAC are usually carefully selected, with often favorable obstetric factors for VBAC success. Furthermore, most high‐quality data on the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC come from high‐income countries. In low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMICs), access to emergency CS and real‐time fetal monitoring may be limited, which could influence uterine rupture risk and outcomes. Boulvain et al.and Boatin et al.reported a uterine rupture rate of 2.1% in women undergoing VBAC in sub‐Saharan Africa, increasing up to 4.9% in Central Africa, compared with 0.3%–0.7% in the United States and other high‐income countries. Therefore, data and literature on risk of uterine rupture during VBAC should be interpreted in the context of each study protocol and setting, and these limitations should be borne in mind when counseling women. Aside from type of uterine incision and number of previous CSs, other factors that influence the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC (e.g. gestational age and method of closure of uterine incision at the previous CS, endometritis and wound scar infection complicating the previous CS, prior uterine rupture, interbirth interval) should also be considered during counseling. Some of these are discussed further in Section 5 on the factors affecting the probability of successful VBAC.

### A survey of access to trial of labor in California hospitals in 2012 [^116UnbrQ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Since 1996 the number of women undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) has dropped sharply, due in part to two sets of guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Following a widely publicized study and increasing malpractice concerns around TOLACs, ACOG in 1998 revised its guidelines for women desiring a vaginal birth after a cesarean. The 1998 guideline differed from the earlier 1994 guideline by limiting TOLAC to women with one or two prior cesareans but kept in place the previous requirement that a physician capable of performing a cesarean should be "readily available" and that anesthesia be available. Then, in 1999, ACOG re-issued its guideline in which the only changes were to replace physicians be 'readily available' with "immediately available", and stipulated that 24-hour in-hospital anesthesia should also be available. In the wake of these guidelines, the cesarean delivery rate in the United States rose from 21% to 32.8% between 1996 and 2010 and the vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) rate (per 100 women with a prior cesarean) dropped from 28% to 8%. In response to the rising cesarean rate, the decline in VBAC, and the intense focus on a rare outcome (0.5% for uterine rupture among TOLAC women), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) convened a Consensus Development Conference Panel in March 2010 to address key questions surrounding the practice of TOLAC. A systematic literature review by a panel of experts showed that for women with one or two prior low transverse uterine incisions, both TOLAC and elective repeat cesarean delivery carry important risks and benefits, which differ for the woman and the fetus. Given the available evidence, the Panel concluded that TOLAC "is a reasonable option for many pregnant women" and that efforts are needed to ensure that women with a prior cesarean are supported in making informed decisions about trial of labor versus an elective repeat cesarean. "When [TOLAC] and elective repeat cesarean delivery are medically equivalent options", the Panel's statement encourages a shared decision-making process that, whenever possible, allows the woman's preference to be honored.

### Evaluation of factors that predict the success rate of trial of labor after the cesarean section [^115fff8a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Population and data sources

In this retrospective study, all the patients who delivered at Northwest Women's and Children's Hospital from January 2016 to December 2018 with a history of cesarean section and voluntarily selected TOLAC after cesarean section were recruited. The inclusion and exclusion criteria of the subjects were comprehensively referred to the VBAC guidelines developed by the Royal Academy of Obstetrics and Gynecology in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. The TOLAC inclusion criteria were as follows: ① a history of cesarean section and a transverse incision of the lower uterus; ② ≥ 37 gestation weeks and singleton live birth; ③ pelvis with normal shape and size; ④ the time of having the previous cesarean section was more than 2 years; ⑤ no contraindications to vaginal trial. Exclusion criteria were as follows: ① a history of uterine rupture during previous delivery; ② a history of two or more cesarean sections, or the last cesarean section was a classical one with a longitudinal incision of the uterus; ③ discontinuity of the anterior wall muscle layer of the lower uterine segment; ④ last cesarean section obstetric indications still existed; ⑤ suffering from other serious medical or obstetric complications.

Perinatal management

Pregnant women were given full intrapartum management throughout their pregnancy including nutrition education and weight management. The delivery methods including the condition of pregnancy status, risk of childbirth for vaginal delivery and dissection were comprehensively evaluated and informed by at least 2 doctors with the position of deputy directors and above to the pregnant women and their families. Pregnant women were asked to provide a written informed consent prior to the study enrolment. If there was no indication of induction of labor, vaginal labor would be expected. If induction of labor was indicated, the method selected was according to the maturity of the cervix. During the process of vaginal trials, pregnant women were accompanied by an experienced midwife and fetal heart rate was continuously monitored for the preparation of cesarean section surgery at any time. If the delivery time exceeded 8 h, it should be reassessed whether the delivery was suitable for vaginal delivery, and patients would be transferred to cesarean section if necessary. If signs of abnormal fetal heart rate, threatened uterine rupture or uterine rupture were found, emergency cesarean section were implemented to deliver the fetus as soon as possible, and prepared for newborn resuscitation.

### Impact of health literacy and primary language on the decision to pursue trial of labor after prior cesarean delivery [^112Lw2Np]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of the PROCEED trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02646423; registration date: 2015–12–15), which was conducted between January 2016-January 2019 at three academic medical centers and two community sites and examined the effect of a patient-centered decision support tool on rates of TOLAC, VBAC and decision quality. At all study sites, usual care for patients with a prior cesarean included counseling by the provider regarding delivery approach (TOLAC vs. ERCD). Details of the trial have been published previously. Briefly, English- or Spanish-speaking pregnant people with one prior cesarean delivery, no prior VBAC, no known absolute contraindication to trial of labor (e.g. prior classical or T incision cesarean delivery, prior uterine surgery), and a singleton gestation between 12 weeks 0 days and 24 weeks 6 days were randomized to use or not use a decision support tool regarding delivery approach that was provided on an electronic tablet. Both groups otherwise received usual care at their clinical sites, including counseling by a clinician regarding delivery approach. Because rates of cesarean delivery have been shown to differ by the social construct of race and ethnicity, participant self-reported race and ethnicity were obtained. Between 34 weeks 0 days and 37 weeks 6 days of gestation, patient-reported outcomes were assessed during a telephone interview conducted by a research staff member who was unaware of group assignment. Delivery approach (TOLAC or ERCD) and mode (VBAC or repeat cesarean delivery [RCD]) were ascertained postpartum via medical record review conducted by clinician investigators, who also were unaware of the randomization group. This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board at each of the participating sites. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study enrollment. The datasets used and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

6 SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND SITUATIONS

6.1 Multiple pregnancy and VBAC

Shinar et al.performed a systematic review of VBAC success rates and maternal and neonatal outcomes in twin pregnancy versus planned repeat CS. They evaluated 2336 VBAC cases and 5763 planned repeat CS cases. Rates of successful VBAC and of uterine rupture were 72.2% (95% CI, 59.7–83.2) and 0.87% (95% CI, 0.51–1.31), respectively. VBAC was associated with a significantly higher risk of neonatal death (which the authors theorized may have been influenced by preterm birth), with no significant differences in mean gestational age at birth, NICU admission, or Apgar score < 7 at 5 min. The risk of maternal infectious morbidity was significantly lower with VBAC, while the risks of uterine scar dehiscence, blood transfusions, and hysterectomy were comparable.

A systematic review and meta‐analysis by Kabiri et al.included 8209 twin pregnancies with previous CS, of which 2484 underwent VBAC and 5725 had a planned repeat CS. Although the rate of uterine rupture was higher in the VBAC group compared with the planned repeat CS group, the rates of uterine rupture and successful VBAC were similar for women with twins and those with singleton pregnancies. Women who attempted VBAC with twins did not have increased risks of uterine scar dehiscence, hemorrhage, blood transfusion, or neonatal morbidity and mortality compared with women who had planned repeat CS.

Guidelines or information for providers

Seven non-concurrent cohort studies in the US examined VBAC rates before and after guidelines or information for providers were implemented (Table 5). Kosecoff et al. compared VBAC rates in 1979 and 1980 (35 and 64 women, respectively) before the National Institutes of Health conference recommendations, with rates in 1981 to 1982 (70 women); a greater proportion of women had a TOLAC (5.7 and 11.0% pre- versus 28.6% post-recommendations) and a VBAC (5.7 and 6.3% pre- versus 15.7% post-recommendations) after the conference recommendations (adjusted positive linear trend of 2.4 [5.8%] for TOLAC and 2.1 [4.5%] for VBAC). Another study comparing before (1987–1988) and after (1988–1991) the ACOG practice guidelines were implemented reported that VBAC rates increased by 5.6 percentage points as a result of the guideline and its information dissemination. Pinette et al. also compared rates of VBAC before (1998) and after (1999–2001) ACOG guidelines were revised to require the presence of surgical personnel throughout a trial of labour, and found a marked decline in hospital VBAC data (relative risk 3.5, 95% CI 3.1–4.2, p < 0.01), citing factors such as patient refusal post-counselling, inability of institutions to meet requirements, and lack of support from the obstetric service. Zweifler et al. examined the effect of the ACOG revision to provide immediate cesarean capability (1996 to 1999 versus 2000 to 2002, before versus after, respectively) and found that there were comparatively fewer TOLACs (24.0% before versus 13.5% after guideline revision, p < 0.001) and successful VBACs among women with TOLACs (82.8% [41,961 of 50,670 deliveries] before versus 81.8% [19,273 of 23,573 deliveries] after guideline revision). In a study focused on the impact of state-legislated practice guidelines, the authors reported that dissemination alone did not significantly increase the VBAC rate (7151 of 23,142 deliveries; 30.9% post-guideline in 1993) compared with the years leading up to the change (4816 of 22,091 deliveries [21.8%] in 1990; 5540 of 21,461 deliveries [25.6%] in 1991; and, 6133 of 22,970 deliveries [26.7%] in 1992). A study compared intrapartum management of women with prior cesareans before (1986–1987) and after (1988–1989) hospital guideline changes incorporated centralized decision-making, and found that rates of TOLAC increased from 31.7% (139 out of 438 women in 1986) to 84.0% (487 out of 580 women in 1989; p < 0.0001), and that the proportion of these women with subsequent VBACs also increased (from 64.7% [90 out of 139 women in 1986] to 82.8% [403 out of 487 women in 1989, p < 0.0001). Bellows et al. examined changes to hospital policies for TOLAC eligibility and labor induction guidelines; the authors reported that while the "overall VBAC rate" (number of women with a prior cesarean who had a VBAC) increased (26.0% pre- versus 33.0% post-guidelines, p < 0.0001), the "VBAC rate" (number of women who underwent a TOLAC and had a successful VBAC) was unchanged (78.9% pre- versus 78.1% post-guidelines, p = 0.75).

### Factors associated with successful vaginal birth after a cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113DKkrf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Historic maternal and fetal factors

Having experienced a vaginal birth (VB), either before CS or after CS, tripled the success rates of VBAC. Moreover, the previous VBAC was a stronger predictor of success than previous VB before CS. These findings can further confirm that the history of past vaginal deliveries is of the utmost importance. Previous VB also related to the lower rate of uterine rupture.

Indications for previous CS have important implications for the chance for VBAC. CPD, dystocia or failure to progress, failed induction, and suspected fetal macrosomia were risk factors for failed VBAC. Although the above conditions might not be present in the next pregnancy, the indications for previous CS could help us to identify the VBAC candidates.

Current maternal and fetal factors

Increased age decreases the likelihood of VBAC. Women with advanced age were more likely to fail to VBAC, which was also supported by Eden et al. Age ≥ 40 years-old was also a risk for uterine rupture when women undertook TOLAC. So, younger women, especially those < 35-years-old, are more likely to have a successful and safe VBAC.

Maternal obesity carries the risk for many obstetric complications including macrosomia and increased risk of CS. Both obesity and macrosomia have negative impacts on VBAC success. When comparing cases where obesity occurred at pre-pregnancy or at admission before delivery, the trends are similar. Faucett et al. found that women with obesity were more likely to undergo emergency cesarean for an arrest disorder before achieving active labor despite having more clinical interventions to achieve a vaginal birth. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which maternal obesity affects the progression of labor, might help to increase the rates of successful VBAC among this population. Maternal obesity was also associated with a high risk of uterine dehiscence or rupture at term gestation among women with previous CS. Therefore, appropriate weight and weight gain during pregnancy are vital for maternal health.

### Vaginal birth after two previous cesarean sections versus elective repeated cesarean: a retrospective study [^116KBX9a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) is a common practice worldwide but the evidence is still scant regarding this practice in women who underwent 2 previous cesareans. The purpose of this study is to retrospectively review our experience with vaginal birth after two previous cesarean sections (VBA2C), with specific attention to the indications for previous cesarean and to the women's motivation for attempting trial of labor.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in a primary care hospital between January 2011 and December 2019. Inclusion criteria were: singleton pregnancies, absence of morphological abnormalities at ultrasonographic screening of the second trimester (or at any other stage of pregnancy), and two previous cesarean sections.

Results

The final analysis included 114 cases for maternal and neonatal outcomes. In total, 40.4% of women chose trial of labor after two cesarean delivery (TOLA2C group). TOLA2C was associated with a success rate of 76.1%, a higher gestational age at birth, and a shorter hospital stay, compared with elective repeated cesarean delivery group. There were no significant differences in the rate of Apgar scores at 5minutes < 7 between both groups. The percentage of successful TOLA2C in women with prior vaginal delivery was 92.8%. Factors related to failed TOLA2C included failure to progress (3/11, 27.3%), nonreassuring fetal heart rate (3/11, 27.3%), and no onset of spontaneous labor after premature rupture of membranes (5/11, 45.4%). In the group of TOLA2C, more than 70% accepted to travel more than 45minutes to reach our hospital, with the aim to attempt VBA2C.

Conclusion

TOLA2C is a possible option for both mothers and neonates in selected cases. Adequate counseling about pros and cons of TOLA2C is mandatory. The woman's motivation represents a key element to determine the success of VBA2C.

Key Points

· Selection of candidates and motivation of the patients represent key elements for successful TOLA2C. · A careful record of obstetrical history and previous deliveries can provide clinicians useful information. · Mode of delivery in women with two previous cesareans is strongly associated with doctor's counseling.

### Labor characteristics and intrapartum interventions in women with vaginal birth after cesarean section [^115W8HYb]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cesarean section (CS) rate worldwide has increased from 10% to 21% over the past 15 years with a continuously increasing trend annually by 4%. It's worth noting that half of all unnecessary caesareans occur in Brazil and China. This has aroused a significant global concern due to the economic burden and the increased complications after CS, especially in China after the implementation of "universal two-child policy". Women following a CS opt to have a second child either by repeated cesarean section (RCS) or vaginal birth after cesarean section (VBAC). Due to the surgical indication of uterine scar, the phrase 'once a cesarean, always a cesarean' has always been repeatedly supported.

However, some studies suggest that RCS does not appear to produce the benefits previously attributed to it. Actually, RCS increased respiratory morbidity, hospital costs and the length of hospital stay in neonates. VBAC, as a relevant factor in decreasing overall CS rate, not only shows a lower incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), embolism disease and infection, but also offers advantages in terms of reducing health-care costs, enhancing patient satisfaction, and facilitating faster recovery from giving birth. Therefore, VBAC should be encouraged in women with a prior low transverse cesarean birth rather than RCS.

Currently, most studies focus on the success factors and risks of planned VBAC, and the maternal and neonatal outcomes of VBAC. However, we know little about labour characteristics and intrapartum interventions. Therefore, in this study, we identified the differences in the characteristics of labor, intervention measures and perinatal outcomes between women who had a VBAC and primipara or multipara women who did not undergo VBAC, providing clinical evidence of labour management for women who are planning a VBAC.

### Safety and efficacy of vaginal birth after cesarean attempts at or beyond 40 weeks of gestation [^113bBrdw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare rates of vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) failure and major complications in women attempting VBAC before and after the estimated date of delivery (EDD) METHODS: This was a 5-year retrospective cohort study in 17 university and community hospitals of women with at least 1 prior cesarean delivery. Women who attempted VBAC before the EDD were compared with those at or beyond 40 weeks of gestation. Logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between delivery beyond the EDD and VBAC failure or complication rate.

Results

A total of 11,587 women in the cohort attempted VBAC. Women past 40 weeks of gestation were more likely to have a failed VBAC. After controlling for confounders, the increased risk of a failed VBAC beyond 40 weeks remained significant (31.3% compared with 22.2%, odds ratio 1.36, 95% confidence interval 1.24–1.50). The risk of uterine rupture (1.1% compared with 1.0%) or overall morbidity (2.7% compared with 2.1%) was not significantly increased in the women attempting VBAC beyond the EDD. When the cohort was defined as 41 weeks or more of gestation, the risk of a failed VBAC was again significantly increased (35.4% compared with 24.3%, odds ratio 1.35, 95% confidence interval 1.20–1.53), but the risk of uterine rupture or overall morbidity was not increased.

Conclusion

Women beyond 40 weeks of gestation can safely attempt VBAC, although the risk of VBAC failure is increased.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^114xiJzj]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

The downward trend in VBAC began in 1996, following the publication of an article by McMahon and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine. The McMahon study, which was conducted in Nova Scotia, Canada, reported that major obstetrical complications were nearly twice as likely in the trial of labor group as in those women who underwent an elective repeat cesarean. The concern that was generated by this study, along with increasing liability pressure on obstetricians, prompted ACOG to publish a revised set of guidelines in 1999. Although ACOG concluded that most women should continue to be counselled about VBAC and offered a trial of labor, the language regarding physician availability was changed from "readily available" to "immediately available throughout active labor" [, p. 198]. The ACOG guidelines also specified that "VBAC should be attempted in institutions equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care" [p. 201]; this recommendation, however, was based primarily on consensus and expert opinion, rather than on research evidence.

After considering the potential impact of the guidelines on VBAC availability, particularly in community and rural hospitals, ACOG later clarified that the operational definition of "immediately available" was subject to interpretation by the local institution. This clarification did not stop the downward trend, however. In 2001, another influential article appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, which further precipitated the decline in VBAC. Authored by Lydon-Rochelle et al, this article reported that the risk of uterine rupture was higher among those women with a previous cesarean whose labor was induced; moreover, induction with prostaglandins conferred a much higher relative risk of uterine rupture. Associated editorials and subsequent media attention following the publication of this article directed the focus toward the rare complication of uterine rupture instead of highlighting the potential benefits of VBAC and the risks of multiple cesareans. As a result, VBAC rates steadily declined over the next decade, to the current rate of 8.2% nationwide (Figure 1).

3 RISK OF UTERINE RUPTURE DURING VBAC

The major concern regarding VBAC, and the main reason why clinicians hesitate to offer it, is uterine rupture — a complication that can severely affect both mother and fetus, often requires transfusion, and can lead to an emergency hysterectomy. The risk of uterine rupture differs according to the type of uterine incision that was performed and the number of previous CSs, but overall, the risk is infrequent, with an average rate of 0.3%. In a study of 17 898 women with a history of CS who underwent VBAC, the overall rate of uterine rupture was 0.7%. The rates of uterine rupture were 0.7% for women with a prior low uterine segment transverse incision, 2% for those with a prior low vertical incision, 1.9% with a prior classical, inverted T, or J incision, and 0.5% for those with an unknown type of prior incision. Another study of 18 794 women who birthed at ≥ 28 weeks of gestation after previous CS reported a uterine rupture rate of 0.5%. In a systematic review of 14 studies including 4254 women with previous CS, uterine rupture and scar dehiscence occurred in 2.1% of the women. A meta‐analysis of patients undergoing VBAC after two previous CSs reported a uterine rupture rate of 1.36%. Macones et al.reported that uterine rupture occurred in 1.8% of 1082 women with two previous CSs who underwent VBAC. In a retrospective review by Cahill et al.of 860 women with ≥ 3 prior CSs, 89 had VBAC and there were no cases of uterine rupture. These studies support that the overall risk of uterine rupture remains low even in women with > 1 previous CS. Therefore, more emphasis should be given to identifying women with good potential for successful VBAC.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^116Di34T]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Although access to VBAC remains very limited in Florida, there has been little effort to date by leaders in obstetrics or public health to address the issue. The recommendations from the NIH VBAC Consensus Conference urged ACOG to reconsider the requirement for immediately availability in order to increase women's access. Although ACOG responded with a liberalized set of guidelines and encouraged obstetricians to consider women's autonomy, there was virtually no change to the immediately available requirement. In light of what the providers in this study have said about the ubiquitous nature of this policy, it seems unlikely that allowing patients "to accept increased levels of risk" will invoke much change in access to VBAC in Florida without tort reform and a cooperative statewide effort.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^112vLfiS]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

According to ACOG, the intent of the guidelines was to improve patient safety, not to decrease access to VBAC. As this small study reveals, however, the barriers for providers are substantial. Clearly, more research is needed on the impact of practice guidelines on providers as well as the women they serve.

### Prior childbirth experience and attitude towards subsequent vaginal birth after one caesarean delivery in lagos, Nigeria: a cross-sectional study [^115Lk481]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Though planned VBAC compared to ERCD is associated with a lower risk of maternal mortality, a shorter length of hospital stay, and a higher likelihood of breastfeeding, there is an increased risk of serious maternal complications such as uterine rupture, as well as a higher risk of perinatal/neonatal mortality and some types of neonatal morbidity. Other risks include those of blood transfusion, puerperal sepsis, surgical injury as well as an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes as documented in a population-based cohort study of women with term singleton pregnancies and no contraindications to VBAC where planned VBAC was compared to ERCD. TOLAC complications arise mainly from the need for emergency repeat CD in cases in which VBAC has not been achieved. These complications can be minimized with good patient selection by identifying parturient likely to achieve a successful VBAC and those not. Appropriate intrapartum monitoring is also imperative.

Several factors such as the client's acceptability of TOLAC, Obstetricians' willingness to offer it and the facility available affect the adoption of TOLAC. Although not all women with prior CD may be eligible for TOLAC; in well-selected cases, as many as 75% have successful vaginal delivery.

Despite abounding evidence that clients' attitudes may be contributory to the uptake of VBAC, the client factor has not been extensively explored. It is well-known that experiences that emerged in prior childbirth may be related to acceptance or refusal of a particular mode of delivery.

At the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, Ikeja, the CD rate is alarming at 40%. We investigated prior childbirth experiences; delivery route preferences and future reproductive plans of pregnant women with one previous CD. This group serves as a major reservoir for repeat CD and may play a significant role in the rising incidence of CD. We also highlight factors associated with preference for subsequent vaginal delivery after one previous CD.

### Committee opinion. induction of labor for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery [^111fPoyu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

A recent population-based study of vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) attempts observed uterine rupture rates of 24.5 per 1,000 with prostaglandin-induced labor, while the uterine rupture rates with spontaneous labor and labor induced without prostaglandins were lower (5.2/1,000 and 7.71/1,000 respectively). The authors did not confirm the diagnoses by examining individual medical records, so the actual incidence of uterine rupture may have been overstated. Despite this limitation, the Committee on Obstetric Practice concludes that the risk of uterine rupture during VBAC attempts is substantially increased with the use of various prostaglandin cervical ripening agents for the induction of labor, and their use for this purpose is discouraged.

### Providers' perspectives on the vaginal birth after cesarean guidelines in Florida, United States: a qualitative study [^1169qaUF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

In areas where VBAC is unavailable, women with a previous cesarean are forced to undergo a repeat cesarean or to travel a considerable distance from their homes to find a healthcare provider who will attend them. Some women also opt for a home delivery because they cannot find obstetricians or midwives who can or will attend them in the hospital. In fact, frustration over a lack of access to VBAC has spawned a grass-roots activist movement to restore the "right" to give birth vaginally after a previous cesarean. Concern over these issues prompted a second NIH VBAC Consensus Conference in March 2010. Although the original intent of the guidelines was to improve patient safety, the evidence presented at this conference suggested that the current policy has not improved outcomes. Women undergoing a repeat cesarean have a significantly increased risk of maternal mortality, abnormal placentation in subsequent pregnancies, and chronic pain from adhesions later in life. Repeat cesarean is also more costly than VBAC due to increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and increased hospital length of stay compared with VBAC. Although ACOG published a revised set of guidelines following the Consensus Conference, there was essentially no change in the language surrounding immediate availability. The guidelines did state, however, that "patients should be allowed to accept increased levels of risk" if they were clearly informed of the increased risks and management alternatives [, p.458].

Given the national mandate to increase access, it is important to explore the factors that either enable providers to offer or constrain them from offering VBAC. The Florida case may be instructive insofar as the state has among the highest cesarean rates (37.2%) and lowest VBAC rates (0.7%) in the United States. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore providers' perspectives on the effect of the ACOG VBAC guidelines in Florida. The specific aims were to examine the barriers associated with these guidelines, as well as the strategies that providers used to continue to offer VBAC in the current litigious climate.

### Results of the national study of vaginal birth after cesarean in birth centers [^111AtHyg]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Some women wish to avoid a repeat cesarean delivery and believe that a midwife-supported vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) in a nonhospital setting represents their best chance to do so; there is a small, persistent demand for out-of-hospital VBACs. We conducted a study to obtain the data necessary to formulate an evidence-based policy on this practice.

Methods

We prospectively collected data on pregnancy outcomes of 1,913 women intending to attempt VBACs in 41 participating birth centers between 1990 and 2000.

Results

A total of 1,453 of the 1,913 women presented to the birth center in labor. Twenty-four percent of them were transferred to hospitals during labor; 87% of these had vaginal births. There were 6 uterine ruptures (0.4%), 1 hysterectomy (0.1%), 15 infants with 5-minute Apgar scores less than 7 (1.0%), and 7 fetal/neonatal deaths (0.5%). Most fetal deaths (5/7) occurred in women who did not have uterine ruptures. Half of uterine ruptures and 57% of perinatal deaths involved the 10% of women with more than 1 previous cesarean delivery or who had reached a gestational age of 42 weeks. Rates of uterine rupture and fetal/neonatal death were 0.2% each in women with neither of these risks.

Conclusion

Despite a high rate of vaginal births and few uterine ruptures among women attempting VBACs in birth centers, a cesarean-scarred uterus was associated with increases in complications that require hospital management. Therefore, birth centers should refer women who have undergone previous cesarean deliveries to hospitals for delivery. Hospitals should increase access to in-hospital care provided by midwife/obstetrician teams during VBACs.

### Factors associated with successful vaginal birth after a cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112thLJ7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

Based on the meta-analyses, the following factors were associated with a successful VBAC: previous VB before CS, previous VBAC, White race, higher bishop score, and fetal malpresentation as the indication for previous CS. The following factors were associated with an unsuccessful VBAC: advanced age, obesity, diabetes, HDCP, non-white race, macrosomia, labor induction, and CPD, dystocia or FTP, failed induction as the indications for previous CS. The following factors are not statistically associated with VBAC success: smoke, interdelivery interval, gestational weeks, epidural anesthesia during labor, and the indications for previous CS (fetal distress, HDCP, and suspected fetal macrosomia).

Understanding the influences of factors on VBAC could provide sufficient evidence to assess chances for achieving a successful vaginal delivery among women with prior CS. It also could help the clinician provide evidence-based counseling about VBAC, which has important implications on avoiding repeated CS. The evidence quality was considered moderate on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.

Strengths and limitations

This meta-analysis is the most recent that comprehensively, critically, and quantitatively assesses the association between maternal or fetal factors and the chances for achieving a successful VBAC, including factors both from the historical and current pregnancies. It is also the first large study to specifically evaluate the association between obesity, diabetes, HDCP, gestational weeks, interdelivery interval and VBAC success. However, this study has limitations. First, there might be pertinent studies that were not identified owing to inherent limitations in database literature searches. Second, the quality of evidence is limited by data largely derived from retrospective observational analyses, with heterogeneous data reporting and study design. Third, after subgroup analyzed by study size, location, and study design, I 2 heterogeneity was still high in some meta-analysis, which might result from the change of the guidelines on VBAC or guidelines varying in different countries. Forth, there was publication bias in the meta-analyses of the SMD of age and the OR of BMI, which might be because positive results are more likely to be published compared to null studies and almost these studies showed the similar trends of the factors related to VBAC. Five, some studies did not present adjusted OR; however, the pooled unadjusted OR was similar to the adjusted OR.

Uterine rupture

A recent systematic review of 10 studies including 212 440 cases that described uterine rupture demonstrated that uterine rupture was significantly higher in the VBAC group than in the planned repeat CS group (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.57–7.15; P < 0.00001). Among 47 202 patients in four studies reviewed by Guise et al.the risk of uterine rupture in the VBAC and planned repeat CS groups was 0.47% and 0.026%, respectively, with the VBAC group having a significantly higher risk of uterine rupture (RR 20.74, 95% CI 9.77–44.02; P < 0.001). On average, uterine rupture occurs in approximately 325/100 000 women undergoing VBAC across all gestational ages, and 778/100 000 women at term. In contrast, the risk of uterine rupture for women undergoing a planned repeat CS is 26/100 000 women when all gestational ages are evaluated, and 22 per 100 000 women at term.

Hysterectomy

The overall risk of hysterectomy is statistically similar for VBAC and planned repeat CS (157 vs. 280 per 100 000 women respectively: moderate grade of evidence). In the study by Fitzpatrick et al.the absolute risk of hysterectomy varied from 0% to 0.12% for planned VBAC and 0%–0.61% for planned repeat CS. Twelve of the 14 studies included in the review found no significant difference in the risk of hysterectomy between the VBAC and planned repeat CS groups, while one study found a reduced risk of hysterectomy for VBAC and one reported a higher risk associated with VBAC. Peripartum hysterectomy is most likely performed due to uterine rupture during VBAC and placenta accreta spectrum conditions in planned repeat CS cases.

Postpartum hemorrhage

A meta‐analysis of 13 studies by Chen and Mi, which compared 1892 cases of VBAC with 1703 cases of planned repeat CS, found no statistically significant difference in the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) between VBAC and planned repeat CS (2.17% vs. 4.40%; OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.51–1.34, P = 0.45).

### Labor outcomes with increasing number of prior vaginal births after cesarean delivery [^1128CgBr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the success rates and risks of an attempted vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) according to the number of prior successful VBACs.

Methods

From a prospective multicenter registry collected at 19 clinical centers from 1999 to 2002, we selected women with one or more prior low transverse cesarean deliveries who attempted a VBAC in the current pregnancy. Outcomes were compared according to the number of prior VBAC attempts subsequent to the last cesarean delivery.

Results

Among 13,532 women meeting eligibility criteria, VBAC success increased with increasing number of prior VBACs: 63.3%, 87.6%, 90.9%, 90.6%, and 91.6% for those with 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more prior VBACs, respectively (P < .001). The rate of uterine rupture decreased after the first successful VBAC and did not increase thereafter: 0.87%, 0.45%, 0.38%, 0.54%, 0.52% (P = .03). The risk of uterine dehiscence and other peripartum complications also declined statistically after the first successful VBAC. No increase in neonatal morbidities was seen with increasing VBAC number thereafter.

Conclusion

Women with prior successful VBAC attempts are at low risk for maternal and neonatal complications during subsequent VBAC attempts. An increasing number of prior VBACs is associated with a greater probability of VBAC success, as well as a lower risk of uterine rupture and perinatal complications in the current pregnancy.

### Obstetric outcomes in women with two prior cesarean deliveries: is vaginal birth after cesarean delivery a viable option? [^1145quA6]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study was undertaken to compare clinical outcomes in women with 1 versus 2 prior cesarean deliveries who attempt vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) and also to compare clinical outcomes of women with 2 prior cesarean deliveries who attempt VBAC or opt for a repeat cesarean delivery.

Study Design

We performed a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study, in which the medical records of more than 25,000 women with a prior cesarean delivery from 16 community and tertiary care hospitals were reviewed by trained nurse abstractors. Information on demographics, obstetric history, medical and social history, and the outcomes of the index pregnancy was obtained. Comparisons of obstetric outcomes were made between women with 1 versus 2 prior cesarean deliveries, and also between women with 2 prior cesarean deliveries who opt for VBAC attempt versus elective repeat cesarean delivery. Both bivariate and multivariate techniques were used for these comparisons.

Results

The records of 20,175 women with one previous cesarean section and 3,970 with 2 prior cesarean sections were reviewed. The rate of VBAC success was similar in women with a single prior cesarean delivery (75.5%) compared with those with 2 prior cesarean deliveries (74.6%), though the odds of major morbidity were higher in those with 2 prior cesarean deliveries (adjusted odd ratio[OR] = 1.61 95% CI 1.11–2.33). Among women with 2 prior cesarean deliveries, those who opt for a VBAC attempt had higher odds of major complications compared with those who opt for elective repeat cesarean delivery (adjusted OR = 2.26, 95% CI 1.17–4.37).

Conclusion

The likelihood of major complications is higher with a VBAC attempt in women with 2 prior cesarean deliveries compared with those with a single prior cesarean delivery. In women with 2 prior cesarean deliveries, while major complications are increased in those who attempt VBAC relative to elective repeat cesarean delivery, the absolute risk of major complications remains low.

### Cesarean versus vaginal delivery: whose risks? Whose benefits? [^115XrvdW]. American Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

We reviewed the risks and benefits of vaginal and cesarean delivery to help frame the inherent trade-offs that should be considered as part of the informed consent discussion between patients and providers. We performed a targeted literature review for common complications of childbirth. Approximately 30% of women will experience a maternal or neonatal complication during childbirth. Both cesarean and vaginal delivery is associated with well-known measurable short- and long-term maternal and neonatal complications and benefits. Childbirth is not risk free. There are data available that can guide the informed consent process with objective quantifiable data that patients and providers can use to weigh risks and benefits of delivery methods.

### Analysis of the uterine rupture during pregnancy and delivery in a provincial maternal and children care hospital in China: 2013–2022 [^114aWyrY]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

A meta-analysis showed that TOLAC results in a 0.27% higher risk of uterine rupture. Four patients attempted a TOLAC in the second-trimester uterine rupture, and all four received oxytocin. TOLAC requires comprehensive management and assessment of the entire labor process and high-risk factors for pregnant women. A uterine rupture should be considered in all women undergoing a TOLAC if any of the following occurs: hypotension, a sudden change in contraction pattern, fetal bradycardia, sudden abdominal pain, hematuria, loss of fetal station, or vaginal bleeding. The expert consensus in our country lists a history of two or more uterine surgeries as a contraindication for TOLAC. Because pregnant women in mid-pregnancy have an early gestation age and only 6/12 of them exhibit clinical symptoms, it is less likely to suspect uterine rupture. Since the clinical symptoms of uterine rupture were atypical and might easily be misdiagnosed as preterm delivery. Two patients were sent to hospital by their family members 6 h after abdominal pain, they both experienced postpartum hemorrhage, and one underwent hysterectomy. This also indicates that the two pregnant women and their families lack sufficient understanding of uterine rupture. A risk-graded early warning system for pregnant women in the second trimester with a history of uterine surgery should be attempted to establish. The possibility of uterine rupture should be highly suspected for pregnant women in the second trimester with persistent abdominal pain, abdominal effusion, and fetal distress. When an induction of labor is unavoidable in the middle and late stages of pregnancy for women with scarred uterus, it is necessary to closely monitor the situation of abdominal pain; and one should be vigilant about the possibility of uterine rupture. At the same time, physical examination and monitoring of vital signs are also very important. If a pregnant woman in the second trimester with scarred uterus who choose TOLAC should fully understand the pros and cons of VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean section), and have close monitoring and management in the entire labor process, with timely assessment.

6.3 Induction and augmentation of labor during

A meta‐analysis of 14 cross‐sectional studies that included 48 457 women who attempted VBAC showed a significantly higher rate of VBAC success in the spontaneous labor group compared with the induced labor group (74.3% vs. 60.7%; P = 0.001) and a significantly lower rate of uterine rupture (0.7% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.0003). The rate of uterine rupture in women using oxytocin in VBAC was significantly higher than in women not using oxytocin (1.4% vs. 0.5%; P = 0.0002). In addition, the rate of uterine rupture following oxytocin augmentation among women with spontaneous labor was lower than in women who were induced, although the difference was not significant (1.7% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.443).

Observational studies have reported rates of uterine rupture of 0.4%–0.52% for spontaneous labor, 0.77%–0.9% for labor induced without prostaglandins, 0%–2.45% for labor induced with prostaglandins alone, 1.4% for labor induced with prostaglandins with or without oxytocin, 1.1% for labor induced with oxytocin alone, and 0.9% for augmented labor. A Cochrane review that evaluated methods of labor induction for women with a previous CS concluded that there was insufficient evidence and the studies were underpowered to determine the optimal method of labor induction in women with a prior CS.

Based on available evidence, current guidelines recommend the use of mechanical methods, such as amniotomy and transcervical extra‐amniotic Foley catheter, over prostaglandins for cervical ripening and induction of labor in women with a previous CS. Misoprostol (prostaglandin E 1) should not be used for cervical ripening and induction of labor because it is associated with an increased risk of uterine rupture in women with a previous CS. Some studies have suggested that low dose dinoprostone (prostaglandin E 2) is a safe option for induction of labor in women undergoing VBAC, with no appreciable increase in rates of uterine rupture or maternal and perinatal mortality when compared with women undergoing a spontaneous VBAC.

Compared with induction of labor at > 41 weeks, induction at 39–41 weeks is associated with lower odds of CS and greater odds of VBAC success. Gestational age ≥ 41 weeks increases the odds of uterine rupture.

### Establishment of an antepartum predictive scoring model to identify candidates for vaginal birth after cesarean [^111rCAzv]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

As for the medical history, various characteristics are predictive of VBAC success. For instance, a previous vaginal delivery has been associated with a high rate of successful delivery. Ashwal et al. demonstrated that VBAC prediction is difficult in women without previous vaginal deliveries. The 2015 Queensland Clinical Guidelines state that previous vaginal birth, whether before or after a cesarean, is a strong predictor of successful TOLAC. We also found that previous vaginal delivery is the most significant variable in the multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR, 4.795). Similar to the results of other studies, TOL before a prior CD increases the likelihood of VBAC except in the cases with dystocia as a CD indication. The stagnation of the labor process and the failure of the fetal head to descend decrease the likelihood of VBAC. In 2010, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also stated that one of the predictors of successful VBAC was the absence of dystocia as a prior CD indication. As for the optimal interval of a subsequent pregnancy after CD to minimize adverse outcomes of pregnancy, most investigations have shown that 2–3 years after the prior CD seem appropriate, considering the healing of uterine scar (prolonged intervals change the scar toughness and may lead to uterine ruptures). Rietveld et al. showed that an interpregnancy interval < 24 months was not associated with decreased VBAC success and that success rates decreased when the interval increased. Bujold and Gauthier found that an interdelivery interval < 18 months presented a higher risk factor of uterine rupture than intervals of 18–24 and > 24 months. García-Benítez et al. also considered that an interdelivery interval > 18 months is safe. Thus, the evidence suggests that an interval between 2 and 4 years increases the likelihood of successful VBAC.

### ACOG releases guidelines for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery… [^111SqJiE]. AAFP (2004). Low credibility.

ACOG notes that only a few studies have documented the relative safety of VBAC in smaller community hospitals or facilities where resources may be more limited. The report adds that women who fail a trial of labor are at risk for several maternal complications, including uterine rupture, the need for transfusion, hysterectomy, endometritis, and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Criteria for selecting candidates for VBAC include the following: one previous low-transverse cesarean delivery; clinically adequate pelvis; no other uterine scars or previous rupture; a physician immediately available throughout active labor who is capable of monitoring labor and performing an emergency cesarean delivery; and the availability of anesthesia and personnel for emergency cesarean delivery. RISKS AND BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH VBAC Repeat cesarean delivery and VBAC both have risks.

Successful VBAC generally is associated with shorter maternal hospitalizations, fewer infections, less blood loss and fewer transfusions, and fewer thromboembolic events than cesarean delivery. However, a failed trial of labor may be associated with major maternal complications, such as hysterectomy, uterine rupture, operative injury, increased maternal infection, need for transfusion, and neonatal morbidity. Multiple cesarean deliveries are associated with an increased risk of placenta previa and accreta. INDUCTION OR AUGMENTATION OF LABOR A successful VBAC is more likely to result from spontaneous labor than labor induction or augmentation. The report states that evidence shows that cervical ripening with prostaglandin preparations increases the likelihood of uterine rupture. Misoprostol also has been associated with a high rate of uterine rupture in women with a previous cesarean delivery.

The report recommends not using prostaglandins for induction of labor in most women with a previous cesarean delivery.
- Epidural anesthesia may be used for VBAC. The following recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence:

- Women with a vertical incision within the lower uterine segment that does not extend into the fundus are candidates for VBAC.
- The use of prostaglandins for cervical ripening or induction of labor in most women with a previous cesarean delivery should be discouraged.
- Vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery is contraindicated in women with a previous classical uterine incision or extensive transfundal uterine surgery.

### Planning for labor and vaginal birth after cesarean delivery… [^114xdaFs]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Women who have had a previous vaginal birth have a high probability of VBAC; physicians should encourage these women to plan for LAC/VBAC unless specific contraindications exist.
- In women who have had a previous cesarean delivery and who are in the third trimester, misoprostol should not be used for cervical preparation or induction of labor. Because of the higher risk of uterine rupture, LAC/VBAC are not options for women who have had a vertical uterine incision or a vertical upward extension of a transverse incision, or women who have had transmural uterine surgery. Women who have had a previous vaginal birth have a high probability of VBAC. Based on higher quality evidence, the AAFP recommends that physicians encourage these women to plan for LAC/VBAC unless specific contraindications exist. If VBAC is not available, patients should be referred to a facility or physician who can provide it.

Because there is little evidence about characteristics, other than previous vaginal delivery, that strongly affect VBAC rates, physicians should talk with patients about reasons for a previous cesarean delivery. Inducing labor is suitable for women who are planning a VBAC and who have indications. The method used affects the risk of uterine rupture. In women who have had a previous cesarean delivery and who are in the third trimester, misoprostol should not be used for cervical preparation or induction of labor. The incidence of infection does not appear to be significantly higher in women undergoing LAC/VBAC compared with repeat cesarean delivery. A variety of factors can affect the risk of uterine rupture. Although uncommon, it can be fatal; therefore, when evaluating the benefits and harms of LAC/VBAC, the plan should be individualized to the patient based on her risk factors.

Perinatal mortality is increased with LAC/VBAC compared with repeat cesarean delivery. The rates of transient tachypnea are higher with repeat cesarean delivery; however other respiratory complications were lower with planned repeat cesarean delivery. Women who intend to have a repeat cesarean delivery have an increased risk of uterine rupture, abnormal placentation, hysterectomy, and possible surgical complications with each pregnancy in the future. Women who have had several cesarean deliveries may not have the choice to undergo LAC/VBAC.

### ACOG updates recommendations on vaginal birth after… [^1141MG2P]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Because most maternal morbidity during TOLAC occurs when repeat cesarean delivery becomes necessary, VBAC is associated with fewer complications than elective repeat cesarean delivery, and failed TOLAC is associated with more complications. The outcome of TOLAC that most significantly increases the risk of maternal and neonatal morbidity is uterine rupture or dehiscence. The incidence of uterine rupture varies, but the risk is higher in women with a history of hysterotomies. The location of the prior uterine incision influences risk. The safety of VBAC has been questioned in women who had a previous cesarean delivery with an unknown incision type. However, two case series reported similar rates of successful VBAC between women with unknown previous incision types and those with previous low transverse incisions. No significant association was noted between unknown incision types and rates of uterine rupture.

Therefore, TOLAC is not contraindicated in women who have had one previous cesarean delivery with an unknown incision type, unless there is high clinical suspicion of a previous classical incision. There is limited evidence that the risk of uterine rupture is greater in women who have not had a previous vaginal delivery and who are attempting TOLAC with a macrosomic fetus. It is important to note, however, that these data are based on actual — not predicted — birth weight, thus limiting their applicability when making delivery decisions antenatally. Although previous and predicted birth weights should be considered when making delivery decisions, suspected macrosomia alone is not a contraindication for TOLAC. Labor Management Several studies have noted an increased risk of uterine rupture after labor induction in women attempting TOLAC.

Although labor can be induced for maternal or fetal indications in women attempting TOLAC, physicians should counsel the patient that it increases risk of uterine rupture and decreases the possibility of successful VBAC. Studies of specific prostaglandins are limited, but generally indicate that the risk of uterine rupture may vary among agents. Evidence from small studies shows that the use of misoprostol increases the risk of uterine rupture in women who have had previous cesarean deliveries. Therefore, this agent should not be used for third trimester cervical ripening or labor induction in women who have had a previous cesarean delivery or major uterine surgery.

### Vaginal birth after cesarean… [^111MH6aB]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

The guideline, Labor After Cesarean/Planned Vaginal Birth After Cesarean, was developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians. It was approved by the Board of Directors in 2014 and an executive summary was published in the Annals of Family Medicine on January 12, 2015. Read the full recommendation for further details. These recommendations are provided only as assistance for physicians making clinical decisions regarding the care of their patients. As such, they cannot substitute for the individual judgment brought to each clinical situation by the patient's family physician. As with all clinical reference resources, they reflect the best understanding of the science of medicine at the time of publication, but they should be used with the clear understanding that continued research may result in new knowledge and recommendations. These recommendations are only one element in the complex process of improving the health of America.

To be effective, the recommendations must be implemented.

### ACOG urges a cautious approach to vaginal birth after cesarean delivery… [^111f11pu]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

According to ACOG, no randomized trials have proved that maternal and neonatal outcomes are better with VBAC than with repeat cesarean delivery. Published evidence suggests that the benefits of VBAC outweigh the risks in most women. However, reports note that maternal and infant complications also are associated with an unsuccessful trial of labor. These developments have led to a more circumspect approach to a trial of labor than was previously indicated. ACOG emphasizes that it is ultimately up to the physician and patient to decide whether to attempt VBAC. The following are the criteria that ACOG lists for identifying a candidate for VBAC: One or two previous low-transverse cesarean deliveries. Clinically adequate pelvis. No other uterine scars or previous rupture. Physician immediately available throughout active labor capable of monitoring labor and performing an emergency cesarean delivery. Availability of anesthesia and personnel for emergency cesarean delivery.

VBAC should not be undertaken in women who have had a previous classic or T-shaped incision or other transfundal uterine surgery. Other contraindications for VBAC are a contracted pelvis; medical or obstetric complication that precludes vaginal delivery; and inability to perform emergency cesarean delivery because of the lack of an available surgeon, appropriate anesthesia, sufficient staff or appropriate facility. The following recommendations from ACOG, based on consistent scientific evidence, have been excerpted from the practice pattern: Most women with one previous cesarean delivery with a low-transverse incision are candidates for VBAC and should receive counseling about VBAC and be offered a trial of labor. Epidural anesthesia may be used for VBAC. A previous uterine incision extending into the fundus is a contraindication to VBAC.

The following recommendations, according to ACOG, are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence: Women with two previous low-transverse cesarean deliveries and no contraindications who wish to attempt VBAC may be allowed a trial of labor. They should be advised that the risk of uterine rupture increases as the number of cesarean deliveries increases. Use of oxytocin or prostaglandin gel for VBAC requires close patient monitoring. Women with a vertical incision within the lower uterine segment that does not extend into the fundus are candidates for VBAC. The following recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion: Because uterine rupture may be catastrophic, VBAC should be attempted in institutions equipped to respond to emergencies with physicians immediately available to provide emergency care.
