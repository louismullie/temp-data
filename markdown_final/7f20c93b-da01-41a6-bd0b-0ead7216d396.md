## Question

Bactrim inpact on potassium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) affects potassium, including its mechanism, dose and patient risk factors, magnitude of risk, monitoring and mitigation strategies, and special populations, culminating in a practical clinical recommendation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic mechanism by which trimethoprim alters potassium handling. Then, I should verify dose-related effects and typical time course. Next, I will examine patient-specific risk factors and quantify absolute and relative risks from observational data. After that, I need to check guideline-based monitoring and management advice, including drug–drug interactions. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise clinical recommendation with safety checkpoints.

> Let me first confirm the mechanism, because if I get this wrong, downstream risk stratification will be off. Trimethoprim blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal nephron, mimicking amiloride and reducing sodium reabsorption while decreasing lumen-negative potential, which impairs ROMK-mediated potassium secretion and can cause a dose-related, reversible hyperkalemia; this is mechanistically distinct from true GFR decline and is typically reversible on discontinuation [^113dEY7u] [^1117gkQr] [^11313iDV].

> Wait, let me verify the dose relationship and time course before I overgeneralize. High-dose regimens used for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (for example, trimethoprim 15–20 mg/day) are consistently associated with a substantial incidence of hyperkalemia, and even standard outpatient doses can precipitate hyperkalemia in susceptible patients; clinically meaningful potassium rises often emerge within 2–6 days of initiation, with risk accumulating over the first week of therapy [^113dEY7u] [^112nuPQe] [^114PMouU].

> I need to check which patient factors amplify risk, because pretest probability drives monitoring intensity. Risk increases with baseline CKD or eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m², older age, diabetes, and baseline potassium at the high end of normal. Critically, concomitant drugs that impair potassium excretion or raise serum potassium — ACE inhibitors, ARBs, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists such as spironolactone, potassium-sparing diuretics like amiloride or triamterene, and NSAIDs — synergistically increase hyperkalemia risk, and the interaction with spironolactone is particularly pronounced [^113dEY7u] [^116C7QHU] [^115t4iUb] [^116pTnuv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk without anchoring to population data. In a large matched cohort of adults aged 66 and older, TMP-SMX increased hospital encounters with hyperkalemia (≥ 5.5 mmol/L) within 14 days versus amoxicillin, with a relative risk around 3.4 and an absolute risk difference that escalates as eGFR falls; in patients with eGFR less than 30, the absolute risk difference approaches 1.45% over 14 days, and in those on spironolactone, the adjusted odds ratio for hyperkalemia admission exceeds 12 compared with amoxicillin, with a population attributable fraction near 60% for this combination [^116C7QHU] [^115t4iUb] [^116pTnuv].

> I should double-check dose effects in real-world cohorts to ensure consistency. High-dose outpatient TMP-SMX is associated with higher odds of hyperkalemia than lower-dose regimens, and in hospitalized HIV cohorts, hyperkalemia requiring intervention occurs more frequently with high-dose therapy. Mechanistically, the ENaC blockade is concentration dependent, which supports a dose–response relationship for potassium retention [^115pbXZz] [^114PMouU] [^1162pCgx].

> Next, I should review guideline and label-based monitoring recommendations so I don't miss standard-of-care steps. FDA labeling advises close serum potassium monitoring in patients with renal insufficiency, disorders of potassium metabolism, or when coadministered with drugs that raise potassium; UK kidney guidance similarly urges caution with trimethoprim in CKD or when combined with RAAS inhibitors, and HIV opportunistic infection guidance highlights hyperkalemia as a common adverse effect necessitating routine monitoring during therapy, especially at higher doses [^113dEY7u] [^113uFQi8] [^114Z9B3a] [^111DMqNH].

> Let me think about practical mitigation, because prevention is preferable to treatment. When feasible, avoid TMP-SMX in patients with eGFR less than 30, in older adults on spironolactone or dual RAAS blockade, or in those with baseline potassium above 4.5–5.0 mEq/L; if TMP-SMX is necessary, use the lowest effective dose and shortest duration, ensure adequate hydration, and check baseline potassium and creatinine, then recheck potassium within 2–4 days of initiation and again by day 7–10, with earlier checks if interacting drugs are present or baseline risk is high; if hyperkalemia occurs, discontinue TMP-SMX when possible, as removal of the offending agent is the most reliable way to reverse the ENaC-mediated potassium retention [^113dEY7u] [^112amNq7] [^116C7QHU].

> But wait, what if discontinuation would compromise infection control and an interim strategy is needed. Case-based evidence suggests that fludrocortisone, a mineralocorticoid agonist, can stabilize potassium within 1–2 days in TMP-SMX–induced hyperkalemia, allowing continuation of essential therapy in select cases; I should confirm this is reserved for carefully selected patients with close monitoring, recognizing that this is off-label and not a substitute for dose reduction or drug cessation when possible [^112Jbu1n].

> I will now examine special populations where my threshold for avoidance or intensified monitoring should be lower. In older adults, particularly those over 65, hyperkalemia is among the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions with TMP-SMX, and geriatric pharmacokinetics show higher trimethoprim exposure and lower renal clearance, increasing risk. In patients with HIV receiving high-dose therapy for PCP, hyperkalemia is common and often coexists with creatinine elevations, warranting early and frequent electrolyte checks. In those with advanced CKD or on dialysis, dose reduction or avoidance is advised, with dialysis-specific dosing algorithms applied when TMP-SMX must be used [^113bHcUU] [^1113ZJfu] [^114Z9B3a] [^111aC8tQ] [^115uyNcC] [^111AWTKc].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought TMP-SMX might directly reduce GFR and thereby cause hyperkalemia, but I should correct that. Trimethoprim can raise serum creatinine without reducing true GFR by inhibiting tubular secretion of creatinine, so apparent "renal impairment" on labs may be misleading; the primary potassium mechanism remains ENaC blockade with impaired kaliuresis, not a primary reduction in filtration, which is why hyperkalemia can occur even when creatinine changes are modest or artifactual [^11313iDV] [^115chpcP].

> Let me reconsider the clinical bottom line to ensure internal consistency. TMP-SMX increases serum potassium via ENaC blockade in a dose-related, reversible fashion; risk is highest with high-dose regimens, in CKD, the elderly, and when combined with RAAS inhibitors or MRAs, especially spironolactone; absolute risk is small in the general population but clinically meaningful in high-risk subgroups, and the interaction with spironolactone is sufficiently strong that avoidance of TMP-SMX is prudent when alternatives exist; when TMP-SMX is necessary, use the lowest dose for the shortest duration, ensure hydration, and monitor potassium within 2–4 days, escalating frequency with additional risk factors or interacting drugs [^113dEY7u] [^116C7QHU] [^115t4iUb] [^116pTnuv] [^112amNq7].

---

Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) can cause **hyperkalemia** by inhibiting renal potassium excretion via ENaC blockade in the distal nephron [^1162pCgx], with risk rising in CKD, the elderly, and when combined with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics [^1113ZJfu] [^114vimtH] [^115t4iUb]. Hyperkalemia usually occurs within days of initiation, is dose-related, and can be severe or life-threatening, especially in high-risk patients [^112amNq7] [^116yFVgv]. Baseline potassium and renal function should be checked before starting therapy, with repeat potassium monitoring within 3–5 days and after any dose change; **avoid Bactrim in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m²** or those on interacting drugs when alternatives exist [^116yFVgv]. If hyperkalemia occurs, stop Bactrim and treat promptly [^113bHcUU] [^113uFQi8].

---

## Mechanism of hyperkalemia

Trimethoprim **blocks ENaC** in the distal nephron, reducing sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion, mimicking amiloride and causing potassium retention [^1162pCgx]. This mechanism is **independent of aldosterone**, so hyperkalemia can occur even with normal or low aldosterone levels [^notfound].

---

## Risk factors for hyperkalemia with Bactrim

Several patient- and treatment-related factors **increase hyperkalemia risk** with Bactrim:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Renal impairment | Reduced potassium excretion; risk rises as eGFR declines [^113dEY7u] [^116C7QHU] |
| Elderly patients | Age-related decline in renal function and altered pharmacokinetics [^113bHcUU] |
| High-dose therapy | Especially for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia [^113dEY7u] [^114PMouU] |
| Concomitant medications | - ACE inhibitors <br/> - ARBs <br/> - Potassium-sparing diuretics <br/> - NSAIDs <br/> - Potassium supplements [^1162pCgx] [^115pbXZz] [^115t4iUb] [^113DJX36] |
| Underlying conditions | - Diabetes mellitus <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - Liver disease <br/> - Adrenal insufficiency [^116z2yMe] [^116omAWy] |

## Incidence and severity of hyperkalemia

Incidence varies by population and dose: in older adults, hospital encounters with hyperkalemia occurred in 0.46% on TMP-SMX vs 0.14% on amoxicillin (RR 3.36) [^116C7QHU]. In hospitalized HIV patients, hyperkalemia occurred in 36% and was more frequent with high-dose regimens [^114PMouU]. Severity ranges from **mild asymptomatic cases to life-threatening arrhythmias**; risk is highest in patients with renal impairment or on interacting drugs [^113dEY7u] [^116C7QHU].

---

## Clinical presentation of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia may be **asymptomatic** or present with:

- Muscle weakness or paralysis
- Cardiac arrhythmias (peaked T waves, widened QRS, ventricular fibrillation) [^116z2yMe]
- Bradycardia or cardiac arrest
- Nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias [^116z2yMe]

---

## Monitoring and management strategies

### Monitoring

- **Baseline assessment**: Check serum potassium and renal function before starting Bactrim [^112amNq7].
- **Early follow-up**: Recheck potassium within 3–5 days of initiation or dose change [^notfound].
- **Ongoing monitoring**: Adjust frequency based on renal function, dose, and concomitant medications [^113dEY7u] [^115pbXZz].

---

### Management

- **Discontinue Bactrim**: Stop therapy immediately if hyperkalemia occurs [^113bHcUU].
- **Standard hyperkalemia treatment**: Use calcium gluconate, insulin with glucose, beta-agonists, sodium bicarbonate, and loop diuretics as indicated [^notfound].
- **Dialysis**: Consider in severe cases or when pharmacologic measures fail [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **risk assessment**, **dose adjustment**, and **monitoring**:

- **Avoidance**: Use caution or avoid in patients with eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m² or those on ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or potassium-sparing diuretics [^113uFQi8] [^116C7QHU] [^115t4iUb].
- **Dose adjustment**: Reduce dose by 50% in moderate renal impairment (CrCl 15–30 mL/min) [^115uyNcC].
- **Monitoring**: Close potassium monitoring is recommended in high-risk patients [^113dEY7u] [^113RRnHU].

---

## Alternative antibiotics

Consider alternatives in high-risk patients, such as:

- **Nitrofurantoin**: For uncomplicated UTIs [^notfound].
- **Fosfomycin**: For uncomplicated UTIs [^notfound].
- **Cephalosporins**: Such as cefalexin [^117HdMFG].
- **Fluoroquinolones**: Such as ciprofloxacin (use with caution due to other risks) [^117HdMFG].

---

Bactrim can cause **hyperkalemia** via ENaC blockade, with risk amplified by renal impairment, high doses, and interacting drugs. Baseline potassium and renal function should be checked before therapy, with early potassium monitoring and prompt management of hyperkalemia; consider alternatives in high-risk patients [^113dEY7u] [^116C7QHU].

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^112t7zw8]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

This cohort covers the years 1997–2015, and we have shown a progressive increase in the odds of developing hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury after a UTI in more recent years. The increase in hyperkalaemia may be due to an increased rate of blood testing in primary care (particularly among groups at risk of high potassium levels, such as patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) or improved automatic recording of test results in general practice records. The marked increase in acute kidney injury over time as defined by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) coding is well established and likely to be predominantly related to increased clinical focus and the adoption of consensus definitions defined by changes in creatinine levels. By adjusting for calendar period we aimed to minimise the influence of these secular trends on our results.

In contrast to previous studies, we did not identify an increased risk of death from any cause in users of trimethoprim. The two previous papers that identified an increased risk of sudden death among users of renin-angiotensin system blockade taking co-trimoxazole, used a case-control design with cases defined by sudden death, among residents of Ontario over 18 years of follow-up. They were therefore well powered for this outcome. We chose all cause death as a prespecified analysis owing to lack of power for cause specific death, since we restricted the cohort to patients with a UTI to address issues of confounding by indication for antibiotic choice that had limited previous research. In addition, since our cohort was not restricted to users of renin-angiotensin system blockers, the overall risk of sudden death was likely to be lower in our study. However, acknowledging these limitations, our findings of an odds ratio of death (comparing trimethoprim with amoxicillin) within seven days of a UTI of 1.51 (95% confidence interval 0.87 to 2.65) among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers are consistent with those of Fralick et al (adjusted odds ratio 1.38, 95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.76). However, our study also had greater ability to adjust for detailed characteristics, such as estimated glomerular filtration rate before UTI, which are likely to have reduced residual confounding. While we cannot exclude a small increase in the odds of sudden death after trimethoprim use among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers, we have found no evidence of an association between trimethoprim use and death in the whole population of older adults, and sudden death is a rare outcome (1.1% (6 in 542) of total deaths within 14 days of antibiotic initiation among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: a matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

Methods

We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada involving adults ≥ 66 years of age newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58 999) matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

Results

A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58 999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58 999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin {RR 3.36 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31]}. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44 and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15 (95% CI 2.82–3.51)] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43 (95% CI 1.34–1.53)].

Conclusions

The 14-day risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia was higher in patients newly treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and the risk was highest in patients with a low eGFR.

Cystoisosporiasis in HIV — monitoring and adverse events: "People treated for cystoisosporiasis should be monitored for clinical response and adverse events". In people with HIV, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is "commonly associated with side effects, such as rash, fever, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated transaminase levels, and hyperkalemia". For ciprofloxacin, adverse effects "include prolong QT intervals and tendonitis and tendon rupture", and for pyrimethamine, "side effects include bone marrow suppression". The guideline reiterates that "IRIS has not been described in this population".

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^1119zRPJ]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We calculated descriptive statistics for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of cases and controls, as well as standardised differences to test for differences between the two groups. Standardised differences of less than 0.1 indicate a good balance between the cases and controls for a given covariate.

We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for the association between hyperkalaemia related hospital admission and receipt of a prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the preceding 14 days, using amoxicillin treated patients as the reference group. We selected amoxicillin as the reference antibiotic because, with rare exceptions, it should not cause hyperkalaemia. To test the specificity of our findings, we also examined the association between hyperkalaemia and prescription of nitrofurantoin or norfloxacin, antibiotics commonly used to treat community acquired urinary tract infections. We hypothesised that these drugs would not be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia relative to amoxicillin. We used multivariable conditional logistic regression to adjust for medical conditions and classes of prescription drugs that may influence the risk of hyperkalaemia (see web appendix). To ascertain whether a dose-response relation existed between trimethoprim and hyperkalaemia, we repeated our primary analysis, stratifying exposure to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole according to prescription for single strength (400 mg/80 mg) or double strength (800 mg/160 mg) tablets. Finally, we determined the population attributable fraction, defined in this study as the fraction of all cases (exposed and unexposed) that would not have occurred if exposure to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole had been avoided. We used SAS version 9.2 for all analyses.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114vimtH]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Clinical implications

Recent national prescribing guidance recommends nitrofurantoin as the first line choice for treating UTIs in adults, with trimethoprim an equivalent choice for those with low risk of antimicrobial resistance, meaning that trimethoprim will continue to be commonly prescribed. Current British National Formulary prescribing guidelines for trimethoprim mention an unquantified risk of hyperkalaemia (but not acute kidney injury), and a possible increase in risk if given with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor antagonists, and spironolactone. Given the different rates of outcomes within subgroups of the population, it is useful to consider absolute and relative risk together by calculating the excess number of events attributable to trimethoprim treatment, although our very strict definition of a UTI means that these estimates should be treated with caution. As an example, our results suggest that for 1000 UTI episodes treated with antibiotics in those aged 65 and over not taking renin-angiotensin system blockers, treatment with trimethoprim, instead of amoxicillin, would result in one additional case of hyperkalaemia and two of acute kidney injury. Among those taking either renin-angiotensin system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics the figures would be very similar; two additional cases of both hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. However, treatment with both renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics would result in 18 additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 11 of acute kidney injury.

A small increased absolute risk of a rare outcome (such as in the general population) from trimethoprim may be acceptable when set against a need for multiple treatment options for patients with allergy to other antibiotics or bacterial resistance patterns. While acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia may result in avoidable morbidity and hospital admission, it is reassuring that we have not identified an increased risk of death, suggesting that there is appropriate response to these outcomes. Our results show that trimethoprim continues to be prescribed to people at high risk of adverse outcomes including patients with advanced renal impairment and those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers with potassium-sparing diuretics. For groups at high risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, other antibiotics should be considered, but, if this is not possible, monitoring of renal function and potassium levels should be performed, in line with the existing summary of product characteristics for trimethoprim.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^1148ZfsU]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion

Our results show that trimethoprim is associated with greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia compared with other antibiotic drugs for a UTI, among the general population aged 65 and over, and not just those treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, this is not associated with an increased risk of death.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112Vqm1o]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacodynamic drug–drug interactions with antihypertensive medications — cautionary combinations include any antihypertensive medication with NSAIDs (reduced BP lowering via sodium retention) or venlafaxine (reduced BP lowering), nondihydropyridine CCB with beta blockers (bradycardia or atrioventricular block), and several ACEi pairings: with ARBs (AKI, hyperkalemia), potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, eplerenone, triamterene, amiloride; hyperkalemia), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (hyperkalemia), potassium supplements (hyperkalemia), or NSAIDs (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen; AKI); additional cautions include clonidine, methyldopa, or guanfacine with CNS depressants (sedation) and clonidine with noncardioselective BB (unopposed alpha agonism upon BB withdrawal leading to hypertensive crisis). Advantageous combinations noted are dihydropyridine CCB with a RAS inhibitor (reduced risk of dihydropyridine CCB-induced lower leg swelling), RAS inhibitors with diuretics (balanced effects on serum potassium with diminished possibility for hypokalemia or hyperkalemia), RAS inhibitors with a potassium binder (lowers risk of hyperkalemia from the RAS inhibitor), and diuretic with potassium supplement (lowers risk of hypokalemia from the diuretic).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^116pTnuv]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objectives

To characterise the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia in elderly patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with spironolactone.

Design

Population based nested case-control study.

Setting

Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 1992 to 1 March 2010.

Participants

Cases were residents of Ontario aged 66 years or above receiving chronic treatment with spironolactone and admitted to hospital with hyperkalaemia within 14 days of receiving a prescription for either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. Up to four controls for each case were identified from the same cohort, matched on age, sex, and presence or absence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and required to have received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the case's index date.

Main Outcome Measures

Odds ratio for association between admission to hospital with hyperkalaemia and receipt of a study antibiotic in the preceding 14 days, adjusted for conditions and drugs that may influence risk of hyperkalaemia.

Results

During the 18 year study period, 6903 admissions for hyperkalaemia were identified, 306 of which occurred within 14 days of antibiotic use. Of these, 248 (81%) cases were matched to 783 controls. 10.8% (17,859/165,754) of spironolactone users received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared with amoxicillin, prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a marked increase in the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia (adjusted odds ratio 12.4, 95% confidence interval 7.1 to 21.6). The population attributable fraction was 59.7%, suggesting that approximately 60% of all cases of hyperkalaemia in older patients taking spironolactone and treated with an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection could be avoided if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not prescribed. Treatment with nitrofurantoin was also associated with an increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 1.3 to 4.6), but no such risk was found with norfloxacin (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 0.8 to 3.4)

Conclusions

Among older patients receiving spironolactone, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a major increase in the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia. This drug combination should be avoided when possible.

### Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia in older adults compared with other antibiotics used to treat UTIs [^115oidKL]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Context

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in older adults. Trimethoprim is a first-line antibiotic prescribed in the UK for acuteuncomplicated UTI. Trimethoprim reduces potassium excretion in the distal nephron, which can cause elevated potassium levels. This is of particular importance in older adults, who are more likely to have comorbidities requiring prescription of additional medicines that may predispose them to hyperkalaemia, such as renin-angiotensin antagonists (RAA).

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^1167HhiX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^1117gkQr]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Spironolactone is a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist used to treat systolic heart failure, resistant hypertension, ascites, and hyperaldosteronism. The prescribing of spironolactone increased considerably after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), which showed that the drug could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Although spironolactone was generally well tolerated in that study, serious hyperkalaemia is an important consideration for patients receiving the drug in clinical practice. Subsequent research has shown that hyperkalaemia occurs in up to a third of patients receiving spironolactone, emphasising the need for regular monitoring of electrolytes and the avoidance of other drugs that can cause hyperkalaemia.

The antibiotic trimethoprim has structural and pharmacological similarities to the potassium sparing diuretic amiloride and reduces urinary potassium excretion by approximately 40%. The inhibition of potassium secretion results in a dose related antikaliuretic effect that may predispose susceptible people to clinically important hyperkalaemia. In combination with sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim is commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and spironolactone are both widely used drugs, the likelihood of co-prescription is high. However, the risk of hyperkalaemia associated with the combined use of these drugs has not been systematically studied, and evidence supporting a clinically meaningful drug interaction is limited to case reports. We therefore sought to characterise the significance of this drug interaction in clinical practice.

Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) therapy monitoring and adverse events — trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) toxicity and management are outlined: Careful monitoring is important to evaluate response and detect toxicity, and follow-up after therapy includes assessment for early relapse; adverse reactions to TMP-SMX are high (20% to 85% of patients), with common effects including rash (30% to 55% of patients), fever (30% to 40% of patients), leukopenia (30% to 40% of patients), thrombocytopenia (15% of patients), azotemia (1% to 5% of patients), hepatitis (20% of patients), and hyperkalemia, and supportive care for these common adverse effects should be attempted before TMP-SMX is discontinued (AIII), with symptomatic treatments such as antihistamines, antiemetics, and antipyretics; alternative agents have characteristic toxicities, including methemoglobinemia and hemolysis with dapsone or primaquine in those with G6PD deficiency.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim PO:
- **Hyperkalemia**: use caution in patients with pre-existing risk factors (e.g., renal disease, advanced age). Monitor serum potassium levels in patients with risk factors for developing drug-induced hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia occurs, discontinue Trimethoprim PO, manage potassium levels appropriately, and consider alternative treatment options if necessary.
- **Pseudomembranous colitis**: use caution presenting with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Use Trimethoprim judiciously and avoid unnecessary or prolonged use to reduce the risk of pseudomembranous colitis. If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue Trimethoprim, initiate appropriate treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, and consider alternative antibiotics if necessary.

MR antagonists

Due to the pivotal role of aldosterone in the control of potassium homoeostasis, MR antagonist (MRA) therapy is a risk factor for hyperkalemia. In a meta-analysis of RCTs conducted in > 16 000 patients with heart failure or after myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia (defined by the individual studies as [K +] > 5.5 or 6.0 mM) occurred in 4.3% of patients allocated to placebo versus 9.3% of patients allocated to MRAs.

Famously, dangerous hyperkalemia became more common after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES) study, which demonstrated a morbidity and mortality benefit from spironolactone therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Large-scale data linkage in a Canadian population revealed that the rates of both hospitalization for hyperkalemia and in-hospital hyperkalemia-related mortality more than doubled after the publication of RALES in September 1999.

In animal models and in Phase 1/2 clinical trials, novel non-steroidal MR antagonists have a more favourable therapeutic index than spironolactone or eplerenone — that is, they carry a lower risk of hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses in heart failure and proteinuric CKD.

Other drugs

Large data-linkage studies are helping to quantify the risk of hyperkalemia associated with other medications. For example, trimethoprim prescription for urinary tract infection (compared with alternative antibiotics) was associated with a small increase in the odds of hyperkalemia in patients > 65 years of age. For every 1000 infections, treatment with trimethoprim rather than amoxicillin results in one to two cases of hyperkalemia in an unselected population. In keeping with the pervasive concept that risk is potentiated when drugs that predispose to hyperkalemia are prescribed in combination in patients also taking RAS inhibitors or MRAs, trimethoprim would cause ∼18 additional cases of hyperkalemia.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^112UH94N]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Our results show that in older patients in the general population, regardless of use of renin-angiotensin system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics, treatment with trimethoprim for a urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with a 72% increase in the odds of acute kidney injury and a greater than doubling of the odds of hyperkalaemia compared with amoxicillin. We also show that ciprofloxacin is associated with a 48% increase in the odds of acute kidney injury compared with amoxicillin. In contrast, no antibiotic was associated with increased risk of death within 14 days compared with amoxicillin. The relative risks of acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death were similar in the general population and among those prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers after trimethoprim use for a UTI.

Strengths and weaknesses of this study

This is the first study to quantify the association of trimethoprim with these outcomes, for an unselected general population cohort after a UTI. Our study used a large number of routine, prospectively collected clinical records from a UK general practice database that is broadly representative of the UK population. Our results are therefore generalisable to all patients aged 65 and over, in contrast to previous research restricted to select populations (eg, patients taking renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics). We have investigated the risk of adverse outcomes after taking antibiotics prescribed for a UTI, thereby reducing the confounding by indication that has limited previous research. As we investigated the effect of trimethoprim alone, we can be clear about the likely causative agent compared with research on the combination product co-trimoxazole.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^117HdMFG]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine if trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death in the general population.

Design

Cohort study.

Setting

UK electronic primary care records from practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database.

Participants

Adults aged 65 and over with a prescription for trimethoprim, amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, or nitrofurantoin prescribed up to three days after a primary care diagnosis of UTI between April 1997 and September 2015.

Main Outcome Measures

The outcomes were acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death within 14 days of a UTI treated with antibiotics.

Results

Among a cohort of 1191905 patients aged 65 and over, 178238 individuals were identified with at least one UTI treated with antibiotics, comprising a total of 422514 episodes of UTIs treated with antibiotics. The odds of acute kidney injury in the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were higher following trimethoprim (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.24) and ciprofloxacin (1.48, 1.03 to 2.13) compared with amoxicillin. The odds of hyperkalaemia in the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were only higher following trimethoprim (2.27, 1.49 to 3.45) compared with amoxicillin. However, the odds of death within the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were not higher with trimethoprim than with amoxicillin: in the whole population the adjusted odds ratio was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.07) while among users of renin-angiotensin system blockers the odds of death within 14 days of antibiotic initiation was 1.12 (0.80 to 1.57). The results suggest that, for 1000 UTIs treated with antibiotics among people 65 and over, treatment with trimethoprim instead of amoxicillin would result in one to two additional cases of hyperkalaemia and two admissions with acute kidney injury, regardless of renin-angiotensin system blockade. However, for people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers and spironolactone treatment with trimethoprim instead of amoxicillin there were 18 additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 11 admissions with acute kidney injury.

Conclusion

Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia compared with other antibiotics used to treat UTIs, but not a greater risk of death. The relative risk increase is similar across population groups, but the higher baseline risk among those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics translates into higher absolute risks of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia in these groups.

### Medication-related adverse events and discordancies in cystatin C-based vs serum creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate in patients with cancer [^112WZ1rw]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

There were 235 patients who received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole within 90 days of the baseline date and had their serum potassium level checked within 30 days (eFigure 1 in Supplement 1). Grade 2 hyperkalemia was numerically higher in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr compared with the eGFR-concordant group (29 of 129 [22%] vs 11 of 92 [12%]; p = 0.07) (Figure 3 B). A similar pattern was found when evaluating the rate of grade 3 hyperkalemia (defined as potassium level > 6.0 mEq). There was also a nonsignificant increase in grade 2 hyperkalemia in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr (3 of 14 patients [21%]), but there were no episodes of grade 3 hyperkalemia in these patients (Figure 3 B). The mean increase in potassium level after initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was higher in patients with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr compared with patients with concordant eGFR and those with an eGFRcys that was more than 30% higher than the eGFRcr (eFigure 3 in Supplement 1).

### Serum potassium influencing interacting drugs: risk-modifying strategies also needed at discontinuation [^114sDAGP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Although the discontinuation of a medication may have important clinical consequences, there is generally much less attention given to medication surveillance when a drug is stopped than when it is started.

Objective

To investigate the consequences on serum potassium levels of discontinuing a drug that increases the serum potassium level (PID↑) and a drug that decreases the serum potassium level (PLD↓) in patients taking both.

Methods

Patients who were hospitalized in the University Medical Centre Utrecht in 2004–2009 and were using both a PID↑ and a PLD↓ were included when one of these drugs was discontinued during hospitalization. Serum potassium levels measured before (potassium(1)) and after (potassium(2)) discontinuation were compared in patients who stopped the PLD↓ and in patients who stopped the PID↑.

Results

In the group of patients who stopped the PLD↓ (ie, continued the PID↑), mean serum potassium levels increased 0.19 mEq/L (range -0.9 to 1.8 mEq/L). After discontinuation of the PLD↓, serum potassium levels increased in 91 (59%) patients. Five patients (3.2%) developed hyperkalemia (potassium(2) > 5.5 mEq/L). In the group of patients who stopped the PID↑ (ie, continued the PLD↓), mean serum potassium levels decreased 0.40 mEq/L (range -2.6 to 0.7 mEq/L). Serum potassium levels decreased in 61 (70%) patients after discontinuation of the PID↑. Fifteen patients (17%) developed hypokalemia (potassium(2) < 3.5 mEq/L). Results were not influenced by length of stay, age, sex, renal function, and type of medication discontinued.

Conclusions

The effects of serum potassium-influencing drugs need to be monitored not only after starting but also after stopping the medication. The same may hold true for the effects of other drugs. Clinical risk management should therefore focus on the risks not only when new medication is prescribed, but also when medication is stopped.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^116otiLc]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Results in context

Multiple historic case reports and case series have implicated co-trimoxazole as a cause of reduced renal function, interstitial nephritis, or acute tubular necrosis. Among patients receiving co-trimoxazole in hospital, 6% developed a creatinine based definition of acute kidney injury that was attributed to the antibiotics. However, we believe our study to be the first to show and quantify an association between trimethoprim alone and acute kidney injury in the general population. This is an important distinction as the sulphonamide antibiotics (including sulfamethoxazole) have been long recognised to be associated with a substantial risk of acute renal impairment, which could have been assumed to be causal. Our finding of an association of ciprofloxacin with acute kidney injury is similar to another population based study that showed that users of fluoroquinolones had a 2.18-fold (95% confidence interval 1.74 to 2.73) higher rate of acute kidney injury. However, ciprofloxacin is recommended for treatment of pyelonephritis, so an association with acute kidney injury may be due to confounding by severity of infection.

An association between both co-trimoxazole, or trimethoprim alone, with hyperkalaemia is well reported, particularly in association with renin-angiotensin system blockers. Our results suggest that, regardless of other drug use (renin-angiotensin system blockers or potassium-sparing diuretics), trimethoprim (but not ciprofloxacin), is associated with a more than doubling of the odds of hyperkalaemia. There is an additional increase in the odds of hyperkalaemia after a UTI for those prescribed renin-angiotensin system blockers, and greater than sixfold increase in association with concomitant use of a potassium-sparing diuretic, regardless of antibiotic choice. Our findings are in keeping with those of a Canadian nested case-control study of older patients taking renin-angiotensin system blockers that identified a nearly sevenfold increased risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia with co-trimoxazole compared with other antibiotic drugs.

### The non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction [^113DJX36]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Drug-drug interactions with finerenone have been investigated in healthy male volunteers. Finerenone is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the gut wall and liver. Accordingly, concomitant use of finerenone with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, cobicistat, telithromycin or nefazodone is contraindicated since a marked increase in finerenone exposure is expected. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice (both CYP3A4 inhibitors) should not be consumed during finerenone. Furthermore, finerenone should not be used concomitantly with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St. John´s Wort) which are expected to markedly decrease finerenone plasma concentration. Other drugs should be used with precautions during finerenone treatment including erythromycin, verapamil and fluvoxamine since increased plasma concentrations have been reported increasing the risk of hyperkalemia. Because of an increased risk for hyperkalemia, finerenone should not be co-administered with potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. amiloride or triamterene) or with other MRAs, and monitoring of potassium is required with the concomitant use of potassium supplements and trimethoprim, or trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole. The risk of hypotension increases with concomitant use of other antihypertensive drugs. The combination therapy of finerenone with sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors has been recently discussed. It seems that this combination mediates additional beneficial actions in terms of further reducing cardiorenal risk and attenuating side effects, especially hyperkalemia. Prospective randomized clinical trials are currently being conducted to demonstrate the benefit of such a combination therapy.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^113RRnHU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):
- **Antimicrobial resistance**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as the use of TMP/SMX in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.
- **Blood dyscrasias**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, and other blood dyscrasias.
- C. difficile infection: maintain a high level of suspicion, as nearly all antibiotics, including TMP/SMX, are associated with an increased risk of C. difficile-associated diarrhea.
- **Crystalluria**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of crystalluria. Ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output.
- **Decreased blood glucose**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with rare cases of hypoglycemia, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, liver disease, malnutrition, or receiving high doses of TMP/SMX.
- **Decreased platelet count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
- **Decreased serum sodium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause severe and symptomatic hyponatremia.
- **Hemolysis**: use caution in patients with G6PD deficiency.
- **Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.
- **Hepatic necrosis**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of fulminant hepatic necrosis.
- **Increased risk of adverse events**: use caution in patients with AIDS because of increased risks of adverse reactions, particularly skin rash, fever, leukopenia, and elevated aminotransferase levels.
- **Increased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX can cause hyperkalemia, especially at high doses of trimethoprim and in patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs increasing serum potassiun levels. Obtain close monitoring of serum potassium in at-risk patients.
- **Lung injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of acute and delayed lung injury.
- **Severe cutaneous adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as TMP/SMX has been associated with an increased risk of severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS syndrome, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, and acute generalized erythematous pustulosis.

### Population pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole: dosage optimization for patients with renal insufficiency or receiving continuous renal replacement therapy [^114C6Hbr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared with other antibiotics, the pharmacodynamics of cotrimoxazole are poorly understood. It is unclear which pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index (fT > MIC, C max > MIC, or AUC/MIC) best correlates with the efficacy of cotrimoxazole. Target concentrations for trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are predominantly based on theoretical assumptions and in vitro measurements rather than an association with clinical outcomes. For the treatment of PCP, target concentrations for sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been suggested and used in both research and TDM in clinical practice. Specifically, sulfamethoxazole peak concentrations above 100 mg/L and trimethoprim concentrations above 5 mg/L are recommended. These targets are originally based on two small studies. The first study included 26 children with PCP and found that 3–5 mg/L for trimethoprim and 100–150 mg/L for sulfamethoxazole resulted in clinical effectiveness. The other study included eight adults with PCP and reported that trimethoprim concentrations below 5.5 mg/L were linked to treatment failure. The concentrations associated with toxicity have been studied more extensively: concentrations of sulfamethoxazole > 200 mg/L, N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole > 75 mg/L, and trimethoprim > 15 mg/L are associated with toxicity both in healthy individuals as in patients with PCP. concentration‐dependent adverse events that have been described include hematological toxicity, hyperkalemia, renal failure and central nervous system adverse effects.,

Studies assessing the optimal initial dosing regimen to reach the target concentrations for PCP are lacking. Moreover, limited information is available regarding the need for dose reductions in patients with reduced renal function or on continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Several dosing regimens have been proposed for patients with altered renal function, but these recommendations lack support from population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) simulations that consider both effectiveness and toxicity.,

To address these gaps, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in hospitalized patients treated with cotrimoxazole. Based on the measured serum concentrations, a model for trimethoprim and a combined population pharmacokinetic model for sulfamethoxazole and its metabolite N ‐acetyl sulfamethoxazole were developed. These models enabled us to simulate dose regimens and dose adjustments for patients with altered renal function or those receiving CRRT for PCP.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim ds [^117QiEcE]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include
sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they
respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly
patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney
and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other
drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a
specific decrease in platelets (with or withoutpurpura), and hyperkalemia are
the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In
those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an
increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported.
Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels
should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency
may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid
therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with
impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to
minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may
cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of
potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with
drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.
Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to
help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim DS Tablets
contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric
subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim
concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in
geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric
Pharmacokinetics).

### Dose-dependent hyperkalemia among hospitalized, HIV-infected patients receiving sulfamethoxazole / trimethoprim [^114PMouU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT) therapy is commonly used in HIV-infected patients and is associated with hyperkalemia and elevated serum creatinine (SCr). Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of hyperkalemia and elevated SCr in hospitalized, HIV-infected patients receiving SXT. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study. HIV-infected hospitalized patients receiving a minimum of 3 consecutive days of SXT were included. Patients were grouped according to high dose (≥ 10 mg/kg/d) and low dose (< 10 mg/kg/d) trimethoprim. The primary end point was the frequency of hyperkalemia, severe hyperkalemia, and elevated SCr. Secondary end points included an evaluation of concomitant potassium-altering medications and concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. Results: A total of 100 consecutive patients were selected from all possible patients who met inclusion criteria. Overall, 47 patients experienced at least 1 adverse drug event (ADE) of either hyperkalemia or increased SCr, with 20 patients experiencing these ADEs in the low-dose group and 27 patients experiencing these ADEs in the high-dose group (P = 0.229). The ADEs of hyperkalemia or increased SCr occurred after a shorter period (5.5 vs 8.7 days) in the high-dose group (P = 0.049). Overall frequency of elevated SCr was 24% and of elevated serum K was 36%. Hyperkalemia requiring a therapeutic intervention occurred in 12 patients in the high-dose group compared with 2 in the low-dose group (P = 0.009). Conclusion and Relevance: Rates of elevated SCr and hyperkalemia in hospitalized HIV-infected patients receiving SXT are significant. Hyperkalemia requiring intervention is more common in patients receiving high-dose SXT.

### Renal failure in a patient with postpolio syndrome and a normal creatinine level [^115oTdvP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Patients with renal failure who are taking trimethoprim have an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia, which can cause muscle weakness. In patients with postpolio syndrome, a normal creatinine level could be abnormally high, renal failure is possible because of lack of creatinine production, and the muscle weakness from resultant hyperkalemia could be more severe because of their underlying condition. This abnormally high creatinine level has been termed from this point relative renal failure. The objective of the study was to review a case in which relative renal failure and hyperkalemia caused muscle weakness that manifested as shortness of breath and confusion with electrocardiographic changes. A dehydrated patient with relative renal failure and postpolio syndrome had taken trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole that caused symptomatic hyperkalemia. The patient presented with muscle weakness, shortness of breath, and confusion, with her postpolio syndrome compounding the situation and likely making the muscle weakness more severe. A patient on trimethoprim with renal failure is at an increased risk of developing hyperkalemia. Patients with postpolio syndrome could have severe muscle weakness from the hyperkalemia and could have renal failure even with a normal creatinine level. This case report will remind treating physicians to evaluate such patients for hyperkalemia if they present with muscle weakness, especially if the patient has renal failure and is on trimethoprim.

Table 2
Association between hospital admission involving hyperkalaemia and recent antibiotic use

TMP/SMX = trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

*Adjusted for age category, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, Charlson co-morbidity index, fifth of income, living in long term care facility, number of prescription drugs in previous year, number of years of spironolactone treatment, and drugs (β adrenergic receptor blockers, potassium sparing diuretics, non-potassium sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, potassium supplements, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors).

The population attributable fraction was 59.7%, suggesting that approximately 60% of all cases of hyperkalaemia in older patients taking spironolactone and treated with an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection could be avoided if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not prescribed.

Finally, because we did not attain a full match for all of our cases, we did a sensitivity analysis matching cases and controls only on sex, thereby matching all cases to at least one control. Results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with those obtained with the originally matched cohort.

### Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia in older adults compared with other antibiotics used to treat UTIs [^117HpZiS]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Commentary

This review highlights the association of prescription of trimethoprim with hyperkalaemia and AKI, but not with death, in older adults being treated for a simple UTI.

The results were adjusted for a wide range of appropriate confounders. The authors adjusted for baseline renal function, which was defined as 'the most recent biochemical test results recorded in primary care'. Renal function declines with age. If there was a long interval between the most recent recorded renal function and renal function recorded post antibiotic prescription, it is possible that the perceived baseline renal function for some individuals may not have been a reflection of their true baseline renal function. This may have led to an overestimation of the number of cases of AKI.

Death and hyperkalaemia were determined from read codes in either primary or secondary care. However, the authors defined AKI as hospital admission with AKI. By excluding cases of AKI occurring in general practice, this may have led to an underestimation of the number of episodes of AKI.

The authors helpfully contextualise the results. While the odds of hyperkalaemia and AKI with trimethoprim prescription are increased by 127% and 72%, respectively, compared with amoxicillin prescription, the increase in the absolute risk is small. The authors state that for 1,000 UTI episodes treated with trimethoprim rather than amoxicillin, there would be one additional case of hyperkalaemia and two of AKI. These results would be very similar among those concurrently prescribed RAAs. However, among those individuals taking RAAs and potassium-sparing diuretics, a prescription of trimethoprim instead of amoxicillin would result in 18 additional cases of hyperkalaemia and 11 of AKI. The authors did not present ORs for the latter association in the main article.

Exposure and Outcomes

The primary exposure was eGFR discordance, defined as an eGFRcys that was more than 30% lower than the eGFRcr, and the reference group consisted of patients with concordant eGFR, defined as eGFRcys that was within 30% of their eGFRcr. We also evaluated the characteristics and risk of medication-related AEs in patients whose eGFRcys was more than 30% higher than their eGFRcr; our a priori hypothesis was that this group would not be at higher risk of medication-related AEs compared with the concordant eGFR group. The 30% cutoff was chosen because it is commonly used in clinical studies to define the accuracy of eGFR from mGFR.

For the primary outcome, we examined the risk of selected medication-related AEs using detailed medical record review. We selected medications (intravenous vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, baclofen, and digoxin) that are typically dose adjusted based on eGFR and whose adverse effects could be quantified by therapeutic drug monitoring or laboratory abnormalities or identified by medical record review. In all cases, we evaluated drug exposures that occurred within 90 days of the baseline date.

The therapeutic range for a vancomycin trough level was 15 to 20 μg/mL, and levels greater than 20 μg/mL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.69) were considered to be supratherapeutic. We defined severely elevated vancomycin trough levels as greater than 30 μg/mL and used manual medical record review to exclude peak values.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole–related hyperkalemia was defined as a serum potassium level greater than 5.5 mEq/L (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1; Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE], version 5.0, grade 2), and severe hyperkalemia was defined as a serum potassium level greater than 6.0 mEq/L (CTCAE grade 3) within 30 days of starting trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In a sensitivity analysis, we identified the mean increase in potassium level after initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Contraindications regarding the use of trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole PO (also known as Bactrim, Sulfatrim, Septra):
- **Concomitant use of leucovorin**: avoid using leucovorin with TMP/SMX for the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive due to the associated risks of treatment failure and increased mortality.
- **Porphyria**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with porphyria, as sulfonamides can precipitate porphyria crisis.
- **Possible folate deficiency**: avoid using TMP/SMX in patients with possible folate deficiency, including the elderly, patients with alcohol use disorder, malabsorption syndrome, malnutrition, or receiving anticonvulsant therapy, as well as in patients with severe allergy or asthma.
- **Thyroid dysfunction**: avoid use of TMP/SMX in patients with thyroid dysfunction, as sulfonamides can precipitate hypothyroidism.
- **Treatment of streptococcal infections**: do not use TMP/SMX for the treatment of group A streptococcal infections, as sulfonamides fo not eradicate streptococci and therefore cannot prevent sequelae such as rheumatic fever.

### Co-trimoxazole and sudden death in patients receiving inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system: population based study [^1162pCgx]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in clinical practice. Each year, more than 50 million prescriptions are dispensed in the United Kingdom and more than 250 million prescriptions in the United States. These drugs are principally used for the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease. Both drug classes increase the risk of hyperkalemia, which occurs in up to 10% of patients and is particularly common in patients with other drug and disease related risk factors for hyperkalemia.

Co-trimoxazole (a combination antibiotic containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) is commonly prescribed for the treatment of urinary tract infection and is listed on the World Health Organization's essential medicines list. Each year, approximately five million prescriptions are dispensed in the United Kingdom and 20 million in the United States. Trimethoprim has structural and pharmacologic similarities to the potassium sparing diuretic amiloride. At doses used in clinical practice (typically 80–160 mg twice daily), trimethoprim blocks the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the distal nephron, impairing renal potassium elimination. Approximately 80% of patients receiving co-trimoxazole develop increases in serum potassium concentrations of at least 0.36 mEq/L and 6% develop frank hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.4 mEq/L).

We have previously shown that the use of co-trimoxazole with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers results in an almost sevenfold increase in the risk of hyperkalemia related hospital admission relative to amoxicillin. Case reports show that this drug interaction can cause life threatening hyperkalemia, but whether it can increase the risk of sudden death in clinical practice is unknown. This is an important question, because sudden death due to hyperkalemia in the pre-hospital setting is likely to be misattributed to intrinsic heart disease, particularly in older patients with existing cardiovascular disease or diabetes.

Co-trimoxazole induced hyperkalemia is common, can occur quickly, and can be life-threatening. We examined whether treatment with co-trimoxazole was associated with a higher risk of sudden death than other antibiotics used for urinary tract infection in patients receiving angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.

Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim oral suspension in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6 However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

Covariates

Based on a priori knowledge, we considered the following variables as potential confounders of the relation between trimethoprim and acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death: sex, age, calendar period, chronic comorbidities, history of renal or urological disease, baseline renal function, prescription for renin-angiotensin system blockers (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) or potassium-sparing diuretics, lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index), ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All covariates other than sex and ethnicity were updated over time.

Age group was defined in the following bands at time of antibiotic initiation: 65–69; 70–74; 75–79; 80–84; and 85 and over.

We included calendar period (1997–2000, 2001–04, 2005–08, 2009–11, and 2012–15) as a covariate to adjust for the many changes in clinical, diagnostic, and administrative practices over the study period that may influence the choice of antibiotic treatment for UTI, the measurement of renal function, and registration of outcomes.

Chronic comorbidities included as confounders were diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and hypertension, identified from both primary care and hospital data. Individuals were considered to have a specific comorbidity if they had a code recorded in their electronic health records before a UTI episode treated with antibiotics.

Baseline renal function was defined using the most recent biochemical test results recorded in primary care at any time before each UTI treated with antibiotics. We used serum creatinine test results to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation. We categorised estimated glomerular filtration rate into the following bands analogous to chronic kidney disease stages: 60 mL/min/1.73m 2 and over; 45–59 mL/min/1.73m 2; 30–44 mL/min/1.73m 2; and less than 30 mL/min/1.73m 2. This created possible selection bias since those at greater risk of renal disease are more likely to have renal function measured. Therefore, we included an absent renal function category for those with no recorded serum creatinine test result before UTI treated with antibiotics.

### Co-trimoxazole and sudden death in patients receiving inhibitors of renin-angiotensin system: population based study [^116yFVgv]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Limitations

Some limitations of our study merit emphasis. Our findings derive from patients aged 66 years and older, and the generalizability to younger patients is unknown. Although we used a validated algorithm to define sudden death, some degree of outcome misclassification is likely. However, this applies equally to all the antibiotics we studied. We used administrative data and did not have access to serum potassium or creatinine concentrations, adherence to treatment, non-prescription drug use, and other risk factors for sudden death. Again, these limitations are independent of antibiotic exposure. Whereas nitrofurantoin and norfloxacin are limited to the treatment of urinary tract infection, amoxicillin, co-trimoxazole, and ciprofloxacin are sometimes used for infections at other sites. Although we had no information on indications for antibiotic use, we used a disease risk index to adjust for potential predictors of sudden death. Finally, we were unable to reliably determine the dose of trimethoprim, precluding a dose-response analysis. Doing such an analysis may have further strengthened the argument that hyperkalemia underlies our main observations.

Conclusion and implications

We found that use of co-trimoxazole was associated with an increased risk of sudden death in older patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. We speculate that this association reflects sudden death from co-trimoxazole induced hyperkalemia in a vulnerable group of patients. The importance of our findings is underscored by the fact that co-trimoxazole is prescribed to millions of patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. Sudden death in these patients is likely to be misattributed to underlying cardiovascular disease, rather than hyperkalemia.

We suggest that, when clinically appropriate, clinicians either choose alternate antibiotics or limit the dose and duration of co-trimoxazole treatment. When co-trimoxazole is prescribed, close monitoring of serum potassium is advisable in susceptible patients.

### The effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis [^116p67Rk]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the effect of long-term intermittent trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole treatment on recurrences of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

Design

Prospective randomized open-labeled interventional clinical trial.

Methods

A total of 124 patients with a history of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis were randomized to treatment with one tablet of trimethoprim (160 mg)/sulfamethoxazole (800 mg) (Bactrim F; Roche Pharmaceuticals, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) every 3 days (61 patients) or to observation without treatment (63 patients) and were followed monthly for up to 20 consecutive months for clinical signs of disease recurrence. A recurrence was defined as a new focus of necrotizing retinochoroiditis with active inflammation either adjacent to or remote from preexisting retinochoroidal scars.

Results

Recurrences developed in four (6.6%) treated patients and in 15 (23.8%) controls (P = 0.01). Treatment was discontinued prematurely in four patients because of mild drug reactions.

Conclusion

Long-term intermittent treatment with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole can reduce the rate of recurrent toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.

Supportive care and fertility considerations in lupus nephritis (LN) note that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) use may be limited because kidney function and hyperkalemia may also limit use, and alternatives, such as atovaquone, dapsone (often used for skin manifestations in SLE), or pentamidine may be considered in patients unable to take TMP-SMX; for patients receiving cyclophosphamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and sperm or oocyte cryopreservation should be considered, and shared decision making, with discussion of the risks and benefits of treatment, should guide therapy; additionally, non-LN glomerular disease occurs only in about 1% to 5% of SLE patients with kidney manifestations, making prospective trials difficult to pursue in lupus podocytopathies.

### Acute glycaemic effects of co-trimoxazole at prophylactic dose in healthy adults [^115XJRSS]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Plausible mechanisms by which hypoglycaemia might occur is the stimulation of insulin secretion as reported by Nunnari and al. and Strevel and al. suggesting a sulfonylurea-like mechanism. So co-trimoxazole would fixed itself on the SUR1 subunit of the beta-cell ATP-sensitive potassium channel leading to the closure of ATP-sensitive potassium channels, then to the depolarization of the cell membrane with the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. This produces an influx of calcium that stimulates fusion of the docked insulin-containing vesicles with the cell membrane and secretion of insulin into the extracellular fluid by exocytosis. This is reinforced by the history of the discovery of sulfonylurea. Indeed, Marcel Janbon reported cases of reversible coma after glucose administration in patients treated with the antibacterial sulphonamide 2254 RP for typhoid fever. This finding aroused interrogations and this is how A. Loubatières highlighted the hypoglycaemic potential of 2254 RP.

This study shows that at prophylactic dose co-trimoxazole can be safely administered in healthy adult, and this is because of the activation of the counter regulatory system. Nevertheless a special attention should be paid when co-trimoxazole is administered at high dose like in the treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and to patients with comorbidities including renal insufficiency or malnutrition. Indeed malnutrition and kidney dysfunction are risks factors for severe hypoglycaemia in patients using high dose of co-trimoxazole as reported by Strevel and al. in a case series. Moreover, Hemkisoy and al. and Arem and al. reported a case of co-trimoxazole-induced hypoglycaemia in a malnourish patient and in another one with in chronic renal failure. A monitoring of blood glucose level is advised in case of concomitant administration of co-trimoxazole and sulfonylureas, in order to rapidly detect and treat a potential hypoglycaemia due an excessive insulin secretion, especially in patients with relevant comorbidities.

### Antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of plague: recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response [^113C9jYn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment recommendations for patients who are elderly or immunocompromised do not differ from those for adults. However, treating clinicians should recognize the potential for decreases in glomerular filtration rate and presence of polypharmacy, with resultant drug-drug interactions, and adjust antimicrobials accordingly. Treating clinicians should carefully monitor patients with plague who are elderly or immunocompromised and extend therapy duration as needed on the basis of their clinical judgment.

For prophylaxis of elderly persons, clinicians should consider using doxycycline preferentially over fluoroquinolones because of the risks for QTc prolongation, neuropsychiatric disturbances including dizziness and imbalance, hypoglycemia, aortic rupture, and damage to connective tissues with fluoroquinolone use. Trimethoprim, alone or in combination with sulfamethoxazole, is associated with increased risk for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia. This risk appears to be magnified when used concurrently with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor blocker, or potassium-sparing diuretic.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^114pht5t]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Co-trimoxazole is a combination antibiotic drug containing trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, prescribed for multiple indications and is the fourth most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the USA. Its use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death among people taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. This may be owing to acute kidney injury, a rapid deterioration in kidney function. Alternately, co-trimoxazole and trimethoprim alone have both been associated with an increased risk of an acute rise in potassium levels, hyperkalaemia, which can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias.

Existing evidence has important limitations. It is not clear if the association between co-trimoxazole and adverse outcomes is owing to the sulfamethoxazole or the trimethoprim component. The observed association may be owing to confounding if the combination antibiotic was used for patients with more severe infections than the antibiotics it was compared with. Finally, existing evidence is primarily associated with specific groups of patients such as those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. In the UK, co-trimoxazole is licensed for specific, uncommon indications and trimethoprim is more commonly used. However, there are efforts to reduce trimethoprim prescribing due to increasing antimicrobial resistance. In 2015 over 3.7 million prescriptions for trimethoprim were dispensed in England and it remains a first line option for treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Despite this, whether trimethoprim alone is linked to sudden death both in the general population and in high risk groups is unknown.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^115chpcP]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

However, there are some important limitations. While we attempted to capture only simple UTIs (defined using primary care morbidity coding, but not excluding those with a history of more complex urological pathology) in our main analysis, we may have included patients with underlying urinary tract disorders, or other infections. Since different classes of antibiotic drugs are prescribed for different clinical scenarios, some degree of confounding by indication is unavoidable. However, we were able to reduce confounding by robustly defining and adjusting for variables that may have influenced the choice of antibiotic drug prescribed such as baseline renal function. As trimethoprim was less frequently prescribed for patients with urological pathology, this would likely have led to underestimating the odds of adverse outcomes, particularly acute kidney injury, for trimethoprim compared with the true result. Similarly, clinicians may have been cautious in prescribing trimethoprim to those at highest risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia, again leading to an underestimation of the true risk of adverse outcomes, particularly for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, the strongest evidence of adverse outcomes in association with trimethoprim use for those taking renin-angiotensin system blockers was only published towards the end of the period of this study.

Our assessment of antibiotic exposure was based on prescriptions alone and patients may not have collected or taken their medicine. This may have led to differential misclassification owing to the severity of the infection, with resulting over or under estimation of the true effect size. However, we have attempted to mitigate for this by limiting the study to simple UTIs and adjusting, in particular, for history of renal or urological disease.

We may also have misclassified the outcomes. Trimethoprim reduces tubular secretion of creatinine causing apparent renal impairment, although glomerular filtration rate does not fall. Lack of awareness of this physiological effect may have led clinicians to incorrectly diagnose acute kidney injury among the trimethoprim treated group, particularly given the current focus on creatinine based definitions of acute kidney injury. However, our definition of acute kidney injury relied on clinical coding of hospital admissions. In general, this leads to under ascertainment compared with analyses of serial creatinine tests but disproportionately captures more severe acute kidney injury. In addition, the increased risk of acute kidney injury dated back to 2001–04, before creatinine based definitions of acute kidney injury were in common use. It is also possible that there was a bias towards testing for or recording acute kidney injury or hyperkalaemia among patients taking trimethoprim if clinicians were aware of a potential association which would have led to an overestimation of the true risk of adverse outcomes.

### Fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders associated with antibiotic therapy [^11313iDV]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2009). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs in medicine. Their use, however, is often limited by associated renal toxic effects. The most common manifestation of these toxic effects is decreased glomerular filtration rate. However, they can also occur while renal function remains near to normal. This Review focuses on antibiotic-associated fluid, electrolyte and acid-base disorders that do not greatly reduce glomerular filtration. Renal tubules can be affected by antibiotics at various locations. In the proximal tubule, toxic effects of tetracyclines and aminoglycosides can result in complete proximal tubular dysfunction, also known as Fanconi syndrome. Aminoglycosides (and capreomycin) can also affect the loop of Henle and lead to a Bartter-like syndrome. In the collecting ducts, antibiotics can cause a diverse range of disorders, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hyperkalemia, renal tubular acidosis, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Causative antibiotics include trimethoprim, amphotericin B, penicillins, ciprofloxacin, demeclocycline and various antitubercular agents. Here, we describe the mechanisms that disrupt renal tubular function. Integrated with the physiology of each successive nephron segment, we discuss the receptors, transporters, channels or pores that are affected by antibiotics. This insight should pave the way for pathophysiology-directed treatment of these disorders.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^115bPt5G]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

For each patient, we identified a period of continuous use of spironolactone beginning with the first prescription for spironolactone after the patient's 66th birthday. We excluded the first year of eligibility for coverage of prescription drugs (age 65) to avoid incomplete drug records. Observation ended with the first occurrence of a hospital admission for hyperkalaemia, death, the end of the study period (31 March 2010), or cessation of spironolactone treatment, defined as a lapse of more than 180 days between prescriptions. In the event of such a lapse, we extended the observation period 180 days from the date of the last prescription to identify outcomes that may have precipitated cessation of treatment.

Within the cohort of continuous users of spironolactone, we defined cases as those admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of hyperkalaemia (international classifications of diseases, 9th edition, code 276.7, and 10th edition, code E87.5) within 14 days of receiving a prescription for one of four study antibiotics: trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, nitrofurantoin, or amoxicillin. We did not include prescriptions for trimethoprim monotherapy, because the drug is invariably used in combination with sulfamethoxazole in Canada. We included only patients who had hyperkalaemia at the time of admission, rather than those who developed hyperkalaemia during the course of a hospital admission. We restricted our analyses to antibiotics that are primarily used to treat urinary tract infections to avoid the potential confounding effects of other systemic infections. The date of hospital admission served as the index date for all analyses, and we considered only the first instance of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia for patients with more than one such admission during the study period. We excluded patients if they received prescriptions for multiple antibiotics or any non-study antibiotics in the 30 days before the index date.

Limitations

Some limitations of our work merit emphasis. We used administrative data and had no access to serum potassium concentrations, indices of renal function (including estimated glomerular filtration rate), adherence to drug treatment, or use of non-prescription drugs that may have influenced the risk of hyperkalaemia. However, these limitations apply equally to all antibiotics studied, and in particular would not be expected to differ appreciably between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and amoxicillin. We also could not identify hyperkalaemia in outpatients and hyperkalaemia related mortality in the pre-hospital setting. However, this would lead to underestimation of the clinical consequences of this drug interaction. Because some clinicians may appreciate the risk of hyperkalaemia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, differential outcome ascertainment is a possible source of bias. However, this is unlikely to have affected our findings as electrolyte concentrations are routinely measured in older patients presenting to hospital. In addition, our findings may not apply to younger patients with fewer risk factors for hyperkalaemia. Furthermore, as with all observational studies, residual confounding is a potential source of bias. However, given the magnitude of the observed association, we find it difficult to conceive of an unmeasured confounder that would be differentially distributed among the various antibiotics that could be accounting for our findings. Finally, the accuracy of hospital discharge coding for hyperkalaemia has not been validated, although the same limitation applies to previous research on the clinical consequences of drug interactions leading to hyperkalaemia.

Conclusions

Prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to elderly patients receiving treatment with spironolactone was associated with a major increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia, and this risk greatly exceeded that observed with other commonly used antibiotics for urinary tract infection. Increased awareness of this drug interaction among pharmacists and physicians is needed to ensure that the potential for life threatening hyperkalaemia with this drug combination is minimised, either by selection of alternative antibiotics when appropriate or by close monitoring of patients treated with both drugs.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim tablets contain 0.515 mg (0.023 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim Double Strength Tablets contain 1.03 mg (0.046 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

Use in the Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6 However, if a patient develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

The incidence of adverse reactions, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase (transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS patients who are being treated for P. jirovecii pneumonia has been reported to be increased compared with the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. If a patient develops skin rash, fever, leukopenia or any sign of adverse reaction, reevaluate benefit-risk of continuing therapy or re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (see WARNINGS).

Avoid coadministration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and leucovorin during treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia (see WARNINGS).

Electrolyte Abnormalities

Hyperkalemia: High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

Hyponatremia: Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

Crystalluria: During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^117Q4VvU]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results

We identified 165 754 patients treated with spironolactone during the 18 year study period, of which 17 859 (10.8%) received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during the study period. Within the cohort of spironolactone users, we identified 6903 admissions for hyperkalaemia, 306 of which occurred within 14 days of receiving an antibiotic of interest. Most cases (n = 248; 81%) were matched to at least one control. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, residence in a long term care facility, and history of diabetes (table 1). As expected, comorbidities and drugs known to increase the risk of hyperkalaemia were more prevalent among cases than among controls.

†Amiloride and combination products; triamterene and combination products.

In the primary analysis, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a marked increase in the risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia among patients receiving spironolactone (table 2). After multivariable adjustment, patients admitted to hospital with hyperkalaemia were more than 12 times as likely to have received a recent prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than for amoxicillin (adjusted odds ratio 12.4, 95% confidence interval 7.1 to 21.6). When we stratified the data by dose, we found a higher risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia with the double strength formulation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (adjusted odds ratio 13.5, 7.5 to 24.2) than with single strength tablets (adjusted odds ratio 9.7, 4.7 to 19.9). Treatment with nitrofurantoin was also associated with an increased risk of hyperkalaemia during spironolactone treatment (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 1.3 to 4.6). In contrast, we found no association between hyperkalaemia and receipt of norfloxacin (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 0.8 to 3.4).

### Trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia in burn patients treated with intravenous or oral trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other infections: nature or nurture? [^112nuPQe]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2013). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim is well known to cause rashes; however, what is not commonly known is that it causes sudden and profound hyperkalemia in 10 to 20% of treated patients. The uniqueness of burn patients begs the question whether changes known to occur in these patients might also increase this trimethoprim effect. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective study evaluated 224 patients with thermal injury who had been treated with trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), 24 of whom had underlying renal impairment (creatinine clearances < 50 ml/min) and were excluded, leaving 200 patients for analysis. Three definitions of drug-induced hyperkalemia were used: 1) a ≥ 1 mEq/L rise, 2) a > 0.8 mEq rise in potassium in < 24 hours warranting early discontinuation of TMP-SMX, and 3) "marked" hyperkalemia defined as serum potassium of ≥ 5.5 mEq/L within 48 hours. A potassium level before trimethoprim exposure (TxK) and after TxK were collected retrospectively. Demographic data were analyzed with Student's t-test and trimethoprim dose alone, demonstrating a significant difference. Analysis of 200 patients exposed to trimethoprim demonstrated an elevation of potassium (first definition) in 31 patients (15.5%), a rapid change in serum potassium in two patients (second definition), and marked hyperkalemia (> 5.5 mEq/L) in 13 patients (6.5%). Hyperkalemia never occurred in 166 of 200 patients (82%; before TxK, 3.9 ± 0.4; after TxK, 4.3 ± 0.5 mEq/L). Change in serum potassium among patients with hyperkalemia was 4.0 ± 0.5 mEq/L before TxK and 5.3 ± 0.7 mEq/L after TxK. Twelve published hyperkalemia risk factors were reviewed in these 200 patients and only history of hypertension and need for intubation was more common in those with hyperkalemia. A nearly 20% incidence of hyperkalemia and 6% serious hyperkalemia in burn patients is consistent with reports in patients without burn injury. These data also suggest that the metabolic and hormonal changes associated with burn injury do not increase further the genetically predisposed hyperkalemia resulting from exposure to trimethoprim. These data suggest patients treated with TMP-SMX should have routine serum potassium monitoring before discharge.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: cohort study [^111hCFiZ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We calculated odds ratios for each outcome (acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death) within 14 days of antibiotic initiation for a UTI comparing each antibiotic drug (trimethoprim, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin) to amoxicillin (as the reference category) adjusting for potential confounders using logistic regression. We used robust standard errors to account for clustering by general practice. Separately, we repeated the analyses using robust standard errors to account for clustering by patient to account for some patients contributing multiple UTI episodes to the analysis. We initially adjusted for sex and age only, and then fitted an adjusted model using sex, age, calendar period, chronic comorbidities, baseline renal function, history of renal or urological disease, and use of renin-angiotensin system blockers and potassium-sparing diuretics.

Findings

Among a cohort of 1, 191, 905 the authors identified 178, 238 individuals who received at least one antibiotic prescription for a UTI. Trimethoprim increased the odds of hyperkalaemia compared with amoxicillin (adjusted OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.49 to 3.45). Individuals prescribed trimethoprim (adjusted OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.24) and ciprofloxacin (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.13) had increased odds of AKI compared with amoxicillin. The odds of death was not increased by prescription of any antibiotic compared with amoxicillin. There was no significant difference in the results for trimethoprim when analyses were restricted to users of RAAs.

From within the cohort of patients receiving spironolactone, we selected up to four controls for each case by using incidence density sampling. We required controls to have had no hospital admission for hyperkalaemia before the index date and to have received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the index date. Consequently, all cases and controls were older patients receiving spironolactone who had also received treatment with one of the study antibiotics. We matched controls and cases on age at the index date (plus or minus one year), sex, presence or absence of diabetes (based on review of the validated Ontario Diabetes Database), and presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, determined from physicians' claims, hospital admission records, and receipt of dialysis in the year before the index date. Each patient could serve only once as a control. When fewer than four control patients were available for each case, we analysed only those controls and maintained the matching process. We excluded any cases that could not be matched to at least one control.

### Association between preoperative hypokalemia and postoperative complications in elderly patients: a retrospective study [^1161YZMP]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Bowel preparation is often implemented before gastrointestinal surgery. Preoperative oral laxative and enema are the main methods, which cause transient watery diarrhea and loss of a large amount of digestive juice, resulting in a decline in blood potassium, and patients are prone to preoperative hypokalemia. Our study found that two or more oral laxatives increased the risk of preoperative hypokalemia, whereas enemas did not. The results suggested that oral laxative may have a greater impact on blood potassium levels than enema. Sadaba et al. also found that sodium phosphate enema did not affect blood potassium in healthy volunteers, which confirmed that enema has a limited effect on blood potassium.

Ben and Nilsson et al. have shown that diuretics such as thiazides can develop into hypokalemia by increasing the excretion of potassium. We investigated the association of loop/thiazide/osmotic diuretics with preoperative hypokalemia, however, the results were not positive. Potassium-elevating medications such as ACEis/ARBs also did not have a significant effect on potassium levels and no preoperative hyperkalemia was observed in our study. These results may be due to the exclusion of patients with renal insufficiency, lower frequency of use, and concomitant use of counteracting drugs. Similar results also exist in researches of Hirai and Zhu. This is likely to indicate that preoperative potassium disturbances in elderly hospitalized patients with normal renal function are more manifested as hypokalemia. Other drugs such as Yokukansan, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and licorice also cause blood potassium disorder by affecting excretion. However, due to the low proportion of patients taking these drugs, it was difficult to compare their effects on preoperative hypokalemia. Furthermore, it is well known that potassium is mainly excreted through kidneys, and renal dysfunction often leads to electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia and hyperkalemia. To investigate risk factors for preoperative hypokalemia in elderly hospitalized patients other than renal causes, this study excluded patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction, and future studies will further investigate the preoperative hypokalemia in this population.

Discussion

In this population based study spanning 18 years, we found that the prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was strongly associated with admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia among elderly patients treated with spironolactone. Treatment with nitrofurantoin was associated with a less pronounced increase in the risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia, whereas we found no such risk with norfloxacin. Our findings support the existence of a clinically important and potentially life threatening drug interaction between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and spironolactone at the population level. This represents the first estimate of the risk of co-prescribing these drugs in clinical practice.

We found a less striking increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with nitrofurantoin treatment. This may reflect a "channelling" effect, in which patients at greater risk of hyperkalaemia were more likely to have been prescribed nitrofurantoin rather than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although this same phenomenon should also apply to norfloxacin. Some evidence indicates that this association may reflect a causal relation. In vitro experiments show that nitrofurantoin inhibits steroid biosynthesis, resulting in a 50% reduction in aldosterone release from adrenocortical cells. An additional, previously underappreciated drug interaction may thus exist between nitrofurantoin and spironolactone that may predispose susceptible patients to hyperkalaemia.

Our study has important clinical implications. In our cohort, 10.8% of patients received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole during the study period and were therefore at increased risk of hyperkalaemia. Serious hyperkalaemia can cause sudden death and is the most dangerous complication of treatment with spironolactone. Consequently, strategies aimed at minimising the risk of hyperkalaemia are essential. Our findings suggest that in patients receiving spironolactone, avoidance of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is prudent when clinically appropriate.

### Elevated serum β glucan levels in cavitary pulmonary nocardiosis [^112p9am2]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Treatment

We diagnosed with pulmonary nocardiosis. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX 1600 mg; 320 mg/day) and imipenem hydrate/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS 1.5 g; 1.5 g/day) were prescribed as initial therapy. On the second day of the treatment, the patient suddenly developed an episode of tetanic convulsion. Brain MRI showed no abnormalities. The IPM/CS was considered the possible cause of seizures. The convulsive episode did not repeat after cessation of IPM/CS. Eighteen-day treatment with TMP/SMX alone improved cough, low-grade fever and chest pain. The inflammatory reaction, C-reactive protein, was normalised with white cell counts. Later, the patient was switched to oral minocycline (200 mg/day) monotherapy following an increase in the potassium serum levels as side effects of TMP/SMX.

Chest radiography on the 28th day of treatment showed an improvement in the shadows (figure 3). Interestingly, the high levels of β - d - glucan observed at pretreatment decreased in parallel with the amelioration of the clinical features: the levels decreased from ≥ 300 pg/mL to 42.5 pg/mL after 45 days (figure 4). The present patient showed no history of eating large amounts of mushrooms, receiving β-lactam antibiotics or immunoglobulin/albumin preparations along with haemodialysis, which are common sources of false-positive test findings for high β - d - glucan levels.

### Trimethoprim-associated hyponatremia [^11271hDH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia associated with diuretic use can be clinically difficult to differentiate from the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). We report a case of a 28-year-old man with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) and Pneumocystis pneumonia who developed hyponatremia while receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Serum sodium level on admission was 135 mEq/L (with a history of hyponatremia) and decreased to 117 mEq/L by day 7 of TMP/SMX treatment. In the setting of suspected euvolemia and Pneumocystis pneumonia, he was treated initially for SIADH with fluid restriction and tolvaptan without improvement in serum sodium level. A diagnosis of hyponatremia secondary to the diuretic effect of TMP subsequently was confirmed, with clinical hypovolemia and high renin, aldosterone, and urinary sodium levels. Subsequent therapy with sodium chloride stabilized serum sodium levels in the 126- to 129-mEq/L range. After discontinuation of TMP/SMX treatment, serum sodium, renin, and aldosterone levels normalized. TMP/SMX-related hyponatremia likely is underdiagnosed and often mistaken for SIADH. It should be considered for patients on high-dose TMP/SMX treatment and can be differentiated from SIADH by clinical hypovolemia (confirmed by high renin and aldosterone levels). TMP-associated hyponatremia can be treated with sodium supplementation to offset ongoing urinary losses if the TMP/SMX therapy cannot be discontinued. In this Acid-Base and Electrolyte Teaching Case, a less common cause of hyponatremia is presented, and a stepwise approach to the diagnosis is illustrated.

Use in the
Treatment of and Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Carinii Pneumonia in Patients with
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS)

AIDS patients may not tolerate or respond to sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim in the same manner as non-AIDS patients. The incidence of side
effects, particularly rash, fever, leukopenia and elevated aminotransferase
(transaminase) values, with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy in AIDS
patients who are being treated for Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia has been reported to be greatly increased compared with
the incidence normally associated with the use of sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim in non-AIDS patients. The incidence of hyperkalemia appears to be
increased in AIDS patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Adverse
effects are generally less severe in patients receiving sulfamethoxazole and
trimethoprim for prophylaxis. A history of mild intolerance to sulfamethoxazole
and trimethoprim in AIDS patients does not appear to predict intolerance of
subsequent secondary prophylaxis.6However, if a patient
develops skin rash or any sign of adverse reaction, therapy with
sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be reevaluated (see WARNINGS).

High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with Pneumocystis carini i pneumonia, induces aprogressive but
reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of
patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when
trimethoprim is administered topatients with underlying disorders of potassium
metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia
are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in
these patients.

During treatment, adequate fluid intake and urinary output should be ensured
to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone
to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

### Incidence of hyponatremia with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole exposure [^114VVtx3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a commonly prescribed antibiotic used at high doses for treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections. Trimethoprim is structurally related to the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride and has been associated with hyperkalemia and hyponatremia through blocking of epithelial sodium channels in the distal nephron. The incidence of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients treated with high-dose TMP-SMX is unknown.

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of all hospitalized patients who received high-dose TMP-SMX (n = 235) from January 2012 to July 2014. Patients with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, baseline hyponatremia, and those on other medications associated with hyponatremia were excluded. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 136 mEq/L.

Results

Analysis was restricted to 76 unique patients who received more than 8 mg/kg/d of TMP for ≥ 3 days. Mean starting serum sodium at time of TMP-SMX initiation was 138.4 ± 2.1 mEq/L. Fifty-five patients (72.3%) developed hyponatremia while on therapy, of which 43.6% (n = 24) were cases of serum sodium < 130 mEq/L. Mean sodium at the time of nadir was 131.6 ± 5.1 mEq/L. Hyponatremia was noted, on average, 5.5 days after initiation of therapy, with more severe hyponatremia development among African American patients. Urine sodium concentrations were available for 40.0% (22/55) of incident hyponatremia cases, with mean urinary sodium of 104.8 ± 55.9 mEq/L. Hyponatremia often resolved within 3 weeks of drug discontinuation.

Conclusions

There is a high incidence (72.3%) of hyponatremia associated with the use of high-dose TMP-SMX among hospitalized patients. This is an overlooked and potentially reversible cause of hyponatremia.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim DS) [^113bHcUU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Levels of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim in breast milk are approximately 2–5% of the recommended daily dose for infants over 2 months of age. Caution should be exercised when BACTRIM is administered to a nursing woman, especially when breastfeeding jaundiced, ill, stressed, or premature infants because of the potential risk of bilirubin displacement and kernicterus.

Pediatric Use

BACTRIM is contraindicated for infants younger than 2 months of age (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE and CONTRAINDICATIONS sections).

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of BACTRIM did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant BACTRIM therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of BACTRIM may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of BACTRIM treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. BACTRIM Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. BACTRIM DS Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

Red characters are metabolites that decrease intracellular amount in response to TMP treatment (THF, GTP, and ATPwere reported previously)

If impairment of DHPPP synthesis is the mechanistic basis for TMP-mediated potentiation of SMX activity, it follows that TMP-SMX synergy should be abolished in the E. coli Δ nudB strain. To evaluate TMP-SMX synergy we performed growth assays with wild-type E. coli BW25113 and the Δ nudB strain in the presence of each drug at a concentration that by itself led to mild growth impairment (Fig. 4a, b). As anticipated when TMP-SMX were combined, their synergistic action resulted in full growth inhibition of the wild-type strain (Fig. 4a). In striking contrast, the combination of TMP-SMX showed an additive inhibitory effect on growth of the E. coli Δ nudB strain (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, through the use of checkerboard assays we found that TMP-SMX showed additive effects against the Δ nudB strain (Fig. 4c). Thus, synergy between TMP and SMX is contingent upon the ability of TMP to disrupt synthesis of DHPPP (Fig. 4d).

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^115t4iUb]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To characterise the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia in elderly patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with spironolactone.

Design Population based nested case-control study.

Setting Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 1992 to 1 March 2010.

Participants Cases were residents of Ontario aged 66 years or above receiving chronic treatment with spironolactone and admitted to hospital with hyperkalaemia within 14 days of receiving a prescription for either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. Up to four controls for each case were identified from the same cohort, matched on age, sex, and presence or absence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and required to have received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the case's index date.

Main outcome measures Odds ratio for association between admission to hospital with hyperkalaemia and receipt of a study antibiotic in the preceding 14 days, adjusted for conditions and drugs that may influence risk of hyperkalaemia.

Results During the 18 year study period, 6903 admissions for hyperkalaemia were identified, 306 of which occurred within 14 days of antibiotic use. Of these, 248 (81%) cases were matched to 783 controls. 10.8% (17 859/165 754) of spironolactone users received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared with amoxicillin, prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a marked increase in the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia (adjusted odds ratio 12.4, 95% confidence interval 7.1 to 21.6). The population attributable fraction was 59.7%, suggesting that approximately 60% of all cases of hyperkalaemia in older patients taking spironolactone and treated with an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection could be avoided if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not prescribed. Treatment with nitrofurantoin was also associated with an increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.4, 1.3 to 4.6), but no such risk was found with norfloxacin (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 0.8 to 3.4)

Conclusions Among older patients receiving spironolactone, treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a major increase in the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia. This drug combination should be avoided when possible.

### Beta-blockers, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the risk of hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization in the elderly: a nested case-control study [^114FScZe]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The simultaneous use of beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may confer a high risk of hyperkalemia.

Design, Setting, Participants, & Measurements

Two nested case-control studies were conducted to examine the association between hospitalization for hyperkalemia and the use of TMP-SMX in older patients receiving beta-blockers. Linked health administrative records from Ontario, Canada, were used to assemble a cohort of 299,749 beta-blockers users, aged 66 years or older and capture data regarding medication use and hospital admissions for hyperkalemia.

Results

Over the study period from 1994 to 2008, 189 patients in this cohort were hospitalized for hyperkalemia within 14 days of receiving a study antibiotic. Compared with amoxicillin, the use of TMP-SMX was associated with a substantially greater risk of hyperkalemia requiring hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8 to 9.4). No such risk was identified with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. When dosing was considered, the association was greater at higher doses of TMP-SMX. When the primary analysis was repeated in a cohort of non-beta-blocker users, the risk of hyperkalemia comparing TMP-SMX to amoxicillin was not significantly different from that found among beta-blocker users.

Conclusions

Although TMP-SMX is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia in older adults, these findings show no added risk when used in combination with beta-blockers.

Implications for practice

Clinicians should be vigilant for hyperkalaemia and AKI when prescribing trimethoprim to older adults with simple UTIs. Clinicians should avoid prescribing trimethoprim to individuals taking both RAAs and potassium-sparing diuretics; if prescribed, their renal function should be monitored diligently. Trimethoprim is not associated with an increased risk of death.

### Mechanistic insights into the primary and secondary alterations of renal ion and water transport in the distal nephron [^113whTME]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Two transporters have been identified in the pathophysiology of increased sodium reabsorption in the kidney. When aldosterone is high, ENaC subunits and their cleavage increasing ENaC activity has been identified as one potential mechanism explaining the increase in sodium retention. Filtered proteases during glomerular proteinuria might thus explain ENaC activation, along with aldosterone increase in a subset of patients. More recently, in the context of a normal plasma aldosterone level, another potential mediator of sodium retention has been identified, represented by a truncated variant of acid‐sensing ion channel 2b (ASIC2b) that induces acid‐stimulated sodium currents when coexpressed with ASIC2a. This channel is sustainably activated by albumin endocytosis in the CD of nephrotic rats and is specifically expressed in kidney biopsies from nephrotic patients.

Activation of electrogenic Na + reabsorption mechanisms (ENaC or Asic2a) should stimulate ROMK‐dependent potassium excretion in the CD. Several lines of evidence suggest quite the contrary. Nephrotic rats display ROMK inhibition and inability to excrete a dietary load of potassium. In the same line, nephrotic patients have elevated plasma potassium levels independent of GFR decline before corticosteroid initiation.

Alteration of the Na + reabsorption process by exogenous compounds, for example of the glycyrrhizic acid and trimethoprim (Bactrim ®). As mentioned above, the main actors of Na + reabsorption in the PC are the channel ENaC, the MR, the nuclear receptor of aldosterone, and the 11βHSD2 enzyme that converts cortisol into cortisone and protects the MR from inappropriate activation by glucocorticoids. The ingestion of licorice, containing glycyrrhizic acid, as confectionary or medication has been shown to induce hypertension and hypokalemia. At first, it was thought that glycyrrhizic acid or its metabolite glycyrrhenitic acid directly binded and activated MR but it was demonstrated that the effect of these compounds was not observed in the absence of adrenal glands. Further studies showed that glycyrrhenitic acid inhibited the function of the 11βHSD2 enzyme, allowing activation of the MR by cortisol.

### An evaluation of hyperkalemia and serum creatinine elevation associated with different dosage levels of outpatient trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole with and without concomitant medications [^115pbXZz]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Adverse events associated with high-dose trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for outpatient infections, particularly those likely caused by community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, have not been adequately characterized.

Objective

Describe hyperkalemia and acute renal injury associated with high-dose TMP-SMX.

Methods

An electronic medical record database retrospective study was conducted of outpatients receiving high-dose or low-dose TMP-SMX, comparing the incidences of hyperkalemia and acute renal injury.

Results

Of 6162 patients, more developed hyperkalemia (3.06% vs 1.05%, P < .0001) or acute renal injury (1.99% vs 0.700%, P = 0.0001) in the high-dose TMP-SMX group. Variables independently associated with hyperkalemia included age > 58 years (odds ratio [OR] = 3.44; 95% CI = 1.86–7.0; P < .0001), concomitant receipt of an NSAID (OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.02–2.79; p = 0.044) or an ACE inhibitor (OR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.06–5.14; P < .0001), high-dose TMP-SMX prescribed (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.85–4.60; P < .0001), and baseline elevated serum creatinine (OR = 45.1; 95% CI = 21.7–93.2; P < .0001). Variables independently associated with acute renal injury included concomitant receipt of an ACE inhibitor (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.01–5.24; p = 0.048) or a potassium supplement (OR = 4.10; 95% CI = 1.45–10.1; p = 0.010), high-dose TMP-SMX prescribed (OR = 3.70; 95% CI = 1.70–8.12; p = 0.0012), and baseline elevated serum creatinine (OR = 2110; 95% CI = 724–7980; P < .0001).

Conclusions

Serum creatinine and potassium concentrations should be monitored in outpatients receiving high-dose TMP-SMX.

Clinical Approach for Monitoring

First, appropriate monitoring of patients at the initiation and shortly after the commencement of therapy with RAASi is critical. Careful monitoring and cautious dose adjustment are absolutely essential to successfully maintain high‐risk patients on maximal RAASi therapy.

Before starting or changing RAASi dose, it is necessary to completely review prescribed (eg, trimethoprim or β‐blockers, both shown to increase serum potassium) and over‐the‐counter medications (such as nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory agents), in addition to assessing intravascular volume status. Having an accurate assessment of the patient's ideal weight is helpful in this regard. Patients significantly lower than their target body weight may already be sodium avid and not provide the distal sodium delivery needed to support potassium excretion. Patients who are significantly greater than their target body weight may have cardiac decompensation, which will reduce renal blood flow, activate the RAAS, and reduce distal sodium delivery. It is important to avoid starting or increasing RAASi dose until patients are optimized with regard to intravascular volume, with stable kidney function, and when other medications that increase serum potassium have been stopped or reduced as much as possible. Clearly starting RAASi in the setting of hyperkalemia is not advisable. Repeat laboratory testing 10 to 14 days after delaying or after starting or changing RAASi dose is important and should include close monitoring once a stable RAASi dose is achieved. The intervals for monitoring should be tailored to the patient's history and comorbidities but at a minimum at least every 4 months.

### Sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim (sulfamethox-TMP DS) [^115ihJ2P]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, e.g., impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see WARNINGS and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy. Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function and duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize risks of undesired reactions (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency or when given concomitantly with drugs known to induce hyperkalemia, such as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients. Discontinuation of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment is recommended to help lower potassium serum levels. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Tablets contain 1.8 mg sodium (0.08 mEq) of sodium per tablet. Sulfamethoxazole and Trimethoprim Double Strength Tablets contain 3.6 mg (0.16 mEq) of sodium per tablet.

Pharmacokinetics parameters for sulfamethoxazole were similar for geriatric subjects and younger adult subjects. The mean maximum serum trimethoprim concentration was higher and mean renal clearance of trimethoprim was lower in geriatric subjects compared with younger subjects (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Geriatric Pharmacokinetics).

### Evaluating the risk of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury with cotrimoxazole: a retrospective observational study [^112amNq7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Increasing antimicrobial resistance has renewed interest in older, less used antimicrobials. Cotrimoxazole shows promise; however, hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) are potential complications. Identifying risk factors for and quantification of these events is required for safe use. This study aimed to evaluate predictors of cotrimoxazole-associated AKI and hyperkalaemia in a clinical setting.

Methods

Patients prescribed cotrimoxazole were identified using electronic healthcare records over 3 years (1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019). Individual risk factors were recognized. Serum creatinine and potassium trends were analysed over the subsequent 21 days. AKI and patients with hyperkalaemia were classified using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and laboratory criteria. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.

Results

Among 214 patients prescribed cotrimoxazole, 42 (19.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.6–25.7) met AKI criteria and 33 (15.4%, 95% CI 11.0–21.1) developed hyperkalaemia. Low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, odds ratio (OR) 7.78, 95% CI 3.57–16.13, p < 0.0001) and cardiac disorders (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.17–4.82, p 0.011) predicted AKI, while low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2, OR 6.80, 95% CI 3.09–15.06, p < 0.0001) and higher baseline serum potassium (p 0.001) predicted hyperkalaemia. Low-dose cotrimoxazole (< 1920 mg/d) was associated with lower AKI and hyperkalaemia risk (p 0.007 and 0.019 respectively). Early (within the first 2–4 days of therapy) serum creatinine changes predicted AKI (OR 3.65, 95% CI 1.73–7.41, p 0.001), and early serum potassium changes predicted hyperkalaemia (> 0.6 mmol/L, OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.14–5.27, p 0.0236).

Conclusions

Cotrimoxazole-associated AKI and hyperkalaemia is frequent and dose dependent. Renal function, serum potassium and preexisting cardiac disorders should be evaluated before prescribing cotrimoxazole. Serum creatinine and potassium monitoring within first 2 to 4 days of treatment to identify susceptible patients is recommended, and the lowest effective dose ought to be prescribed.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### Successful use of fludrocortisone for the management of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-induced hyperkalemia: a case series [^112Jbu1n]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Medium credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a widely used antibiotic for various infections but is often associated with hyperkalemia. In this case series, we evaluate the use of fludrocortisone (FCS), a mineralocorticoid receptor agonist, in managing TMP-SMX-induced hyperkalemia. Six patients treated with TMP-SMX for infectious indications developed hyperkalemia within 2–6 days of therapy initiation. The administration of FCS at doses ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 mg daily effectively stabilized potassium levels in all patients within 1–2 days, allowing most to continue the TMP-SMX treatment. These findings highlight the efficacy of FCS in mitigating TMP-SMX-induced potassium retention, thereby providing a safe and practical approach to maintaining essential antibiotic therapy.
