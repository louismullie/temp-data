## Question

2 month history penis glans blisters

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate and manage a 2-month history of blisters on the penile glans. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key history elements that distinguish infectious from noninfectious causes. Then, I should verify the focused physical examination findings and how morphology guides the differential. Next, I will construct a tiered differential diagnosis and map it to an evidence-based diagnostic workup plan. After that, I should outline prudent empiric management while results are pending, and then define definitive management pathways based on likely result scenarios. Finally, I need to consider special populations, counseling, prevention, and a follow-up plan, making sure I double-check guideline-concordant testing and treatment throughout.

> Let me first confirm the critical history domains I must elicit: onset, evolution from vesicles to ulcers, pain or pruritus, recurrence pattern, systemic symptoms, sexual risk factors, prior STIs, HIV risk, circumcision status, medications including new drugs that can cause fixed drug eruptions, autoimmune disease, diabetes or renal disease, and any trauma or procedures; I need to ensure I also ask about partner symptoms and epidemiologic clues for less common infections, because this frames pre-test probabilities and infection control considerations [^117W8KUa] [^116gVNFj].

> Next, I should review the focused physical examination with attention to primary morphology and distribution; grouped painful vesicles with subsequent shallow erosions support HSV, a solitary painless indurated ulcer suggests primary syphilis, papillomatous verrucous growths favor HPV warts, dermatomal unilateral vesicles raise concern for zoster, pruritic papules or nodules on the genitalia may reflect scabies, and velvety erythroplakia or keratotic plaques require exclusion of carcinoma in situ; I need to check for inguinal lymphadenopathy, phimosis, discharge, pigment irregularity, and any signs suggesting systemic dermatoses, while reminding myself not to overcall malignancy without biopsy when diagnosis is uncertain [^111dQMhd] [^1161SvxY].

> Now, let me construct the differential; the most likely entity is genital HSV given the classic progression from vesicles to erosions and its status as the most common cause of genital ulcers in the U.S., though a 2-month time frame forces me to clarify whether this is a protracted primary episode versus recurrent outbreaks or even a noninfectious mimicker; inflammatory dermatoses such as lichen sclerosus, psoriasis, or lichen planus are plausible, particularly on the glans, and syphilis must remain high on the list because missing it has public health implications and serology is straightforward to obtain [^111dQMhd] [^111dH5pm] [^1161SvxY].

> Wait, let me verify less common but context-dependent considerations; herpes zoster can involve the penis if sacral dermatomes are affected, though it is uncommon and typically dermatomal, HPV warts are usually nonvesicular but atypical morphology occurs, and scabies can present with penile papules or nodules and intense pruritus, so I need to look for burrows and involvement of typical sites like the wrists and interdigital spaces to avoid premature closure [^113fVLhP] [^113dZH5y] [^1169a3p7].

> I will now examine the rare but critical diagnoses I cannot miss; neoplastic processes including carcinoma in situ or invasive SCC can mimic inflammatory disease and require biopsy if atypical or persistent beyond a month, bullous autoimmune disease and fixed drug eruption can produce localized blisters or erosions, pyoderma gangrenosum can ulcerate rapidly with undermined violaceous borders often in the setting of IBD, and calciphylaxis, especially in renal disease or warfarin exposure, can cause painful necrotic penile ulcers where biopsy may be contraindicated due to morbidity, so I should double-check systemic risk factors before proceeding invasively [^113s2Z5L] [^1161SvxY] [^115pdpp1] [^114J6BsX].

> Let me first confirm the initial diagnostic workup; from any active vesicle or ulcer base I should obtain HSV NAAT/PCR because it is more sensitive than culture and can type HSV-1 vs HSV-2, and I should draw syphilis serology with a non-treponemal test and treponemal confirmation, while screening for HIV given guideline recommendations for genital ulcer disease; if epidemiology suggests chancroid, I need to consider culture or NAAT where available and apply CDC probable criteria, but in most U.S. settings chancroid is rare, so this is a targeted decision [^116zd5PJ] [^116gVNFj] [^11257c3A].

> Hold on, I should verify serologic strategies when PCR is negative or lesions are absent; type-specific HSV-2 serology has a role when clinical suspicion remains high, when there are atypical recurrences with negative PCR/culture, during STI evaluations, or in partners of persons with genital herpes, but I must avoid routine serologic screening in asymptomatic people because harms outweigh benefits per USPSTF, so I need to document a clear clinical rationale before ordering serology [^1157fx7U] [^116D33iw] [^117KfR14].

> If the diagnosis remains uncertain or red flags are present, I need to ensure a timely biopsy; indicators include persistence beyond one month, induration, pigmentation, fixation, bleeding, nonresponse to empiric therapy, or concern for neoplasia, with a punch biopsy including lesion edge and adjacent normal tissue and consideration of direct immunofluorescence if autoimmune blistering disease is suspected, but I must remember that suspected penile calciphylaxis is a scenario where biopsy should be avoided due to increased morbidity, and if cancer is confirmed, staging with MRI and appropriate nodal assessment should follow [^1161SvxY] [^114J6BsX] [^113s2Z5L].

> While awaiting results, I should consider empiric therapy anchored to pretest probability; if HSV is clinically likely, start acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir for 7–10 days and provide analgesia with topical lidocaine or sitz baths, and if primary syphilis is strongly suspected, treat with benzathine penicillin G without undue delay while arranging reporting, but I need to be cautious with empiric corticosteroids on the glans unless infection is reasonably excluded, reserving high-potency topical steroids for inflammatory dermatoses when infection is unlikely or after negative infectious testing [^116zd5PJ] [^116gVNFj] [^1161SvxY].

> Next, I should review result-contingent pathways; if HSV PCR is positive, continue antivirals, counsel about transmission and asymptomatic shedding, and discuss suppressive therapy if recurrences are frequent or distressing, whereas if syphilis serology is positive, administer benzathine penicillin G per stage, arrange RPR titer follow-up at 6 and 12 months, and notify partners and public health authorities; if all infectious testing is negative and lesions persist, I need to reconsider inflammatory or autoimmune etiologies and proceed to dermatology referral and biopsy; if malignancy is diagnosed, expedite urologic oncology referral for organ-sparing options such as glansectomy in T1–T2 disease with appropriate nodal evaluation [^116zd5PJ] [^116gVNFj] [^113s2Z5L].

> But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or pregnant; in HIV or other immunosuppressed states, HSV may be more severe and atypical, requiring aggressive antiviral therapy and broader infectious differential including CMV or fungal pathogens, and in pregnancy I should avoid routine HSV serologic screening if asymptomatic while recognizing that acyclovir is considered safe when treatment is indicated and cesarean delivery is recommended if lesions or prodrome are present at labor, so I should coordinate obstetric management early [^115NZFPM] [^117KfR14] [^116zd5PJ].

> If the patient is a child or adolescent, I should confirm whether findings could be nonsexually acquired and screen appropriately; nonsexually acquired genital ulcers can occur and are often self-limited, bullous pemphigoid can rarely localize to the glans in childhood and requires histologic confirmation and systemic steroids, and balanitis xerotica obliterans is an important cause of chronic glans disease that may progress to meatal stenosis and requires longitudinal follow-up, while maintaining a high index of concern for abuse if an STI is identified [^1159LJ44] [^116LyMiB] [^1118Gg9j].

> I need to ensure thorough counseling and prevention; for HSV, emphasize lifelong infection, asymptomatic shedding, risk reduction with condoms and suppressive therapy, and the importance of disclosure to partners, and for HPV warts, discuss treatment options and the preventive role of vaccination and potential benefit of circumcision in reducing transmission of certain STIs, tailoring messages to the patient's risk profile and priorities [^116zd5PJ] [^113dZH5y].

> Finally, I should double-check the follow-up cadence; within 1–2 weeks I will review test results, clinical response, and analgesia needs, then in 1–3 months reassess for recurrences and consider suppressive therapy for frequent HSV episodes, and in 6–12 months monitor chronic inflammatory conditions for scarring or phimosis and ensure syphilis serologic titer decline is adequate after therapy, adjusting the plan if expected responses are not observed [^116zd5PJ] [^116gVNFj].

A 2-month history of blisters on the glans penis most often suggests **genital herpes (HSV-1 or HSV-2)** [^115NZFPM] [^111dH5pm], but persistent lesions warrant evaluation for **syphilis, chancroid, and non-infectious causes** [^111dQMhd] [^116gVNFj] such as fixed drug eruption, lichen planus, or bullous disorders. Obtain **HSV PCR** from lesion swabs [^116zd5PJ] and **syphilis serology** [^111dQMhd], and consider **biopsy** [^1161SvxY] [^114CHrs2] if the diagnosis is unclear or lesions are atypical. Management includes **antivirals for HSV** [^115NZFPM], **antibiotics for bacterial STIs** [^116gVNFj], and **targeted therapy** for non-infectious causes [^1161SvxY]; **prompt diagnosis** prevents complications and transmission [^117KfR14] [^111dH5pm].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for persistent blisters on the glans penis includes infectious and non-infectious causes:

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Infectious | Genital herpes (HSV-1, HSV-2) | - Painful vesicles <br/> - Erosions <br/> - Recurrences <br/> - Lymphadenopathy [^111dH5pm] [^115NZFPM] |
| Infectious | Syphilis (Treponema pallidum) | - Painless ulcer (chancre) <br/> - Generalized rash <br/> - Systemic symptoms [^111dQMhd] [^116gVNFj] |
| Infectious | Chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi) | - Painful ulcers <br/> - Suppurative inguinal lymphadenopathy [^11257c3A] |
| Infectious | Lymphogranuloma venereum (Chlamydia trachomatis) | - Painless ulcer <br/> - Painful lymphadenopathy [^111dQMhd] [^116gVNFj] |
| Infectious | Molluscum contagiosum | - Umbilicated papules <br/> - Rarely vesicular [^114wX2HU] [^114Wuufh] |
| Infectious | Monkeypox | - Umbilicated vesicles <br/> - Systemic symptoms [^114wX2HU] [^112CinX8] |
| Non-infectious | Fixed drug eruption | - Recurrent lesions at same site <br/> - Medication history |
| Non-infectious | Lichen planus | - Violaceous papules <br/> - Pruritic [^1161SvxY] |
| Non-infectious | Bullous pemphigoid | - Tense bullae <br/> - Rare genital involvement [^116LyMiB] |
| Non-infectious | Pemphigus vulgaris | - Flaccid bullae <br/> - Mucosal involvement |

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

- **History and physical examination**: Detailed sexual history [^117W8KUa], lesion characteristics, systemic symptoms, and medication use [^116gVNFj].
- **Laboratory testing**: HSV PCR from lesion swabs [^116zd5PJ]; syphilis serology [^111dQMhd]; consider bacterial cultures for chancroid or LGV.
- **Biopsy**: Indicated for atypical lesions [^114CHrs2], persistent or recurrent lesions, or suspicion of neoplastic or autoimmune conditions [^1161SvxY].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying diagnosis**:

- **Genital herpes**: Antiviral therapy (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) for initial and recurrent episodes [^115NZFPM] [^114DHpv7]; suppressive therapy for frequent recurrences.
- **Syphilis**: Benzathine penicillin G [^111dQMhd]; alternative regimens for penicillin-allergic patients [^116gVNFj].
- **Chancroid**: Azithromycin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin [^11257c3A] [^116gVNFj].
- **Non-infectious conditions**: Topical corticosteroids for lichen planus; immunosuppressive therapy for bullous pemphigoid or pemphigus vulgaris [^1161SvxY] [^116LyMiB].

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or improperly managed **glans penis blisters** can lead to:

- **Scarring and disfigurement**: Permanent cosmetic and functional impairment [^116BkYyW].
- **Sexual dysfunction**: Painful intercourse, erectile dysfunction, psychological distress [^111dH5pm].
- **Secondary infections**: Bacterial superinfection, cellulitis, systemic infection [^1143JmPD].
- **Transmission of infectious diseases**: Ongoing transmission of HSV, syphilis, or other STIs [^117KfR14] [^115NZFPM].

A 2-month history of blisters on the glans penis most often suggests **genital herpes** [^115NZFPM], but persistent lesions still warrant evaluation for syphilis, chancroid, and non-infectious causes [^116gVNFj] [^1161SvxY]. Obtain **HSV PCR** from lesion swabs [^116zd5PJ] and **syphilis serology** [^111dQMhd], and consider **biopsy** [^1161SvxY] if the diagnosis is unclear or lesions are atypical. Management includes **antivirals for HSV** [^114DHpv7], **antibiotics for bacterial STIs** [^116gVNFj], and **targeted therapy** for non-infectious conditions [^1161SvxY]; **prompt diagnosis** prevents complications and transmission [^117KfR14].

### Noninfectious penile lesions [^1161SvxY]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Family physicians commonly diagnose and manage penile cutaneous lesions. Noninfectious lesions may be classified as inflammatory and papulosquamous (e.g. psoriasis, lichen sclerosus, angiokeratomas, lichen nitidus, lichen planus) or as neoplastic (e.g. carcinoma in situ, invasive squamous cell carcinoma). The clinical presentation and appearance of the lesions guide the diagnosis. Psoriasis presents as red or salmon-colored plaques with overlying scales, often with systemic lesions. Lichen sclerosus presents as a phimotic, hypopigmented prepuce or glans penis with a cellophane-like texture. Angiokeratomas are typically asymptomatic, well-circumscribed red or blue papules, whereas lichen nitidus usually produces asymptomatic pinhead-sized, hypopigmented papules. The lesions of lichen planus are pruritic, violaceous, polygonal papules that are typically systemic. Carcinoma in situ should be suspected if the patient has velvety red or keratotic plaques of the glans penis or prepuce, whereas invasive squamous cell carcinoma presents as a painless lump, ulcer, or fungating irregular mass. Some benign lesions, such as psoriasis and lichen planus, can mimic carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma. Biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt or neoplasm cannot be excluded. The management of benign penile lesions usually involves observation or topical corticosteroids; however, neoplastic lesions generally require surgery.

### Genital ulcers: Differential diagnosis and management [^111dQMhd]. American Family Physician (2020). Low credibility.

Genital ulcers may be located on the vagina, penis, and anorectal or perineal areas and can be infectious or noninfectious. Herpes simplex virus is the most common cause of genital ulcers in the United States. A diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection is made through physical examination and observation of genital lesions. The 2015 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted disease guidelines provide strategies for managing patients with genital ulcer disease. Specific testing includes:

- **Polymerase chain reaction test**: For herpes simplex virus.
- **Syphilis serology and darkfield microscopy**: Alternatively, a direct fluorescent antibody test for Treponema pallidum.
- **Culture for Haemophilus ducreyi**: In settings where chancroid is highly prevalent.

Rarely, cases of Epstein-Barr virus may present with genital ulcers. Syphilis and chancroid cause genital ulcers and must be reported to the local health department. In some cases, no pathogen is identified. It is important to consider noninfectious etiologies such as sexual trauma, psoriasis, Behçet syndrome, and fixed drug eruptions. Genital ulcers are symptomatic by definition. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends:

- **Screening for syphilis infection**: For those at risk.
- **Early screening for syphilis infection**: In all pregnant women.
- **Against routine serologic screening for genital herpes simplex virus infection**: In asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including those who are pregnant.

### Genital herpes: Insights into sexually transmitted infectious disease [^111dH5pm]. Microbial Cell (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on genital herpes:

- **Definition**: Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted viral infection characterized by primary and recurrent inflammation and lesions.

- **Pathophysiology**: Genital herpes is mostly caused by HSV-2 and HSV-1 transmitted through sexual contact.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of genital herpes in North America is estimated to range from 5,000 to 24,000 per 100,000 people per year.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include lesions of the mucous membrane presenting as bilateral clusters of macules and papules, followed by vesicles, pustules, and ulcers on the external genitalia, with symptoms of pain, itching, burning, dysuria, lymphadenopathy, fever, cervicitis in women, and proctitis in homosexual men. Complications in women include aseptic meningitis and urinary retention. Recurrences may show prodromal symptoms of paresthesia and pains in the area of lumbosacral dermatomes. Asymptomatic genital shedding without any clinical symptoms is quite frequent. The disease increases psychological stress with frequent recurrences.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Untreated pregnancy-related genital herpes is associated with a mortality of 0.062 per 1,000 births in neonates.

### Management of external genital warts [^113dZH5y]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Genital warts affect 1% of the sexually active U.S. population and are commonly seen in primary care. Human papillomavirus types 6 and 11 are responsible for most genital warts. Warts vary from small, flat-topped papules to large, cauliflower-like lesions on the anogenital mucosa and surrounding skin. Diagnosis is clinical, but atypical lesions should be confirmed by histology.

Treatments may be applied by patients or by a clinician in the office. Patient-applied treatments include topical imiquimod, podofilox, and sinecatechins, whereas clinician-applied treatments include podophyllin, bichloroacetic acid, and trichloroacetic acid. Surgical treatments include excision, cryotherapy, and electrosurgery.

The quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine is active against virus subtypes that cause genital warts in men and women. Additionally, male circumcision may be effective in decreasing the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus.

### Penile calciphylaxis [^114J6BsX]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A 66-year-old male presented with five days of penile pain and ulceration. The patient had a history of stage 5 chronic kidney disease and had repeatedly declined hemodialysis. Wound and urine cultures were unrevealing. CT of the abdomen and pelvis did not reveal any evidence of Fournier's gangrene but identified diffuse severe calcific vasculopathy. Urology and dermatology agreed on the diagnosis of penile calciphylaxis. While the diagnosis of calciphylaxis often includes histologic evidence of obstructive vasculopathy, biopsy of penile calciphylaxis is contraindicated due to increased morbidity and mortality. Management focuses on wound care and correction of electrolyte abnormalities responsible for calcium deposition.

### Myointimoma (angiocentric myofibroblastic tumor) of the glans penis in an adolescent: A case report and review of the literature [^116Tad39]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

A 15-year-old Caucasian boy presented with a 6-month history of a slowly growing, palpable firm nodule within the glans penis. Clinically, he was completely asymptomatic and voided freely. The patient did not report any history of trauma, systemic connective tissue diseases, or other autoimmune disorders. On physical examination, there was a palpable, well-circumscribed, firm, whitish painless mass, around 1 cm in diameter within the glans (Fig. 1). The overlying skin was normal in structure without signs of inflammation. No palpable inguinal lymphadenopathy was observed, and the stage of puberty was Tanner III.

As there are no guidelines concerning penile tumors in this age group, we adhered to the EAU guidelines for penile cancer in adults and performed penile Doppler ultrasonography and MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic, hypoperfused poorly defined area inside the glans (Fig. 2). MRI did not confirm any other pathologic mass inside the glans and corpora cavernosa (Fig. 3). An excisional biopsy under general anesthesia with intra-operative pathological evaluation was decided. The formation was not clearly demarcated from the surrounding glans tissues and reached close to the urethra, without interfering with its wall. The procedure was performed using optical magnification, with particular attention to prevent injury to the neighboring urethra (Fig. 4). As the intra-operative pathological evaluation showed a benign nature of the tumor, we simply…

### Serologic screening for genital herpes infection: US Preventive Services Task Force reaffirmation recommendation statement [^117KfR14]. JAMA (2023). High credibility.

Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by two related viruses, herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2). Infection is lifelong; currently, there is no cure for HSV infection. Antiviral medications may provide clinical benefits to symptomatic persons. Transmission of HSV from a pregnant person to their infant can occur, most commonly during delivery; when genital lesions or prodromal symptoms are present, cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of transmission. Neonatal herpes infection is uncommon yet can result in substantial morbidity and mortality.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a reaffirmation evidence update on targeted key questions to systematically evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and harms of routine serologic screening for HSV-2 infection in asymptomatic adolescents, adults, and pregnant persons to reaffirm its 2016 recommendation.

The population under consideration includes adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons, without a known history, signs, or symptoms of genital HSV infection.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the harms outweigh the benefits for population-based screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons.

The USPSTF recommends against routine serologic screening for genital HSV infection in asymptomatic adolescents and adults, including pregnant persons (D recommendation).

### Three cases of subcutaneous granuloma annulare of the penis: A rare presentation of a common disease [^111yR1CF]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

To describe three patients who presented to a single institution within four years of each other with isolated granuloma annulare of the penis, a study was conducted. Granuloma annulare is an inflammatory disease of the dermis that can affect men of any age, including childhood. The occurrence of granuloma annulare on the penis is remarkably uncommon, with only 12 cases previously reported.

A retrospective review of pathologic records was conducted, confirming three cases of penile granuloma annulare diagnosed at our institution. The results describe in detail the history, presentation, histological findings, and treatment of each patient. Additionally, the clinical variants, characteristic histology, classic clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and recurrence following surgery of granuloma annulare are reviewed.

In conclusion, this study describes three individuals from a single institution with isolated granuloma annulare of the penis, suggesting this condition is more common than previously thought. It is important for practicing urologists to be familiar with this idiopathic subcutaneous disorder to avoid unnecessary aggressive surgery, as patients with penile granuloma annulare may present to them.

### Localized penile bullous pemphigoid of childhood [^116LyMiB]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Bullous pemphigoid is an acquired autoimmune bullous condition that is uncommon in childhood, with genital involvement being extremely rare. We present a case of a 7-year-old boy with bullous lesions confined to the glans penis. Precise diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and specific histopathologic testing. Oral corticosteroid therapy is the treatment of choice.

### Eruption on the vulva and groin [^116meLdP]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Answers: A. Transient acantholytic dermatosis (Grover disease) – Incorrect. Grover disease is a self-limited pruritic papulovesicular condition with a predilection for the trunk, neck, and proximal extremities, sparing the genitocrural region. Histology may resemble pemphigus, Darier disease, or Hailey-Hailey disease or be spongiotic.

B. Segmental follicular dyskeratosis (Darier disease) – Incorrect. Darier disease presents in adolescence as greasy, scaly brown papules that may form large verrucous plaques. Histology displays acantholysis with hyperkeratosis and dyskeratotic cells; verrucous epidermal hyperplasia and prominent folliculocentricity are typical. Seborrheic regions are affected with distribution on the trunk, scalp, face, and neck, in addition to the groin. Nail abnormalities are common. A segmental distribution indicates that this form of Darier disease follows the lines of Blaschko, which is inconsistent with the genitocrural distribution found in this patient.

C. Segmental Hailey-Hailey disease – Incorrect. Histopathology shows dyskeratosis and suprabasilar acantholysis with loss of intercellular bridges, classically described as a dilapidated brick wall. The clinical morphology is dissimilar, with painful flaccid vesicles and crusted erosions on intertriginous skin such as the neck, axilla, and groin in a blaschkoid distribution.

D. PAD (of the genitocrural folds) – Correct. Discrete white to skin-colored smooth or verrucous papules that coalesce into plaques on the vulva and perineum reflect the morphology of PAD. PAD is a rare chronic acantholytic dermatosis.

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^111mTCD3]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

After reviewing a diversity of post-male circumcision (MC) glanular-preputial adhesions, we confidently classified these complications into: early fibrinous adhesion, skin bridges, and cicatricial phimosis. Skin bridges are subsequently classified as single or multiple. Their location defines them as dorsal, lateral, or ventral; the latter subtype is usually associated with penile bending.

Cicatricial phimosis may be associated with several other sequelae, such as meatal stenosis and ascending urinary tract infections (UTIs). If glanular-preputial adhesions are not treated early and properly, they may result in different forms and degrees of penile bending. Additionally, these adhesions may harbor smegma particles, debris, and dirt, leading to various forms of balanitis or specific penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis. The latter may develop secondary to chronic exposure to urine, which is proposed to play a role in its etiogenesis. It is postulated that dribbled urine becomes occluded between the inner preputial remnants and the glans; this occlusion and subsequent koebnerization precipitate inflammation, potentially progressing to sclerosis characteristic of penile lichen balanitis.

Several other factors, such as genetic susceptibility, autoimmunity, and infections, have also been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis. This condition is uncommon in children, and its diagnosis is almost always clinical, supported by histology. The detection and confirmation of three cases of penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis among this group of children with glanular-preputial adhesions highlight the substantial hazards of these adhesions.

### Lichen sclerosus-associated nevus on glans penis mimicking melanoma [^111pi1nn]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A man in his mid-30s presented with a pigmented lesion on the glans penis, which quickly increased in size over a 10-month period. His medical history was significant for circumcision due to lichen sclerosus three years before referral to our clinic. There was no predisposition for malignant melanomas reported. Initially, a dermatologist suspected the pigmented lesion to be malignant melanoma and referred the patient to the department of plastic surgery for excision.

On clinical examination, the lesion measured 22 mm, was irregularly outlined with varying brown to black pigmentation, and exhibited an additional pigmented focus, raising suspicion for a satellite formation (Fig 1). Dermoscopy revealed a broad network, peripheral dots, and pseudopods. To spare the external urethral meatus, the excision biopsy was conducted with a narrow margin.

Histopathology showed a melanocytic lesion composed of an excess of melanocytes in a nested and lentiginous pattern, with irregular distribution at the dermal-epidermal junction (Fig 2). No continuous basal rows of melanocytes or upward scatter of melanocytes were present, and underlying dermal changes were consistent with lichen sclerosus. The pigmented lesion fulfilled the criteria for an atypical nevus superimposed on lichen sclerosus, extending well beyond the borders of the pigmentation.

The surgical borders were not clear, and the patient was offered re-excision, which he refused due to the sensitive anatomic location and possible complications of an abnormal urinary stream. Follow-up after three months showed no recurrence of the lesion.

### Genital herpes [^116Qqrpp]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Low credibility.

Genital herpes is an infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2) and is among the most common sexually transmitted diseases.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent sexual transmission of herpes simplex virus? What are the effects of interventions to prevent transmission of herpes simplex virus from mother to neonate? What are the effects of antiviral treatment in people with a first episode of genital herpes? What are the effects of interventions to reduce the impact of recurrence? What are the effects of treatments in people with genital herpes and HIV? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organizations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

- **Results**: We found 35 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

### Nasal-type extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma recurrence at penile glans masquerading urinary contamination on 18 F-FDG PET/CT [^111Mkhp3]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

A 69-year-old man with a history of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL-NT), underwent an interim 18 F-FDG PET/CT for response evaluation. It showed an intense focal uptake at his penile glans, initially suspected as urinary contamination. However, he complained of redness and swelling of his penis upon further inquiry. After careful observation, ENKTL-NT recurrence at the penile glans was highly suspected and finally confirmed by percutaneous biopsy.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^111QEecQ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 57-year-old man with a history of advanced non-small cell lung cancer with distant metastasis presented to the clinic with painful lesions in the inguinal folds and toenails. Six weeks prior to the visit, amivantamab was initiated. At the time of presentation, he had already received five infusions. Two weeks after starting treatment, he developed small ulcers in the groin and swollen toenails. After each subsequent infusion, new ulcers appeared in the same sites and the penile area. Other associated symptoms included cracked lips and dry mouth.

Prior to the initial visit, lesions had been treated with potent topical steroids and antifungals with minimal response. The patient denied having any family members with similar lesions, previous episodes of similar lesions, or systemic symptoms. Physical examination revealed multiple, tender, oval ulcers with scalloped borders on bilateral inguinal folds and penile shaft (Fig 1). There was erythema and swelling with an underlying hemorrhagic crust on the proximal nailfolds of the first, second, and third toes bilaterally (Fig 2). No inguinal lymphadenopathy was identified.

Laboratory study results were negative for Epstein–Barr virus IgG and immunoglobulin M, cytomegalovirus, HIV, herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 IgG and immunoglobulin M, rapid plasma reagin test, and Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. A skin biopsy specimen from an active lesion on the groin showed an ulcer with a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Fig 3). Based on the clinical presentation, we suspected the possibility of drug-related toxicity.

### Lipschutz ulcers in a 4-month-old girl [^112af55M]. Pediatric Dermatology (2022). Low credibility.

Lipschutz ulcers, or non-sexually acquired genital ulcers, typically occur in older children and young adults. A diagnosis of Lipschutz ulcers can only be made after excluding common infectious and non-infectious causes of mucosal ulcers. Herein, we present the case of a 4-month-old girl with painful ulceration of the labia consistent with Lipschutz ulcers.

### Necrotizing granulomatous inflammation of the glans penis [^115B4KEf]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

We describe the case of a 73-year-old man who presented with a 10-month history of an ulcerating lesion on the glans penis. Initially, this was thought to be an invasive squamous cell carcinoma, but a biopsy showed histological features consistent with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation. Extensive serological, immunological, and microbiological tests only showed positive antinuclear and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, indicating a possible autoimmune aetiology; however, an underlying systemic cause was not identified.

Treatment with oral corticosteroids limited the inflammatory process, but due to the gross destruction of the glans penis, he still required a glansectomy and split-skin graft reconstruction, from which he recovered well. Although this patient ultimately required surgery for this rare presentation, this case highlights the differential diagnosis of penile ulceration (that transcends neoplasia) and the importance of performing and interpreting penile biopsies before undertaking potentially mutilating definitive surgery.

### Visual clues - dermatological manifestations of sexually transmitted infections in men [^116BkYyW]. Nature Reviews Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Considering the increasing prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, accurate diagnosis and management based on the diverse dermatological presentations of sexually transmitted infections are crucial. A strong visual diagnostic skill set guides clinicians towards prompt recognition, directs appropriate diagnostic testing, and enables timely initiation of treatment. This procedure, in turn, helps to interrupt infection transmission and mitigate long-term complications. Thus, incorporating visual learning and a dermatological perspective into urology training is essential, empowering urologists to make a difference in improving sexual health outcomes and supporting public health efforts.

### Trousseau syndrome presenting with penile gangrene [^113sPAbp]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old Chinese man with poorly controlled, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia was referred for a 2-month history of glans penis gangrene. He had no known drug allergies. He had a history of prostate adenocarcinoma with bony metastases [stage T3, N4, M1, Gleason 9 (score 4+5)], serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 272 μg/L (normal range, 0–4 μg/L) and had undergone bilateral subcapsular orchidectomy 6 years ago with improvement of serum PSA levels to 0.8 μg/L postoperatively. He defaulted follow-up for 5 years and re-presented with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with a PSA of 126.6 μg/L. He was started on bicalutamide (antiandrogen) tablets.

The penile lesions started as painful erosions surrounding the penile meatus, which gradually became necrotic over 2 months. There were no vesicles or bullae. The patient attempted to self-medicate with topical Baneocin powder (Bacitracin Zinc, Neomycin Sulfate). He also experienced worsening pain and required multiple courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tramadol. He denied any urinary symptoms or systemic symptoms before or during the onset of the erosions. There were no recent changes in his regular medication. His last sexual contact was more than 10 years ago.

Clinically, the patient was afebrile and had near-circumferential dry gangrene involving the glans penis associated with severe swelling of the foreskin and paraphimosis. The penile shaft and scrotal skin were unremarkable, with no significant dermatologic signs elsewhere.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^116AGzoi]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

A small percentage of individuals with genital HSV-1 infection have a high rate of recurrence beyond the first year of infection. It is unknown whether HSV-1 in these individuals differs genetically from other HSV-1 isolates that are successfully controlled by the host immune system, or if the ongoing recurrences represent an innate failure of the immune system. Prior approaches studying HSV-1 genetic variation in clinical cases such as these have relied on PCR analysis of single genes or on viral samples that have been expanded in tissue culture. Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing and targeted oligonucleotide enrichment now enable capture of whole viral genomes directly from mucosal surfaces, without expansion in culture. This approach has been applied to viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human cytomegalovirus to reveal viral adaptation or evolution within a host and to deduce its potential impacts on pathogenesis and disease.

Here, we present the first genome sequences of uncultured mucosal swab specimens of HSV-1, which were collected from a study participant who has an unusually high recurrence rate of genital HSV-1. We used oligonucleotide enrichment to capture and sequence uncultured viral genomes directly from symptomatic lesions and nonlesion sites, and standard library preparation methods to sequence viral genomes from diagnostic lesion material expanded in culture. With these data, our goal was to establish the level of viral diversity present within a single host over a time period involving several rounds of latency and reactivation.

### The 2020 International Alliance for the Control of Scabies Consensus Criteria for the Diagnosis of Scabies [^1169a3p7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

- **Male genital lesions**: Discrete papules or larger nodules found on the penis (shaft, corona, glans, prepuce) and/or scrotum are highly specific for scabies. Their surface may be smooth or rough, depending on how vigorously the patient has been scratching, but they are not scaly. Typically, several lesions are present simultaneously in an affected individual. These lesions are often very itchy, but in some individuals, they may not be itchy at all. Genital lesions are reported to occur in up to 10–30% of male patients with scabies, but they may be more frequent in adult males in temperate climates.

- **Typical lesions**: The clinical signs of common scabies vary widely in terms of the appearance of individual lesions, appearance of grouped or clustered lesions, and severity and degree of secondary changes such as excoriation, impetiginization, eczematization, and lichenification (thickening of skin due to scratching and rubbing). In the absence of the highly specific signs of burrows or male genital lesions, determining whether other observed skin lesions are typical for scabies is critical for diagnosing clinical or suspected scabies. For lesions to be considered typical, examiners must consider both morphology and number.

In morphology, typical scabies lesions are small, elevated, and easily palpated. The most common lesions are solid and 2–3 mm in diameter (papules). Larger, nodular lesions, usually 5–10 mm and occasionally > 10 mm, are more likely to be seen in certain body areas such as the groin and genitalia.

### Amivantamab, the first epidermal growth factor receptor and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor inhibitor, associated with penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia [^111pDGCA]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

After a literature review, apart from clinical trials, a single case of amivantamab-induced adverse cutaneous reactions was found. A 53-year-old man developed facial, scalp, buttocks, and lower limb lesions after 3 weeks of treatment. Notably, the patient developed erosive erythema in the perianal region, erythematous papules on the scrotum, and paronychia-like changes, similar to our patient. Therapy was continued with lesions recurring following each infusion; however, lesions improved with kangfuxin liquid, compound polymyxin B ointment, and recombinant human epidermal growth factor gel.

The differential diagnosis of genital ulcers in an immunocompromised patient includes chancroid, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, Behçet disease, lymphogranuloma venereum, and herpes simplex virus. The absence of viral cytopathic changes on histology makes a viral infection less likely. However, given the unavailability of polymerase chain reaction results in our case, the possibility of herpes zoster virus cannot be entirely excluded. Negative infectious workup, nonspecific histologic findings, unresponsiveness to azithromycin, presence of paronychia, dryness, and a temporal relationship with drug ingestion support the diagnosis of EGFR-inhibitor cutaneous toxicity. Among other differential diagnoses, the possibility of monkeypox in immunocompromised patients presenting with genital ulcers cannot be overlooked, which has resurged in the past year and a half.

Herein, we present a case of penile and inguinal ulcers and paronychia following amivantamab administration. Although rare, health care professionals should be aware of these potential adverse reactions.

### Umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the genital area in a man [^114wX2HU]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Molluscum contagiosum
B. Chickenpox
C. Cryptococcosis
D. Smallpox
E. Monkeypox

- **Answers**:

	- **A. Molluscum contagiosum**: Incorrect. Umbilication of lesions raises the possibility of molluscum contagiosum, caused by a poxvirus. However, molluscum contagiosum has a longer incubation period ranging from 2 weeks to 2 to 3 months. The skin lesions are characterized by smooth and firm papules without vesiculation. Histopathology shows lobular epidermal hyperplasia resulting in a cup-shaped lesion, where keratinocytes are enlarged and filled with eosinophilic inclusion bodies, known as Henderson-Patterson bodies.

	- **B. Chickenpox**: Incorrect. Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and is more typical of the pediatric age group. It is characterized by a generalized, cropping vesicular rash with intense pruritus. Histopathologically, keratinocytes are multinucleated and acantholytic with nuclear inclusions, alongside epidermal necrosis similar to herpes simplex. Leucocytoclastic vasculitis may be present.

	- **C. Cryptococcosis**: Incorrect. Although skin lesions of cryptococcosis present with dome-shaped, firm umbilicated papules, they appear predominantly over the face. Histologically, they reveal layers of clear histiocytes containing spherical fungal structures measuring 4 to 20 μm.

	- **D. Smallpox**: Incorrect. Smallpox is caused by the variola virus, belonging to the genus Orthopoxvirus. The last recorded patient of smallpox was reported in 1977. In 1980, the World Health Organization declared that smallpox had been eradicated, and there is no evidence of new cases of smallpox transmission.

### A rare case of bacterial species infection: A new mimicker in the dermatology office [^114T4gyT]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 54-year-old man, with a history of genital warts, presented to the clinic with a mildly painful and pruritic grayish-red macerated plaque with ulceration and erythematous borders localized on the penis for approximately 3 weeks. Before presentation, the patient had been experiencing genital warts on the ventral and dorsal shaft of the penis and right scrotum from 2017 to 2021 (Fig 1, A-E). Biopsies of the genital warts were obtained after failed treatment with topical imiquimod and liquid nitrogen cryotherapy, which demonstrated high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA strain. Treatment was then modified to multiple rounds of liquid nitrogen cryotherapy and ozenoxacin cream 1% with improvement.

- **Figure 1**:
	- **A, B**: Patient of interest presented in 2018 with raised, flesh-colored papules on the ventral surface of the penile shaft demonstrating high-risk human papillomavirus 16 DNA strain.
	- **C**: In 2019, patient developed more flesh-colored lesions, highlighting the recurrence of genital warts on the shaft of the penis.
	- **D, E**: In 2022, the patient continued to develop genital warts on the ventral and dorsal shaft of the penis.

In early September 2022, the patient visited an urgent care facility complaining of a new and unusual, painful lesion at the right distal dorsal penile shaft, which was treated as a potential herpes outbreak (Fig 2, A). A culture of the lesion was obtained, and the patient was then started on valacyclovir 1 g twice a day for 7 days and mupirocin ointment. The culture resulted negative for viruses, including herpes and monkeypox.

### An overview of penile and scrotal dermatoses [^111yQ9E7]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

There are a number of dermatoses that manifest in the genital region. Urologists are often the first point of contact for patients with such disorders. These can be isolated genital conditions or manifestations of a more widespread cutaneous disease. Though similar in appearance, there are often key clinical findings that aid in diagnosis. In general, genital dermatoses can be classified as physiologic variants, inflammatory, neoplastic, or infectious in etiology. This article provides a broad overview for urologists in addressing both common and rarer penile and scrotal dermatoses. Emphasis is placed on characteristic clinical findings to aid in diagnosis. Recommendations for diagnostic evaluation, treatment, and appropriate follow-up are discussed.

### Diagnosis and management of genital herpes: Key questions and review of the evidence for the 2021 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted infections treatment guidelines [^115NZFPM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 or type 2, is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection (STI). Given that HSV is an incurable infection, there are important concerns about appropriate use of diagnostic tools, management of infection, prevention of transmission to sexual partners, and appropriate counseling.

In preparation for updating the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) STI treatment guidelines, key questions for the management of genital herpes infection were developed with a panel of experts. To answer these questions, a systematic literature review was performed, with tables of evidence including articles that would change guidance assembled. These data were used to inform recommendations in the 2021 CDC STI treatment guidelines.

### Naspag clinical consensus on nonsexually acquired genital ulcers (vulvar aphthous ulcers) [^1159LJ44]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2025). Low credibility.

The objective of this document is to provide guidance on the recognition, diagnosis, and management of non-sexually acquired genital ulcers in pediatric and adolescent patients. Commonly known as genital or vulvar aphthous ulcers, these lesions are typically seen in the peri-menarchal population. They are exquisitely painful, generally self-limited, and often managed with supportive care. Details of ulcer physical appearance, proposed etiology, and options for management are provided to familiarize clinicians with this entity, which can be alarming for patients and families.

### Distribution and arrangement of multiple lesions in the anogenital region [^111V9LhC]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

A series of skin diseases may affect the anogenital region with unusual presentations; therefore, a careful clinical approach is needed to make a correct diagnosis. Diseases of the anogenital area include inflammatory dermatoses, infectious lesions, and neoplastic conditions. Inflammatory dermatoses are frequently not restricted to the anogenital area and often occur in other sites. Infectious anogenital lesions can be easily confused with other benign or malignant processes. Tumors that arise on the anogenital skin are similar to those that occur on the skin elsewhere. The differential diagnosis of all of these lesions often depends upon the distribution and arrangement of the skin lesions.

### Caverject [^11619SUn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The following adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling:

- **Prolonged erection and priapism**: See warnings and precautions (5.1).
- **Penile fibrosis**: See warnings and precautions (5.2).

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, the adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Local adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of the 1,861 patients in clinical studies of Caverject, including an 18-month, open-label study. Reported reactions include injection site hemorrhage, injection site inflammation, itching, swelling, edema, urethral bleeding, penile warmth, numbness, irritation, sensitivity, pruritus, erythema, painful erection, and abnormal ejaculation. In these studies, no local adverse reactions were reported in the 294 patients who received placebo except for penile pain, which was reported in 2% of patients.

- **Penile pain**: In the majority of cases, penile pain was rated mild or moderate in intensity. Three percent of patients discontinued treatment because of penile pain.

- **Prolonged erection/priapism**: Prolonged erection was defined as an erection lasting 4 to 6 hours; priapism was defined as an erection lasting 6 hours or longer. In clinical studies, the frequency of prolonged erection after Caverject was 4%.

### Umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the genital area in a man [^112CinX8]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 61-year-old HIV-negative man presented with itchy lesions on his genital area, which had developed 3 days before the consultation. Seven days prior to the eruption, he attended a party where he had unprotected sexual intercourse with men. Physical examination revealed three asymptomatic, 3 to 4 mm umbilicated vesicles and multiple pustules on the penis shaft and pubis, accompanied by bilateral lymphadenopathy (Fig 1, A). On follow-up after 10 days, the vesicles and pustules spontaneously resolved, leaving some crusted lesions (Fig 1, B).

- **Dermoscopy findings**: Dermoscopy of an umbilicated vesicle revealed a trizonal pattern, characterized by a central ulceration-crust, a white peripheral halo with dotted hemorrhagic vessels, and a paler pink zone at the periphery (Fig 2).

- **Histopathology findings**: Histopathology showed a cluster of pallor and ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, with scattered eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Fig 3).

### Balanitis xerotica obliterans in boys [^1118Gg9j]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic dermatitis of unknown etiology, most often involving the glans and prepuce but sometimes extending into the urethra. We report our 10-year experience with BXO in pediatric patients.

- **Materials and methods**: Our pathology database was queried for all tissue diagnoses of BXO from 1992 to 2002. Available charts were reviewed, and patient presentation, clinical and referral history, operative procedure(s), and postoperative course were recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 41 patients had a tissue-confirmed diagnosis of BXO, with a median age of 10.6 years. Of these patients, 85% were between 8 to 13 years old, and all had referrals available for review. The most common referral diagnoses were phimosis (52%), balanitis (13%), and buried penis (10%). No patient had the diagnosis of BXO at referral. Nineteen patients (46%) underwent curative circumcision or redo circumcision with no recurrence at a mean follow-up of 12.5 months (range 1 to 57). Eleven patients (27%) had BXO involvement of the meatus and underwent circumcision combined with meatotomy or meatoplasty. Nine patients (22%) required extensive plastic operations of the penis, including buccal mucosa grafts in two cases.

- **Conclusions**: The incidence of BXO in pediatric patients may be higher than previously reported, with the diagnosis rarely made by pediatricians. Our study demonstrates that older patients, those with BXO involvement of the meatus, and those with a history of surgery for BXO tend to have a more severe and morbid clinical course.

### Painful facial, oral, and genital ulcers [^11798xpz]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A biopsy of a right inguinal papule revealed an orthokeratotic stratum corneum with a preserved granular layer, ballooning degeneration, spongiosis, karyorrhexis, neutrophilic infiltrate, and intraepithelial cytoplasmic inclusion bodies (Fig 3). What stain or additional test, if any, would confirm the diagnosis?

- **Options**:
	- A. Grocott methenamine silver-nitrate (GMS) stain
	- B. Giemsa stain
	- C. Direct immunofluorescence
	- D. Warthin-Starry silver stain
	- E. No stain or additional testing needed

- **Answers**:
	- A. GMS stain – Incorrect. GSM stain is useful for identifying fungal organisms and, although not routinely used, could aid in diagnosing cutaneous candidiasis.
	- B. Giemsa stain – Incorrect. Epithelial scrapings of active HSV lesions with Giemsa stain can show multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear viral inclusions to aid in diagnosing HSV; however, Giemsa stain has no utility in diagnosing monkeypox.
	- C. Direct immunofluorescence – Incorrect. Although there are no pathognomonic laboratory tests to diagnose Behçet syndrome, direct immunofluorescence seems promising in aiding the diagnosis.
	- D. Warthin-Starry silver stain – Incorrect. The gold standard for diagnosing syphilis is serologic testing, although the Warthin-Starry stain can be useful for identifying spirochetes on pathology.
	- E. No stain or additional testing needed – Correct. Monkeypox is characterized histologically by ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, prominent spongiosis, dermal edema, and acute inflammation, consistent with this case. The clinical progression of lesions is…

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^112oa5d7]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Glanular-preputial adhesions (GPA) are often diagnosed in babies and children, regardless of circumcision status. In circumcised patients, GPA may present as fibrinous adhesions forming early, often in the first weeks post-circumcision. These are made of fibrin and might be managed conservatively with medical treatment (group A). Alternatively, fibrous, well-formed single or multiple skin bridges GPA requires surgical adhesiolysis (group B). Fibrinous and physiological GPA are better labeled as preputial synechia, which may be a transient phenomenon.

Patients often present late with a disfigured circumcision scar, usually recognized by older children or their parents. Itching and burning sensations are common symptoms, while adolescents may also experience painful erections and penile bending. Secondary superimposed bacterial infection, penile chordee, and penile scleroatrophic lichen are not rare sequelae. Penile chordee typically develops after some time and is common with ventral skin bridges.

In this retrospective single-center study, 95 consecutive children with different forms of glanular-preputial adhesions following non-medical male circumcision are assessed. The spectrum of complications and the different management modalities available for this condition are presented and discussed.

### Steglujan [^111joqPR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Inform male patients that yeast infections of the penis, such as balanitis or balanoposthitis, may occur, especially in uncircumcised males. Provide them with information on the signs and symptoms, such as rash or redness of the glans or foreskin of the penis. Advise on treatment options and when to seek medical advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of sitagliptin, a component of Steglujan. If symptoms such as rash, hives, or swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat occur, instruct patients to stop taking Steglujan and seek medical advice promptly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

- **Severe and disabling arthralgia**: Inform patients that severe and disabling joint pain may occur with this class of drugs. The time to onset of symptoms can range from one day to years. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if severe joint pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid may occur with the DPP-4 class of drugs. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if blisters or erosions occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

- **Fetal toxicity**: Advise pregnant patients of the potential risk to a fetus with treatment with Steglujan. Instruct patients to immediately inform their healthcare provider if pregnant or planning to become pregnant.

### Warfarin-induced skin necrosis diagnosed on clinical grounds and treated with maggot debridement therapy [^112ELF1m]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Low credibility.

A patient with a history of deep vein thrombosis presented with painful bruising and blistering on his left leg 7–10 days after warfarin treatment. A complicated 2-month treatment followed, where vasculitis was originally diagnosed based on histological findings before the final diagnosis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis (WISN) was made on clinical grounds. Warfarin was stopped, reversed, and low molecular weight heparin was started, but the lesions progressed to full-thickness necrosis. Initially, this was treated with conventional surgical debridement before introducing maggot debridement therapy (MDT) in an effort to salvage the limb.

### Management of cutaneous disorders related to inflammatory bowel disease [^115pdpp1]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Resolution of penile pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) has been reported with therapeutic colectomy in ulcerative colitis. Because the course of PG can be independent of the course of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and has even been reported years after proctocolectomy, bowel resection is not a primary therapy.

The prognosis is that of the associated disease. Control of the intestinal condition can resolve the skin problem, and recurrences may occur at periods of exacerbation of IBD. In patients who readily respond to treatment, the prognosis of the disease is good, but considerable scarring and disfigurement may eventually result.

- **Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans**: Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans (PPV) is a benign and rare mucocutaneous dermatosis often associated with gastrointestinal disorders, especially with IBD. Some authors consider PPV in the spectrum of neutrophilic dermatoses, and others suggest that it is a form of PG.

There is a strong association of PPV with IBD, particularly with ulcerative colitis (UC). Usually, the intestinal disease precedes the onset of oral lesions by months or years. However, oral involvement in IBD could be previous or simultaneous to the gastrointestinal symptoms. The clinical course of oral lesions parallels the activity of IBD. There is general consensus that the bowel should be investigated in PPV, even if intestinal symptoms are absent at presentation.

Clinically, oral and cutaneous lesions are characteristic and distinctive, although any mucosal surface can be involved. Oral examination reveals multiple, non-painful, small yellowish pustules on an erythematous and edematous base.

The penis is an organ of enormous importance, vital for both excretory and reproductive functions. Its anatomy can lead to various emergent conditions, making a thorough understanding of its anatomy and physiology central to recognizing these conditions. Physicians should maintain a high clinical suspicion for penile emergencies and perform a thorough physical examination to make a proper diagnosis. Prompt diagnosis and proper management are essential for minimizing dysfunction of this vital organ.

### The perils of penile enhancement: Case report of a fulminant penile infection [^116zowNE]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A 31-year-old male presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of progressive pain and swelling of the penile shaft. This was preceded by unprotected sexual intercourse three days prior. The patient subsequently self-administered a single 50 mg dose of oral prednisone the following morning and developed subjective chills on the same day.

Relevant past medical history included subcutaneous hyaluronic filler injections at a cosmetic clinic for penile girth enhancement two months prior to presentation, distal tubularised hypospadias repair, and genital herpes simplex. The patient had multiple behavioural risk factors, including regular self-administered intramuscular testosterone injections, self-injection of growth hormone to the base of the penis (performed one month prior to the penile filler procedure), multiple heterosexual sexual partners, cocaine use, heavy alcohol consumption (22 standard drinks/day), and a 10 pack-year smoking history.

On arrival, the patient was tachycardic to 127 beats per minute, hypotensive to 90/50 mmHg, and febrile to 40°C. Physical examination revealed gross penile oedema and erythema of the penile shaft, which ceased at the base of the penis, with an associated curvature of the penile shaft towards the 8 o'clock position. There was also a small, tender abrasion on the distal ventral aspect of the penile shaft 1 cm proximal to the glans. Blood tests showed a white cell count (WCC) of 6.1 × 10⁹/L, creatinine of 95 μmol/L, and lactate of 2.3 mmol/L. Urinalysis was negative. The patient was admitted and commenced on intraveous antibiotics.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for penile size abnormalities, particularly in relation to history and physical examination, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend using stretched penile length measurements. This involves measuring from the skin junction to the glans tip or dorsally from the pubic bone to the glans tip to define penile length. Both flaccid and erect measurements should be taken to assess penile length in detail.

### Necrotising granulomatous mass of the foreskin with inguinal lymphadenopathy: A rare presentation of syphilis [^116HVPUJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Penile lesions can arise from the epithelium of the foreskin, glans, or shaft. They pose a diagnostic challenge that is largely guided by clinical presentation and physical examination. The broad differential for penile lesions includes sexually acquired and non-sexually acquired infections, malignant and premalignant lesions, inflammatory conditions, trauma, and, rarely, iatrogenic causes, such as reactive inflammation due to foreign body material.

Infectious aetiology includes viral, parasitic, and bacterial infections. The most prevalent infections are human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), scabies, and syphilis. Infectious penile lesions have vastly different appearances: HPV-induced condyloma appears as soft, papillomatous growths; HSV presents as genital ulceration; scabies causes papules with multiple linear burrows; and syphilis typically presents as a solitary, painless ulcer with well-defined margins and an indurated base.

Penile carcinoma is rare but should be considered in men with a suspicious mass or ulcer of the penis. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) accounts for the majority of penile cancers. Other penile cancers include melanoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, and lymphoma. Carcinoma in situ often presents as solitary, painless lesions, similar to invasive SCC. Definitive diagnosis of penile carcinoma requires tissue biopsy for histopathological confirmation. Although most penile SCCs arise de novo, some are preceded by premalignant lesions, such as cutaneous horn and lichen sclerosus. Cutaneous horn presents as overgrowth and cornification of the skin.

### Buried penis: Congenital syndrome of a short penile shaft and a paucity of penile shaft skin [^115eaBs6]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

The term "buried penis" has been applied to a variety of penile abnormalities and includes an apparent buried penis that is obvious at birth. The purpose of this study was to examine prospectively the congenital buried penis and evaluate an operative technique for its management.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 31 males, aged 2 to 28 months (mean age 12.3 months), with a congenital buried penis underwent surgical correction of the anomaly. Measurements were made of the penile shaft skin, inner leaf of the prepuce, glans length, and stretched penile length. Observations of the subcutaneous tissue of the penis were made. The outer leaf of the prepuce was resected, following which covering of the penile shaft was accomplished with a combination of the penile shaft skin and the inner leaf of the prepuce.

- **Results**: Stretched penile lengths ranged from 2.3 to 4.1 cm (mean 3.1 cm). The glans length, from the tip of the glans dorsally to the corona, ranged from 0.9 to 1.6 cm (mean 1.2 cm). The inner leaf of the prepuce ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 cm (mean 1.5 cm) in length, while the dorsal penile skin lengths were 1 to 1.6 cm (mean 0.8 cm). In all patients, complete shaft coverage was accomplished using a combination of varying degrees of penile shaft skin and the inner leaf of the prepuce. In no case was there a requirement for either unfurling of the inner and outer leaf of the prepuce or mobilization of scrotal flaps to accomplish shaft coverage. All patients healed well and have done well with follow-up from 6 months to 1 year.

### Treatment of pearly penile papules with CO2 laser [^113wGufy]. Dermatologic Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Pearly penile papules are angiofibromas found on the corona and sulcus of the glans penis. While these represent a benign condition, psychological and cosmetic concerns often prompt patients to seek therapeutic removal of these lesions. Multiple therapeutic modalities have been reported; however, the use of CO2 laser has proven to be the most effective at the time of writing.

- **Objective**: To demonstrate the efficacy of CO2 laser in treating pearly penile papules.

- **Methods**: Case report.

- **Results**: We report the successful treatment of pearly penile papules in an African American man with CO2 laser.

- **Conclusion**: The use of CO2 laser is an effective treatment for pearly penile papules.

### Genome-wide surveillance of genital herpes simplex virus type 1 from multiple anatomic sites over time [^112SekEu]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Here we present genomic and in vitro analyses of temporally separated episodes of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) shedding by an HSV-1–seropositive and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/HSV-2–seronegative individual who has frequent recurrences of genital HSV-1. Using oligonucleotide enrichment, we compared viral genomes from uncultured swab specimens collected on different days and from distinct genital sites. We found that viral genomes from seven swab specimens and three cultured specimens collected over a four-month period from the same individual were 98.5% identical. We observed a greater than two-fold difference in the number of minority variants between swab specimens from lesions, swab specimens from nonlesion sites, and cultured specimens. This virus appeared distinct in its phylogenetic relationship to other strains, and it contained novel coding variations in 21 viral proteins. This included a truncation in the UL11 tegument protein, which is involved in viral egress and spread. Normal immune responses were identified, suggesting that unique viral genomic features may contribute to the recurrent genital infection that this participant experiences.

### Glans injury during ritual circumcision [^115gdAqG]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Circumcision is one of the most performed surgical procedures in the world, often conducted for nontherapeutic reasons. Depending on cultural and social backgrounds, the procedure may be performed by various sources, ranging from trained healthcare practitioners to laypeople, leading to different frequencies and types of complications. Glans injury during ritual circumcision is a rare yet serious complication due to its associated morbidity and long-term consequences.

- **Objective**: In this study, we describe the experience of two medical centers with the management and follow-up of glans injury after ritual circumcision.

- **Methods**: We have retrospectively reviewed the medical files of all pediatric patients who presented to the emergency room with glans injury following ritual circumcision, over a 17-year period from two medical centers.

- **Results**: A total of eight patients were identified, who underwent ritual circumcision between 7 and 9 days of age. On presentation, one infant had complete glans amputation, while the others presented with partial amputation of the glans. Six of the eight patients had a simultaneous urethral injury. All patients underwent surgical correction for their injury. Patients with isolated glans injury underwent primary glans anastomosis. Of the six cases with simultaneous urethral injury, three underwent end-to-end urethral anastomosis following anastomosis of the amputated glans. One patient with complete glans amputation underwent a similar procedure, with initial end-to-end urethral anastomosis followed by glans anastomosis to the corpora cavernosa, and two were managed by ur…

### Toxigenic corynebacterium diphtheriae-associated genital ulceration [^112N8WwM]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

In October 2016, a 16-year-old boy from Ethiopia sought care at the University Hospital of Cologne (Cologne, Germany) with three papules at the glans and a slightly bleeding, painful ulceration at the dorsal shaft of his penis. He complained about local pruritus and had swollen, painful inguinal nodules on the left side. Upon clinical examination, the ulcer appeared to have coalesced from a few smaller lesions with an erythematous base and a yellow to purulent exudate. The boy denied having lesions before the ulcer developed. Given his undefined status of residence and the fact he lived in accommodation for asylum seekers, it was challenging to clarify his specific history satisfactorily. As he was an unaccompanied minor refugee, examiners considered the possibility of traumatic sexual experiences since the boy was unwilling to share further details, particularly about his sexual history. A general physical examination yielded unremarkable results, and his pubertal development was normal.

- **Initial diagnosis and treatment**: We presumed a sexually transmitted infection. Considering herpes simplex virus and chancroid as likely diagnoses, the boy began empiric outpatient treatment with valaciclovir and azithromycin. However, serologic screening for syphilis and herpes simplex virus PCR tests returned negative results.

- **Causative organism and subsequent hospitalization**: Toxigenic C. diphtheriae was cultured from the ulcer, and the boy was hospitalized seven days after the initial consultation due to cutaneous diphtheria. The toxigenicity of the isolate was verified by real-time PCR for the tox gene and the modified Elek test conducted at the German National Consulting Laboratory for Diphtheria.

### The diagnostic challenge of coma blisters [^115jWnwA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Coma blisters are a benign dermatologic condition that can be diagnostically challenging. This case was unique in that the lesions closely mimicked retiform purpura in a patient with a darker skin tone, Fitzpatrick type V. Distinguishing coma blisters from more serious diseases requires thorough history-taking, dermatologic examination, and timely skin biopsy. Increased representation of images of dermatologic diseases in patients with darker skin tones may help improve diagnostic acumen.

### Genital herpes: A review [^11152iNU]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Genital herpes simplex virus infection is a recurrent, lifelong disease with no cure. The strongest predictor for infection is a person's number of lifetime sexual partners. The natural history includes first-episode mucocutaneous infection, establishment of latency in the dorsal root ganglion, and subsequent reactivation. Most infections are transmitted via asymptomatic viral shedding. Classic outbreaks consist of a skin prodrome and possible constitutional symptoms such as headache, fever, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. As the infection progresses, papules and vesicles on an erythematous base, as well as erosions, appear over hours to days. These lesions usually crust, re-epithelialize, and heal without scarring. First-episode infections are more extensive, with primary lesions lasting two to six weeks compared to approximately one week for recurrent lesions.

Atypical manifestations are common. Infected individuals experience a median of four recurrences per year after their first episode, but rates vary greatly. Genital herpes simplex virus type 2 recurs six times more frequently than type 1. Viral culture is preferred over polymerase chain reaction testing for diagnosis. Serologic testing can be useful in individuals with a questionable history. Effective oral antiviral medications are available for initial, episodic, and suppressive therapy, although these are not a cure. There is some evidence that alternative therapies such as L-lysine, zinc, and certain herbal preparations may offer benefits. Counseling patients about the risk of transmission is crucial and helps prevent the spread of the disease.

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^115Mx8hZ]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Partial (A) and circumferential (B) fibrinous adhesion can be seen in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 depicts well-formed skin bridges, which could be single (A), multiple (B), and with ventral bending (C). Multiple adhesions with penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis are shown in Fig. 3. Different grades of a completely covered glans penis with cicatricial phimosis (A & B) and concealed penis are presented in Fig. 4.

The scar covering the glans completely with a stenotic preputial hiatus ending in cicatricial phimosis was detected in three patients (Fig. 4 A-B). Adhesions that covered 50% of the glans or more were detected in two patients (Fig. 4 C). Three patients had adhesions that covered less than 50% of the glans penis (Fig. 4 D). Adhesions that cover the glans penis and occlude only the coronal sulcus are considered proximal adhesions, while those extending distally to the urinary meatus are considered distal.

- **Management outcomes**: Group A patients managed with local topical steroid ointment did not develop any secondary complications or side effects. Children with cicatricial phimosis showed an acceptable outcome and had an uneventful postoperative course. Most post-operative adhesive complications of ritual male circumcision are primarily confined to the distal penile parts, including the meatus, coronal sulcus, and distal penile shaft. It is extremely rare for adhesions to affect the penoscrotal junction, except in cases of severe microphallus and concealed penis.

- **Obesity in childhood note**: The most common definition of obesity in childhood is weight in excess of 20% above the ideal weight for age and gender. In Group B, six children were detected to have apparent overweight issues.

### Nonuremic penile calciphylaxis treated with pentoxifylline [^113S4UXj]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Examination demonstrated a deep ulceration of the dorsal glans penis with a fibrinous base and a shallower ulceration of the inferior urethral meatus.

Histopathologic evaluation revealed an inflammatory fibronecrotic crust overlying an ulcer with marked calcification of arterioles and focal organized thrombi within the dermis. Von Kossa stain highlighted concentric vascular calcification of small-sized, medium-sized, and large-sized vessels (Fig 2, A and B), leading to a diagnosis of nonuremic penile calciphylaxis.

- **Fig 2**:
	- **A**: Concentric calcifications of a deep dermal vessel.
	- **B**: Calcifications highlighted by Von Kossa staining (hematoxylin and eosin, 40× magnification).

The patient was on dual antiplatelet therapy for his comorbid diagnoses. In addition, the patient was started on pentoxifylline 400 mg three times a day, with diligent wound care including dilute vinegar soaks and topical antibiotics. Although the initiation of Vitamin K 10 mg three times per week was recommended, the patient did not begin this therapy. Intralesional sodium thiosulfate was considered but was held in reserve due to the pain of injections.

Fortunately, at the 1-month follow-up, the ulcer of the ventral glans penis had completely resolved, and the ulcer of the dorsal penis had significantly improved (Fig 3). The patient's pain was considerably alleviated. Given the excellent clinical response, the patient continued on the regimen of pentoxifylline 400 mg three times per day. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient continued to report improvement.

### Penile calciphylaxis [^111k5WdQ]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Calciphylaxis is an uncommon condition usually seen in patients with end-stage renal disease. The typical features include violaceous skin lesions overlying painful, indurated, subcutaneous nodules. Necrosis and nonhealing ulcers, with secondary gangrene, sepsis, and death frequently follow. The outpatient hemodialysis population has a reported calciphylaxis prevalence of 1% to 4.1%; however, published studies contain only a few case reports of penile calciphylaxis. The urologic presentation consists primarily of penile gangrene. A description of our patient, the underlying pathologic features, a review of the relevant published studies, and the possible predisposing conditions are included.

### Blue-gray plaque of the penis [^114GNKWt]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Histologic diagnosis: A shave biopsy found the presence of parakeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis of the epidermis. We also observed within the keratinocytes abundant cytoplasm and irregularly hyperchromatic nuclei (koilocytosis) (Fig 4). Polymerase chain reaction of the biopsy was positive for human papillomavirus type 6.

- **Key message**: Genital warts are the most common sexually transmitted disease, and they are caused by the human papillomavirus. This case highlights the difficulties encountered in the differential diagnosis of darkly pigmented planar lesions of the penis. Dermoscopic patterns in genital warts have been described by several investigators (fingerlike, knoblike, mosaiclike, and pattern combinations). We present a case of a genital wart that falls into none of the aforementioned patterns. The honeycomb pattern observed on confocal microscopy is normally observed in seborrheic keratoses. This case illustrates the complementarity of dermoscopy and confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of clinically atypical lesions of the genital mucosa.

### Lichen sclerosus-associated nevus on glans penis mimicking melanoma [^115eG3wM]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: Genital nevi pose a diagnostic challenge because they may be characterized by irregular borders and variegated colors and reach large diameters, which are features that overlap with those of malignant melanomas. However, accurate diagnosis is imperative because malignant melanoma is a differential diagnosis with potentially severe consequences. Melanocytic proliferation and lichen sclerosus have been reported to co-occur in women, although concomitant lichen sclerosus and melanocytic proliferations are not well described in male genitalia, with only a few case reports existing. The stronger association between lichen sclerosus and nevi in female patients may be due to a higher prevalence of the former on female genitalia.

To differentiate malignant melanomas from genital nevi superimposed on lichen sclerosus, Carlson et al. and El Shabrawi-Caelen et al. suggested a set of key histopathologic characteristics. In this case, histopathologic features were melanocytic nests, which varied in size and form, occasionally showing confluence; single-cell melanocytic proliferation at the dermal-epidermal junction, but not in continuous rows; and a few intraepidermal melanocytes high in the epidermis in the center of the lesion. These findings were in line with those described in previous literature for genital nevi superimposed on lichen sclerosus in female patients, with proliferative activity in melanocytes, demonstrating a "pseudomelanoma"-type confluence at the dermal-epidermal junction.

In addition to lichen sclerosus, nevi arising on damaged skin in the setting of epidermis.

We report the case of a 66-year-old white man with a 6-month history of a blue-gray plaque of the glans. The patient was heterosexual, with two sexual partners in the last six months, and denied condom use. There was no personal or family history of melanoma.

Physical examination of the uncircumcised penis revealed a round, well-demarcated, smooth, blue-gray plaque measuring 8 × 10 mm, arising within an erythematous background plaque of the glans (Fig 1). The remaining physical examination, including the oral cavity, was unremarkable.

We report the case of a 17-year-old boy who presented with penile ulceration and a urethral fistula that had failed to heal after plastic reconstructions with skin grafts. The patient had a history of pathergy because the initial lesion was an ulcer that deteriorated and led to the development of the fistula after surgical interventions for its repair. Based on the patient's history and normal laboratory evaluation findings, the diagnosis of penile pyoderma gangrenosum was made, and the patient began corticosteroids and cyclosporine. Four months after treatment initiation, the penile area was free of inflammation and ulceration.

### Spectrum and the management of glanular-preputial adhesions after ritual male circumcision [^112C82Ut]. BMC Urology (2024). Low credibility.

After reviewing a considerable number of glanular-preputial adherences, these cases were classified into several types:

- **Partial fibrinous adhesion**: These were identified and referenced [28] (Fig. 1 A).

- **Circumferential fibrinous adhesion**: Seen in particular instances [27] (Fig. 1 C).

- **Well-formed skin bridges**: These could be single [25] (Fig. 2 A) or multiple [7] (Fig. 2 B), affecting the lateral, dorsal, or ventral surfaces [19, 8, and 5], with or without a ventral bending [3] (Fig. 2 C).

- **Adhesions with penile scleroatrophic lichen balanitis**: These were encountered in certain cases [3] (Fig. 3).

- **Completely covered glans penis**: Some cases presented with or without a cicatricial phimosis and concealed penis, affecting eight cases [8] (Fig. 4 A-D).

These classifications and observations provide insight into the spectrum of glanular-preputial adhesions following ritual male circumcision.
