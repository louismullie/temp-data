## Question

Elevated crp with encephalopathy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) in the context of encephalopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what CRP actually measures and its limitations. Then, I should categorize the major encephalopathy etiologies that commonly present with elevated CRP. Next, I will examine how CRP behaves in each category and whether trends outperform single values. After that, I should integrate CRP with other biomarkers and clinical data to refine the differential. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic diagnostic and management approach, including when to escalate to immunomodulatory therapy and how to monitor response.

> Let me first confirm what CRP tells us. CRP is a hepatically synthesized acute-phase reactant driven largely by IL-6; it rises within 6–12 hours of inflammatory stimuli and is highly sensitive but nonspecific, so it cannot localize the source of inflammation or distinguish infectious from noninfectious drivers by itself, and serial measurements are more informative than isolated values, especially in critical illness contexts [^e1eae544] [^a70b6d5] [^b2a29fcf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should categorize the encephalopathy etiologies that most often accompany elevated CRP: systemic inflammatory states with secondary brain dysfunction (sepsis-associated encephalopathy, cytokine storm syndromes, critical illness delirium), infection-triggered neuroinflammatory syndromes (COVID-19 encephalopathy, acute necrotizing encephalopathy, autoimmune encephalitis), hepatic encephalopathy with concurrent infection, and status epilepticus with secondary inflammation. I need to ensure I keep metabolic, toxic, and structural causes in mind as differentials that may not raise CRP [^207bb0d4] [^a2ba1ce2] [^0e415be1] [^2d8c83a4] [^12b4510f] [^d7761dcc].

> Next, I should review how CRP behaves in systemic inflammatory encephalopathies. In sepsis-associated encephalopathy, CRP is typically markedly elevated and correlates with the intensity of systemic inflammation; higher CRP and procalcitonin at ICU admission associate with more days of delirium/coma, supporting inflammation as a driver of brain dysfunction, though CRP alone is not diagnostic of sepsis-associated encephalopathy and must be interpreted in clinical context [^a2eebe1b] [^76c195bd] [^661d33d7]. In COVID-19, CRP frequently exceeds 100 mg/L in severe disease and tracks with cytokine storm and multiorgan failure; guidelines endorse IL-6 blockade when CRP is ≥ 75 mg/L in progressive severe/critical illness, underscoring CRP's role as a severity and treatment-response biomarker rather than a disease-specific diagnostic test [^fb33f8f9] [^5335878b] [^d5b84285].

> I will now examine infection-triggered neuroinflammatory encephalopathies. In COVID-19 encephalopathy, CRP is commonly elevated and often peaks alongside systemic inflammatory markers; however, encephalopathy can occur with relatively modest CRP, and CSF may show neuroinflammatory signatures even when CRP is not extreme, so I should not dismiss neuroinflammation solely based on a "normal" CRP [^a2ba1ce2] [^36700ab0]. In acute necrotizing encephalopathy, CRP is almost universally elevated and frequently > 100 mg/L, reflecting a cytokine storm phenotype; immunotherapy (steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange, or tocilizumab) is commonly used and mortality is high without it, so a very high CRP in the right clinical-radiologic context should prompt early immunomodulation rather than waiting for infectious workup completion [^0e415be1] [^3a52a74b]. But wait, what if this is autoimmune encephalitis? CRP is often normal or only mildly elevated in autoimmune encephalitis, so a high CRP pushes me away from isolated autoimmune etiologies and toward infectious or systemic inflammatory drivers, though overlap exists and antibody testing remains essential when suspected [^2d8c83a4] [^e5aa8341].

> Let me consider hepatic encephalopathy. Baseline CRP is often elevated in cirrhosis due to chronic inflammation, and superimposed infection may not raise CRP as much as in non-cirrhotic patients; thus, a "high-normal" CRP in decompensated cirrhosis can still signal infection, and guidelines emphasize actively searching for precipitating infections and non-hepatic causes of altered mentation rather than attributing everything to HE when CRP is modestly elevated [^81fa054e] [^ef20c0fe] [^12b4510f] [^0abc842a]. I should double-check for aspiration risk, SBP, UTI, and pneumonia, especially when encephalopathy worsens with even a small CRP rise, because the threshold for infection is lower in this population [^notfound].

> Now, status epilepticus. Initially, I thought CRP might reliably flag infection in SE, but wait, let me verify. Single CRP values are unreliable in SE because seizures themselves provoke a systemic inflammatory response; however, linear increases in CRP over the first 1–3 days correlate with infectious complications, and low CRP levels have a high negative predictive value for hospital-acquired infection, so I should trend CRP rather than interpret a single value [^d7761dcc] [^bb0c0815] [^016229c9]. I need to ensure I do not anchor on CRP alone and miss nonconvulsive status or medication effects contributing to encephalopathy [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to integrate CRP with other biomarkers and clinical data. Pairing CRP with IL-6, ferritin, and D-dimer helps identify cytokine storm and hypercoagulability; in COVID-19, this constellation supports immunomodulatory therapy when CRP is ≥ 75 mg/L, while in suspected bacterial CNS infection, combining CRP with CSF parameters and, when available, CSF IL-12(p40) markedly improves diagnostic accuracy for bacterial versus viral etiologies [^5335878b] [^d5b84285] [^ed9f4481]. I should confirm that neuroimaging and EEG are used when focal deficits, seizures, or unexplained encephalopathy persist, because CRP cannot distinguish encephalitis, stroke, PRES, or structural lesions, and delays in imaging can be consequential [^661d33d7] [^a2ba1ce2].

> I will now translate this into a practical diagnostic approach. First, I need to check vitals, gas exchange, and perfusion to identify systemic instability and sepsis. Then, I should obtain serial CRP with CBC, metabolic panel, liver function, coagulation profile, lactate, and, when indicated, procalcitonin, IL-6, ferritin, and D-dimer to characterize the inflammatory milieu. Next, I should review medications and toxins, and perform targeted neuroimaging and EEG based on clinical suspicion. Finally, I must consider lumbar puncture when infection or autoimmune encephalitis remains plausible, recognizing that CSF may be normal early in some entities and that CRP in serum complements, but does not replace, CSF analysis [^661d33d7] [^a2ba1ce2] [^02bcfcf9].

> For management, I need to ensure I treat the underlying cause first. If sepsis-associated encephalopathy is suspected, source control, antibiotics, and organ support are priorities. If COVID-19 encephalopathy with CRP ≥ 75 mg/L and progressive severe disease is present, I should add tocilizumab to steroids per IDSA guidance, balancing infection risk and patient preferences. If acute necrotizing encephalopathy is suspected, I should not delay immunotherapy (steroids, IVIG, plasma exchange, or tocilizumab) while awaiting exhaustive infectious testing, given the high mortality without early immunomodulation. If hepatic encephalopathy is suspected, I should treat precipitating factors and infections aggressively rather than assuming HE alone explains the encephalopathy. And if status epilepticus is present, I should treat seizures and trend CRP to detect infection rather than using a single CRP to diagnose infection [^5335878b] [^d5b84285] [^0e415be1] [^12b4510f] [^d7761dcc].

> I should double-check monitoring and prognostication. Serial CRP can track treatment response in cytokine-driven encephalopathies, with expected falls after effective immunomodulation in COVID-19 and related syndromes. In contrast, persistently elevated CRP despite therapy should prompt reassessment for ongoing infection, inadequate source control, or alternative diagnoses. In encephalitis cohorts, higher admission CRP has been associated with worse outcomes, reinforcing its prognostic value even if it is not etiologic [^5c279e95] [^6d72efef].

> In summary, I need to ensure I do not overinterpret a single CRP value in encephalopathy. CRP is a systemic inflammation barometer that helps me gauge severity, monitor response, and identify candidates for immunomodulation, but it cannot diagnose the cause of encephalopathy by itself. By integrating CRP trends with clinical phenotype, neuroimaging, CSF, and complementary biomarkers, I can narrow the differential and act decisively to treat the underlying process and improve outcomes [^a70b6d5] [^b2a29fcf] [^a2ba1ce2].

Elevated CRP with encephalopathy signals **systemic inflammation** from infection, autoimmune disease, or cytokine storm [^207bb0d4] [^a2ba1ce2]. CRP is a nonspecific marker; **trends matter more than single values** [^a70b6d5] [^d7761dcc]. In COVID-19, CRP > 100 mg/L correlates with severe disease and encephalopathy risk [^fb33f8f9] [^a2ba1ce2]. Evaluate with infection workup, neuroimaging, and CSF analysis [^661d33d7]; treat the cause and monitor CRP to guide response [^d5b84285].

## Pathophysiological mechanisms linking elevated CRP and encephalopathy

Several **pathways** plausibly link elevated CRP to encephalopathy:

- **Systemic inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction**: Cytokine-driven BBB breakdown allows inflammatory mediators into the CNS, causing neuroinflammation and encephalopathy [^207bb0d4] [^36700ab0].

- **Cytokine storm syndrome**: Elevated CRP reflects IL-6–driven inflammation; IL-6 can cross the BBB and disrupt neural function [^e1eae544] [^36700ab0].

- **Direct neurotoxic effects of inflammatory mediators**: TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 can impair neurotransmission and cause neuronal injury [^notfound].

- **Microvascular dysfunction and coagulopathy**: Inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi contribute to ischemic encephalopathy [^2f5caea8].

---

## Clinical conditions associated with elevated CRP and encephalopathy

| **Clinical condition** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis-associated encephalopathy | Systemic inflammation, BBB dysfunction, cytokine storm | - Altered mental status <br/> - Delirium <br/> - Coma [^661d33d7] |
| COVID-19-associated encephalopathy | Cytokine storm, microvascular dysfunction, direct viral effects | - Altered mental status <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Stroke [^a2ba1ce2] [^332fa956] |
| Autoimmune encephalitis | Immune-mediated inflammation, BBB dysfunction | - Cognitive impairment <br/> - Seizures <br/> - Psychiatric symptoms [^2d8c83a4] |
| Hepatic encephalopathy | Systemic inflammation, ammonia neurotoxicity | - Altered mental status <br/> - Asterixis <br/> - Constructional apraxia [^notfound] |
| Status epilepticus | Systemic inflammatory response, BBB dysfunction | - Prolonged seizures <br/> - Altered mental status [^d7761dcc] |

## Diagnostic evaluation

When evaluating a patient with encephalopathy and elevated CRP, a **systematic approach** is essential:

- **Confirm encephalopathy**: Use clinical assessment, EEG, and neuroimaging (MRI preferred) to characterize brain dysfunction [^661d33d7].

- **Identify the underlying cause**: Perform infection workup (blood cultures, urinalysis, chest imaging), autoimmune screening (ANA, ANCA, anti-neuronal antibodies), and metabolic assessment (liver function, renal function, ammonia) [^02bcfcf9].

- **Assess inflammation severity**: Serial CRP measurements help track response; very high CRP (> 100 mg/L) suggests cytokine storm and may guide immunomodulatory therapy [^fb33f8f9] [^d5b84285].

- **Evaluate for COVID-19**: Test for SARS-CoV-2, as COVID-19 is a common cause of elevated CRP and encephalopathy [^a2ba1ce2].

---

## Prognostic implications

Elevated CRP correlates with **worse outcomes** in encephalopathy:

- **Mortality**: Higher CRP is associated with increased mortality in sepsis-associated encephalopathy and COVID-19 encephalopathy [^edeeb103].

- **Neurological sequelae**: Persistent elevation predicts cognitive impairment and functional disability [^notfound].

- **Duration of encephalopathy**: Higher CRP is linked to longer delirium/coma duration in critically ill patients [^a2eebe1b].

---

## Management strategies

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** and controlling inflammation:

- **Treat the underlying condition**: Antibiotics for infection, immunotherapy for autoimmune encephalitis, and supportive care for hepatic encephalopathy [^661d33d7] [^02bcfcf9] [^12b4510f].

- **Anti-inflammatory therapy**: Corticosteroids and IL-6 blockade (tocilizumab) are effective in cytokine storm–related encephalopathies, including COVID-19 [^5335878b] [^d5b84285].

- **Supportive care**: Manage seizures, maintain hemodynamic stability, and provide nutritional support [^notfound].

- **Monitor CRP trends**: Serial measurements guide treatment response and detect complications [^a70b6d5].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

CRP is **nonspecific** and can be elevated in many non-infectious conditions (e.g. surgery, trauma, malignancy), and liver dysfunction blunts CRP responses, potentially masking inflammation. Interpretation should be **context-specific**, integrating clinical, laboratory, and imaging data [^e5cda824] [^ef20c0fe].

---

Elevated CRP with encephalopathy reflects **systemic inflammation** driving brain dysfunction. CRP is a useful severity and response marker, but diagnosis and management require a comprehensive, cause-directed approach with serial monitoring and targeted anti-inflammatory therapy when indicated [^a70b6d5] [^d5b84285].

### Low plasma C-reactive protein level as an early diagnostic tool for heatstroke vs central nervous system-associated infection in the ED [^2279f1bf]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purposes

Heatstroke (HS) is a life-threatening condition, manifested by systemic inflammation and multiorgan failure. Rapid recognition and treatment are life saving. We report a laboratory-oriented characterization of HS by low plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) level and propose its usefulness in distinguishing this type of hyperpyrexia from central nervous system-associated high core temperature.

Methods

After institutional review board approval, records of patients admitted to general intensive care unit between August 2008 and September 2011 with core temperature 39.0°C or higher due to HS or meningoencephalitis (ME) were reviewed. Patients' demographics, CRP on admission and 24 to 48 hours later, serum creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, platelets count, international normalized ratio, alanine transaminase, serum pH, and lactate levels were retrieved.

Results

Thirty-six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit with high core temperature: 19 patients, aged 21 to 85 years, had HS; 17 individuals, aged 22 to 81 years, had ME. None of the HS individuals had infection. Twelve HS patients were previously healthy; in 13 patients, the event occurred postexercise. Mean admission CRP levels was 2.1 ± 3.3 mg/L in the HS group compared with 129 ± 84 mg/L in the ME patients (P < .0001); mean 24- to 48-hour CRP levels were 14.6 ± 16.8 vs 139 ± 98 mg/L, respectively (P < .0001). There were no clinically significant differences between the groups regarding laboratory parameters indicative of end-organ damage. Six HS patients underwent computed tomography and/or lumbar puncture before starting intensive cooling, due to misdiagnosis; 5 of them died subsequently.

Conclusions

Low serum CRP levels characterize non-central nervous system-associated HS. This available laboratory test could identify noninfectious hyperthermic patients upon admission, saving precious time until treatment and avoiding unnecessary diagnostic tests.

### COVID-19: review of a 21st century pandemic from etiology to neuro-psychiatric implications [^d0297204]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

The authors suggest that if the patients have loss of consciousness or an altered mental status, then 1) acute hypercapnia, 2) sepsis, and/or 3) seizures, should be suspected and ruled out. Electroencephalography could serve as a tool in assessing the brain function in COVID-19 patients.

It is also important to monitor CRP and IL-6 trends for cytokine storm, and close monitoring of infection symptoms to prevent potential sepsis and subsequent organ failure. Acute hypercoagulable state should be predicted and managed to avoid coagulopathy, stroke, thrombotic events, including limb thrombosis, which could cause compartment syndrome, as well as pulmonary/organ embolism.

Proper pain management in COVID-19 patients is essential. Providers need to be aware of when, and how much pain medications/sedatives to give the patient, since this could have an impact on their physiology and cognition which could potentially mask or cause metabolic encephalopathy.

A comprehensive approach to the management of COVID-19 individuals should involve various treatment modalities. These include a dietary assessment and treatment to effectively reduce complications and improve both short and long-term prognosis essential to ensuring survival, especially in the recovery phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent edema, refeeding syndromes, or micronutrient deficiencies, long-term stay patients in the ICU settings should be routinely monitored for nutritional deficiencies. A review of the literature indicates that common causes of death include cardiovascular, pulmonary, and other organ complications. Therefore, in those COVID-19 patients with underlying comorbidities (e.g. cardiovascular, pulmonary, ADRD, and immunocompromised), it becomes imperative to identify the patients with a high mortality risk. This should be done in order to focus on precise protective measures and management strategies to mitigate negative outcomes in those at risk or those already infected with the virus.

### High attributable risk of elevated C-reactive protein level to conventional coronary heart disease risk factors (...) [^1581dc87]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

The attributable risk of elevated CRP level due to one or more CHD risk factors was computed using the following formula: NE/ND, where PD/E is the weighted percentage of high CRP levels with abnormal or borderline CHD risk factors, PD/Ē is the weighted percentage of high CRP levels without CHD risk factors, NE is the number of estimated individuals with abnormal or borderline CHD risk factors in the population, and ND is the estimated total number of cases in the population. A total of 15 341 adult men and women were included in the analysis. Table 1 provides baseline and demographic information of the NHANES III cohort. A graded increase in the prevalence of high CRP levels was also apparent as blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and BMI cut points increased from normal to borderline and abnormal levels, with larger increases occurring between borderline and abnormal ranges.

Similar changes were also observed in univariate analysis comparing sedentary and physically active subjects. The present study reinforces the central role that traditional CHD risk factors play in atherothrombosis by demonstrating that a pivotal biomarker of systemic inflammation, elevated CRP level, is generally accompanied by borderline or abnormal CHD risk factors and rarely occurs in their absence. Thus, while these data in no way negate the important influence that inflammation plays in promoting or accelerating CHD, 23 they underscore the likely role that well-established risk factors contribute to the inflammatory process. These close-knit relationships make it difficult to disentangle the distinctive impact of CRP level beyond well-established risk factors. Moreover, the treatments commonly used to reduce conventional CHD risk factors also lower CRP levels.

28-31 Therefore, given the tight interrelationship between systemic inflammation and CHD risk factors, and in view of the extremely low prevalence of high CRP level in the absence of the 8 risk factors in NHANES III, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove the “CRP hypothesis”. Because the presence of multiple risk factors increases the likelihood of CHD, 36 focusing on individual parameters may underestimate overall CHD risk, especially in the United States, where the prevalence of multiple risk factors is high. 37 In the present study, elevated CRP level was very prevalent in the presence of at least 1 borderline or abnormal risk factor.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^d7761dcc]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

• Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, possibly due to a systemic inflammatory reaction caused by SE itself.

• Linear changes of CRP levels and WBC counts significantly correlate with the presence of infectious complications during SE.

• Low levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients.

### Effect of therapeutic hypothermia on C-reactive protein levels in patients with perinatal asphyxia [^f79d3110]. American Journal of Perinatology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the changes in serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels during therapeutic hypothermia.

Study Design

Between January 2011 and June 2013, 133 hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy patients being followed up in the neonatal intensive care unit of Dr. Sami Ulus Maternity and Children's Hospital are prospectively evaluated. Group 1; patients that received therapeutic hypothermia (n=74) and group 2; patients that did not required therapeutic hypothermia (n=59). All the patients underwent serial complete blood cell count and CRP assessments; blood cultures were obtained from all the cases at the time of admission and when CRP levels were elevated.

Results

Positive blood cultures were encountered in five cases (6.7%) in group 1 while no blood culture-proven septicemia was encountered in group 2. The CRP levels elevated gradually reaching a peak level on the 4th day and then decreased during the therapeutic hypothermia in patients with no blood culture-proven septicemia in group 1. The CRP levels showed statistically significant changes reaching a peak level on the 7th day in patients with blood culture-proven septicemia in group 2. Also, the CRP levels showed no alteration with time in group 2.

Conclusion

Therapeutic hypothermia itself might be associated with CRP elevation rather than an actual infection.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^fb33f8f9]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In COVID-19 infections, CRP levels that are minimally elevated (e.g. between 10 and 20 μg/mL) can be diagnostic of mild viral disease. Therapeutic considerations might focus on ways to control viral infectivity and replication using viral neutralization concepts (antibodies/vaccines and receptor blockers), or inhibiting viral-specific enzymes (e.g. remdesivir). COVID-19 patients with moderate elevations of CRP levels (e.g. > 20–40 μg/mL) may harbor some level of (reversible) tissue damage associated with the natural response to combating the viral disease. If these levels are measured relatively early in disease progression, before a cytokine storm response, these levels may suggest a confounding bacterial infection or more significant tissue involvement in disease. Therapeutic considerations may include, in addition to viral neutralization, the use of antimicrobials and immunomodulation using interferon therapies or biologic agents that can neutralize pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1, and IL-6 inhibitors). COVID-19 patients with significantly elevated CRP levels (e.g. > 100 μg/mL) more readily reflect advanced tissue damage and pathologies associated with cytokine storm, coagulation abnormalities, and multiple organ failure. Such high CRP levels would correlate with a life-threatening prognosis.

### Effect of hypothermia and severity of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the levels of C-reactive protein during the first 120 hours of life [^f924d8fe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to describe normal C-reactive protein (CRP) levels of newborns diagnosed with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and assess the influence of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) and the severity of HIE.

Study Design

We prospectively recruited infants ≥35 weeks of gestational age diagnosed with HIE from 2000 to 2013 and compared CRP levels in the first 120 hours of life according to the severity of HIE and the use of TH, which was introduced in 2009.

Results

Moderate HIE was diagnosed in 115 newborns, severe HIE in 90 (hypothermia was performed in 151 cases), and mild HIE in 20. Cooled newborns showed lower levels of CRP in the first 34 hours, but reached higher median maximum CRP levels (15.4 vs. 8.5 mg/L), and at a significantly older age (53 vs. 17 hours). Levels of CRP in mild HIE were lower than those of moderate-severe forms. Moderate and severe HIE had similar CRP levels, but time to maximum CRP was significantly less in moderate cases.

Conclusion

CRP levels of mild HIE are similar to healthy newborns, while CRP elevations can be expected in newborns with moderate-severe HIE. TH produced a slower rise, with a higher and late maximum CRP peak level.

### Neurological associations of COVID-19 [^a2ba1ce2]. The Lancet: Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is of a scale not seen since the 1918 influenza pandemic. Although the predominant clinical presentation is with respiratory disease, neurological manifestations are being recognised increasingly. On the basis of knowledge of other coronaviruses, especially those that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome epidemics, cases of CNS and peripheral nervous system disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 might be expected to be rare.

Recent Developments

A growing number of case reports and series describe a wide array of neurological manifestations in 901 patients, but many have insufficient detail, reflecting the challenge of studying such patients. Encephalopathy has been reported for 93 patients in total, including 16 (7%) of 214 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and 40 (69%) of 58 patients in intensive care with COVID-19 in France. Encephalitis has been described in eight patients to date, and Guillain-Barré syndrome in 19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the CSF of some patients. Anosmia and ageusia are common, and can occur in the absence of other clinical features. Unexpectedly, acute cerebrovascular disease is also emerging as an important complication, with cohort studies reporting stroke in 2-6% of patients hospitalised with COVID-19. So far, 96 patients with stroke have been described, who frequently had vascular events in the context of a pro-inflammatory hypercoagulable state with elevated C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and ferritin. WHERE NEXT?: Careful clinical, diagnostic, and epidemiological studies are needed to help define the manifestations and burden of neurological disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Precise case definitions must be used to distinguish non-specific complications of severe disease (eg, hypoxic encephalopathy and critical care neuropathy) from those caused directly or indirectly by the virus, including infectious, para-infectious, and post-infectious encephalitis, hypercoagulable states leading to stroke, and acute neuropathies such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. Recognition of neurological disease associated with SARS-CoV-2 in patients whose respiratory infection is mild or asymptomatic might prove challenging, especially if the primary COVID-19 illness occurred weeks earlier. The proportion of infections leading to neurological disease will probably remain small. However, these patients might be left with severe neurological sequelae. With so many people infected, the overall number of neurological patients, and their associated health burden and social and economic costs might be large. Health-care planners and policy makers must prepare for this eventuality, while the many ongoing studies investigating neurological associations increase our knowledge base.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^a70b6c0d]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds for inflammation—interpretation and use are as follows: CRP levels of 3.0–9.9 mg/L are consistent with mild inflammation, levels of 10–50 mg/L are consistent with moderate inflammation, and levels of >50 mg/L are consistent with severe inflammation; these thresholds are provided to help support identification of individuals with inflammatory diseases and conditions, not to assess risk for development of disease. Serial CRP measures can be helpful when the status or contribution of inflammation is unclear in the setting of a chronic condition, and measurement of CRP trends can be helpful, because a single normal CRP value does not exclude the possible contribution of an inflammatory component; whenever possible, the opportunity to make use of CRP test results that have been ordered for other medical purposes is encouraged.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^e1eae544]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### C-reactive protein and bacterial infection in cirrhosis [^81fa054e]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In the general population, C-reactive protein (CRP) level increases in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation and infections. In patients with cirrhosis, the basal level is higher than in patients without cirrhosis, due to chronic hepatic and other inflammation, but when infection occurs the more severe the underlying liver dysfunction, the lower the increase in CRP. Therefore, the predictive power of CRP for infection and prognosis is weak in patients with decompensated/advanced cirrhosis and in the intensive care setting. However, higher CRP and also persistently elevated CRP levels can help identify patients with a higher short-term risk of mortality.

### Hemorrhagic encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 [^57f02014]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms for neurological complications of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), are not yet well understood. We present a critically ill man with a COVID-19-associated hemorrhagic encephalopathy. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood. CSF analyses suggested dysregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine pathways, particularly tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6, consistent with a cytokine release syndrome. The patient gradually recovered with supportive care and neurological rehabilitation. Awareness of this clinical entity may facilitate the identification of patients with a potentially remediable cause of encephalopathy in COVID-19.

### What every intensivist should know about tocilizumab [^3916f1ca]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Additionally, we want to highlight two aspects that are of importance when administering Tocilizumab:
4 Increased infection risk Blockade of the IL-6R increases the risk of serious infections and should not be used in sepsis. Bacterial, viral and opportunistic infections have been reported.
5 Development/aggravation of encephalopathy Due to its pharmacodynamics, Tocilizumab is unable to cross the blood–brain-barrier but increases the circulating amount of IL-6 (a small molecule that can easily do so) up to 3800%. This phenomenon of induced encephalopathy is known from CAR-T-associated CRS and should be considered when giving Tocilizumab to awake patients (particularly in the context of delirium). Whereas it has been used in the CAR-T context according to the standard algorithm usually before steroids, in COVID-19, Tocilizumab’s effect might be different after prior steroid use.

Mechanistically, it has been proposed that the increase in IL-6 is the result of IL-6R blockade, inhibiting internalization of IL-6 after ligation with its receptor. In other words, the blocked IL-6R liberates the release of accumulated IL-6 into the circulation. One can speculate that a given IL-6 increase reflects its local production in the inflamed lung and that this increase might even be useful to predict a clinical Tocilizumab response. In our rather small cohort, no differences between survivors and non-survivors were detectable, but a controlled trial would be desirable.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^bb0c0815]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, while linear changes of CRP levels and WBC counts over time are significantly correlated with the presence of infections during SE. In addition, normal levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients. Further studies will be needed to elucidate whether changes in PCT levels over time would be an even more accurate approach for diagnosis of infections during SE.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^a2eebe1b]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In this pilot study, inflammation, as measured by high procalcitonin and CRP levels at admission, was associated with fewer days alive and free of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients, suggesting that inflammation plays an important role in delirium and coma in the ICU. Future studies are needed to elucidate further the inflammatory mechanisms of delirium and coma during critical illness.

### A clinical approach to diagnosing encephalopathy [^85a254f9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy refers to dysfunction of the level or contents of consciousness due to brain dysfunction and can result from global brain insults or focal lesions. The underlying causes of encephalopathy include both primary neurologic and systemic conditions. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of encephalopathy, with a focus on primary neurologic causes. A practical schema for organizing the differential diagnosis is to group etiologies by their pace of onset and evolution (eg, sudden, acute, subacute, chronic).

### Long-term outcome of acute encephalitis of unknown aetiology in adults [^6d72efef]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Encephalitis is caused by a variety of conditions, including infections of the brain by a wide range of pathogens. A substantial number of cases of encephalitis defy all attempts at identifying a specific cause. Little is known about the long-term prognosis in patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology, which complicates their management during the acute illness. To learn more about the prognosis of patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology, patients in whom no aetiology could be identified were examined in a large, single-centre encephalitis cohort. In addition to analysing the clinical data of the acute illness, surviving patients were assessed by telephone interview a minimum of 2 years after the acute illness by applying a standardized test battery. Of the patients with encephalitis who qualified for inclusion (n = 203), 39 patients (19.2%) had encephalitis of unknown aetiology. The case fatality in these patients was 12.8%. Among the survivors, 53% suffered from various neurological sequelae, most often attention and sensory deficits. Among the features at presentation that were associated with adverse outcome were older age, increased C-reactive protein, coma and a high percentage of polymorphonuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. In conclusion, the outcome in an unselected cohort of patients with encephalitis of unknown aetiology was marked by substantial case fatality and by long-term neurological deficits in approximately one-half of the surviving patients. Certain features on admission predicted an unfavourable outcome.

Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (AD/ADRD)—laboratory panels and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) use are described as follows: Brain MRI without contrast, when available and not contraindicated, is appropriate for evaluation of AD/ADRD, and strong evidence supports the utility of brain MRI against gold-standard neuropathologic examinations. Other panel tests are informative about potential comorbidities such as dehydration (e.g., suggested with a blood urea nitrogen: creatinine ratio ≥ 20:1), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are included as broad, non-specific, and inexpensive screens for insidious systemic processes. In contemporary practice, structural brain images may reveal atrophy patterns supportive of a particular neurodegenerative disease diagnosis.

ASTCT consensus—laboratory parameters are not included in the definition or grading of CRS; although C-reactive protein (CRP) is widely available, it is not specific for CRS and changes in CRP can lag behind clinical changes by at least 12 hours, so grading favors clinical observation while continued measurement of cytokines, CRP, ferritin, and other parameters is encouraged for future study.

### Diagnostic yield of anti-neuronal antibody testing in patients suspected of an infectious encephalitis [^e5aa8341]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

In our study of patients who presented in an acute setting with a suspected encephalitis, expanded antibody testing did not yield additional anti‐neuronal antibodies in patients for whom no clear infectious or alternative diagnosis could be made during the disease episode. Our findings indicate that current clinical practice in participating centers effectively evaluates AIE episodes within the acute presentation of suspected CNS infection or inflammatory disease. In the acute setting, clinical diagnostic criteria for possible AIE can assist in determining whether to proceed to anti‐neuronal antibody testing.

Our data show that antibody‐positive AIE was identified correctly in all cases using the possible AIE criteria. Although this might seem to imply that antibody testing is only recommended when a patient meets the possible AIE criteria, there is a major caveat. The sensitivity of the possible AIE criteria is largely dependent on the cohort of investigation. In patients in a hospital setting with an acute presentation, as in the I‐PACE study, we show it is high, but in situations beyond the acute setting, such as cognitive, psychiatric, or epileptic cohorts, it was shown to be only moderate. On the other hand, no autoantibodies were detected in nearly a third of the patients who met the criteria for possible AIE. A prior study reported a specificity for possible AIE of only 25%–30% and concluded that these criteria are insufficient for making a diagnosis but are useful as entry criteria for antibody testing. The complex presentations of AIE may pose challenges for accurate diagnosis, leading to inappropriate use of diagnostic criteria for AIE. Our study also emphasizes the challenges of diagnosing seronegative AIE and the importance of carefully applying its criteria.

In line with the existing literature, patients with an antibody‐positive (definite) AIE in this study did not have fever and had lower levels of serum inflammatory markers (CRP, leukocytes) compared to the complete cohort suspected of a CNS infectious or inflammatory disease. Similarly, compared to episodes lacking a diagnosis but meeting the possible AIE criteria, the same pattern was revealed. This may suggest a higher likelihood of having infectious encephalitis with an unknown cause rather than AIE of unknown cause. Atypical of AIE in the antibody‐positive patients were the high percentage of episodes with pleocytosis and poor outcomes. In general, the clinical characteristics—the low frequency of seizures and aphasia, and the abovementioned serological findings—of the included cohort, including those of the definite AIE diagnoses, suggest a selection bias toward infectious pathology instead of autoimmune causes.

### Risk factors and prognosis of pulmonary infection in hepatitis B-related acute-on-chronic liver failure: a retrospective cohort study [^0efb5576]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Infections are commonly associated with a high short-term mortality rate in patients with ACLF, highlighting the importance of identifying risk factors for the occurrence of infections for early diagnosis and treatment. This study found that the incidence of pulmonary infection was correlated with TBIL, CRP, invasive procedures, concurrent ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy, in line with previous research. Invasive procedures disrupt the normal tissue barriers and structures, diminishing the body’s defense against environmental pathogens and increasing the risk of infection in patients. Ascites provides a conducive environment for bacterial growth and spread, and due to the compression of lung volume by ascites, which impairs lung expansion, the body’s ability to clear pathogenic microorganisms is weakened, thereby reducing the capacity to fight against infections. TBIL is a reliable indicator of changes in the liver’s detoxification and excretory functions, and a decline in these functions is a significant cause of infection. Studies have identified TBIL as an independent risk factor for bacterial infection in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. This study suggests that an increase in CRP may indicate the possibility of infection in HBV-ACLF patients. CRP is an important non-specific acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver and released into the bloodstream. The reactive oxygen species produced by its metabolism can induce intracellular oxidative stress, thereby activating NF-κB; it also binds to complement C1q and activates the complement system through the classical pathway, stimulating the release of inflammatory mediators and exacerbating the inflammatory response. Consequently, CRP measurement is frequently used to monitor the therapeutic efficacy in chronic inflammatory diseases and serves as a sensitive indicator for clinical assessment of inflammation. Hepatic encephalopathy is a syndrome characterized by functional derangement of the central nervous system due to metabolic disorders, occurring as a complication of severe liver disease. The results of this study indicate that HBV-ACLF patients with concurrent hepatic encephalopathy are more susceptible to bacterial infections than those without hepatic encephalopathy. Zang et al. found that hepatic encephalopathy is a risk factor for inducing infections in ACLF patients, with those suffering from hepatic encephalopathy having a 2.083-fold increased risk of infection. For patients with hepatic encephalopathy, consciousness disorders can lead to aspiration and reflux, which are risk factors for pulmonary infection. In addition, In previous studies, hormones were the main cause of hospital-acquired infections. However, in our study, no statistically significant difference was seen in hormone use between the infected and uninfected groups. This may be related to the different courses of hormone use in different patients and the shorter duration of hormone therapy in some patients. In addition, due to the current controversy over the indications for hormone use in slow plus acute liver failure, there are no standardized criteria for hormone dosage, route of administration, and discontinuation. Therefore, further studies are needed to address the effect of hormones between the occurrence of pulmonary infections in ACLF.

### Procalcitonin and mortality in status epilepticus: an observational cohort study [^84a2de52]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute-phase proteins, such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin, may relate with course and outcome in status epilepticus (SE), as seizures bring about inflammation, changes of cytokine levels and blood-brain barrier breakdown. We aimed to determine the predictive value of serum levels of PCT at SE onset for the emergence of infections and unfavorable outcome in adult patients with SE. Furthermore, we sought to compare the predictive value of PCT, CRP and albumin for death.

Methods

This observational cohort study was performed in the intensive care units of the University Hospital Basel (Switzerland), a university-affiliated tertiary care center. Adult patients with SE admitted from 2005 to 2012 were included. Serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin were assessed at SE onset. Unfavorable outcome (i.e., death and a Glasgow Outcome Score of 1 to 3) during hospital stay and mortality after 30 days were considered the primary and infections as the secondary outcome measures.

Results

In 91 SE patients, mortality was 23.1 % during hospital stay and at 30-days follow-up. Infections emerged in 30.8 % of patients. In the multivariable analysis, PCT predicted unfavorable outcome independently from possible confounders such as acute etiology, infections during SE, the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and the Status Epilepticus Severity Score (hazard ratio 1.44 per every increasing ug/L, 95 % confidence interval 1.11-1.87). Additional multivariable analysis including serum levels of PCT, CRP and albumin revealed PCT as the only biomarker independently associated with an increased hazard for unfavorable outcome. PCT levels at SE onset were not related to infections during SE.

Conclusions

Serum PCT levels measured at SE onset are independently associated with unfavorable outcome but do not predict the emergence of infections during SE. Procalcitonin may increase the predictive value of clinical scoring systems allowing for rapid risk stratification early in the course of SE.

### Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome – the markers for an early HSES diagnosis [^c0a21375]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Sepsis from bacterial infection was excluded by the negative bacterial cultures and the normal CRP levels. However, the hemodynamic course of our patients was very similar to severe septic shock.

The etiology of HSES is still unknown. It has been reported that cytokine storm may be associated with the progress of acute encephalopathy including HSES [-] as septic shock, and levels of some cytokines were useful markers for HSES. The serum levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-2 receptors were increased in our patients, however, the degree of the increase varied in each patient. These results suggest that the increase in cytokines may be associated with HSES. As septic shock is characterized by severe vascular leakage, this is the reason that large amounts of fluids and/or norepinephrine infusions were needed for the patients in this study.

As previously expressed, the respiratory functions of the HSES patients in the present study were maintained throughout their clinical courses. This is the most essential difference between HSES and sepsis in the state of multiple organ failure. Sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported, and the inflammatory response in ALI/ARDS is associated with the release of cytokines. A limitation of the present study was its small population of only 8 children. Therefore, we did not find a definitive reason the cytokine storm with HSES did not have a significant influence on the pulmonary vascular permeability, as would a prodromal marker of ALI/ARDS. It is our supposition that this difference is a key point that would detect the etiology of HSES.

Further studies are warranted to discover what kinds of cytokines would be the most useful markers. The current problem that we face in our center is that it takes considerable time and effort to get the necessary results for these cytokines.

### Infection-associated encephalopathies: their investigation, diagnosis, and treatment [^a7f38034]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Reduced level of consciousness is a common clinical finding in acutely sick patients. In the majority of cases a cause for the encephalopathy is readily identifiable,whilst in a minority the aetiology is more difficult to ascertain. Frequently the onset of encephalopathy is associated with, or follows, infection. The mechanisms through which infection leads to encephalopathy are diverse. They range from direct microbial invasion of the brain or its supporting structures, to remote, infection-triggered mechanisms such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Most common however, is the encephalopathy caused through a remote effect of systemic sepsis-septic encephalopathy. This article discusses the clinical presentation and underlying pathogeneses of the acute encephalopathies associated with infection, aiming to aid both their recognition and treatment.

### Encephalopathy with progression to posterior reversible encephalopathy pattern in a patient with COVID-19: clinical, imaging findings and follow-up [^9a2c46af]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neurological conditions are being more recognised in patients with COVID-19, with encephalopathy being the most prevalent problem. Posterior reversible encephalopathy is suspected to occur due to elevated blood pressure and overproduction of inflammatory markers, both of which have been reported in the setting of COVID-19 infection. Encephalopathy was the main presentation in this case, without respiratory dysfunction initially, and with imaging findings indicative of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome as an aetiology. Follow-up imaging showed resolution of the abnormal results with mental status returning to baseline upon discharge.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^28b42c13]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

There are several strengths and limitations in our study. First, this pilot investigation, which evaluated 87 patients, may lack adequate statistical power to detect some clinically important associations. Furthermore, the limited number of patients prevented us from studying potential differences in various subgroups such as surgical versus medical ICU patients; for example, some data suggest that post-surgical patients have elevated levels of procalcitonin dependent on the nature and extent of surgery. Despite these limitations, we were able to show associations between procalcitonin and CRP with DCFDs, providing a basis for studying the role of inflammation in delirium and coma in the ICU. Second, because we studied only baseline procalcitonin and CRP levels, we were unable to assess whether changes in these inflammatory markers over time are associated with the resolution or persistence of brain dysfunction. Third, because of our small sample size, only a limited number of covariates could be included in our regression models; the inclusion of additional potential confounders would have increased the possibility of obtaining unreliable results due to overfitting. We did, however, adjust for sepsis, which represents a major risk factor. Furthermore, our results are consistent with studies that have shown an association of CRP with delirium in non-ICU cohorts [-], delirium following stroke and sepsis, and delirium in one small study of 32 ICU patients, which did not adjust for confounders. Additionally, we found that among septic patients, higher baseline CRP levels were associated with a greater duration of renal dysfunction, which is in concordance with a previous study by Lobo et al. that showed that increased admission CRP was proportional to days of renal support therapy. Fourth, our chosen outcome of delirium/coma-free days (representing the days alive without delirium or coma) can be influenced by death, which in turn may be dependent on other organ dysfunctions. We assessed the role of both procalcitonin and CRP in non-brain organ dysfunctions and survival and found little evidence that the observed associations between the biomarkers and delirium/coma-free days were driven by a relationship with survival. In fact, there were no associations between the biomarkers and survival in our study. Finally, we assessed patients only once a day for delirium, and patients who were CAM-ICU negative were considered to be "free of brain dysfunction" for the entire day. Given that delirium is a fluctuating state of mental status, it is possible that some patients developed delirium later in the day and were missed in our study.

### Assessment of pretreatment and posttreatment evolution of neurofilament light chain levels in patients who develop immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome [^5d2da1e9]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

After chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, 40% to 60% of patients will develop neurotoxicity termed immune effector cell–associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). While the number of patients treated with cellular therapy (<10 000 annually) represents a small fraction of all patients treated for cancer, the indications for cellular therapy are rapidly growing. Symptom onset is typically 3 to 9 days postinfusion and range from encephalopathy to aphasia to cerebral edema. While most cases of low-grade (grade 1-2) ICANS are self-limited, grade 3 or higher ICANS can cause substantial morbidity and mortality.The early identification of patients at risk for ICANS is critical for preemptive management. Recently, neurofilament light chain (NfL), an axonal structural protein with elevated levels in multiple neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases,has emerged as a potential biomarker in ICANS. Schoeberl and colleaguesreported postinfusion NfL elevations up to 5 days prior to peak ICANS. However, it remains unclear if this is an acute postinfusion elevation or a chronic change predating cellular therapy. Likewise, NfL’s association with established ICANS risk factors (preinfusion baseline tumor burden, CAR T-cell dose, history of preexisting neurologic comorbidities,and postinfusion ferritin level, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet count, fibrinogen level, and C-reactive protein [CRP] level,,,,) is unclear. In this study, we investigate serial plasma NfL levels in patients undergoing cellular therapy, starting from before lymphodepletion to 30 days postinfusion, and examine its association with ICANS and potential risk factors.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^c585795c]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

A further explanation for elevated biomarker levels without evidence of infections during SE might be the presence of comorbidities in this cohort. Patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation and cerebral hypoxia have shown PCT elevation in the absence of infections and also multiple trauma with or without brain injury, as present in our study, were shown to be associated with an increase of PCT concentrations without infectious complications. However, there were no significant differences of comorbidities between patients with and without infections and also no differences between patients with and without RTI, the largest subgroup of infections in this study (Table 4). We did not perform analyzes for the subgroup with autoimmune diseases, as this group had a small size of only 5% of the cohort. Moreover, we cannot exclude that there were some cases where infections were present but could not be detected.

Table 4 
Distribution of comorbidities of patients with and without infections or RTI

RTI = respiratory tract infection; CNS = central nervous system

The authors are well aware of limitations of this study: the retrospective character and the small patient sample. Nevertheless, as CRP and WBC are measured routinely and daily in every patient on the ICU in clinical practice, a selection bias appears very unlikely. Furthermore, the selection of patients in dependence of performed PCT measurements is an obvious selection bias. The lack of a biomarker-specific time course for PCT in this cohort as well as the smaller sample size does not allow a direct head-to-head comparison to the other markers and may also weaken its prognostic strength for infections, which should be analyzed in further prospective studies. Inter-rater agreement calculation was not performed in this study. However, all EEG reports were based on EEG interpretation by two board certified epileptologists and discrepant interpretation was resolved by consensus. In addition, all microbiological data that were obtained during hospitalization were retrospectively, independently cross-checked by a board certified infectious disease specialist using the computerized database of the infection control microbiology surveillance and only if the required definitions by the CDC were fulfilled, was the diagnosis of infection accepted.

### Blood / brain biomarkers of inflammation after stroke and their association with outcome: from C-reactive protein to damage-associated molecular patterns [^b4021821]. Neurotherapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Stroke represents one of the most important causes of disability and death in developed countries. However, there is a lack of prognostic tools in clinical practice to monitor the neurological condition and predict the final outcome. Blood biomarkers have been proposed and studied in this indication; however, no biomarker is currently used in clinical practice. The stroke-related neuroinflammatory processes have been associated with a poor outcome in stroke, as well as with poststroke complications. In this review, we focus on the most studied blood biomarkers of this inflammatory processes, cytokines, and C-reactive protein, evaluating its association with outcome and complications in stroke through the literature, and performing a systematic review on the association of C-reactive protein and functional outcome after stroke. Globally, we identified uncertainty with regard to the association of the evaluated biomarkers with stroke outcome, with little added value on top of clinical predictors such as age or stroke severity, which makes its implementation unlikely in clinical practice for global outcome prediction. Regarding poststroke complications, despite being more practical scenarios in which to make medical decisions following a biomarker prediction, not many studies have been performed, although there are now some candidates for prediction of poststroke infections. Finally, as potential new candidates, we reviewed the pathophysiological actions of damage-associated molecular patterns as triggers of the neuroinflammatory cascade of stroke, and their possible use as biomarkers.

### Elevated C-reactive protein levels are associated with prevalent dementia in the oldest-old [^e70f3412]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2009). Low credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a nonspecific marker of inflammation that is increased in the brain and serum of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and has been associated with increased risk of developing dementia. Inflammation increases with age, and the number of people reaching age 90 years and older is growing, making the association between inflammation and dementia increasingly relevant. Using a cross-sectional design, we examined whether high levels of serum CRP are associated with increased odds of prevalent dementia in the oldest-old.

Methods

Serum CRP levels of 305 participants (mean age +/- standard deviation, 94.3 +/- 2.9 years) from the 90+ Study, a longitudinal cohort study of people aged 90 years and older, were evaluated with respect to all-cause dementia. Levels of CRP were divided into three categories: undetectable (<0.5 mg/dL), detectable (0.5-0.7 mg/dL), and elevated (> or =0.8 mg/dL). Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression, and were adjusted for covariates.

Results

Relative to participants with undetectable CRP levels, participants with detectable or elevated CRP levels had increased odds of all-cause dementia (detectable: OR, 3.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-7.3; elevated: OR, 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-12.9). When participants were subdivided by gender, significantly increased ORs were seen only in women.

Conclusions

In the oldest-old, high CRP levels are associated with increased odds of all-cause dementia, particularly in women. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm whether increased CRP levels are associated with an increased risk of developing dementia in this age group.

### Serum CRP as a prognostic biomarker in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (...) [^b70b6da6]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that patients with ALS and elevated serum CRP levels progress more rapidly than do those with lower CRP levels and that this elevation may reflect a neuroinflammatory state potentially responsive to the immune regulators such as NP001. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model and Kaplan-Meier analysis, the elevated CRP group had a significantly shorter survival compared with the normal CRP group. Moreover, the serum CRP level was significantly correlated with patient survival, showing that patients with ALS and elevated serum CRP levels at first evaluation had a significantly shorter survival compared with those with normal serum CRP levels. Similar results were found in an independent cohort obtained from a population-based registry of patients with ALS.

In particular, according to the hazard ratio evaluated in discovery and validation cohorts, for every 1-point increase in the serum CRP level, we detected an effect of 13% and 4%, respectively, on survival time in the patients with ALS evaluated in our study. , CRP is associated with damaged fibers within senile plaques. 44 In our study, the significant correlation of serum CRP level with neurologic functional impairment and survival in patients with ALS in the early phase of the disease and without an active inflammatory process supports the hypothesis that the increment of CRP in the peripheral blood may be the mirror of the upregulation of the production of CRP in the central nervous system.

Recently, Lu et al45 showed that the cytokine IL-6 was strongly associated with CRP levels and was the only marker showing increasing expression toward end-stage disease in the longitudinal analysis. In a retrospective analysis, patients with Parkinson disease and elevated CRP levels at baseline had a significantly shortened survival compared with those with normal CRP levels. 46 Moreover, CRP has been associated with severity of functional impairment in other neuromuscular disorders.

### Temporal relationship between serum levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein in therapeutic hypothermia for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy [^985e2618]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective C-reactive protein (CRP) is a useful marker of neonatal infection. Recent studies have shown that neonatal therapeutic hypothermia delays an elevation of CRP in infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). This study investigated the time difference of peak levels of serum CRP and other inflammatory responses during therapeutic hypothermia. Study design We prospectively studied the serial serum data of CRP, interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), and complete blood counts during the first week of life in HIE infants receiving therapeutic hypothermia. Results We identified 22 infants who received therapeutic hypothermia between August 2013 and July 2015. No infants developed clinically overt infections. The peak of serum levels of IL-6, PCT, and CRP were postnatal days 1, 2, and 4, respectively. White blood cells, neutrophils, and platelet counts gradually decreased from days 1 to 7. Early postnatal serum levels of IL-6 correlated with CRP on day 4 (IL-6 on day 2; r =0.78, p <0.001). Conclusion The peak value of CRP on day 4 might reflect the early production and secretion of IL-6 rather than an actual infection. Serial measurement of IL-6 might help avoid invasive sepsis workup and unnecessary change of antibiotics in infants.

### Predicting outcome of childhood bacterial meningitis with a single measurement of C-reactive protein [^a31e591a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, shows high serum levels in invasive bacterial infections. We investigated the potential of a single CRP measurement at different phases of acute childhood bacterial meningitis to predict outcomes.

Methods

Using whole-blood finger-prick samples with no centrifugation, CRP was measured quantitatively on arrival and on day 3 or 4 in children participating in 2 prospective, randomized, double-blind treatment studies conducted in Latin America or Angola. The results were compared with patient outcomes.

Results

Although initial CRP values from 669 children gave useful prognostic information, the 3rd or 4th day measurements taken from 275 children associated significantly with seizures, slow recovery and low scores on the Glasgow Outcome Scale, with odds ratios for CRP values above the median (62 mg/L) ranging from 2 to 6, 2 to 5, and 3 to 5 (Latin America-Angola), respectively. Hearing impairment, although not full deafness, was 3 to 7 times more likely if CRP was above the median soon after hospitalization.

Conclusions

Especially in resource-poor settings, clinicians have few simple-enough tools to identify the child with meningitis who requires maximum attention. CRP is a worthy addition.

Remarks add that patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab, and that in the largest trial the criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥75 mg/L.

COVID-19 has caused a large number of fatalities, most due to multiple organ failure secondary to the virus-induced SIRS or SIRS-like immune disorders.Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with severe COVID-19 might have a cytokine storm syndrome characterized by increased IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α.Lung tissue from patients with SARS related to coronavirus showed hemophagocytosis, which is a central pathologic feature of cytokine storm.Patients with SARS also exhibited high levels of interferon-γ and IL-18, which are particularly important in the cytokine storm syndrome.Thus, the host's immune response and development of inflammation in the lung likely plays an important role in COVID-19.

Li et al.found that coronavirus neurovirulence correlates with the ability of the virus to induce proinflammatory cytokine (IL-12 p40, TNFα, IL-6, IL-15, and IL-1β) signaling from astrocytes and microglia in a mouse model. Other investigators also showed that primary glial cell cultures exposed to coronavirus secrete the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and TNFα.

In cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy, acute necrotizing myelopathy, encephalitis, and ADEM with negative PCR in CSF, cytokine storm is the most probable mechanism of CNS dysfunction. A recent single autopsy case report described a combination of hemorrhagic white matter lesions with areas of necrosis and organizing microscopic infarcts, along with perivascular ADEM-like alterations, suggesting a combination of vascular and inflammatory injury.

The hyperinflammatory response that leads to SIRS can manifest with high levels of C-reactive protein, coagulopathy (elevated-dimer levels, low platelet count, and fibrinogen levels), tissue damage (elevated LDH and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels), macrophage/hepatocyte activation (elevated ferritin levels), and cytopenias (thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia).Therefore, early anti-inflammatory intervention such as anticytokine therapies could reduce the risk of injury in the nervous system.Glucocorticoids remain the first treatment option, and clinical trials are urgently needed to test their efficacy and identify optimal dosing, especially given the clear advantage of glucocorticoids in worldwide availability and cost.

### Neuroimmune disorders in COVID-19 [^2a898b62]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Encephalopathy

Eleven patients (5 females, mean [range 51–78] age 67 years) did not meet possible autoimmune encephalitis criteria. All of them were confirmed cases of COVID-19, 10 with severe disease. There was no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF in 8 patients tested. Neurological presentation was simultaneous with respiratory symptom onset in 1 patient, but in the other 10 there was a latency of days (range 5–25). The presentation consisted of failure to recover consciousness during the weaning period in eight patients and delirium with pyramidal signs in the rest. Neuroimaging was notable in five patients, showing signs of large cerebral arterial wall inflammation (abnormal contrast enhancement), without criteria of vasculitis, predominantly observed in the posterior circulation, similar to the pathological findings of endotheliitis reported in a previous post-mortem series. CSF showed hyperproteinorrachia in 4 (none with signs of endotheliitis), all of them with an elevated CSF/serum albumin quotient suggesting blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Inflammatory markers (CRP, D-dimer, ferritin) and IL-6 were elevated in three patients’ sera. All of them were treated with immunotherapy: the five patients with endotheliitis had a rapid response after intravenous methylprednisolone, three showed complete recovery with IVIG (two combined with Tocilizumab and one with steroids), and plasma exchange was used in the three patients with post-intubation encephalopathy with different outcomes (one death and one still in the ICU but without respiratory support at the point of publication).

### Acute cerebrovascular disease following COVID-19: a single center, retrospective, observational study [^2f5caea8]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Inflammation has been increasingly recognised as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of CVDsand involved in the acute intravascular events triggered by the interruption of the blood supply. Several studies have reported the elevated levels of CRPs and D-dimer in patients with the coexistence of COVID-19.A study done in China with 191 patients included found that D-dimer greater than 1 µg/mL has an association with mortality in patients of COVID-19.Meanwhile, acute inflammation caused by COVID-19 is prone to be followed by a hypercoagulable state due to the increased concentrations of proinflammatory cytokinesand serum inflammatory factors (eg, interleukin and CRP) responsible for early molecular events triggered by coagulation abnormalities.Compared with the patients without CVD, patients with CVD had a higher blood CRP level. Ten out of 11 patients with both CVD and COVID-19 had extremely high levels of D-dimer (median level of 6.9), by contrast, D-dimer of patients without CVD was at a lower level (median level of 0.5). According to the laboratory test index of blood, patients of COVID-19 with CVD had more severe inflammatory infection and were in a state of high coagulation. The significantly increased inflammatory response could be one of the causes of abnormal blood coagulation function in early stage and could be one of the reasons of onset of CVD.

The average time from SARS-CoV-2 infection to onset of CVD was about 12 days. Neurological injury has been confirmed in the infection of other coronaviruses such as in SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MER-CoV).A study reported that 28 days after onset of SARS-CoV infection, patients experienced central nervous symptoms.A four-patient case report showed patients developed neuromuscular diseases approximately 3 weeks after the onset of SARS.Another three-patient case report showed brain MRI revealed significant changes characterised by widespread, bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted imaging within the white matter and subcortical areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes after 25–28 days’ onset of MER-CoV.Thus, in early stages, making a diagnosis according to clinical symptoms and lab tests and taking measures for anti-inflammatory treatment as early as possible may arrest the growth of COVID-19. It may be one way to reduce the risk of CVD.

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^60180108]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the reliability of CRP, WBC and PCT for the diagnosis of infections in patients with SE. Of note, the knowledge about systemic inflammatory reactions with elevated cytokine serum levels during SE is increasing [-], accelerating the uncertainty for the clinicians about the use of acute phase proteins for the diagnosis of infections in SE. Numerous studies have identified different cut-off levels for CRP, PCT and WBC for the presence of infections in ICU patients but a consensus was not found [,-].

In our study, CRP demonstrated a high negative predictive value for infections in patients with SE. In addition, its sensitivity steadily increased from Day 1 to Day 3 of SE. However, specificity and positive predictive value were low, making it a poor predictor for the presence of infections during SE. However, the cut-off chosen for CRP (<10 mg/L) is low and might have led to high sensitivity and low specificity. Single values of WBC counts were insufficient to either rule in or rule out the presence of infections during SE. ROC curves were not performed, as linear changes of CRP and WBC levels over time were highly significant with the presence of infections and, as mentioned above, many previous studies have found numerous cut-off values by focusing on infection in ICU patients, making it complex and obscure for the clinicians to rely on multiple recommendations. Therefore, we have focused on the change of biomarker levels over time. In our study population, the linear changes with time for both CRP and WBC levels were significantly associated with the diagnosis of infections, suggesting that both parameters are useful when evaluating their time course rather than single values. For the presented odds ratios, it has to be taken into account that they are given for each change of 1 mg/L of CRP and 10 9 /L for WBC, respectively. This finding might be reflected by the increasing specificity on day 3 of SE in comparison to day 1.

### Continuous renal replacement therapy in cytokine release syndrome following immunotherapy or cellular therapies? [^70274188]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentation of CRS

In the clinical setting, CRS presents itself with a variety of symptoms ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms, to severe life-threatening complications with onset within minutes to hours, depending on the inducing agent and the immune system activation.Mild symptoms, non-specific of CRS, include fever, fatigue, headache, rash, arthralgia and myalgia. Severe symptoms are characterized by high fever exceeding 40°C with multiorgan system failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.The main organ systems involved are respiratory (ranging from symptoms such as tachypnea, dyspnea, cough to acute respiratory distress syndrome with severe impairment of ventilation and oxygenation requiring sedation, intubation of the airway and mechanical ventilation); cardiac (cardiac failure with pulmonary edema); renal (AKI/failure); hepatic failure and neurological (confusion, aphasia, hemiparesis, cranial nerve palsies, seizures and coma).

Neurotoxicity is the second most common adverse event after CAR-T cell therapy being named ‘CAR T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome’ (CRES). CRES does not seem to be directly related to CRS since is currently considered an independent event, as the two complications have been described as being separate time events in some studies.Common laboratory abnormalities in patients with CRS include cytopenias, elevated creatinine and liver enzymes, deranged coagulation parameters and a high CRP.

In rare cases, CRS can overlap with clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities that resemble hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). In these cases, the main cytokines observed to play an important role are represented by IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-10, which are in accordance with classic CRS. Patients with CRS-associated HLH display the typical clinical and laboratory findings of HLH/MAS such as high fevers, splenomegaly, highly elevated ferritin levels, coagulopathy and hypertriglyceridemia.

After treatment with blinatumomab in B-cell ALL, almost 25% of CRS patients had a diagnosis of HLH.

Moreover, because of the overlap in clinical symptoms between CRS and sepsis and because the population of patients receiving CAR-T cell therapy or T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies is at higher risk of both CRS and sepsis, a thorough differential diagnosis has to be made, with active sepsis screening (table 2).

### Acute phase proteins and white blood cell levels for prediction of infectious complications in status epilepticus [^016229c9]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Infections in status epilepticus (SE) patients result in severe morbidity making early diagnosis crucial. As SE may lead to inflammatory reaction, the value of acute phase proteins and white blood cells (WBC) for diagnosis of infections during SE may be important. We examined the reliability of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and WBC for diagnosis of infections during SE.

Methods

All consecutive SE patients treated in the ICU from 2005 to 2009 were included. Clinical and microbiological records, and measurements of CRP and WBC during SE were analyzed. Subgroup analysis was performed for additional PCT measurements in the first 48 hours of SE.

Results

A total of 22.5% of 160 consecutive SE patients had infections during SE. Single levels of CRP and WBC had no association with the presence of infections. Their linear changes over the first three days after SE onset were significantly associated with the presence of infections (P = 0.0012 for CRP, P = 0.0137 for WBC). Levels of PCT were available for 31 patients and did not differ significantly in patients with and without infections. Sensitivity of PCT and CRP was high (94% and 83%) and the negative predictive value of CRP increased over the first three days to 97%. Specificity was low, without improvement for different cut-offs.

Conclusions

Single levels of CRP and WBC are not reliable for diagnosis of infections during SE, while their linear changes over time significantly correlate with the presence of infections. In addition, low levels of CRP and PCT rule out hospital-acquired infections in SE patients.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels at admission as predictors of duration of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients [^76c195bd]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Non-intensive care unit (ICU) cohorts have shown an association between inflammatory disturbances and delirium, though these relationships have not been studied in critically ill patients. This study sought to investigate the relationship between two inflammatory biomarkers, procalcitonin and C-reactive protein (CRP), and duration of acute brain dysfunction in ventilated patients.

Methods

Patients enrolled in the Maximizing Efficacy of Targeted Sedation and Reducing Neurological Dysfunction (MENDS) trial were assessed daily for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU. Plasma levels of procalcitonin and CRP were obtained within 24 hours of enrollment. Proportional odds logistic regression was used to examine the association between procalcitonin and CRP separately with delirium/coma-free days, adjusting for age, acute physiology score (APS) of the Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, sedation group (dexmedetomidine vs. lorazepam), and sepsis. Secondary analyses examined the association of these markers with other organ dysfunctions and 28-day survival.

Results

Eighty-seven patients were included in this analysis. The median age of the patients was 60 years with APACHE II scores of 28; 68% had sepsis within 48 hours of admission. Higher levels of procalcitonin were associated with fewer delirium/coma-free days [odds ratio (OR), 0.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.3 to 1.0; P = 0.04], whereas higher CRP levels showed trends towards fewer delirium/coma-free days (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.1; P = 0.08). Similar relationships were found regardless of the presence of sepsis. No associations were found between procalcitonin or CRP with 28-day survival (P = 0.40 and 0.16, respectively).

Conclusions

In our pilot study, high baseline inflammatory biomarkers predicted prolonged periods of acute brain dysfunction, implicating inflammation as an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of delirium and coma during critical illness, irrespective of whether patients had sepsis or not.

### Evaluation of C-reactive protein measurement for assessing the risk and prognosis in ischemic stroke: a statement for health care professionals from the CRP pooling project members [^ea7fd7c7]. Stroke (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Several studies have shown, in different populations, that modest elevation of plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) in the range seen in apparently healthy individuals is a strong predictor of future vascular events. Elevated plasma CRP concentrations are also associated with an increased risk of cerebrovascular events and an increased risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke patients. These epidemiological and clinical observations suggest that determination of plasma CRP concentrations could be used as an adjunct for risk assessment in primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular disease and be of prognostic value. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for CRP as an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events in at-risk individuals and ischemic stroke patients and to consider its usefulness in evaluating prognosis after stroke.

Summary Of Review

CRP fulfils most of the requirements of a new risk and prognostic predictor, but several issues await further confirmation and clarification before this marker can be included in the routine evaluation of stroke patients and subjects at risk for cerebrovascular disease. Potentially important associations have been established between elevated plasma CRP concentrations and increased efficacy of established therapies, particularly lipid-lowering therapy with statins.

Conclusions

At present, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend measurement of CRP in the routine evaluation of cerebrovascular disease risk in primary prevention, because there is insufficient evidence as to whether early detection, or intervention based on detection, improves health outcomes, although shared risk of cardiovascular disease indicates this may be of value. In secondary prevention of stroke, elevated CRP adds to existing prognostic markers, but it remains to be established whether specific therapeutic options can be derived from this.

### Sepsis-associated encephalopathy and its differential diagnosis [^661d33d7]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Sepsis is often complicated by an acute and reversible deterioration of mental status, which is associated with increased mortality and is consistent with delirium but can also be revealed by a focal neurologic sign. Sepsis-associated encephalopathy is accompanied by abnormalities of electroencephalogram and somatosensory-evoked potentials, increased in biomarkers of brain injury (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, S-100 beta-protein) and, frequently, by neuroradiological abnormalities, notably leukoencephalopathy. Its mechanism is highly complex, resulting from both inflammatory and noninflammatory processes that affect all brain cells and induce blood-brain barrier breakdown, dysfunction of intracellular metabolism, brain cell death, and brain injuries. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurologic examination that can lead one to perform specific neurologic tests. Electroencephalography is required in the presence of seizure; neuroimaging in the presence of seizure, focal neurologic signs or suspicion of cerebral infection; and both when encephalopathy remains unexplained. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if there is any doubt of meningitis. Hepatic, uremic, or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, withdrawal of sedatives or opioids, alcohol withdrawal delirium, and Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses of sepsis-associated encephalopathy. Patient management is based mainly on controlling infection, organ system failure, and metabolic homeostasis, at the same time avoiding neurotoxic drugs.

### Predictive value of the serum procalcitonin level for fulminant virus-associated encephalopathy [^32d4c453]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fulminant VAE mainly presents with acute brain dysfunction, which might progress rapidly to brain death. Pathogens that can trigger fulminant VAE include influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV-2, and HHV-6. However, the mechanism of VAE development is still unknown. Viral invasion into the CNS, cytokine storms, metabolic disorders, and genetic background might be involved. The theory that viruses directly invade the CNS is controversial since viruses are rarely detected in CSF. There was no virus found in the CSF in our study, which is consistent with the findings of most previous studies. VAE is related to immune-mediated disorders and cytokine storms triggered by viral infection. Proper activation of the immune response and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines play important roles in the defense against viral infection. However, excessive cytokine secretion can lead to an inflammatory cytokine storm, which might cause multiple organ injury. Fulminant VAE includes a variety of phenotypes, such as ANE, ADEM, and hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome. Lesions of VAE in the brain might be located in white matter, gray matter and the basal ganglia. Among them, thalamic involvement is the hallmark of ANE. The prognosis of VAE varies across countries. The mortality rate of patients with fulminant VAE was 30.43% in our study, which is similar to that of patients with ANE. However, much remains unknown about fulminant VAE. Treatments for fulminant VAE are limited. We aimed to determine the risk factors for fulminant VAE that might help to predict poor outcomes.

### Infectious disease-associated encephalopathies [^207bb0d4]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Infectious diseases may affect brain function and cause encephalopathy even when the pathogen does not directly infect the central nervous system, known as infectious disease-associated encephalopathy. The systemic inflammatory process may result in neuroinflammation, with glial cell activation and increased levels of cytokines, reduced neurotrophic factors, blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neurotransmitter metabolism imbalances, and neurotoxicity, and behavioral and cognitive impairments often occur in the late course. Even though infectious disease-associated encephalopathies may cause devastating neurologic and cognitive deficits, the concept of infectious disease-associated encephalopathies is still under-investigated; knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, which may be distinct from those of encephalopathies of non-infectious cause, is still limited. In this review, we focus on the pathophysiology of encephalopathies associated with peripheral (sepsis, malaria, influenza, and COVID-19), emerging therapeutic strategies, and the role of neuroinflammation.

### Clozapine-induced elevated C-reactive protein and fever mimic infection [^9f40a747]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Clozapine-induced fever has been reported frequently, but clozapine-induced elevated serum C-reactive protein (S-CRP) over 100 mg/L with early onset, without associated myocarditis, has not been reported in the literature. In this case report, we present a case of an 80-year-old Slovenian female with dementia and psychotic symptoms who developed elevated S-CRP (122 mg/L) and fever (38.2 °C) on the seventh day with 25 mg of clozapine daily, which improved after clozapine discontinuation. The patient did not have symptoms and signs of infection. This case report can be used to remind clinicians of keeping in mind the potential of clozapine associated with very high elevated S-CRP with fever, which can be easily confused with more serious conditions.

### Impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants and vaccination on pediatric febrile seizures: a retrospective cohort study [^7a0eca20]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

D-dimer and coagulopathy

The significant rise in D-dimer levels (Table 3) suggests a hypercoagulable state, potentially induced by SARS-CoV-2-related endothelial dysfunction and complement activation. Elevated D-dimer levels have been associated with cerebral microthrombosis and the disruption of the BBB, which facilitates viral entry and neuroinvasion. This coagulopathic mechanism may play a role in the observed escalation of FS severity and recurrence, as elevated D-dimer may reflect hypercoagulable states associated with endothelial dysfunction. The lack of significant differentiation in CRP levels (P = 0.15; Table 3) highlights the restricted utility of CRP as a neurospecific marker, advocating for the implementation of CNS-focused biomarker panels in clinical practice. In contrast to febrile seizures caused by other infectious agents, where CRP is often elevated, our findings suggest that IL-6 and D-dimer may be more specific indicators of neuroinflammation in SARS-CoV-2-associated FS.This discrepancy between elevated IL-6 and D-dimer with normal CRP levels is noteworthy, as it may reflect a distinct inflammatory profile of SARS-CoV-2-associated FS compared to FS from other causes, though further research is needed to confirm its specificity.

### Combined testing of cerebrospinal fluid IL-12 (p40) and serum C-reactive protein as a possible discriminator of acute bacterial neuroinfections [^ed9f4481]. Cytokine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central nervous system infections (CNS) are life-threatening diseases, with meningitis being the most common. Viral infections are usually self-limiting diseases but bacterial pathogens are associated with higher mortality rates and persistent neurological sequelae. We aimed to study the role of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12(p40), TNF-α cytokines, classical cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters, and serum C-reactive protein levels (CRP) for discriminating bacterial from viral central nervous system infections.

Material and Methods

This prospective study included 80 patients with clinical signs and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid laboratory findings typical for neuroinfection admitted to St. George University Hospital-Plovdiv. Routine methods such as direct microscopy, culturing and identification were used for microbiological analysis as well as latex-agglutination test and multiplex PCR. Cytokines' concentrations were measured by ELISA. CRP and CSF parameters were collected from the patients' medical records.

Results

We observed the highest discriminatory power among cytokines for cerebrospinal IL-12(p40) (AUC = 0.925; p = 0.000). CSF protein levels were the best predictor for bacterial neuroinfection (AUC = 0.973; p = 0.000). The AUC for the serum CRP as a stand-alone biomarker was estimated to be 0.943. The discriminatory power can be increased up to 0.995 (p = 0.000) when combining cerebrospinal fluid IL-12(p40) and serum CRP, with an optimal cut-off value of 144 (Sensitivity 100%; Specificity 90.9%).

Conclusion

The combined testing of CSF IL-12(p40) and serum CRP is associated with the highest diagnostic accuracy.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^5c279e95]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Of note, some success in treating patients in severe cytokine storm has been measured using tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor antagonist biotherapeutic. As IL-6 is the key cytokine signaling the synthesis and release of CRP and because IL-6 (and CRP) levels do correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease, the relationship among these factors and the relevance of each in the establishment and progression of COVID-19 infection needs evaluation. Xu et al.reported CRP levels decreased markedly from 75 ± 67 to 38.13 + 54.21 μg/mL 1 day after tocilizumab therapy. Levels continued to fall to 10.61 ± 13.79 μg/mL 3 days after therapy, and to 2.72 ± 3.6 μg/mL 5 days after therapy. In another clinical trial not causally related to COVID-19 infection, a patient given chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy developed a severe cytokine storm response like that seen in severe COVID-19 infection. Whereas use of steroid and vasopressor was ineffective, treatment with tocilizumab to block the IL-6 response was found to rapidly resolve the life-threatening complications occurring in that patient.

The role of CRP and its distinct isoforms in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection remains to be studied. However, the accumulating evidence of their correlation supports the notion of the use of CRP levels as a diagnostic index of the severity of COVID-19 infection. Moreover, it may be possible to develop a point-of-care CRP test for patients with fever or other basic clinical symptoms that is noninvasive, highly predictive of health outcomes, and which may inform clinical decision-making.

### Autoimmune and infectious encephalitis: development of a discriminative tool for early diagnosis and initiation of therapy [^2d8c83a4]. Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Focal neurological deficits were more prevalent in IE compared to AE. While AE commonly presents with the typical triad of limbic encephalitis, consisting of cognitive deficits, epileptic seizures, and psychiatric disorders, focal deficits are less frequent. This may be due to the mesiotemporal pathology seen in many AE. The requirement for ICU treatment and mechanical ventilation was high in both patient subgroups. Some studies have linked these features to a poorer outcome. However, we did not observe a correlation with the overall outcome as measured by the mRS score. This unexpected result may have been influenced by a selection bias as multimorbid patients with severe encephalitis might not have been referred to intensive care in the first place.

Significant differences in laboratory parameters between AE and IE include CSF leukocyte count, as well as serum C-reactive protein (CRP), platelets, and sodium. In AE, reports have indicated either normal or only mildly elevated CSF leukocytes, with varying proposed cutoffs between 36 and 50 cells/µl to differentiate AE from IE. Lower serum sodium and platelets levels in IE compared to AE have been previously noted, possibly reflecting a more pronounced systemic reaction to infectious pathogens. These observations extend to clinical features such as headache and fever, which we found to be discriminative between the two conditions.

Inflammation and infection monitoring in neurocritical care—In SAH, comparison of neutrophil percentage in ventricular fluid in the first three days to other predictive scales suggests that it has good negative predictive value for patients who may develop delayed deterioration, but there is no evidence to support the use of WBC counts or indices of WBC to discriminate between infection and inflammatory changes in patients with EVDs. CRP and Pro-calcitonin are most frequently measured; while CRP may provide indirect confirmation of an infection or response to therapy, it does not reliably discriminate between bacterial meningitis from other forms of inflammation and has poor predictive value in SAH, ICH, or stroke, and Pro-calcitonin does not appear to be a useful monitoring technique to investigate infections in brain-injured patients.

### C-reactive protein concentrations during bacteraemia: a comparison between patients with and without liver dysfunction [^ef20c0fe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the value of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations as a marker of sepsis in patients with biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction.

Design

A retrospective case-control comparison of serum CRP concentrations between patients with and those without liver dysfunction (prothrombin time over 18 s and serum bilirubin > or = 20 micromol/l) during their first episode of bacteraemia.

Setting

The neurosciences and general adult intensive care units of a university teaching hospital.

Patients

Any patient from the above settings with a first episode of bacteraemia (first isolate of pathogenic bacteria from blood cultures) over a 3-year period.

Measurements and Results

After exclusions 126 first episodes of bacteraemia were identified, of which 33 were in patients with liver dysfunction. Serum CRP concentrations were significantly lower in patients with liver dysfunction (median 103 mg/l, IQR 29-204) than in those without (146 mg/l, 74, > 250).

Conclusions

Patients with biochemical evidence of liver disease generate significantly lower serum CRP concentrations during bacteraemia than patients without liver dysfunction. Serum CRP concentrations should be interpreted with caution in patients with liver disease to diagnose and monitor bacterial sepsis.

### Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-associated encephalopathy: an under-recognised cause of acute encephalitis? Case series and literature review [^ac73f39e]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

HTLV-1 infection should be considered a possible cause of encephalopathy, where no other aetiology is identified, particularly in patients from endemic areas or where there is co-existing myelopathy. HTLV-1 may also increase the risk of encephalopathy in patients with existing risk factors such as co-infections or autoimmune conditions. If HTLV-associated encephalopathy is suspected, IV corticosteroids may be an effective initial treatment option.

### Associations of CRP and PCT levels with obstetric and neonatal outcomes: a prospective study [^665e2d1c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia was defined as a blood pressure increase of more than 140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks of gestation combined with proteinuria, either more than 300 mg per 24 h or 2 + or more by dipstick. In the absence of proteinuria, preeclampsia is diagnosed as hypertension associated with thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100.000/microliter), impaired liver function (elevated blood levels of liver transaminases to twice the normal concentration), new-onset renal insufficiency (elevated serum creatinine greater than 1.1 mg/dL or a doubling of serum creatinine), the development of cerebral or visual disturbances, or pulmonary edema. Gestational hypertension is an increase in blood pressure after 20 weeks of gestation in the absence of proteinuria or any systemic findings. GDM was diagnosed between the 24th and 32nd weeks of gestation, according to the criteria of the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group.

Neonatal sepsis is a pathological process that occurs in infants within the first four weeks of life and is characterized by hemodynamic and respiratory alterations resulting from a systemic inflammatory response to an infectious process. Neonatal respiratory distress syndrome is a pulmonary condition that leads to respiratory difficulties in newborns shortly after birth. Therefore, a composite definition of adverse neonatal outcomes was employed, encompassing the presence of one or more of the following criteria: Apgar score < 5 at 5 min, ventilator support within the first 24 h of life (excluding CPAP), cardiopulmonary resuscitation, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, seizure, sepsis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, persistent pulmonary hypertension, necrotizing enterocolitis (stage II or III), grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage, fracture, neonatal brachial plexus palsy, or perinatal death.

CRP and procalcitonin measurement

Venous blood samples were collected during the antenatal visit for routine antenatal care during all three trimesters. CRP and procalcitonin measurements were carried out on the same day that blood was taken. The serum CRP levels were evaluated via nephelometric methods on a Siemens brand BN 2 (Siemens Healthineers Corp. Erlangen, Germany) autoanalyzer, and the serum procalcitonin levels were evaluated via electrochemiluminescence methods on a Roche brand Cobas e 601 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Mannheim, Germany) hormone autoanalyzer.

### Diagnostic performance of procalcitonin for bacterial infection in severe alcoholic hepatitis Compared with C-reactive protein [^38a591a5]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol consumption has catastrophic consequences, with an estimated 3 million deaths (5.3% of all deaths) globally in 2016 attributed to harmful alcohol use, including 607,000 deaths from alcohol-attributable liver diseases. Alcoholic liver disease encompasses a spectrum of conditions, including steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Patients with underlying alcoholic liver disease who continue heavy drinking may develop sudden-onset jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy, and other signs of liver failure, known as alcoholic hepatitis. According to prospective studies, the patients of alcoholic hepatitis with modified discriminant function ≥ 32 showed a poor prognosis as high mortality in a month as 35-50%. Therefore, this condition is defined as severe alcoholic hepatitis. Steroid therapy is currently the only effective medical treatment that reduces 28-day mortality based on clinical trials and meta-analyses in severe hepatitis. Meanwhile, alcohol-induced derangement of the immune system triggers an extended inflammatory response, resulting in immune exhaustion and dysregulated compensatory anti-inflammatory pathway. Therefore, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis are susceptible to bacterial infections, with a known prevalence of 26–37%. Steroid therapy induces immune suppression, making severe infection or sepsis a contraindication. Therefore, it is crucial to identify evidence of infection upon admission.

However, patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis often exhibit clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis, making it challenging to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious conditions. Culture is a specific diagnostic tool for bacterial infection, but it requires several days to obtain results. Therefore, clinicians frequently rely on early inflammatory biomarkers like C-reactive protein (CRP) to detect sepsis in alcoholic hepatitis. While CRP is a useful acute phase protein that reflects the severity of inflammation, its levels can increase not only in infectious conditions but also in non-infectious conditions.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is a precursor of calcitonin, and its concentration significantly increases in severe bacterial and fungal infections. However, it only shows a slight elevation in non-infectious inflammation, trauma, and malignancy, which makes it a valuable diagnostic biomarker for acute severe infections. However, there are limited studies that have investigated the comparative diagnostic capacity of PCT and CRP in severe alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, our intention is to compare the effectiveness of PCT and CRP in detecting bacterial infections in severe alcoholic hepatitis through a prospectively enrolled multicenter clinical trial.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in classic Hodgkin's lymphoma, complicated by anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy [^b200b399]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Differential diagnosis

Investigations and clinical examinations found the differential diagnoses to be cerebritis, encephalitis or PRES. CNS vasculitis could have been considered, although MRI findings are generally diffuse and irreversible.Metabolic encephalopathies can have similar presentations—but serum glucose, urea and electrolytes were normal. An EEG was not performed. If she had experienced persistent seizures or encephalopathy, then an EEG would have been indicated to exclude mimics or complications.

Cerebritis

In most cases, cerebritis progresses to a cerebral abscess by the time diagnosis is made, due to cerebral tissue necrosis.This is not in keeping with a radiological resolution of findings after 11 days. Autoimmune cerebritis is unlikely without encephalopathy and autoimmune diagnoses (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).

CNS infection

The patient had been neutropenic (secondary to myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy) and febrile with elevated CRP 133 at the time of the seizures occurring. The following laboratory investigations to locate a source of infection were normal and negative for pathogens; CSF culture and cytology, blood, urine and stool cultures, CSF viral PCR and serum beta-D-glucan. CTPA showed no evidence of respiratory tract infection and there were no skin lesions or rashes.

The CSF sample was obtained 2 days after the onset of seizures, showing normal cell counts and protein. In herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), 10% of CSF cell counts and 50% of CSF protein are normal within a week of illness.CSF PCR has high specificity (99%) and sensitivity (96%) in HSE when sampled at 48 hours and 10 days after symptom onset.The LP was not repeated at 10 days due to neurology and pathology having resolved and results would not change management. Furthermore, the patient and her family were keen to avoid unessential invasive procedures.

It is worth noting that intravenous antibiotics and antivirals were started 2 days prior to the LP and continued until after the symptoms and radiological findings had resolved. We cannot completely rule out CNS infection, but it would be less typical to see quick radiographic and clinical resolution.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy in COVID-19-related encephalopathy [^76f84f86]. Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Encephalopathy is emerging as a recurrent complication of COVID-19, yet the best approach to management and treatment remains unknown. We described five patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy, all of whom recovered following IVIg.

IVIg is an efficient anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory treatment for a growing number of neurological disorders; however, its mode of action is complex and not yet fully understood. The pathophysiology underlying the diseases which respond to IVIg is highly heterogeneous, thus it is likely that IVIg acts on various disease-specific pathways.

In patients with COVID-19 and severe pulmonary involvement, treatment with IVIg led to a significant clinical improvement and concomitant reduction of serum inflammatory markers, observed as early as the first infusion day. Correspondingly, our patients showed a prompt and dramatic improvement of neurological manifestations following IVIg. Similar results have been achieved in six other patients with COVID-19-related encephalopathy treated with high-dose corticosteroids. In our third case, steroid pulse therapy was ineffective, where subsequent IVIg was concomitant with clinical recovery. In support of our preliminary findings, IVIg led to improved neuropsychiatric symptoms in four COVID-19 patients with mixed central and peripheral neurological manifestations and to clinico-radiological recovery in a further patient with frontal status epilepticus and encephalopathy.

Clinical course and investigative findings observed in the present case series, including negative RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF, absence of significant elevation of CSF cells and protein levels, non-specific MRI findings, and the dramatic response to immunotherapy, suggest an inflammatory/immune-mediated pathogenesis rather than CNS viral invasion. An autoantibody-mediated mechanism is unlikely to explain CNS involvement, based on the brief temporal interval between CNS and infection-related symptom onset, negative testing for anti-neuronal antibodies, and the prompt and sustained response to IVIg. Cytokine-mediated neuroinflammation has been implicated in the underlying pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19-associated encephalopathy, and may have contributed to disease course in our patients. Except the third case, all patients suffered acute respiratory distress secondary to CRS induced by SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, case 3 is the only patient with previous cognitive impairment, a condition that possibly made her more susceptible to develop encephalopathy despite mild systemic inflammation, as in other reported geriatric patients. In patient 1 and 4, we observed a delay between the rise of inflammatory markers in serum and the onset/peak of neurological manifestations, possibly due to a delayed rise of CSF cytokines with respect to serum levels. Unfortunately, we were not able to measure CSF cytokines.

### Inflammatory cytokine patterns associated with neurological diseases in coronavirus disease 2019 [^36700ab0]. Annals of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with distinct neurological manifestations. This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid. Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL-6, CXCL8, and active tumor growth factor β1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system in COVID-19 can appear early, as a parainfectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 neuroinvasion. At the same time, encephalopathy is mainly influenced by peripheral events, including inflammatory cytokines. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:1041-1045.

GLIM inflammation criterion—application of clinical judgment states that clinical judgment based on the integration of underlying diagnosis or condition, clinical signs, and/or laboratory markers should guide confirmation of the presence of inflammatory disease or condition; judgment is also indicated to discern when serial CRP measurements may be indicated or when alternative laboratory indicators of inflammation warrant consideration, and although some of these indicators may still have limited sensitivity and specificity, they can still be used by clinicians to support the potential presence of inflammation. The "agree" or "strongly agree" response rate to statement 7 was 97%.

### Association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and prognosis in different periods after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^9ac22516]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The increased levels of hsCRP after stroke might also be attributable to in‐hospital acquired inflammatory processes, such as infection. We therefore adjusted for leukocyte counts to exclude the effect of secondary complications on functional outcome. We observed a statistically significant association between hsCRP levels measured between 24 and 72 hours and increased risk of poor functional outcomes. Identical with a prior study, we found that hsCRP levels slightly decreased after subacute phases of stroke.It is conceivable that an increased hsCRP level after stroke could be attributable to inflammation related to the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke and might reflect the extent of the ischemic area.Moreover, it has been shown that the peak level of hsCRP was reached after 24 hours of symptom onset,,,and a correlation between CRP measured within 4±2 days after symptom onset and infarct size has been described before.The time course of acute‐phase response might explain the absent relationship of hsCRP detected within 24 hours with functional outcome in our study.

Taken together, our findings discovered that higher hsCRP levels within 72 hours after index onset are strongly associated with poor stroke prognosis. From a clinical point of view, it might help stratify risk of new stroke and poor functional outcomes and identify patients with potential benefits from anti‐inflammatory therapy. Further randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of early anti‐inflammatory therapy in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA were needed.

Strength and Limitation

The strength of this study is that the data for this study derived from a prospective, multicenter, hospital‐based, and large‐sample‐size cohort. The blood samples from all subcenters were assayed centrally. However, our study also had several limitations. First, the blood sample was drawn from peripheral venous blood. The peripheral inflammatory or acute‐phase responses motivated by ischemic stroke may overlap with preexisting inflammatory processes. Moreover, though it is well established that local inflammation in the brain is associated with peripheral systemic inflammation,the concentration of inflammatory markers in peripheral blood may only partially reflect the inflammatory response at the infarct site. Second, only 1 time point biomarker measurement is available, which precluded us from assessing the contribution of changes in these markers over time. Third, hsCRP is not measured continuously but at different times. The patients measured at each period may be different. It is unclear if the selection effect versus timing of hsCRP is driving the finding. Finally, hospital arrival time has been shown to affect the prognosis of stroke. Absence of this element impeded assessment of its influence on the correlation between hsCRP and outcomes in the current study. It should be considered in further research.

### Defining the clinicoradiologic syndrome of SARS-CoV-2 acute necrotizing encephalopathy: a systematic review and 3 new pediatric cases [^0e415be1]. Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

We characterize clinical and neuroimaging features of SARS-CoV-2-related acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE).

Methods

Systematic review of English language publications in PubMed and reference lists between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2023, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for sporadic and genetic ANE were included.

Results

From 899 articles, 20 cases (17 single case reports and 3 additional cases) were curated for review (50% female; 8 were children). Associated COVID-19 illnesses were febrile upper respiratory tract infections in children while adults had pneumonia (45.6%) and myocarditis (8.2%). Children had early neurologic deterioration (median day 2 in children vs day 4 in adults), seizures (5 (62.5%) children vs 3 of 9 (33.3%) adults), and motor abnormalities (6 of 7 (85.7%) children vs 3 of 7 (42.9%) adults). Eight of 12 (66.7%) adults and 4 (50.0%) children had high-risk ANE scores. Five (62.5%) children and 12 (66.7%) adults had brain lesions bilaterally and symmetrically in the putamina, external capsules, insula cortex, or medial temporal lobes, in addition to typical thalamic lesions of ANE. Hypotension was only seen in adults (30%). Hematologic derangements were common: lymphopenia (66.7%), coagulopathy (60.0%), or elevated D-dimers (100%), C-reactive protein (91.7%), and ferritin (62.5%). A pathogenic heterozygous c/.1754 C>T variant in RANBP2 was present in 2 children: one known to have this before SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a patient tested because the SARS-CoV-2 infection was the second encephalopathic illness. Three other children with no prior encephalopathy or family history of encephalopathy were negative for this variant. Fifteen (75%) received immunotherapy (with IV methylprednisolone, immunoglobulins, tocilizumab, or plasma exchange): 6 (40.0%) with monotherapy and 9 (60.0%) had combination therapy. Deaths were in 8 of 17 with data (47.1%): a 2-month-old male infant and 7 adults (87.5%) of median age 56 years (33-70 years), 4 of whom did not receive immunotherapy.

Discussion

Children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 ANE have similar clinical features and neuroimaging characteristics. Mortality is high, predominantly in patients not receiving immunotherapy and at the extremes of age.

### C-reactive protein is linked to disease activity, impact, and response to treatment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria [^df4eadbc]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation, have been consistently reported in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Here, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1253 CSU patients from 2 centers to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of elevated levels of CRP in CSU? (ii) Why do CSU patients show elevated levels of CRP? (iii) Are elevated CRP levels relevant?

Methods

Serum levels of CRP were measured by the nephelometric method. We collected information regarding various laboratory tests including ESR, CBC with differential, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C3, C4, IL-6, etc. For most patients, we also collected data on age, gender, duration of CSU, presence of angioedema, activity (UAS at the time of blood sampling and for 7 days), quality of life (CU-Q2oL and/or DLQI), comorbidities and possible causes of CSU, and autologous serum skin test (ASST) response. The efficacy of second-generation antihistamines was evaluated on the day of blood collecting.

Results

One-third of CSU patients had elevated levels of CRP. Higher levels of CRP were associated with ASST positivity (P = .009) and arterial hypertension (P = .005), but not with other possible causes or comorbidities of CSU. C-reactive protein correlated with urticaria activity (P < .001), quality of life impairment (P = .026), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (P < .001). C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in nonresponders to antihistamines as compared to responders (P < .001).

Conclusion

Elevated levels of CRP are common and relevant in CSU patients. The assessment of CRP levels may help to optimize the management of patients with CSU.

Interleukin-6 inhibitors—tocilizumab in hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19: Among hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 who have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests tocilizumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone. (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab. In the largest trial on the treatment of tocilizumab, criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥75 mg/L.

### Phenotypes and subphenotypes of delirium: a review of current categorisations and suggestions for progression [^8631c60f]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Mechanisms

Classification of delirium based on expression markers or biological data may provide insight into its underlying mechanisms, potentially leading to more ambitious targeted treatments which are not possible with reliance on classification by clinical traits only. At least six neuropathophysiological hypotheses, which remain poorly understood, have been proposed to precipitate delirium. These theories are complementary and accumulative, rather than competitive. They may translate into potential subphenotypes defined by underlying mechanism. Other phenotyping successes, such as that of asthma, have endotyped groups based on the pathophysiological processes leading to the development and progression of disease and treatment responses. This allows further treatment research to target the relevant patient groups. Applying similar methods to delirium, using well-characterised cohorts with appropriate representation of the spectrum of the syndrome, and incorporating bioinformatics, may see phenotyping success, and eventual development of effective treatments. The neuroinflammation hypothesis may allow for categorisation into inflammatory or neuroinflammatory, and non-inflammatory delirium, as the biomarkers may differ depending on presence of inflammation. High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of acute inflammatory response, are independently associated with delirium. In ICU patients, higher levels of CRP and procalcitonin are associated with a longer period of delirium or coma. Additional potential biomarkers for neuroinflammation are plasma pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), cortisol, S100B-protein, and interleukins (IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12). Cytokine levels are measured peripherally from the blood, but brain cytokine levels cannot be quantified readily and low accessibility to the central nervous system restricts this research. A 2008 cross-sectional study investigating pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in elderly patients with hip fractures found that plasma IL-6 and IL-8 levels were higher in patients who developed delirium post-operatively. A 2014 study suggested that IL-1β production in the CNS may be an indicator of early event in the pathogenesis cascade of delirium. However, trace IL levels in CSF and the consequent reliability on extrapolation decrease the reliability of these tests. IL-10 is a marker for non-inflamed patients. It has also been hypothesised that repeated endogenous glucocorticoid release in response to stress contributes to delirium development.

### C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in people with eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^165c366c]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Studies suggest that there is a relationship between inflammatory diseases, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and psychiatric disorders. In eating disorders, cross-sectional studies have recently examined peripheral CRP levels in blood serum and plasma, which allow a comprehensive meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined studies from three databases, measuring CRP levels in people with eating disorders, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total n = 14 publications were included into the systematic review. Of these, n = 13 cross-sectional papers with N = 700 participants were meta-analysed, n = 11 in anorexia nervosa (AN) and n = 2 in binge eating disorder (BED). One study of the total n = 14 was narratively summarised because it was not suitable for inclusion into the meta-analysis. In the cross-sectional analyses, CRP levels were significantly lower in people with AN compared to health controls (HCs), but CRP level were higher in people with BED compared to HCs. Patients with AN appear to have lower CRP levels compared to healthy controls. This could be a result of malnutrition or specific nutritional deficiencies. Due to the reduced CRP levels in AN, patients might be at risk for bacterial infections or developing autoimmune diseases, and clinicians might fail to notice an inflammatory process or an infection. In contrast, patients with BED were found to have higher CRP level than healthy controls which might be a consequence of an inflammatory response triggered by overeating, disordered eating patterns and the consumption of low-quality food during binges.

### Inflammation biomarkers and delirium in critically ill patients: new insights? [^669ce274]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanism of the serious and frequently occurring disorder delirium is poorly understood. Inflammation and sepsis are known risk factors for ICU delirium and therefore these patients are highly susceptible to delirium. Several studies have been performed to determine which cytokines are most associated with delirium but the results are inconclusive. Also, new biomarkers associated with brain dysfunction and cognitive impairment are still recognized and need to be studied to determine their relation with delirium. In this commentary we address some limitations concerning an interesting new study that warrants directions for future studies.

### Neurologic syndromes predict higher in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 [^edeeb103]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present the largest inpatient cohort of SARS-CoV-2–infected patients to date, evaluating predictors of inpatient mortality as they relate to neurologic syndromes at presentation. The neurologic findings seen in this cohort were similar to other large cohort studies. A small but substantial subset of patients had associated neurologic presentations of sufficient severity to warrant imaging of the neuraxis. Although the majority had normal neuroimaging, the distinction between those with altered cognition or arousal and those exhibiting other neurologic signs and symptoms associated with COVID-19 infection (neuro-COVID-19 complex) appears to be important.

The etiology of altered mentation in COVID-19 is not clear. In this study, there was an association between altered mentation and hypotension, renal impairment as demonstrated by elevated BUN and creatinine, disturbed coagulation as evidenced by elevated D-dimer levels, prolonged INR and reduced platelet counts, and increased inflammation as evidenced by elevated levels of procalcitonin. These biomarker abnormalities are associated with multiorgan system failure and more severe SARS-CoV-2 illness. These patients were less likely to have traditional symptoms such as fever or decreased oxygen saturation. It is unclear whether these findings are exclusive to COVID-19 infection. Other studies have shown that delirium is a predictor for increased inpatient mortality irrespective of underlying diagnosis, particularly in elderly patients.Even when controlling for biomarker abnormalities, patients with impaired cognition or arousal without abnormal neuroimaging findings exhibited an increased risk of inpatient mortality, suggesting that other yet-to-be determined mechanisms may be at play. Irrespective of the etiologic factors, such neurologic presentations can be subtle but important indications of more severe SARS-CoV-2 illness and should be taken seriously in hospital emergency departments. While other biomarker findings such as hypotension, D-dimer, coagulopathy, and renal failure may be more predictive of illness severity, and mortality, neurologic syndromes portend a higher risk of mortality, and can be easily assessed early in a patient encounter. The biomarkers we found to be most correlative with poor outcome and potentially modifiable such as BUN, INR, oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, and CRP could serve as potential targets for future research for treatments or management paradigms.

### Neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19, potential neurotropic mechanisms, and therapeutic interventions [^8a2c47ca]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

IL-6 is prominent in the cytokine storm that underlies COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome and brain injury. Increasing evidence supports the safety and efficiency of the IL-6 receptor blocker tocilizumab for treating patients with severe or critical COVID-19, especially those with cytokine release syndrome. Case reports described that tocilizumab exerted potential beneficial effects on COVID-19-related neuropsychiatric symptoms, including encephalopathy presenting with aphasia and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Case reports and case series showed that immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulin was safe and effective for the treatment of COVID-19-associated neurological disorders, including encephalopathy, GBS, and new-onset refractory status epilepticus. Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib has been shown to reduce macrophage and neutrophil recruitment and suppress inflammation in a rhesus macaque model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Baricitinib treatment could affect both inflammation and cellular viral endocytosis and entry into cells, thus it could be a potential treatment for COVID-19. Thiamine, a vitamin and dietary supplement, was recently reported to attenuate the Th17 cell-mediated IL-17 pro-inflammatory cytokine storm related to COVID-19, and is a promising repurposed drug for treating neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials showed that psychosocial interventions are associated with enhanced immune system function for at least 6 months following treatment cessation, as indexed by decreases in levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines or markers (e.g. IL-6, CRP), and by increases in immune cell counts (e.g. CD56, CD4). Psychosocial interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy, psychological first aid, and a community-based psychosocial arts program, were reported to have beneficial effects on psychological and psychiatric complications in COVID-19 patients.

### Cytokine storm of acute necrotizing encephalopathy [^3a52a74b]. Pediatric Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Acute necrotizing encephalopathy is a rare, clinically distinct entity characterized by multiple, symmetric areas of edema and necrosis in the thalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and white matter. It is postulated to arise from uncontrolled cytokine release during a febrile illness, and is most often seen in East Asia. We describe a rare North American case of acute necrotizing encephalopathy attributable to human herpes virus-6 is a 9-month-old white male. The infant moved to the United States from Hong Kong, 3 months before disease onset. A workup revealed elevations in serum interleukin-1β, interleukin-2, and interleukin-10, with normal values of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α after the initiation of high-dose steroids. This profile is unique compared with previous cytokine profiles of this disease, possibly because of the effects of steroid therapy. A rare North American case with a history of birth in East Asia underscores the possibility of a role for environmental pathogens in this disease.

### Inflammation-triggered enlargement of choroid plexus in subacute COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms [^bf2c4187]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate whether choroid plexus volumes in subacute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients with neurological symptoms could indicate inflammatory activation or barrier dysfunction and assess their association with clinical data.

Methods

Choroid plexus volumes were measured in 28 subacute COVID-19 patients via cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), compared with those in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy patients (n=25), asymptomatic individuals after COVID-19 (n=21), and healthy controls (n=21). Associations with inflammatory serum markers (peak counts of leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukin 6), an MRI-based marker of barrier dysfunction (CSF volume fraction [V-CSF]), and clinical parameters like olfactory performance and cognitive scores (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) were investigated.

Results

COVID-19 patients showed significantly larger choroid plexus volumes than control groups (p<0.001, η 2 =0.172). These volumes correlated significantly with peak leukocyte levels (p=0.001, Pearson's r=0.621) and V-CSF (p=0.009, Spearman's rho=0.534), but neither with CRP nor interleukin 6. No significant correlations were found with clinical parameters.

Interpretation

In patients with subacute COVID-19, choroid plexus volume is a marker of central nervous system inflammation and barrier dysfunction in the presence of neurologic symptoms. The absence of plexus enlargement in infection-triggered non-COVID-19 encephalopathy suggests a specific severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 effect. This study also documents an increase in choroid plexus volume for the first time as a parainfectious event. ANN NEUROL 2024;96:715-725.

Conclusions

For children with KFD, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of CNS involvement when lymph node tenderness, elevated CRP, or elevated LDH is present. In cases of aseptic meningitis or encephalitis in children, KFD involving the CNS should be considered as a differential diagnosis.

### Presentations and mechanisms of CNS disorders related to COVID-19 [^f2146234]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In addition to severe respiratory symptoms, there are a growing number of reports showing a wide range of CNS complications in patients with COVID-19. Here, we review the literature on these complications, ranging from nonspecific symptoms to necrotizing encephalopathies, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, endotheliitis, and stroke. We postulate that there are several different mechanisms involved in COVID-19-associated CNS dysfunction, particularly activation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways and, in a few patients, a direct viral effect on the endothelium and the parenchyma. Last, critically ill patients frequently present with protracted cognitive dysfunction in the setting of septic encephalopathy likely due to multifactorial mechanisms. Further studies are needed to clarify the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms, but available data suggest that CNS complications in COVID-19 are rare and probably not directly caused by the virus.

### Elevated cytokine, chemokine, and growth and differentiation factor-15 levels in hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome: a retrospective observational study [^43d2e9cc]. Cytokine (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients with hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) have a high early mortality rate, which may be caused by a 'cytokine storm'. However, there is little information on how cytokines and chemokines change over time in these patients. We aimed to describe the characteristics of HSES by examining changes in serum biomarker levels over time. Six patients with HSES were included. We retrospectively evaluated their clinical course and imaging/laboratory data. We measured serum levels of multiple cytokines [interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor alpha], chemokines (IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interferon-inducible protein-10), and growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-15. The highest cytokine and chemokine levels were noted in the first 24 h, and decreased thereafter. The GDF-15 level was markedly high. Cytokine, chemokine, and GDF-15 levels were significantly higher in patients with HSES than in controls in the first 24 h, except for IL-2 and IL-4. Patients with HSES have high inflammatory cytokine and chemokine levels, a high GDF-15 level in the first 24 h, and high lactate levels. Our study provides new insights on the pathophysiology of HSES, a detailed clinical picture of patients with HSES, and potential biomarkers.

### Seizures in febrile children with SARS-CoV-2 infection: clinical features, short-term follow-up [^b4a2082b]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

COVID-19 relevant data for positive and negative groups

Among the cohort of 182 patients with fever and seizures tightly connected with COVID-19, 7 exhibited a poor prognosis, consisting of 3 fatalities (Table 2) and 4 individuals with residual partial cognitive or motor impairment. It’s particularly noteworthy that all 7 patients displayed impaired consciousness lasting for several hours, with 3 of them receiving a diagnosis of the exceedingly rare acute necrotizing encephalopathy (Table 3). Subsequently, 32 patients (17.6%) underwent routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis through lumbar puncture. This all-round analysis encompassed the assessment of appearance, pressure, protein, glucose, chloride ion levels, cell count, and cell classification. Within this subset, 28 patients exhibited normal cerebrospinal fluid results, 2 displayed elevated glucose levels, while 1 exhibited elevated protein levels, and another showed elevated levels of both leukocytes and protein in their cerebrospinal fluid.

Among the 117 patients in the COVID-19-negative group, 98 were diagnosed with febrile convulsions, 4 were diagnosed with CNS infections, and the remaining 15 could not be definitively diagnosed at this time as a consequence of their refusal to be examined. In the COVID-19-negative group, 20 patients underwent lumbar puncture cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination. Among them, one patient exhibited augmented cerebrospinal fluid proteins and leukocytes, while the remaining 19 patients displayed normal CSF results.

Follow-up results

Among the 161 individuals under follow-up, 21 (13.0%) experienced a recurrence of seizures—specifically, 3 presented non-febrile seizures, while 18 exhibited febrile seizures.
