## Question

29 yr old male requesting for sperm count

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to evaluate a 29-year-old man who is requesting a sperm count. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether infertility is being evaluated or if this is a screening request. Then, I should verify the indication for semen analysis and whether a single test suffices. Next, I will review pre-test instructions and collection logistics. After that, I need to check which semen parameters are essential and how to interpret them against current WHO reference ranges. Finally, I should consider when additional testing is warranted, how to counsel on variability and next steps, and whether any special circumstances apply to a 29-year-old without a partner or immediate fertility goals.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. A 29-year-old requesting a "sperm count" could be seeking baseline fertility assessment, screening before vasectomy, or evaluation for infertility with a partner. I need to ask about relationship status, duration of unprotected intercourse, prior pregnancies, and any symptoms such as erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction, because guidelines frame semen analysis within a couple's infertility evaluation rather than as a routine screening test for asymptomatic men without a partner [^d64876bf] [^0d9dea48].

> Wait, let me verify the indication before ordering anything. Semen analysis is indicated when a couple has failed to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, or after 6 months if the female partner is 35 or older, and it is also indicated for specific scenarios like post-vasectomy clearance or pre-treatment fertility preservation. It is not routinely indicated for asymptomatic men without a partner or immediate fertility goals, so I should clarify why he is requesting this test and align it with guideline-based indications [^d64876bf] [^0d9dea48] [^8ae50891].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single semen analysis being enough. I should confirm that at least two semen analyses, ideally separated by about 2–4 weeks, are recommended when assessing male fertility because of substantial within-person variability in sperm concentration, motility, and morphology. A single abnormal result should prompt a repeat before labeling a problem, and even a single normal result does not exclude future abnormalities [^f2ce861d] [^c8ea01b7] [^f4e63e68].

> I need to ensure proper pre-test instructions. The patient should abstain from ejaculation for 2–7 days, avoid lubricants or condoms with spermicide, collect the entire ejaculate by masturbation into a sterile container, and deliver the sample to the lab within about 1 hour of collection. If transport takes longer, I should double-check that the lab can still process it reliably, as delays can impair motility assessment and confound interpretation [^f2ce861d] [^35d6e931].

> Next, I should review which parameters are essential. A complete semen analysis should include volume, sperm concentration, total sperm count, motility categories including progressive motility, vitality, and morphology using strict criteria, with reporting aligned to the most recent WHO manual and, where applicable, ISO 23162:2021 for standardization. I should confirm that the lab uses WHO 6th edition methods to ensure comparability and clinical relevance [^a673f76d] [^8d1eeafb] [^dcd0faa5].

> Let me think about interpretation. I should confirm that results are compared against WHO 6th edition reference intervals derived from fertile men, recognizing that these distributions do not define a binary fertile versus infertile boundary. For example, the fifth percentile for sperm concentration is about 16 million/mL and for total sperm number is about 39 million per ejaculate, but values above these do not guarantee fertility and values below do not guarantee infertility, so counseling must reflect this overlap [^f78ea611] [^662c1a50].

> I should double-check what to do if the first analysis is abnormal. If any parameter is outside the reference range, I should repeat the semen analysis after a similar abstinence interval, and if abnormalities persist, proceed with a focused history and physical examination and targeted labs such as FSH and testosterone to differentiate impaired spermatogenesis from obstruction. I need to ensure I do not over-order advanced tests like sperm DNA fragmentation in the initial workup, as that is not recommended routinely [^d64876bf] [^e4979686] [^057068c9].

> But wait, what if the patient has no partner and just wants to know his baseline? I should counsel that a single normal semen analysis does not ensure future fertility and that results can fluctuate, so routine screening without a clinical indication is not advised. If he proceeds, I should still recommend two analyses for accuracy and explain that any abnormal result would warrant further evaluation rather than reassurance [^f4e63e68] [^662c1a50].

> Let me reconsider any special circumstances. If he is planning vasectomy, I should explain that post-vasectomy semen analysis protocols differ and that clearance is typically based on azoospermia or a very low threshold of nonmotile sperm, not a standard fertility semen analysis. If he is on or considering testosterone therapy, I should emphasize that exogenous testosterone suppresses spermatogenesis and that baseline semen analysis and fertility counseling are essential before treatment [^8ae50891] [^559ee007].

> I will now examine the counseling points I must deliver. I should explain that semen analysis assesses quantity and quality of sperm but does not directly measure fertilizing potential, that results vary between samples, and that lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol, and obesity can affect parameters. I should also note that 1–6% of men evaluated for infertility harbor significant undiagnosed medical pathology, reinforcing the value of a structured evaluation when abnormalities are found [^e0523b94] [^bc925249].

> Next, I should review the practical next steps. If both semen analyses are normal, I can reassure him but remind him that normal results do not guarantee fertility. If abnormalities are present, I should arrange a reproductive history and physical exam focused on genital anatomy, varicocele, and endocrine clues, and consider FSH and testosterone testing to guide whether the pattern reflects spermatogenic failure versus obstruction, with referral to a reproductive urologist as indicated [^d64876bf] [^e4979686].

> In summary, I need to ensure the request is indication-driven, obtain at least two semen analyses with proper collection instructions, interpret results against WHO 6th edition references while counseling on variability and overlap, and escalate to history, exam, and targeted labs if abnormalities persist. For a 29-year-old without a partner or immediate fertility goals, routine screening is not recommended, but if he proceeds, I should still apply best-practice standards for accuracy and counseling [^d64876bf] [^f2ce861d] [^f78ea611].

A 29-year-old male requesting a sperm count should have a **semen analysis** as the first step, with **two samples** (2–7 days abstinence, ≥ 1 month apart) to account for biological variability [^f2ce861d] [^c8ea01b7]. If results are abnormal, repeat testing and a focused history/physical are indicated; if normal, counsel on fertility and lifestyle factors [^d64876bf]. Routine screening without symptoms or a fertility goal is not recommended; testing is guided by clinical context and patient goals [^notfound].

---

## Indications for semen analysis

Semen analysis is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Couple infertility**: Failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse (or 6 months if female partner is ≥ 35 years) [^0d9dea48] [^d64876bf].
- **Personal concern**: Patient-requested assessment of fertility potential.
- **Pre-vasectomy**: Baseline assessment before vasectomy.
- **Post-vasectomy**: Confirm success of vasectomy [^8ae50891].
- **Medical risk factors**: History of cancer, chemotherapy, radiation, or significant medical illness.

---

## Pre-test preparation and collection guidelines

Accurate semen analysis requires adherence to **specific preparation and collection guidelines**:

- **Abstinence**: 2–7 days before collection [^f2ce861d].
- **Collection method**: Masturbation into a sterile container; avoid lubricants or condoms with spermicide.
- **Complete sample**: Collect the entire ejaculate.
- **Timing**: Analyze within 1 hour of collection [^notfound].
- **Repeat testing**: If abnormal, repeat after ≥ 1 month to account for variability [^f4e63e68].

---

## Parameters assessed in semen analysis

Semen analysis evaluates several **key parameters**:

| **Parameter** | **Normal reference range (who 2021)** |
|-|-|
| Semen volume | ≥ 1.4 mL |
| Sperm concentration | ≥ 16 million/mL |
| Total sperm count | ≥ 39 million/ejaculate |
| Progressive motility | ≥ 30% |
| Total motility | ≥ 42% |
| Normal morphology | ≥ 4% |

---

These reference ranges are based on the **fifth percentile** of fertile men and do not strictly define fertility or infertility [^f78ea611].

---

## Interpretation of results

Results are interpreted as **normal (normozoospermia)** or **abnormal**, which may include:

- **Oligozoospermia**: Reduced sperm concentration.
- **Asthenozoospermia**: Reduced motility.
- **Teratozoospermia**: Abnormal morphology.
- **Azoospermia**: No sperm in ejaculate.
- **Aspermia**: No ejaculate.

Abnormal results warrant **repeat testing** and further evaluation to identify underlying causes [^d64876bf].

---

## Clinical significance of abnormal results

Abnormal semen analysis results may indicate:

- **Hormonal disorders**: Hypogonadism, hyperprolactinemia.
- **Genetic abnormalities**: Klinefelter syndrome, Y-chromosome microdeletions.
- **Structural abnormalities**: Varicocele, obstruction.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, alcohol, obesity, environmental exposures.
- **Medical conditions**: Cancer, diabetes, infections.

Further evaluation may include **hormonal testing (FSH, LH, testosterone)**, genetic testing, imaging (scrotal ultrasound), or referral to a reproductive urologist [^66145e49] [^62ecff28].

---

## Counseling and follow-up

Counseling should address:

- **Variability**: Results can vary between samples; repeat testing may be needed [^c8ea01b7].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Weight loss, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, avoiding environmental toxins [^8ad226eb].
- **Fertility options**: Natural conception, assisted reproductive techniques (IUI, IVF, ICSI) [^a73fdae9].
- **Emotional support**: Address anxiety or stress related to fertility concerns.

---

## Limitations of semen analysis

Semen analysis has limitations: it does not assess **sperm function** or **DNA integrity**, and normal results do not guarantee fertility [^e0523b94]. Additional tests (e.g. sperm DNA fragmentation) may be considered in select cases but are not routine [^057068c9].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

For a 29-year-old male requesting a sperm count, obtain a **semen analysis** with two samples (2–7 days abstinence, ≥ 1 month apart) [^f2ce861d]. If results are abnormal, repeat testing and a focused history/physical are indicated; if normal, counsel on fertility and lifestyle factors [^d64876bf]. Routine screening without symptoms or a fertility goal is not recommended; testing is guided by clinical context and patient goals.

A male factor is a contributor in 50% of cases of infertility. Although assisted reproductive techniques can often bypass the need to improve semen parameters, the evaluation of the infertile man remains critical. Current methods for evaluating the infertile man are discussed, beginning with the basic workup that all suspected infertile men should undergo, followed by subsequent evaluation steps. Although the fundamental components of the evaluation have remained consistent, several new tools are available to assist in identifying the underlying etiology. As our understanding of male fertility expands, the technologies available to diagnose and ultimately treat it continue to evolve.

Today's reproductive endocrinology and infertility providers have many tools at their disposal when it comes to achieving pregnancy. In the setting of highly efficacious assisted reproductive technology, it is natural to assume that male factor infertility can be overcome by acquiring sperm and then bypassing the male evaluation. In this review, we go through guideline statements and a stepwise male factor infertility evaluation to propose that a thorough male evaluation remains important to optimize pregnancy and live birth. The foundation of this parallel evaluation is referral to a reproductive urologist for the optimization of the male partner, for advanced diagnostics and interventions, and for the detection of other underlying male pathology. We also discuss what future developments might have an impact on the workup of the infertile male.

AUA/ASRM male infertility guideline — assessment recommendations state that for initial infertility evaluation, both male and female partners should undergo concurrent assessment (Expert Opinion). Initial evaluation of the male for fertility should include a reproductive history (Clinical Principle), and initial evaluation of the male should also include one or more semen analyses (SAs) (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men with one or more abnormal semen parameters or presumed male infertility should be evaluated by a male reproductive expert for complete history and physical examination as well as other directed tests when indicated (Expert Opinion).

Male infertility algorithm — initial evaluation and branching are outlined as follows: One year of failure to conceive if female < 35 years old or if female > 35 years old, 6 months of failure to conceive prompts parallel assessment in which male and female are evaluated in parallel including male reproductive history, with counselling re: post-vasectomy fertility options for post-vasectomy cases. If there is at least one abnormal semen analysis or abnormal male reproductive history, complete male evaluation with history and physical follows; otherwise, primary evaluation/ management of female partner proceeds. Subsequent steps include initial hormonal evaluation (FSH, T), and for azoospermia, to categorize azoospermia with FSH, exam. The algorithm lists options such as genetic testing (karyotype and Y microdeletion), genetic (CF) testing for congenital cases of obstruction, and sperm retrieval or microsurgical reconstruction, and also states to consider diagnostic and therapeutic biopsy if FSH & testicular volume normal but no clinical evidence of obstruction.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^220791b4]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the past 40 years, since the publication of the original WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the laboratory methods used to evaluate semen markedly changed and benefited from improved precision and accuracy, as well as the development of new tests and improved, standardized methodologies. Herein, we present the impact of the changes put forth in the sixth edition together with our views of evolving technologies that may change the methods used for the routine semen analysis, up-and-coming areas for the development of new procedures, and diagnostic approaches that will help to extend the often-descriptive interpretations of several commonly performed semen tests that promise to provide etiologies for the abnormal semen parameters observed. As we look toward the publication of the seventh edition of the manual in approximately 10 years, we describe potential advances that could markedly impact the field of andrology in the future.

### Evolution of the World Health Organization semen analysis manual: where are we? [^662c1a50]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO (World Health Organization) manuals provide state-of-the-art guidance on how a semen analysis should be carried out. The much anticipated sixth edition of the WHO semen analysis manual has been released 10 years after its previous version and includes essential updates, such as new reference standards for semen volume and microscopic sperm characteristics of recent fathers. A well-conducted semen analysis remains an essential foundation of the infertility evaluation process and affects patient referral, diagnosis and treatment. However, a male infertility work-up primarily based on routine semen analysis does not provide men with an optimal fertility pathway; the primary reasons for routine semen analysis inadequacy in this context include its low predictive value for natural and assisted conception success, its inability to detect sperm DNA and epigenetic deficiencies that might negatively affect embryo development, implantation and offspring well-being, and the substantial overlap between semen parameters of fertile and subfertile individuals. Ideally, a full andrological assessment should be carried out by reproductive urologists in all men dealing with couple infertility and should include a detailed history analysis, physical examination, semen analysis, endocrine assessment and other tests as needed. Only through a complete male infertility work-up will relevant underlying medical and infertility conditions be revealed and potentially treated or alleviated. The ultimate goals of a comprehensive andrological assessment are to positively influence overall male health, pregnancy prospects and offspring well-being.

DIALOG: You can discuss this article with its authors and other readers at

With the publication of the 6th edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the advances in the field of andrology to date are evident and reflect over 40 years of technical refinement of the routine semen analysis that improved the precision and accuracy of the procedure as well as the addition of new tests to evaluate semen characteristics or sperm function together with the removal of tests that are no longer widely employed (e.g. the postcoital cervical mucus penetration test). In this article, we look toward the future and discuss some of the impacts of this work to date, the emerging areas for the development of new procedures, as well as a glimpse of the future and thoughts about where the field will be headed over the next 10 years of the publication of this manual and its new editions to come.

### Postmortem sperm retrieval: the effect of instituting guidelines [^49890baf]. The Journal of Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

Postmortem sperm retrieval (PMSR) raises serious medical and ethical concerns. In this study we report the effect of intra-institutional guidelines developed for the permissibility of the procedure on the number of procurement procedures performed.

Materials and Methods

The family members of 22 men who died suddenly sought PMSR. We performed an institutional review board approved chart review of the requests for PMSR from 1994 to 2002. A set of guidelines addressing PMSR was developed by a panel of experts at our institution. Key elements included 1) evidence of intended paternity for the deceased man, 2) next of kin/legal consent (i.e. only the wife can give consent for PMSR), 3) the death was sudden (permitting retrieval less than 24 hours post mortem) and 4) consent to a 1-year waiting period for bereavement and assessment of recipient.

Results

Of the 22 families who sought PMSR 18 were not candidates for retrieval based on the criteria established by the guidelines. Four men 29 to 36 years old underwent PMSR after death and maintained on a respiratory (2) or within the first 24 hours after death (2). Procedures performed included vasal aspiration in 3 patients and epididymal/testicular retrieval in 1. Average specimen volume (including medium) was 2.1 cc, the average number of vials cryopreserved per patient was 3, sperm count was 17.6 million per mL and motility was 8.7%. All specimens demonstrated post-thaw motility. Only 1 wife used retrieved sperm for an in vitro fertilization cycle, and no pregnancy was obtained.

Conclusions

The exclusionary guidelines presented provide a framework utilized at 1 institution for consideration of requests for PMSR and dramatically decreased the number of postmortem sperm retrievals performed.

### Are WHO recommendations to perform 2 consecutive semen analyses for reliable diagnosis of male infertility still valid? [^c8ea01b7]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

We evaluated whether a second semen analysis as suggested by the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination of Human Semen and Sperm-Cervical Mucus Interaction would improve diagnostic reliability in the evaluation of male infertility.

Materials and Methods

We analyzed a total of 5,132 semen samples from 2,566 men who underwent at least 2 consecutive semen analyses at a university fertility center. Reproducibility and correlation between the first and second analyses were evaluated for sperm concentration, motility and morphology according to the WHO criteria as well as the total motile sperm count.

Results

Altogether 51.2% of the second analyses confirmed the initial findings according to WHO criteria and 60% confirmed them when applying total motile sperm count criteria. After finding normozoospermia on the initial analysis 27% of the second semen analyses were pathological. Following a first pathological semen analysis 23% of the second analyses were normal and 77% were pathological. The coefficient of variation ranged from 0.23 to 0.60. The Spearman correlation coefficient was high for sperm concentration (r s = 0.84) and normal morphology (r s = 0.80) but lower for progressive motility (r s = 0.57). The discriminating capacity of each semen parameter to distinguish between men with a normal vs a pathological second semen analysis was rather limited (ROC AUC 0.72 to 0.79).

Conclusions

In accordance with WHO recommendations 2 consecutive semen analysis should be performed.

### Limitations of semen analysis as a test of male fertility and anticipated needs from newer tests [^35c4204d]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Semen analysis is the first step to identify male factor infertility. Standardized methods of semen analysis are available allowing accurate assessment of sperm quality and comparison among laboratories. Population-based reference ranges are available for standard semen and sperm parameters. Sperm numbers and morphology are associated with time to natural pregnancy, whereas sperm motility may be less predictive. Routine semen analysis does not measure the fertilizing potential of spermatozoa and the complex changes that occur in the female reproductive tract before fertilization. Whether assisted reproduction technology (ART) is required depends not only on male factors but female fecundity. Newer tests should predict the success of fertilization in vitro and the outcome of the progeny.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^a673f76d]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The launch of the sixth edition in 2021

On July 20, 2021, the WHO launched the sixth edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen through a webinar. In the press release, the WHO states "High-quality laboratory services are crucial for ensuring the value of research on health. Effective analysis and comparison of results across laboratories help to ensure that health care workers receive high-quality information, which in turn helps them to provide the best quality care. The sixth edition of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen replaces the 2010 version. It provides important information on semen examination and preparation for clinical evaluation, assessment, cryopreservation, quality control in the semen analysis laboratory, and laboratory examination in the investigation of male sexual and reproductive health".

Retaining the stated goals of the manual articulated with its first launch in 1980, this newest edition provides step-by-step, easy-to-follow procedures for technicians and scientists performing semen analyses. Consistent with previous editions, the sixth edition includes basic examination, semen volume, sperm motility, concentration, morphology, and vitality assessments as well as estimation of sperm numbers in samples with very low sperm concentration. Extended semen examination includes procedures to detect leucocytes, immature germ cells, sperm antibodies, indices of multiple sperm defects, and biochemical assessment and introduces methods to detect sperm aneuploidy, sperm genetics, and DNA fragmentation. Advanced examination replaced the prior research tests with extensive revisions and includes assessment of reactive oxygen species, membrane ion channels (new), acrosome reactions, and computer-assisted sperm analysis. Emerging new methods were briefly described, including tracking individual sperm cell motility and flagellar waveforms that may provide more information on the energetics of sperm movement. Continued improvement in digital camera technology in smartphones raises the possibility of initial semen assessment without a microscope. The zona-free hamster oocyte penetration test and human zona pellucida binding test are removed as these tests are rarely used in the laboratory because of difficulty in obtaining the test materials, lack of standardization, high labor intensity, and high cost. In addition, the availability of intracytoplasmic injection of sperm directly into oocytes eliminated the necessity of these tests. Chapters on sperm preparation and cryopreservation and internal and external quality control methods have been updated. The chapter on sperm interaction with cervical mucus has been eliminated, as the procedure is no longer being routinely performed as part of infertility investigation.

### Diagnosis and treatment of infertility in men: AUA / ASRM guideline part I [^12f9620e]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

AUA/ASRM male infertility guideline — scope, methods, and outputs are outlined: The guideline describes appropriate evaluation of the male partner in an infertile couple, including history and physical examination and diagnostic tests when indicated. The guideline team searched PubMed, Embase, and Medline from 2000 to 2019 and, when sufficient evidence existed, graded the evidence A, B, or C to support strong, moderate, or conditional recommendations; when evidence was insufficient, information was provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions. The document provides updated, evidence-based recommendations on evaluation and on associations between male infertility and other important health conditions, and the evaluation and treatment recommendations are summarized in an associated algorithm. The summary is published simultaneously in Fertility and Sterility and The Journal of Urology.

### The association of gut microbiota and spermatogenic dysfunction… [^3e10b1c8]. ClinicalTrials (2022). Medium credibility.

The Association of Gut Microbiota and Spermatogenic DysfunctionClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Infertility is a global issue that affects as much as 10%-15% of couples. Approximately half of infertility can be attributed to men. Recently, a worldwide accelerated decline in sperm counts was reported. And the gut microbiome modulates many physiological functions and diseases, including host immunity, metabolic diseases, neuropsychiatric disorders, and so on. Recent publications demonstrate the links between intestinal microbiota and sperm production in fat animals and a few patients. And systemic clinical research would be necessary to explore the human microbiota and males with fertility disorders. The primary objective of the study is to determine the links between the gut microbiome and sperm quality utilizing microbiome and metabolomics. Stool, blood, and urine will be collected when a patient completes basic semen analysis and informed consent is signed.

Microbiome and metabolomics will be compared among aspermia, oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia, teratozoospermia, and normal individuals. Other: no intervention

### Contemporary concepts in the evaluation and management of male infertility [^ee4dd20d]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2011). Medium credibility.

Infertility in men is a common condition. At the core of the medical evaluation of the male partner in a couple who are unable to conceive is the history and physical examination. Special attention should be directed to the patient's developmental history and any use of testosterone products. The physical examination focuses on the genitals, and includes assessments of the size and consistency of the testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, and presence of varicoceles. Although many sophisticated tests are available, semen analysis is still the most important diagnostic tool used to assess fertility, and includes parameters such as sperm count, motility and viability. Treatment of male factor infertility can involve targeted agents, in the case of specific conditions such as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, or it can be empirical-using medical therapy or assisted conception techniques-for patients in whom no underlying cause has been identified. Although an all-encompassing treatment for male factor infertility has not yet been developed, the field offers many promising avenues of research.

### Can semen parameters predict pregnancy outcomes? [^e0523b94]. Fertility and Sterility (2023). Medium credibility.

Semen analysis is an integral component of the evaluation and management of men with infertility. Although it is important for patient counseling and clinical decision making, a conventional semen analysis cannot reliably predict the chance of pregnancy or differentiate fertile vs. infertile men (except in the most extreme cases). Advanced, nonstandard sperm functional tests may provide additional discriminatory and prognostic power; however, further research is needed to determine how to best incorporate these tests into modern clinical practice. Therefore, the primary applications of a conventional semen analysis should be to judge the severity of infertility, estimate the effects of future therapy, and measure the response to current therapy.

ART SELECTION

Evaluation for infertility is generally not recommended until a couple has attempted 12 months of frequent, unprotected intercourse without conceiving, unless the female partner is greater than 35 years of age, in which case evaluation after 6 months is recommended. A medical history and physical examination are initially performed for both the male and the female partner.

The evaluation of male fertility includes sexual history and a semen analysis. Personal history may include symptoms suggestive of erectile or ejaculatory dysfunction. Semen analysis is initially evaluated for quantity, morphology, and motility of sperm. If abnormal, additional testing is done to identify causes which may include structural and functional sperm abnormalities. Treatment options vary depending on the cause, including surgical correction of structural abnormalities. Sperm retrieval techniques can also be performed.

For male infertility, ICSI is often the first choice. While ICSI has also been used for non‐male factor infertility, there is ongoing debate about its use in this clinical situation. Although earlier reports described a higher prevalence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities, a recent systematic review and meta‐analysis with only weak evidence did not support this finding.

The evaluation of female infertility is more complex. Because the most common cause of female infertility is ovulatory dysfunction, ovulation is initially confirmed. If ovulation is confirmed, the next step is to evaluate for structural anomalies of the uterine and tubal anatomy using ultrasound and/or a hysterosalpingogram. The evaluation for anovulation includes hormonal evaluation. More invasive testing is available for females with specific symptoms. Even after this comprehensive work‐up, at times an underlying cause for either male or female infertility is not identified.

Depending on the cause identified, ART may be the treatment of choice. ART for female infertility typically involves IVF. Before trying IVF, intrauterine insemination can be attempted for females under 40 years of age. Treatment selection also depends on factors such as success of treatments, age of patient, cost, and risk of genetic disease. Currently IVF is done in approximately one‐third of ART cycles and ISCI in two‐thirds. Couples who have unsuccessful outcomes with IVF can consider oocyte donation. If a parent is at high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder, PGT, donor insemination, and/or oocyte donation can be considered.

### Post-vasectomy semen analysis: what is the best protocol? [^8ae50891]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy is a safe, quick, and highly effective form of permanent sterilization. However, vasectomy does not render patients sterile immediately, and they must continue to use alternate forms of contraception until cleared by a post-vasectomy semen analysis (PVSA). Historically, the criteria for post-vasectomy clearance have varied widely amongst providers, with most physicians requiring azoospermia in order to consider vasectomy a success. The 2012 American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines expanded the definition of post-vasectomy clearance to include ≤ 100,000 non-motile sperm (NMS). This has decreased the need for subsequent semen analyses and increased initial clearance rates. Despite this, patient compliance with PVSA has been poor, which has led to research focused on factors associated with compliance and interventions to enhance PVSA completion. There are many factors that affect patient compliance. Mail-in and at-home PVSA have the potential to increase compliance due to inherent convenience and less patient embarrassment. While no currently at-home test fulfills the AUA guidelines on post-vasectomy clearance, mail-in testing can be utilized to clear patients on the basis of azoospermia alone. Future research should focus on continued strategies to enhance PVSA compliance as well as explore patient preferences and alternative options.

### Approach to evaluation and management of male infertility in sub-saharan Africa [^04771798]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of infertility among couples globally is estimated at 15%. Male factor infertility contributes to 20%-70% of the cases depending on the specific region of the world. Male infertility accounts for up to 22.26% of cases in Africa. Causes are generally categorized as pre-testicular, testicular, or post-testicular, based on the level of dysfunction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Primary testicular failure is caused by intrinsic testicular dysfunction, while secondary testicular failure originates from a dysfunction in the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland. Post-testicular causes are attributed to obstructive, ejaculatory, or erectile dysfunction. Evaluation should thus entail a full history followed by a detailed physical exam and stepwise investigation. Semen analysis is recommended as the initial test, followed by hormonal tests, imaging, biopsies, and karyotyping as needed. Treatment is tailored based on the specific cause identified.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^351e9cf0]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Paradigm shift in the pathway for investigations and diagnosis of male factor infertility

Semen analysis, along with physical examination and history, is the cornerstone in the diagnosis of male factor infertility. Currently, the analysis needs to be performed in a laboratory. However, in the 6th edition, there is a discussion on emerging technologies (Chapter 4.6 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen), which may widen the availability of semen analysis into the community. One aspect identified was the potential use of home assays for the assessment of sperm motility. With the recent implementation of widespread telemedicine for several types of clinical office visits, it is not surprising that home assays for a variety of clinical diagnostic tests would be created. At-home testing in andrology has a long history, and several new tests that assess sperm motility and/or concentration were recently launched. A number of kits commercially available today have yet to be rigorously evaluated in large-scale trials, including comprehensive comparisons with standardized laboratory methods, so their current clinical value in diagnosis is limited. However, technology is rapidly evolving, and as the assays improve, it is very likely that men assessing their own samples (providing robust and acceptable diagnostic information) will be a reality in the next 5 years. Therefore, patients will have a pivotal role to play in their own health management as witnessed in several other arenas, for example, blood glucose levels for diabetes and retinal imaging. Once the technologies are demonstrated to be accurate and precise, there is a need to determine the role these assays play in the patient diagnostic pathway, for example, are they additional, complementary, or replacement tests, and can they be used to triage patients? The tests may be cheaper and easier to use than traveling to andrology laboratories for semen analysis. They can be used in large-population–based studies of lifestyle changes or potential environmental exposures and may help to identify infertility in men. Certainly, these at-home or mail-in test kits could be particularly important for those living in rural or underdeveloped areas lacking sufficient healthcare, and at the very least, they may provide the patient with some data on their semen parameters pointing to the need for a clinical evaluation and diagnostic semen analysis if abnormalities are present. If positive answers are forthcoming, this will significantly increase effectiveness and patient satisfaction. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has indicted that we can do more at-home testing to manage our healthcare than previously recognized.

### Progressive depletion of germ cells in a man with nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome: optimal time for sperm recovery [^1a3aae98]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

We describe a sequential deteriorated change of sperm count in a 30-year-old infertile man with nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome. His initial semen analysis revealed oligozoospermia; however, the sperm count decreased progressively, which resulted in azoospermia over a period of 3 years. By testicular sperm extraction, a few spermatozoa were recovered. We analyzed the germ cells with three-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the presence of a 46, XY lineage was found. We suggest that progressive depletion of germ cells might occur in men with nonmosaic Klinefelter's syndrome and that these men should undergo semen cryopreservation or sperm recovery as early as possible.

### Semen parameter variability among users of at-home sperm testing kits [^f4e63e68]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Semen analysis remains the single most important modality in the initial clinical evaluation of men's reproductive health. Despite the generally accepted World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on this procedure, an individual's results can display significant variation when performed across time or in different laboratories. Semen parameters are in fact highly variable measures that can differ significantly between various analyses; for this reason, a single semen study should not be used alone in assessing fertility status. The American Urological Association (AUA)/the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of male infertility recommend performing at least two semen analyses, ideally spaced at least one month apart, especially in cases when the first semen analysis revealed abnormal parameters.

Previous studies have focused much attention on the intra-subject variation of semen parameters. Brooks A. Keel enrolled 74 patients with infertility and 65 healthy donors who provided 479 and 2043 semen samples, respectively, and demonstrated substantial intraindividual variability among semen parameters, particularly sperm count. Moreover, intraclass correlations demonstrated that a minimum of three semen analyses should be performed prior to making the diagnosis of infertility. Similarly, Blickenstorfer et al. support the need for at least two semen analyses in male fertility assessment. The authors analyzed 5132 semen samples from 2566 men and demonstrated that only 51.2% of cases in the second analysis confirmed the initial results. Mallidis et al. investigated 673 semen samples obtained from seven healthy men over a seven-year period and revealed noticeable within-subject variations in sperm concentration, ejaculate volume, and motility index.

Genetic testing and semen analysis recommendations — targeted applications are specified: Clinicians should recommend Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation carrier testing (including assessment of the 5T allele) in men with vasal agenesis or idiopathic obstructive azoospermia, and for men who harbor a CFTR mutation, genetic evaluation of the female partner should be recommended. Sperm DNA fragmentation analysis is not recommended in the initial evaluation of the infertile couple (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Men with increased round cells on SA (> 1million/mL) should be evaluated further to differentiate white blood cells (pyospermia) from germ cells.

### Infertility workup for the women's health specialist: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 781 [^04964756]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Infertility, defined as failure to achieve pregnancy within 12 months of unprotected intercourse or therapeutic donor insemination in women younger than 35 years or within 6 months in women older than 35 years, affects up to 15% of couples. An infertility evaluation may be offered to any patient who by definition has infertility or is at high risk of infertility. Women older than 35 years should receive an expedited evaluation and undergo treatment after 6 months of failed attempts to become pregnant or earlier, if clinically indicated. In women older than 40 years, more immediate evaluation and treatment are warranted. If a woman has a condition known to cause infertility, the obstetrician-gynecologist should offer immediate evaluation. Essential components of an initial workup include a review of the medical history, physical examination, and additional tests as indicated. For the female partner, tests will focus on ovarian reserve, ovulatory function, and structural abnormalities. Imaging of the reproductive organs provides valuable information on conditions that affect fertility. Imaging modalities can detect tubal patency and pelvic pathology and assess ovarian reserve. Male factor is a cause of infertility in 40–50% of couples. Given the high prevalence of male factor in infertile heterosexual couples, a basic medical history and evaluation of the male partner are warranted from the outset. A women's health specialist may reasonably obtain the male partner's medical history and order the semen analysis. It is also reasonable to refer all male infertility patients to a specialist with expertise in male reproductive medicine. Unexplained infertility may be diagnosed in as many as 30% of infertile couples. At a minimum, these patients should have evidence of ovulation, tubal patency, and a normal semen analysis.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^6d60ca73]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Another aspect to improving standards in basic semen analysis is the very recent development of a formal International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard (23162:2021) for Basic Semen Examination. This is the first time that this has been achieved. The ISO standards are based on the same principles as the sixth edition of the manual and specify the minimum requirements for equipment and critical aspects of methods for best practice. Adoption of these standards will support laboratories seeking accreditation. Moreover, because ISO is applicable through the world, adherence to this standard is likely to be manifested in an overall improvement in quality of semen assessment globally.

The reproducibility of scientific data is, of course, not a unique problem for andrology. Several tools suggested to address these challenges include the provision of robust materials and methods and checklist for publication in journals, for example, STAR methods in Cell Press journals. In andrology, we now have clear robust methods, and with new educational methods to use for staff training, we can look forward to a world where a robust semen analysis is the norm.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^f78ea611]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

In the second, third, and fourth editions of the WHO manual, the consensus-based lower limits of semen variables were presented. At that time, population-based studies from men who have achieved conception within the prior 12 months were not available. The fifth edition reported WHO reference ranges in 2010 based on men whose partners achieved pregnancy within 12 months of trying to conceive. In the sixth edition, data from new publications from more diverse populations were amalgamated to the 2010 data; the results from approximately 3,500 fertile men from 12 countries in five continents validated and expanded the distribution of semen variables in the fifth edition. It was emphasized again that these distribution data with the fifth centile as the lower reference range do not define limits between fertile and subfertile men. There is a substantial overlap of semen evaluation between fertile and subfertile men, and there are no distinct boundaries between fertile vs. infertile men. The clinician may explain to the infertile couple that with the use of the distribution of semen variables in fertile men, for instance, the man's sperm concentration/total number in the ejaculate is lower than 5% of fertile men (fifth centile sperm concentration < 16 × 10⁶/ml or total sperm number < 39 × 10⁶/ejaculate) and then based on clinical assessment discuss the options of further investigation or treatment.

Purpose

The summary presented herein represents Part I of the two-part series dedicated to the Diagnosis and Treatment of Infertility in Men: AUA/ASRM Guideline. Part I outlines the appropriate evaluation of the male in an infertile couple. Recommendations proceed from obtaining an appropriate history and physical exam (Appendix I), as well as diagnostic testing, where indicated.

Materials/Methods

The Emergency Care Research Institute Evidence-based Practice Center team searched PubMed®, Embase®, and Medline from January, 2000 through May, 2019. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions (table 1[Table: see text]). This summary is being simultaneously published in Fertility and Sterility and The Journal of Urology.

Results

This Guideline provides updated, evidence-based recommendations regarding evaluation of male infertility as well as the association of male infertility with other important health conditions. The detection of male infertility increases the risk of subsequent development of health problems for men. In addition, specific medical conditions are associated with some causes for male infertility. Evaluation and treatment recommendations are summarized in the associated algorithm (figure[Figure: see text]).

Conclusion

The presence of male infertility is crucial to the health of patients and its effects must be considered for the welfare of society. This document will undergo updating as the knowledge regarding current treatments and future treatment options continues to expand.

The success of a comprehensive office-based evaluation of male-factor infertility depends on the physician's thorough understanding of risk assessment in the history, identification of pertinent physical examination findings, and correct assessment of laboratory data. Office-based ultrasonographic techniques have already increased the urologist's ability to visualize suspected anatomic abnormalities, and the use of functional tests of sperm has given greater depth to the limited, but essential, prognostic capabilities of the routine semen analysis.

Male partner evaluation — failed ART cycles or recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) and semen analysis (SA): In couples with failed ART cycles or recurrent pregnancy losses (RPL) (two or more losses), evaluation of the male should be considered (Expert Opinion). Maternal age is the strongest predictor of fertility outcome for couples, and semen parameter values falling above or below the lower limit do not by themselves predict either fertility or infertility, so at least two SAs, ideally obtained at least one month apart, are important to obtain, especially if the first SA has abnormal parameters. In addition to treatment benefits, 1–6% of men evaluated for infertility have significant undiagnosed medical pathology including malignancies even when they have so-called "normal" SAs.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^dbdef8c1]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The manual in the final form can be downloaded using this URL: It is anticipated that this edition of the manual will be a widely used teaching guide for semen analyses workshops and andrology training programs, for both basic and more advanced methods, adapting to the virtual meeting format that gained wide acceptance in the past year. Continued improvement in virtual meeting systems with a hands-on demonstration by the trainer followed by each course participant showing step-by-step procedures back to the trainer to allow guidance and further instructions. This may allow the training of clinicians, scientists, laboratory staff, and students to learn and adopt the standardized methods, which is the goal of the semen manual. However, it is essential to provide in-house performance training following the virtual sessions. Unlike the prior manuals, the sixth edition described only one recommended method of assessment of semen volume, sperm concentration, motility, and morphology which simplifies the recommended procedures for laboratories. The challenge is to implement external quality control to ascertain that the methods recommended by the WHO laboratory manual are implemented by laboratories to achieve standardization and reproducibility of results across laboratories around the globe. A further support to the global standardization is the recently published ISO standard (International Standards Organization; ISO 23162:2021 Basic semen examination — Specification and test methods, 2021, ISO, Geneva) based on the same principles and evidence base as the sixth edition.

Evaluation of Studies of Semen Parameters Background Information Semen analysis provides information on various factors that can affect male fertility. When a couple experiences difficulty getting pregnant, male factor issues. The current World Health Organization 2010 reference values are based on the 5th percentile values from samples of fertile men.

1. Outcome Ascertainment Key issues to consider in evaluating the assessment of semen parameters involve sample collection and sample analysis. Considerable within-person variability exists in sperm parameters.

At least two semen samples are recommended for characterizing an individual in a clinical setting. Multiple samples also would be considered "ideal" for epidemiological studies; however due to feasibility concerns, a single sample typically is used to characterize exposure effects on a population level. Abstinence for at least 2 days and no more than 7 days is recommended; an ideal study will provide such details and collect data that enable examination of the effect of variation in abstinence time on the results. The core parameters included in a review of semen studies are semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, and sperm morphology.

Computer-assisted semen analyses and the Sperm Quality Analyzer-Vision yield results that are similar to results obtained with the manual method for all semen parameters except morphology; programming a computer to recognize shape is difficult, and manual methods are preferred for assessing morphology [see Supplemental Material for comparison of methods data from Lammers et al. While all of the cell divisions that produce mature sperm occur after puberty, a man's own environment in utero could impact his sperm production. Thus, exposure measures that reflect the timing when the semen sample is collected correspond to a relevant exposure period. Other exposure periods also might be relevant.

### IVF versus ICSI in patients without severe male factor infertility: a randomized clinical trial [^2096d96b]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Amendments

In March 2020, an amendment was made to remove the following two inclusion criteria: (1) regular menstrual cycles (21–35 days) and (2) a diagnostic sperm sample from the male partner with ≥ 4% morphologically normal spermatozoa. A subsequent amendment in September 2020 eliminated the requirement for a minimum of 5 million progressive motile spermatozoa in a purified diagnostic sperm sample, originally chosen to account for the timing of randomization after the ovulation trigger. This margin, from 5 million in the diagnostic sample to 2 million on the day of retrieval, aimed to minimize the number of participants requiring ICSI irrespective of their allocated group. The new criterion focused on a sperm sample, purified on the day of oocyte retrieval, expected to contain at least 2 million progressive motile spermatozoa. This change was implemented to adopt a more clinically practical approach, allowing for the inclusion of all patients expected to have at least 2 million progressive motile spermatozoa on the day of oocyte retrieval. A comprehensive overview of the amendments can be found in Supplementary Table 10.

Statistical analysis

The study was designed as a superiority trial with 80% power and a 5% significance level for a two-sided test, aiming to detect a 10% point difference in CLBR. The expected rate of first live births after the transfer of all available embryos from the initial oocyte retrieval was set at 45% in the c-IVF group and 55% in the ICSI group. This rate was based on data from the general population treated across the participating clinics, reflecting a diverse patient population. The estimated sample size was 824 patients, with primary analysis conducted using an ITT approach. Cumulative live birth from the initiated first cycle until the end of the study (12 months after randomization of the last participant) was calculated, and the live birth rate after the first embryo transfer between groups was compared using risk ratio and risk difference, with corresponding 95% CIs. Secondary analyses included a per-protocol analysis and analyses examining the impact of treatment across various factors, including maternal age, IVF indications, trial centers, ovarian response, AMH, sperm morphology and normal sperm parameters (lower reference levels for semen volume, total sperm number, sperm concentration and total motility (World Health Organization (WHO) sixth edition)). All secondary analyses, except for the per-protocol analysis, were defined postdata collection as outlined in the statistical analysis plan.

All statistical analysis was done using R (v4.2.2), using the packages sjPlot (v2.8.15) and marginal effects (v0.18.0).

### Infertility: evaluation and management [^8ad226eb]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Infertility is the inability to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months of regular, unprotected sexual intercourse. Evaluation and treatment are recommended earlier than 12 months when risk factors for infertility exist, if the female partner is 35 years or older, and in the setting of nonheterosexual partnerships. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination emphasizing the thyroid, breast, and pelvic areas should be performed to help direct diagnosis and treatment. Causes of infertility in females include uterine and tubal factors, ovarian reserve, ovulatory dysfunction, obesity, and hormone-related disorders. Common male factor infertility issues include abnormal semen, hormonal disorders, and genetic abnormalities. Semen analysis is recommended for the initial assessment of the male partner. Evaluation of the female should include assessment of the uterus and fallopian tubes with ultrasonography or hysterosalpingography when indicated. Laparoscopy, hysteroscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to evaluate for endometriosis, leiomyomas, or evidence of a previous pelvic infection. Treatment with ovulation induction agents, intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, donor sperm or eggs, or surgery may be necessary. Unexplained male and female infertility can be treated with intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization. Limiting alcohol intake, avoiding tobacco and illicit drug use, consuming a profertility diet, and losing weight (if obese) may improve pregnancy success rates.

History and physical examination — The initial infertility appointment should have sufficient time to obtain a comprehensive medical, reproductive, and family history and to perform an appropriate physical examination. The infertility physical examination should be targeted to detect pathology that specifically impacts fertility or reproductive potential, and a complete physical or gynecologic evaluation for every patient presenting for a fertility evaluation is not required.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^bcd07cad]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approaches will be improved: basic semen analysis will be standardized and thus the results comparable throughout the world

A plethora of data, including that from well-established Andrology External Quality Assurance schemes, independent of country of origin, demonstrate that there is considerable variability in the results of the basic semen analysis. There are several reasons for this, for example, lack of adherence to established methods, poor training, and/or the use of a variety of methods to perform the analysis. This variability has significant clinical ramifications because a semen analysis result in 1 laboratory may not be comparable to that in another. Moreover, it can make comparisons between data sets difficult. Although these issues are well documented and have been a continual source of concern, these challenges remain.

A focus of the 6th edition is to provide clear and standardized methods that focus among others on the basic analysis (Chapter 2 of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen). Providing simplified methods obviates a primary difficulty in performing high-quality semen analysis and helps address the reproducibility crisis that has beset semen analysis for a number of years. Moreover, because the basic techniques described are robust and easy to follow, it is anticipated that this will facilitate higher-quality training. However, on their own, simplified methods will not be sufficient. If, in the next 5–10 years, we are to achieve comparable results from semen analysis from different laboratories, complementary tactics need to be actioned.

### Limits of current male fertility testing [^7f67125a]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

In the current approach to male fertility testing, basic semen analysis has limitations as a predictor of fertility status, and the technology is fraught with variability. Nonetheless, it remains the cornerstone of the evaluation of the male infertility, and we recommend adherence to most recent World Health Organization guidelines. Although the current sperm function tests (bioassays) have important drawbacks, they are still valuable as research tools. Sperm quality assays with analysis of sperm DNA fragmentation need further investigation before they can be recommended for routine clinical use. The answer to the many current challenging questions relies on identifying spermatogenesis pathologies and the resulting sperm dysfunctions at the cellular and molecular levels. New discoveries may bring answers or new avenues to explore.

### A histomorphometric and cytogenetic study of testis from men 29–102 years old [^08bc9f8e]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the influence of aging on testicular histology and the aneuploidy rate in testis postmeiotic cells.

Design

Comparison between older men and younger men.

Setting

Deceased donors and patients who requested assisted reproductive technology (ART).

Patient(S)

Thirty-six older men (61–102 years old) and 10 younger men (29–40 years old).

Intervention(S)

Testes were obtained from 35 deceased donors, and testicular biopsies were obtained from 11 patients who requested ART.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Histomorphometry of testis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with a three-probe set X, Y, and 18.

Result(S)

The histomorphometric study showed a thickening of the basal membrane when spermatogenesis was arrested. The number of germinal and Sertoli cells decreased as age increased. The rate of aneuploidy of postmeiotic cells was 1.1% for the control group, 1.29% for older subjects with preserved spermatogenesis, and 14.28% for the subjects with an arrested spermiogenesis. Only this last figure was higher than the control group.

Conclusion(S)

The rate of aneuploidy in older subjects (61–95 years old) with preserved spermatogenesis was not statistically different from that found in the control group; it was increased in older subjects with arrested spermatogenesis.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^cc28960b]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

As stated clearly in all editions of the WHO Laboratory Manual for the Examination and Processing of Human Semen, the goal of the manual is to meet the growing needs for the standardization of semen analysis procedures. With constant advances in andrology and reproductive medicine and the advent of sophisticated assisted reproductive technologies for the treatment of infertility, the manual has been continuously updated to meet the need for new, evidence-based, validated tests to not only measure semen and sperm variables but also to provide a functional assessment of spermatozoa. The sixth edition of the WHO manual, launched in 2021, can be freely downloaded from the WHO website, with the hope of gaining wide acceptance and utilization as the essential source of the latest, evidence-based information for laboratory procedures required for the assessment of male reproductive function and health.

AUA/ASRM guideline — sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) testing and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL): Sperm DNA fragmentation may adversely affect the outcome of ART treatments as well as attempts at natural fertility, including an increased miscarriage rate, but because there are no prospective studies directly evaluating its impact on clinical management, this assay should not be routinely performed in the initial evaluation of the infertile male. Some causes of abnormal sperm DNA fragmentation (such as anti-depressant use or genitourinary infection) are easily reversible, and others may be managed by use of testicular sperm in selected cases; clinicians should also discuss paternal structural autosomal defects and karyotype analysis in couples with RPL, and given the increased risk of miscarriage for men with abnormal sperm DNA fragmentation, testing for sperm DNA fragmentation is also indicated for males in couples with RPL.

### Evaluation of the subfertile man [^6638e7a8]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Infertility affects 15 percent of couples, and 50 percent of male infertility is potentially correctable. Evaluation of the subfertile man requires a complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory studies. The main purpose of the male evaluation is to identify and treat correctable causes of subfertility. In addition, many men seek an explanation for their condition, which can be discovered during their evaluation. Furthermore, the male fertility evaluation can uncover significant medical and genetic pathology that could affect the patient's health or that of his offspring. Although pregnancies can be achieved without any evaluation other than a semen analysis, this test alone is insufficient to adequately evaluate the male patient. Treatment of correctable male-factor pathology is cost effective, does not increase the risk of multiple births, and can spare the woman invasive procedures and potential complications associated with assisted reproductive technologies. Appropriate evaluation and treatment of the subfertile man are critical in delivering suitable care to the infertile couple.

Diagnosis/assessment/evaluation — testing and interpretation: The results from SA should be used to guide management of the patient, and results are of greatest clinical significance when multiple SA abnormalities are present (Expert Opinion). Clinicians should obtain hormonal evaluation including follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone for infertile men with impaired libido, erectile dysfunction, oligozoospermia or azoospermia, atrophic testes, or evidence of hormonal abnormality on physical evaluation (Expert Opinion). Azoospermic men should be clinically evaluated to differentiate genital tract obstruction from impaired sperm production initially based on semen volume, physical exam, and FSH levels (Expert Opinion). Karyotype and Y-chromosome microdeletion analysis should be recommended for men with primary infertility and azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (< 5 million sperm/mL) with elevated FSH or testicular atrophy or a presumed diagnosis of impaired sperm production as the cause of azoospermia (Expert Opinion).

### SNMMI procedure standard / EANM practice guideline for nuclear medicine evaluation and therapy of differentiated thyroid cancer: abbreviated version [^f343ef10]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). High credibility.

SNMMI/EANM differentiated thyroid cancer — male fertility effects and sperm preservation with 131I therapy: Fertility is generally unaffected in young women, but male fertility may be seriously reduced, especially at activities in excess of 3.74–5.6 GBq (100–150 mCi); sperm counts decreased by 3 months after 131I activity of 3.7 GBq (100 mCi), returning to normal by 13 months. Multiple courses raise the risk of oligospermia up to 50%, and sperm DNA fragmentation persisted up to 28 months following a second 131I therapy; after multiple therapeutic 131I administrations the number of normokinetic sperm showed a consistent reduction. Based on this data it is recommended that for patients considered for high 131I therapeutic activities ≥ 7.4 GBq (≥ 200 mCi) and who anticipate fertility, sperm storage should be considered before 131I therapy; if sperm analysis returns to normal after 1 year of 131I therapy, then the specimen is discarded, and if multiple 131I therapies are required, sperm storage for males desiring fertility should be offered, at least before the second 131I therapy. Aggressive hydration for several days following 131I therapy (> 4 L [1 Gal] daily fluid intake) is recommended for diluting excreted 131I in a large volume of urine and increasing urination frequency, with the goal of reducing scattered radiation from the bladder to adjacent gonads.

### Evaluation and management of testosterone deficiency: AUA guideline [^a6ba5236]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Medium credibility.

Testosterone deficiency — men desiring fertility: Men who are interested in fertility should have a reproductive health evaluation performed prior to treatment (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Men interested in preserving fertility should undergo testicular exam to evaluate testicular size, consistency, and descent and have serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measured to assess reproductive status. Elevated FSH levels in the setting of testosterone deficiency indicate impaired spermatogenesis and clinicians should consider fertility testing, such as semen analysis. Men with severe oligospermia (sperm concentration < 5 million per mL) or non-obstructive azoospermia should be offered reproductive genetics testing consisting of karyotype testing and Y-chromosome analysis for microdeletions, and the management of such patients is best conducted by a reproductive urologist.

### The sixth edition of the WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen: ensuring quality and standardization in basic examination of human ejaculates [^8d1eeafb]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

A basic semen investigation has established principles that are necessary for ascertaining reliable and internationally comparable results. Although these principles have been present in the WHO manual since its inception, the baseline issue across most published studies and practice in reproductive medicine (in which the male is considered) is repetitive failure to adhere to these principles, thereby leading to relevant comparable data and accuracy. To address this failure, the sixth edition of the WHO manual includes revised basic methods, and a complementary formal standard of the International Standards Organization (ISO23162:2021) for basic semen examination has been published. Perhaps the most significant change in the sixth edition is the reintroduction of the four-category distinction of sperm motility, which causes additional work for laboratories in changing reporting parameters but is clinically important. Another essential change is the widened focus from mainly a prognostic tool for medically assisted reproduction to additionally raising awareness of semen examination as a measure of male reproductive functions and general male health.

### The importance of both an early orchidopexy and germ cell maturation for fertility [^a520d05f]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Delayed orchidopexy for undescended testes has been associated with abnormal testicular histology, but the effect on later fertility is unknown. We aimed to establish the importance of the first postnatal maturational step-ie, the transformation of gonocytes into Ad (dark) spermatogonia on fertility. We matched histological findings of the testes from 31 patients who had undergone an early orchidopexy with their total number of sperm. If Ad spermatogonia were present, 17 (94%) of 18 (95% CI 72.7–99.9) of the men had a total sperm count of 40 × 10⁶/ejaculate or greater. By contrast, despite successful early surgery, if Ad spermatogonia were absent, 12 (92%) of 13, (64.0–99.8) patients had abnormal spermiograms. Thus, the transformation of gonocytes into Ad spermatogonia is crucial for male fertility.

Results

Clinical investigation of male infertility

The investigation of male infertility includes personal and medical history, physical examination, semen analysis, hormonal parameters, and in specific cases, genetic investigation. Table 1 shows the main aspects to evaluate and their relevance for male reproductive health. The radiologist should obtain infertility-related clinical data of the patient studied from the managing physician, and consider them to have an overall view of the case when performing the imaging investigation. The managing physician should get and deliver these data upon request.

### What advances may the future bring to the diagnosis, treatment, and care of male sexual and reproductive health? [^8ffd85bc]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

The impact of these current and future advances

In closing, the continued improvement of procedures for the laboratory evaluation and processing of human semen over the past > 40 years has expanded the knowledge of male reproductive function and diagnosis of specific forms of dysfunction and set the stage for large multinational studies of semen parameters and characteristics worldwide. The improved rigor, precision, and accuracy that the current standardized protocols describe will now set the stage for advanced clinical trials aimed at filling the significant evidence gaps in both the diagnosis and treatment of male factor infertility needed to improve clinical care. In addition, the genomic revolution now allows the clinical diagnostic laboratories to realize quantum leaps in improved patient diagnosis in several areas of medicine. In andrology, we are on the forefront of vastly improving our diagnostic abilities to define precise etiologies and comorbidities and eventually (perhaps) develop medically based treatments for men with reproductive failure to improve not only their fertility potential but also their overall health. Translation of the new technologies described earlier (spermatogonial stem cell transplantation and spermatogenesis in vitro) to serve the clinical needs will require additional research. In the future, these methods should move from the laboratory to the clinical arena to provide therapeutic options for men with reproductive health-related conditions. However, because of the complexity of the systems involved and the substantial risks that otherwise healthy individual may be subjected to, there must be a high bar to ensure safety and a positive outcome. Despite these caveats, certainly, the future looks promising for improving the health and fertility of the male with reproductive failure through precision medicine and the application of advanced technologies for advanced diagnosis and treatment.

### Critical appraisal of World Health Organization's new reference values for human semen characteristics and effect on diagnosis and treatment of subfertile men [^69768926]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

In 2010, the World Health Organization established new reference values for human semen characteristics that are markedly lower than those previously reported. Despite using controlled studies involving couples with a known time to pregnancy to establish the new limits, the reference studies are limited with regard to the population analyzed and the methods used for semen evaluation. The present review discusses concerns related to the new reference values for semen characteristics, including the effect on patient referral, diagnosis, and treatment of recognized conditions, such as varicocele, and on the indications for assisted reproductive technologies.

### Semen cryopreservation, utilisation and reproductive outcome in men treated for Hodgkin's disease [^eb3b8374]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Semen analysis after treatment

Of 115 patients who cryopreserved semen, 97 patients were alive and disease free, one patient was alive with disease, 16 patients had died and there was incomplete data for one patient when this analysis was performed. After treatment, 74 patients requested semen analysis at least once (median = 2, range 1–7) and at varying times following treatment depending on personal circumstances. At the first analysis, a median interval of 2.9 years (range 0.1–12.3) after completion of chemotherapy, the majority were azoospermic (68 out of 74) and four patients were oligospermic (1×10⁶ per ml). Normal spermatogenesis was present in two patients (sperm concentrations of 25 million per mL and 50 million per ml), 79 and 54 months after treatment. Both patients had received only three of a planned eight cycles of MVPP. At subsequent analyses, recovery of spermatogenesis was detected in seven previously azoospermic patients although all remained severely oligospermic (sperm concentration < 10×10⁶ per ml). Overall, a degree of recovery of spermatogenesis occurred in 13 out of 74 patients at a median interval of 5.1 years (range 3.3–13.1) after treatment. To our knowledge, four patients in whom spermatogenesis recovered have fathered children naturally.

Assisted reproduction using cryopreserved semen

Data regarding utilisation was complete for 113 out of 115 patients who stored semen. The actuarial rate of utilisation 10 years from storage is 27%, the rate of destruction of semen without utilisation and before death of the patient is 19% and the rate of death without utilisation is 13% (Figure 3

Figure 3
Cumulative rates of semen utilisation, death before utilisation and sample destruction without utilisation or death in patients with Hodgkin's disease (Kaplan–Meier method).). Cryopreserved samples from 29 patients have been destroyed due to death (n = 15), recovery of spermatogenesis (n = 4) or at patient request with no reason specified (n = 10). Patients who remain alive who have neither used nor destroyed cryopreserved semen have been followed for a median of 10.1 years. At the time of analysis, cryopreserved semen had been utilised for assisted reproduction by 33 couples. Grouping of patients according to whether or not they already had children or marital status at diagnosis revealed no group of patients who were significantly more or less likely to attempt assisted reproduction using cryopreserved semen (data not shown). Similarly, analysis by age at diagnosis also showed no significant difference in utilisation after 10 years (Figure 4

### Semen analysis and successful paternity by intracytoplasmic sperm injection in a man with steroid 5 α-reductase-2 deficiency [^4d76b0b3]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report semen parameters and successful paternity by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in a male patient with molecularly confirmed steroid 5α-reductase-2 deficiency.

Design

Case report.

Setting

National research institute and an infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

A 29-year-old Japanese man with 5α-reductase-2 deficiency who had failed to have a child despite an ordinary conjugal life for 2 years with his wife.

Intervention(S)

Mutation analysis, semen analysis, and execution of ICSI.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Mutation detection, semen assessment, and production of a child.

Result(S)

Mutation analysis revealed a homozygous p.R246Q missense mutation on exon 5 of SRD5A2. Semem analysis showed oligozoospermia (semen volume 0.3 mL, sperm count 15 × 10⁶/mL, total sperm count 4.5 × 10⁶, motile cells 17%, and normal morphologic sperm 8%). ICSI resulted in a production of a healthy male infant.

Conclusion(S)

The results, in conjunction with those of previously reported patients who received semen analysis and/or achieved paternity, suggest that male patients with 5α-reductase-2 deficiency, especially those with hypomorphic mutations including p.R246Q, could retain some degree of spermatogenic function and achieve paternity with and without assisted reproductive technology.

### Vasectomy: AUA guideline [^a420a37e]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Vasectomy — self-PVSA home testing has been approved by the FDA and is sensitive to sperm counts > 250,000/mL, but it "does not assess for sperm motility". If two tests are both negative, "the negative predictive value of a sperm count > 250,000 sperm/mL is 99.9%", yet this 250,000 sperm/mL cut-off is higher than the success definition used here, " < 100,000 non-motile sperm/ mL". No studies have shown this approach reliable enough "to recommend discontinuation of contraception", and none have followed users for pregnancy risk; because results are patient-read, "the surgeon must instruct the patient on all aspects of the test prior to its use", and the Panel concludes there are "insufficient data for the panel to come to a conclusion regarding its use in clinical practice".

### Fertility preservation for pediatric and adolescent patients with cancer: medical and ethical considerations [^9e4d9df5]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Background — infertility definition, evaluation timing, and age-related fertility outcomes: Infertility is defined as the inability to achieve or sustain a successful pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected intercourse, and earlier evaluation and treatment may be justified on the basis of medical history, such as anovulation or erectile dysfunction. For women 35 years and older, a fertility evaluation is recommended after 6 months of unsuccessful attempts at conception, and although fertility declines with age for both men and women, this decline is much more profound in women; at age 40, half of women will have trouble conceiving. If in vitro fertilization (IVF) is required, the chance of pregnancy per cycle is only 13.9% in women at age 40 and under 4% in women older than 42 years. For men at age 45, the chance of achieving a pregnancy is much higher, and for these older men, the age of their female partner is the most significant determinant of outcome. The risk of infertility after cancer treatment depends on the type of malignancy and its specific treatment as well as the age of the individual both at the time of diagnosis and at the time that they wish to initiate a pregnancy; in men, treatments can lead to a complete absence of spermatogenesis, a decreased sperm count, or sexual dysfunction, and in women, there can be a complete depletion of viable egg production or diminished ovarian reserve, leading to subfertility and a shortened fertile window, and a hysterectomy or insult to the uterus may lead to the inability to gestate a pregnancy.

### Are young men attempting to achieve paternity through intracytoplasmic sperm injection candidates for general health screenings? [^9262a6ad]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, in countries with limited access to assisted reproduction treatment due to socio-economic factors, alternative strategies for such early screening need to be developed. In some parts of the world, the indications for using ICSI in infertile couples have now been widened to also include cases of unexplained fertility, advanced maternal age, low oocyte yield or poor quality of the latter. Therefore, attempts on targeted screening campaigns, as suggested by us, should be done in the setting where ICSI referral is indicated by male-factor infertility only, and preferably in countries with tax-funded assisted reproduction.

Although simple semen analysis could be used as a proactive health measure, we believe targeting infertile men seeking to achieve paternity by ICSI to be more feasible and cost-effective in preventing infertility-related morbidity, a concept which, in our earlier publications, was shown to be well-grounded. Nevertheless, whether it is poor sperm quality based on basic semen analysis or attempted paternity through ICSI, reproductive ability as a marker for poor somatic health in young men may in the future have promising clinical implications. Implementation of targeted health interventions based on a male's fertility potential grows even more so relevant as we each day keep learning about the negative implications of impaired testicular function beyond its reproductive goals.
