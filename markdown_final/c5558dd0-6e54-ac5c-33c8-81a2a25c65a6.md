## Question

How does subclavian stenosis affect the blood pressure?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how subclavian stenosis affects blood pressure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the direct hemodynamic effect on the affected arm's measured blood pressure. Then, I should verify how this translates into an inter-arm blood pressure difference and what thresholds matter diagnostically. Next, I will consider whether subclavian stenosis alters systemic blood pressure regulation or just the local measurement. After that, I should review the evidence for blood pressure changes after revascularization. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and clinical implications for screening and management, making sure I distinguish true systemic effects from measurement artifacts and steal phenomena.

> Let me first confirm the direct hemodynamic effect. Subclavian stenosis reduces antegrade flow to the ipsilateral arm, so the measured brachial systolic pressure on that side is lower than it would be otherwise, often by a clinically meaningful margin, and this is the primary way it "affects" blood pressure in routine practice [^6ab2a012] [^e2a2db74].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and thresholds. In invasive angiographic cohorts with proven subclavian stenosis greater than 50%, the mean systolic inter-arm difference is about 37 mmHg, which is substantial and explains why even a 10–15 mmHg gap is clinically suspicious. Guidelines and meta-analyses consistently flag a systolic difference of 10 mmHg or more as abnormal and 15 mmHg or more as strongly suggestive of subclavian stenosis, with risk ratios around 8–12 for stenosis when the gap is 10–20 mmHg, albeit with imperfect sensitivity and high specificity [^6ab2a012] [^dfc5f4f9] [^5d03a656].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about systemic blood pressure. I initially wondered if subclavian stenosis could raise overall blood pressure via neurohormonal activation, but I should double-check that. The balance of evidence indicates subclavian stenosis does not directly increase systemic arterial pressure; rather, it creates a false-low reading on the affected side, masking true systemic hypertension if only that arm is used, and it may be associated with generalized atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk without being a causal driver of systemic hypertension itself [^6ab2a012] [^4721607d] [^5d03a656].

> Next, I should review whether revascularization changes blood pressure in a way that implies a systemic effect. A prospective cohort in hypertensive patients with subclavian or vertebral stenosis showed that stenting reduced office and ambulatory blood pressures by roughly 7–10/3–5 mmHg over 1–6 months, but wait, I need to be cautious here — this could reflect improved perfusion and reduced sympathetic activation rather than a primary systemic antihypertensive effect, and the study did not show a reduction in antihypertensive medication count, which tempers inference about causality on systemic BP regulation [^69cba441].

> I will now examine the clinical implications for screening and diagnosis. Guidelines recommend measuring blood pressure in both arms at least once, ideally at the first visit, because a systolic difference greater than 10 mmHg signals increased cardiovascular risk and may indicate subclavian stenosis; in patients with PAD or those undergoing ABI, identifying the higher-reading arm is essential to avoid underestimating true systemic pressure and to ensure accurate noninvasive testing [^5d03a656] [^dfc5f4f9] [^bbd31916].

> But wait, what if the inter-arm difference is small or the patient is asymptomatic? I should confirm that modest differences can still matter. Even in the absence of arm symptoms, a difference of 10–15 mmHg correlates with higher risks of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and mortality, so documenting and following such findings is prudent, while recognizing that very large differences, especially 20 mmHg or more, are particularly specific for hemodynamically significant subclavian stenosis and warrant imaging and risk stratification [^6ab2a012] [^dfc5f4f9].

> Let me consider special contexts where this changes management. In patients with prior coronary bypass using the internal mammary artery, a proximal subclavian lesion can cause coronary-subclavian steal and myocardial ischemia; in those facing TEVAR with planned left subclavian coverage, pre-emptive revascularization is recommended to mitigate spinal cord ischemia risk; and in dialysis patients with ipsilateral access, subclavian stenosis can impair access function, prompting revascularization in selected cases [^254f6759] [^a30a9de7] [^53c9fa35].

> I should double-check the bottom line. Subclavian stenosis lowers the measured blood pressure in the affected arm, producing a characteristic inter-arm systolic difference that is a marker of atherosclerotic disease and cardiovascular risk; it does not directly elevate systemic blood pressure, but it can conceal true hypertension if the stenotic arm is used for monitoring, and revascularization may modestly reduce measured pressures while primarily addressing ischemic symptoms or access issues rather than acting as a systemic antihypertensive therapy [^6ab2a012] [^69cba441] [^5d03a656].

---

Subclavian stenosis lowers blood pressure in the affected arm by reducing antegrade flow, causing a **systolic inter-arm difference > 10–15 mmHg** [^6ab2a012] that can mask true systemic hypertension if only the affected arm is measured [^4721607d]. This pressure drop reflects the stenosis severity and can reverse with revascularization, normalizing the inter-arm difference and revealing the true systemic BP [^9fe47b9f]. Clinicians should **measure BP in both arms** [^5d03a656] to detect this discrepancy and avoid undertreatment of hypertension [^4721607d].

---

## Hemodynamic mechanisms

Subclavian stenosis reduces antegrade flow to the ipsilateral arm, causing a **pressure drop distal to the lesion** [^6e446c23]. The magnitude of this drop correlates with stenosis severity and collateral flow. Key mechanisms include:

- **Reduced antegrade flow**: Narrowing lowers downstream pressure and flow, especially during exertion [^6e446c23].
- **Collateral compensation**: Vertebral artery collaterals can partially offset the deficit, but not fully restore normal pressure [^6e446c23].
- **Steal phenomenon**: In severe cases, retrograde vertebral flow ("subclavian steal") further reduces arm perfusion and can cause neurologic symptoms [^6e446c23].

---

## Clinical evidence of blood pressure differences

Multiple studies show a **significant systolic inter-arm difference** in subclavian stenosis:

| **Study** | **Findings** |
|-|-|
| Meta-analysis (2012) | - Mean SBP difference: 36.9 mmHg (95% CI 35.4–38.4) with > 50% stenosis [^6ab2a012] <br/> - SBP difference ≥ 10 mmHg strongly associated with subclavian stenosis (RR 8.8, 95% CI 3.6–21.2) [^6ab2a012] |
| AHA/ACC guideline (2017) | - Inter-arm SBP difference > 15–20 mmHg is abnormal and suggests subclavian or innominate stenosis [^dfc5f4f9] |
| Prospective cohort (2020) | - Stenting reduced SBP by 7/3 mmHg at 1 month, 9/4 mmHg at 3 months, and 10/5 mmHg at 6 months, normalizing the inter-arm difference [^69cba441] |

---

## Clinical implications

### Masking of systemic hypertension

If BP is measured only in the affected arm, subclavian stenosis can **underestimate true systemic BP**, risking undertreatment of hypertension [^4721607d]. This is especially concerning in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or established disease [^6ab2a012].

---

### Diagnostic and therapeutic considerations

- **Bilateral arm BP measurement**: Recommended at least once to detect inter-arm differences and identify the higher-reading arm for future monitoring [^5d03a656] [^dfc5f4f9].
- **Revascularization**: Endovascular therapy can restore flow, normalize the inter-arm difference, and reveal true systemic BP [^9fe47b9f] [^69cba441].
- **Risk stratification**: An inter-arm SBP difference ≥ 10 mmHg is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality, supporting aggressive risk factor management [^6ab2a012] [^5d03a656].

---

## Summary of effects

Subclavian stenosis causes a **measurable reduction in ipsilateral arm BP**, typically producing a **systolic inter-arm difference > 10–15 mmHg** [^6ab2a012]. This can conceal systemic hypertension if the affected arm is used for monitoring, so **bilateral arm BP measurement is essential** to detect this discrepancy and guide appropriate management [^5d03a656].

Background

Differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 10 mm Hg or more or 15 mm Hg or more between arms have been associated with peripheral vascular disease and attributed to subclavian stenosis. We investigated whether an association exists between this difference and central or peripheral vascular disease, and mortality.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, and Medline In Process databases for studies published before July, 2011, showing differences in SBP between arms, with data for subclavian stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease, or survival. We used random effects meta-analysis to combine estimates of the association between differences in SBP between arms and each outcome.

Findings

We identified 28 eligible studies for review, 20 of which were included in our meta-analyses. In five invasive studies using angiography, mean difference in SBP between arms was 36·9 mm Hg (95% CI 35·4-38·4) for proven subclavian stenosis (>50% occlusion), and a difference of 10 mm Hg or more was strongly associated with subclavian stenosis (risk ratio [RR] 8·8, 95% CI 3·6-21·2). In non-invasive studies, pooled findings showed that a difference of 15 mm Hg or more was associated with peripheral vascular disease (nine cohorts; RR 2·5, 95% CI 1·6-3·8; sensitivity 15%, 9-23; specificity 96%, 94-98); pre-existing cerebrovascular disease (five cohorts; RR 1·6, 1·1-2·4; sensitivity 8%, 2-26; specificity 93%, 86-97); and increased cardiovascular mortality (four cohorts; hazard ratio [HR] 1·7, 95% CI 1·1-2·5) and all-cause mortality (HR 1·6, 1·1-2·3). A difference of 10 mm Hg or higher was associated with peripheral vascular disease (five studies; RR 2·4, 1·5-3·9; sensitivity 32%, 23-41; specificity 91%, 86-94).

Interpretation

A difference in SBP of 10 mm Hg or more, or of 15 mm Hg or more, between arms might help to identify patients who need further vascular assessment. A difference of 15 mm Hg or more could be a useful indicator of risk of vascular disease and death.

### The effect of stenting on blood pressure in hypertensive patients with symptomatic proximal subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis [^69cba441]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of stenting on blood pressure in hypertensive patients with symptomatic proximal subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis.

Background

Whether posterior circulation revascularization could reduce blood pressure in hypertensive patients with posterior circulation hypoperfusion has not been investigated in humans.

Methods

A total of 48 patients with essential hypertension (33 males; mean age 63.0±8.7 years) with symptomatic proximal subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis who underwent stenting successfully at the Fuwai Hospital were prospectively enrolled between January 2014 and December 2015. All 48 patients were followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure. Blood pressure, use of antihypertensive agents, and complications were investigated.

Results

Baseline values included office blood pressure of 132/77±10/8 mmHg, mean 24-hr blood pressure of 127/75±12/9 mmHg, and mean antihypertensive agents used of 1.6±0.8. Stenosis of the subclavian and vertebral arteries decreased from 88.9±9.5% and 85.8±7.4% to 5.5±3.5% and 4.6±3.7%, respectively, immediately after the procedure. Reductions in office blood pressure were-7/-3 (SD 3/2), -9/-4 (5/3), and-10/-5 (7/5) mmHg at 1, 3, and 6 months, respectively. While 24-hr blood pressures after the procedure reduced by -5/-3 mmHg at 6 months, the total number of antihypertensive agents used at the aforementioned time points was unchanged.

Conclusion

This first prospective cohort study in humans showed that posterior circulation stenting is apparently effective in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive patients with symptomatic proximal subclavian or vertebral artery stenosis.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure assessment in peripheral artery disease—Patients with PAD should undergo noninvasive blood pressure measurement in both arms at least once during the initial assessment. Measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ABI. An inter-arm blood pressure difference of >15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal and suggestive of subclavian (or innominate) artery stenosis, and patients with PAD are at increased risk of subclavian artery stenosis. Although a difference in arm systolic pressures of >15 to 20 mm Hg suggests subclavian (or innominate) artery stenosis, in the absence of symptoms (e.g., arm claudication or symptoms of vertebral artery steal), no further imaging or intervention is warranted.

### The vital prognosis of subclavian stenosis [^293c0fcc]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to assess the prognosis of subclavian stenosis (SS) as a potential marker of total and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality.

Background

Subclavian stenosis, diagnosed by a brachial systolic pressure difference (BSPD) > or =15 mm Hg, is associated with an increased prevalence of CVD risk factors. However, the association between SS and mortality is unknown. We hypothesized that a BSPD > or =15 mm Hg would predict an increased risk of CVD events.

Methods

We analyzed baseline and longitudinal data from 3 cohorts. Two were recruited from noninvasive vascular laboratories, and the third was a community-dwelling cohort. Multivariate survival models were used to test for an independent association of SS with total and CVD mortality.

Results

Baseline and follow-up data (mean 9.8 years) were complete in 1,778 participants. Subclavian stenosis was found in 157 (8.8%) subjects. Adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity, and cohort of origin, the presence of SS was significantly associated with increased total and CVD mortality (respectively, hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, p < 0.005; and HR 1.50, p = 0.05). This association persisted after adjustments for CVD risk factors (smoking pack-years, hypertension, diabetes, total/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and body mass index) as well as lipid-lowering and antiplatelet therapies (HR 1.40, p < 0.01; and HR 1.57, p < 0.05 for total and CVD mortality, respectively). When any history of CVD or an ankle-brachial index <0.90 were added to the model, SS remained an independent predictor for total mortality (HR 1.34, p = 0.02), with a similar trend for CVD mortality (HR 1.43, p = 0.09).

Conclusions

The presence of SS, easily diagnosed by comparing systolic pressures in the left and right arm, predicts total and CVD mortality independent of both CVD risk factors and existent CVD at baseline.

### Subclavian artery stenosis: prevalence, risk factors, and association with cardiovascular diseases [^4721607d]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objective was to assess the prevalence of subclavian artery stenosis (SS) in four cohorts (two free-living and two clinical populations) and determine both risk factors for this condition and the association with other cardiovascular conditions.

Background

The prevalence of SS in the general population is unknown, and its association with risk factors and other cardiovascular diseases is not well-established.

Methods

A total of 4,223 subjects (2,975 from two free-living cohorts and 1,248 from two clinical cohorts) were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Subclavian artery stenosis was defined as > or =15 mm Hg interarm pressure difference.

Results

The prevalence of SS was 1.9% in the free-living cohorts and 7.1% in the clinical cohorts; SS was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with past smoking (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80), current smoking (OR = 2.61), and higher levels of systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.90 per 20 mm Hg). Higher levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were inversely and significantly associated with SS (OR = 0.87 per 10 mg/dl). In regression analyses relating SS to other cardiovascular diseases, the only significant finding was with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) (OR = 5.11, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Significant SS is present in approximately 2% of the free-living population and 7% of the clinical population. Additionally, SS is correlated with current and past smoking histories, systolic blood pressure, HDL levels (inversely), and the presence of PAD. These findings suggest that bilateral brachial blood pressure measurements should routinely be performed in patients with an elevated risk profile, both to screen for SS, and to avoid missing a hypertension or PAD diagnosis because of unilateral pressure measurement in an obstructed arm.

### Inter-arm blood pressure difference, when is it a useful risk marker for cardiovascular events? [^3939a86e]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

In a linked paper Nolde et al. consider whether IAD could also be useful for the stratification of higher-risk groups. They examined the associations of IAD with vascular target organ damage in 199 patients recruited from a tertiary hypertension outpatient clinic; carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was adopted as a surrogate marker of hypertension-mediated vascular organ damage. In this selected cohort, they were unable to show a cross-sectional relationship between IAD and PWV. Further analyses also failed to find an association of IAD with either absolute blood pressure (BP) levels or BP variability.

PWV provides a quantitative assessment of arterial stiffening and is a recognised risk marker for cardiovascular events. The aetiology of an IAD is not clearly established; initially regarded as subclavian stenosis on the side of the lower reading arm, to date there has been a paucity of evidence to support such an association in the absence of substantial (i.e. ≥35 mmHg) systolic BP differences between arms. There is a growing body of evidence to associate IAD with elevated arterial stiffness manifested as increased PWV and/or pulse pressure. It seems likely that IAD is largely, if not fully, mediated by asymmetries in arterial stiffness, and that this pathophysiology underlies the independent associations of IAD with cardiovascular risk. In truth, it is probable that both stenoses and stiffening of arteries make contributions to the phenomenon of IAD and since both pathologies share common underlying causes the distinction is, perhaps, somewhat academic. We have previously observed that substantial sample sizes, probably in excess of 1000 for carotid-femoral PWV and higher for brachial-ankle PWV, are required before cross-sectional associations with an IAD can be reliably demonstrated. Thus, the numbers examined by Nolde et al. may have been underpowered in their ability to demonstrate a true relationship, and restriction to dichotomous rather than continuous analysis may have further compounded this.

### 2016 AHA / ACC guideline on the management of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease: executive summary [^3b40af2b]. Vascular Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) clinical evaluation—vascular examination includes palpation of lower extremity pulses, auscultation for femoral bruits, and inspection of the legs and feet; pulses are rated 0, absent; 1, diminished; 2, normal; or 3, bounding. Patients with confirmed PAD are at increased risk for subclavian artery stenosis, and an inter-arm blood pressure difference of >15 to 20 mm Hg is abnormal; measuring blood pressure in both arms identifies the arm with the highest systolic pressure, a requirement for accurate measurement of the ankle-brachial index (ABI). To confirm the diagnosis of PAD, abnormal physical examination findings must be confirmed with diagnostic testing, generally with the ABI as the initial test.

### Angiographic prevalence and clinical predictors of left subclavian stenosis in patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization [^0cb03d06]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2001). Low credibility.

The angiographic prevalence, clinical predictors, and sensitivity and specificity of a bilateral arm blood pressure differential for predicting proximal left subclavian artery stenosis were established in 492 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Seventeen subjects (3.5%) in the overall population and nine subjects (5.3%) with potential surgical coronary disease had proximal left subclavian stenosis. Precatheterization evidence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was the only predictor of subclavian stenosis in the overall population (P < 0.001; OR = 7.9; 95% CI = 2.6-24.3) and in patients with potential surgical coronary disease (P = 0.04; OR = 5.4; 95% CI = 1.1-27.2). Both a bilateral blood pressure differential of > 10 mm Hg and of > or =20 mm Hg had a good specificity but a poor sensitivity for predicting left subclavian stenosis. Thus, left subclavian angiography should be performed in patients with surgical coronary disease with either an arm blood pressure differential of > 10 mm Hg or with other precatheterization evidence of PVD.

### Screening for subclavian artery stenosis in patients who are candidates for coronary bypass surgery [^731b13d2]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2002). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated 59 patients who were deemed candidates for coronary bypass surgery after coronary artery angiography for subclavian artery narrowing, which could compromise the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery graft. Bilateral arm blood pressure (BP) measurements, auscultation for supraclavicular or cervical bruits, and questioning about cerebrovascular ischemic symptoms were compared to brachiocephalic-subclavian arteriography. One neurologic complication occurred during arteriography. An upper extremity BP difference of > or = 15 mm Hg identified all patients with > or = 50% subclavian artery narrowing. We recommend brachiocephalic-subclavian arteriography only in patients with abnormal noninvasive screening for subclavian stenosis, not routinely.

### Interarm difference in systolic blood pressure in different ethnic groups and relationship to the "White coat effect": a cross-sectional study [^fda4bef2]. American Journal of Hypertension (2017). Low credibility.

Differences in systolic blood pressure (BP) between right and left arms ≥10 mm Hg independently predict increased risk of cardiovascular events,, subclavian stenosis,and cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.Measuring BP in both arms is a simple intervention that identifies the higher reading arm, which should be used for future hypertension management, and may identify patients needing investigation, or intensification of cardiovascular risk management.Prevalence of patients with a significant systolic interarm difference (ssIAD) varies according to population. A U.S. systematic review, found the prevalence of ssIADs was 7.5% in primary care, 9% for hospital outpatients, and 12.1% for hospital inpatients.A recent study using Framingham data found the prevalence of ssIADs in a community sample, free from cardiovascular disease at baseline, was 9.4%. A UK systematic review considered prevalence of ssIADs in relation to clinical predictors and found 11.2% in hypertensives, 7.4% in people with diabetes and 3.6% in the general population.Characteristics associated with ssIADs are age,, diabetes,higher systolic BP,,, and increased body mass index (BMI).

Some ethnic groups are at higher cardiovascular risk.South Asians and African-Caribbeans have a higher incidence of diabetes than White Europeans,and African-Caribbeans have a greater prevalence of hypertension and stroke. Ethnicity may also affect the prevalence of ssIADs. Countries in the Far East appear to have a lower prevalence of patients with ssIADs than Western populations., To our knowledge, there has only been one study so far to look at the effect of ethnicity on the prevalence of ssIADs.It found a higher prevalence of ssIADs ≥15 mm Hg in African American and White Americans compared to Hispanic or Chinese Americans.

Method of measurement affects the likelihood of finding a ssIAD; single or sequential BP measurement techniques may overestimate the prevalence.

This study, using simultaneous measurements, aimed to evaluate whether prevalence of ssIADs ≥10 mm Hg varied according to South Asian, African-Caribbean, or White British ethnicity, hypertensive status or other participant characteristic and additionally to investigate any association of prevalence with the number of readings, or the presence of a white coat effect (WCE) or white coat hypertension (WCH).

### Upper extremity blood pressure difference in patients undergoing carotid revascularisation [^4105a218]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood pressure (BP) regulation is important in patients with carotid artery atherosclerotic disease. Concomitant subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) might lead to an underestimation of the true systemic BP in the monitoring of these patients. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the inter-arm BP difference in patients undergoing carotid intervention and its association with ipsilateral significant subclavian stenosis and clinical outcome.

Methods

Bilateral BP measurements and vascular imaging (CTA and MRA) of both subclavian arteries and the innominate artery were assessed in 182 symptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis undergoing revascularisation in the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS). Data were separately analysed according to previously described cutoff values for systolic BP (SBP) differences of ≥10 and <15 mmHg, ≥15 and <20 mmHg, or ≥20 mmHg. Significant SAS was defined as a >50% diameter reduction.

Results

Of the 182 patients, 39 (21%) showed an inter-arm difference in SBP >15 mmHg. The mean inter-arm SBP difference associated with ipsilateral SAS was 14 mmHg. SAS was present in 21/182 (12%) patients. Only two patients (1%) had bilateral stenotic disease. An inter-arm SBP difference of ≥20 mmHg was associated with unilateral SAS (RR 11.8; 95% CI 3.2-43.1) with a sensitivity of 23% and a specificity of 98%. Patients were followed up for a median of 4.0 years (IQR 3.0-6.0; maximum 7.5). Risk of stroke or death during follow-up was 20.0% (95% CI 11.1-28.9) in patients with, and 15.1% (95% CI 12.3-17.9) in patients without SAS (p = .561). The hospital stay was longer in patients with significant SAS (5.0 days, SD 4.9 vs. 2.7 days, SD 4.3, p = .035).

Conclusion

The present study is the first to affirm the clinical need for the measurement of inter-arm BP differences in patients undergoing carotid revascularisation, especially in the post-operative phase in the prevention of cerebral hyperperfusion.

### Assessment and management of peripheral arterial disease: what every cardiologist should know [^e98633cb]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Upper extremity PAD

Atherosclerotic upper extremity PAD occurs most commonly in left subclavian artery, followed by right subclavian artery and then innominate artery. It should be suspected if there is >15 mm Hg SBP difference between each arm, although patients are typically only symptomatic with more severe stenosis causing higher blood pressure differences. Symptoms may include upper extremity claudication, vertebral basilar steal, coronary steal in patients with internal mammary artery coronary bypass grafts or dialysis access dysfunction. Revascularisation is indicated only for symptomatic disease or in cases of planned CABG using internal mammary artery. Although there are no data directly comparing surgical and endovascular treatment, endovascular treatment with balloon-expandable stent is often preferred first-line therapy due to high success rate and high long-term patency rate.

### An alternative surgical approach to subclavian and innominate stenosis: a case series [^9e065362]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Subclinical aortic atherosclerosis may start as early as the second decade of life and the commonest disease in the aorta and the SATs is atherosclerotic in causation. Lesions develop principally in high shear stress regions, which is in the zone of flow separation and is associated with whirlpools that form near the lateral wall of bifurcations. Plaques are relatively uncommon in ascending aorta but more common in arch and descending thoracic aorta. Hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, dyslipideamia and genetic preponderance are common risk factors for developing atherosclerosis and in combination have a greater than additive effect. The majority of patient with SAT stenosis are asymptomatic, but some patients may present with symptoms of vertebrobasilar ischaemia including episodes of dizziness, diplopia, ataxia, vertigo, limb claudication, paraesthesia and steal syndrome. Physical examination may reveal diminished pulse and decreased blood pressure (> 20 mmHg reduction compared to the normal side) in the affected limb. The subclavian steal syndrome is one of the best recognised presentations of SAT stenosis. It is more common on the left side, perhaps due to the acute angle at the origin of the left subclavian artery which may result in accelerated atherosclerosis from increased turbulence. SAT stenosis can be diagnosed by digital subtraction angiography, duplex scanning, contrast enhanced spiral CT, magnetic resonance imaging and arch aortography.

The concept of extra-anatomic bypass was first introduced in 1952 by Freeman and Leeds, when they used superficial femoral artery to carry blood from one femoral artery to other, and this procedure has now become a widely used and accepted method of revascularisation. The physiologic basis of extra-anatomic bypass reveals that inflow in the donor artery is the key factor that determines the haemodynamic effects of extra-anatomic bypass. If the inflow in the donor artery is below a critical level of 60%, it may be insufficient to supply adequate blood flow simultaneously to both the distal segment of the donor artery and the bypass graft. Moreover, the capacity of the donor artery to provide increased blood flow on demand may be compromised because of atherosclerosis or iatrogenic stenosis at the site of anastomosis. To ensure a good result the donor artery should be free of disease and every precaution should be taken to avoid anastomotic stenosis. The increased flow demand following the extra-anatomic bypass is met by increased flow in donor artery proximal to the anastomosis and the flow remains essentially unaffected by changes in the outflow and hypotension. The only factor that leads to the phenomenon of vascular steal is restriction or obstruction of inflow in donor artery.

### Results after balloon angioplasty or stenting of atherosclerotic subclavian artery obstruction [^9fe47b9f]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endovascular therapy is an accepted treatment strategy in occlusive disease of the subclavian artery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical long-term outcome following either balloon angioplasty (plain balloon angioplasty (PTA)) or stenting.

Patients and Methods

The authors retrospectively analyzed 108 interventions of atherosclerotic lesions of subclavian arteries or the brachiocephalic trunk (107 patients; mean age of 66 +/- 9 years; 90% symptomatic) representing 92% of the patients treated with subclavian artery obstructive disease during a 10-year period. Primary endpoint of the study was the 1-year primary patency rate. Follow-up was based on oscillometry, Doppler blood pressure measurements, and duplex ultrasound.

Results

The primary success rate was 97% (100% for stenoses (78/78) and 87% for total occlusions (26/30)). Treatment modalities included PTA alone (13%; n = 14) or stenting (87%; n = 90) with balloon-expandable (n = 61), self-expanding (n = 17), or both types of devices (n = 12). The 1-year primary patency rate of the 97 patients eligible for follow-up was 88%, for the subgroups 79% (PTA) and 89% (stenting; P = 0.2). The blood pressure difference between both limbs at baseline was 45 +/- 26 mm Hg and dropped to 10 +/- 14 mm Hg (P < 0.001) after the intervention and 15 +/- 19 mm Hg at 1 year (P < 0.01).

Conclusion

Endovascular therapy of atherosclerotic subclavian artery obstructions result in excellent acute success rates even in total occlusions. Results evince good durability of endovascular therapy for atherosclerotic occlusive disease of subclavian arteries and with a trend towards better outcome with stenting compared to PTA.

### Angioplasty versus stenting for subclavian artery stenosis [^c3dd5753]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The subclavian arteries are two major arteries of the upper chest, below the collar bone, which come from the arch of the aorta. Endovascular treatment for stenosis of the subclavian arteries includes angioplasty alone, and with stenting. There is insufficient evidence to guide the use of stents following angioplasty for subclavian artery stenosis. This is the second update of a review first published in 2011.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to determine whether stenting was more effective than angioplasty alone for stenosis of the subclavian artery.

Search Methods

For this update, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and LILACS databases, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 2 February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We searched for randomised controlled trials of endovascular treatment of subclavian artery lesions that compared angioplasty alone and stent implantation.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently evaluated studies to assess eligibility. Discrepancies were resolved by discussion. If there was no agreement, we asked a third review author to assess the study for inclusion. We planned to undertake data collection and analysis in accordance with recommendations described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and assess the certainty of the evidence using a GRADE approach.

Main Results

To date, we have not identified any completed or ongoing randomised controlled trials that compare percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for subclavian artery stenosis.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently insufficient evidence to determine whether stenting is more effective than angioplasty alone for stenosis of the subclavian artery.

### Measurement of blood pressure in the leg-a statement on behalf of the British and Irish hypertension society [^bcade1f3]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Full statement

Blood pressure (BP) is normally measured on the upper arm, but occasionally this is not possible. The presence of fractures, wounds, vascular access devices and shunts, morbid obesity, surgical procedures, lymphoedema, limb deformities (phocomelia) and amputations may prevent the satisfactory cuff placement around the upper arm. In addition, BP measurement may be inaccurate in the presence of bilateral subclavian artery stenoses such as can occur with Takayasu’s arteritis or atherosclerosis. In these circumstances, measurement of BP in the leg may be necessary. It is important to recognise, however, that BP measurements in the arm may differ from those in the legs.

A recent systematic review examined the relationship between supine BP measurements in the arm and leg. A review of 44 studies involving 9771 patients concluded that ankle systolic BP was on average 17.0 mmHg (95% CI 15.4–21.3 mmHg) higher than arm systolic BP, whilst there was no difference in diastolic BP in the general population. These findings suggest that a threshold of ≥155/90 mmHg could be used for diagnosing hypertension in routine practice when only ankle measurements are available. This threshold is conservative and would ensure maximum sensitivity to detect hypertension at the expense of some specificity.

It should be noted that the review found much lower leg pressures in the presence of peripheral vascular disease (PVD). The proposed threshold should therefore be used with caution, and patients with low ankle BPs in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. diabetes, renal disease and existing cardiovascular disease) should be considered for further investigation, especially if there is a history of intermittent claudication or clinical evidence of PVD (e.g. femoral arterial bruits, poor or absent foot pulses, poor distal skin perfusion, cold peripheries or arterial ulceration). In such cases, arterial Doppler ultrasonography, CT or MR angiography can be used to confirm significant PVD which may invalidate the use of ankle BP as a surrogate for arm BP. PVD may be worse in one leg compared with the other, so ankle BPs should be taken in both legs where this is suspected.

A 24-year-old woman presented with sudden-onset slurred speech and right-side weakness. Ten months previously, she had had an episode of transient consciousness loss. The patient denied smoking, had no history of miscarriage, was not taking oral contraceptives, and had a body mass index of 21.
2. She denied any family history of stroke. On admission, her blood pressure was 103/65 mm Hg in the right arm and 76/40 mm Hg in the left arm. Her body temperature, heartbeat, and respiration rate were within normal limits. Simultaneous palpation of pulses in the 2 arms revealed that the left radial pulse was weak. A neurological examination revealed clinically significant right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. Other findings of general physical and neurological examinations were normal. The patient’s blood work results were unremarkable, aside from an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level. Hypercoagulable laboratory studies, chest radiography, transthoracic echocardiography, electrocardiography, and 24-hour Holter monitoring yielded normal findings. Head computed tomography images showed an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia. Head-and-neck CT angiography with digital subtraction angiography revealed left carotid artery occlusion and subclavian artery stenosis. These findings were believed to be consistent with Takayasu arteritis. The patient was given prednisolone. Regular clinical follow-up, including physical examinations, radiographic evaluations, and other medical tests, was performed every 6 to 12 months. Chen L, Cao H, Zhou M.

### Determinants of immediate and long-term results of subclavian and innominate artery angioplasty [^709e0246]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) is widely used in the treatment of subclavian/innominate artery obstruction, but factors of long-term PTA outcome are poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of PTA on symptom resolution and identify determinants of long-term outcome.

Methods and Results

Seventy-six lesions were treated in 75 patients (58.7% men) aged 60 +/- 8.5 years. PTA was successful in 70 (93.3%) patients, including 58/58 (100%) stenotic lesions and 13/18 (72.2%) occlusions. The mean stenosis grade (QCA) was reduced from 78.9% +/- 16.6% to 13.5% +/- 10.7% (P < 0.01). A great majority of lesions (87.1%) were stented. In 5 (7.1%) high-risk lesions a proximal or distal neuroprotection system was used. There were no strokes or embolic events. Minor complications occurred in 7 (9.3%) cases. Fifty-seven (89%) of 64 symptomatic patients had complete symptom resolution. The mean follow-up was 24.4 +/- 15.5 months (up to 66 months). Ten restenoses (15.6%), including 9 (13.8%) in-stent restenoses and 1 (16.7%) restenosis after balloon angioplasty, were diagnosed in 64 patients and followed up for at least 6 months. Nine symptomatic restenoses were successfully treated with repeated angioplasty. Cox multivariable analysis revealed the following independent predictors of restenosis: implantation of more than one stent (P = 0.005), low stent diameter (P = 0.088), and postprocedural systolic blood pressure difference between upper extremities (P = 0.044).

Conclusions

PTA is a safe and effective method for the treatment of the subclavian/innominate artery obstruction and leads to symptom resolution in majority of patients. Restenosis is not frequent and it can be effectively treated with repeat angioplasty. Low stent diameter, implantation of two stents, and upper limb systolic blood pressure difference are independent predictors of restenosis.

### Gadolinium-enhanced angiography for diagnosis and interventional treatment of subclavian artery stenosis prior to fistula creation [^25e7d8d5]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

We report the use of gadolinium-based contrast agent for both diagnostic and interventional subclavian angiography in two azotemic patients, presenting with an asymptomatic, high-grade stenosis of the left subclavian artery, ipsilateral to the site of choice for native fistula creation. Angiographic imaging performed with diluted gadolinium-based contrast material was clear enough to perform successful subclavian artery stenting, resulting in normalization of the arterial blood pressure in the afferent artery of the dialysis fistula. Clinically, no decrease in residual renal function and no other complication were noted immediately or a longer period after the interventional treatment.

### Symptomatic obstruction of the brachiocephalic and left subclavian arteries obscured by aortic stenosis [^fbe0d114]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis: 
- Definition: Subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis refers to the narrowing of these arteries, typically due to atherosclerosis or arterial dissection.
- Pathophysiology: Subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis can lead to decreased blood flow and impaired oxygen delivery to the upper extremities and brain.
- Epidemiology: The epidemiology of subclavian and brachiocephalic artery stenosis is not well-defined due to their relative rarity, and prevalence and incidence rates are not explicitly reported.
- Disease course: Clinical manifestations include symptoms of lightheadedness, syncope, left-sided weakness, subclavian steal syndrome, and arm claudication.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis can be severe if left untreated. Subclavian stenosis is associated with increased total and CVD mortality, even after adjustments for CVD risk factors and existent CVD at baseline.

### Subclavian steal syndrome [^6e446c23]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

“Subclavian steal” refers to a syndrome of symptoms relating to arterial insufficiency in a branch of the subclavian artery stemming from flow reversal,attributable to occlusive disease in the subclavian artery proximal to that branch that is usually atheroscleroticin cause. Most patients are asymptomatic,but patients with IMA bypass grafts may manifest angina elicited by exercise of the upper extremity ipsilateral to the graft and stenosis (so called“coronary-subclavian steal”).Subclavian steal may also manifest as vertebrobasilar insufficiency or,most commonly, arm claudication.Subclavian steal should be considered among patients exhibiting suggestive symptoms. A meticulous examination of segmental pulses and pressures,as well as judicious use of duplex ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography, computed tomography angiography, or conventional angiography can confirm the presence of subclavian stenosis. Symptomatic patients benefit from either percutaneousor surgical revascularization,depending on both anatomic and patient factors. Subclavian stenosis,regardless of symptoms, is a marker of atherosclerotic disease and increased risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.

### Steal affecting the central nervous system [^285bca0d]. Neurosurgery (2002). Low credibility.

Steal is a pathophysiological process in which increased blood flow through a low-resistance vascular bed is sufficient to divert flow away from a region of the central nervous system. Three disease states in which steal may cause neurological deficits due to central nervous system ischemia are reviewed. Subclavian steal occurs when stenosis of the subclavian artery proximal to the vertebral origin causes retrograde flow in the left vertebral artery. Patients with anatomic subclavian steal usually do not develop neurological symptoms but may rarely present with posterior circulation ischemia. Arteriovenous malformations alter cerebral blood flow patterns and regional perfusion pressure. It has been hypothesized that cerebral arteriovenous malformations may cause neurological deficits due to steal and that these deficits may be cured with arteriovenous malformation treatment. Intra-arterial pressure measurements and transcranial velocity studies show regional hemodynamic alterations. However, these changes have not been correlated with presenting symptoms. Evidence from single-photon emission computed tomography does suggest a relationship between regional hypoperfusion and neurological deficits. Coarctation of the aorta may divert flow from the spinal cord circulation through intercostal arteries distal to the stenosis. This is a possible but unproven mechanism of myelopathology. Steal syndromes may be amenable to treatment by open surgical or endovascular approaches. Experimental studies of the pathophysiology of steal are strengthened by precise definitions of the measured parameters and innovative applications of technology.

### Variant of subclavian steal syndrome: unusual anatomical relationship between left subclavian artery and left vertebral artery [^e644df13]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

A woman in her 70s presented to her general practitioner (GP) with a 3-month history of left upper arm pain and weakness. A significant difference in bilateral blood pressures was noted and a further history elicited coolness in her left arm without functional compromise. A CT angiography revealed variant subclavian steal syndrome with a subclavian arterial stenosis, which was proximal to both the internal mammary and thyrocervical trunk and her left vertebral artery originating from the aortic arch. She was referred to a vascular surgeon but declined surgical intervention. Her symptoms remain stable with 6-month follow-up from her GP. This case highlights the importance of considering vascular aetiologies in upper limb pain and weakness. Our case reviews the differential diagnoses of upper limb pain and weakness, consequently leading to the discussion of an interesting variant of subclavian stenosis.

### Incidence of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^9218b514]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the incidence of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery.

Design

Prospective.

Setting

Veterans Affairs Medical Center and university-affiliated medical center.

Participants

Adult patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery and documented use of an internal mammary artery.

Interventions

Bilateral simultaneous brachial blood pressures were determined noninvasively. The presumptive diagnosis of ipsilateral subclavian artery stenosis and coronary-subclavian steal syndrome was made if the systolic blood pressure differential was >20 mmHg.

Measurements and Main Results

The presumptive diagnosis of ipsilateral subclavian artery stenosis based on a blood pressure differential was made in 6 of 86 (5%) patients screened. The diagnosis of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome was confirmed at cardiac catheterization by observing retrograde internal mammary artery flow in 3 patients or lack of internal mammary artery flow in 1 patient (3.4%). All 4 patients with angiographic confirmation had either angina or silent ischemia. Three patients had successful carotid subclavian bypass, and 1 patient refused surgery. Two patients had no evidence of myocardial ischemia and underwent their planned procedure without incident.

Conclusion

Coronary-subclavian steal syndrome occurs with relative frequency in noncardiac surgery patients with prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery using internal mammary artery conduits. Bilateral blood pressure measurements should be routinely performed during the preoperative evaluation. A pressure differential >20 mmHg should suggest the possibility of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome.

### Brachiocephalic and subclavian stenosis: current concepts for cardiovascular specialists [^923fb77c]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Brachiocephalic and subclavian artery stenoses are less common manifestations of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) compared to lower extremity PAD. However, even among asymptomatic patients, a diagnosis of PAD portends worse long-term mortality. Symptoms may include subclavian steal syndrome and arm claudication. Among patients with internal mammary coronary bypass grafts, symptoms may include those of myocardial ischemia. Symptomatic subclavian stenosis can be readily treated using endovascular techniques with durable outcomes.

### Cardiovascular manifestations from therapeutic radiation: a multidisciplinary expert consensus statement from the International Cardio-oncology Society [^3c4fed77]. JACC: CardioOncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Pericardial disease

TTE often provides the initial evaluation of patients with suspected RT-associated pericardial disease, allowing evaluation of pericardial thickening, pericardial effusion, and functional assessment of constrictive physiology. However, the distinction between normal and thickened pericardium by TTE can be difficult, and other modalities such as cardiac MRI and/or CT imaging may be necessary. The timing of screening for pericardial disease aligns with that for valvular heart disease. The majority of patients will be evaluated by use of TTE at 5 years after the completion of RT and then in 5-year intervals. Cardiac MRI and CT imaging are not recommended for generalized screening.

Aorta and great vessels

Routine screening is not currently recommended for SVC syndrome given the lack of data; however, SVC syndrome should be considered in patients who present with any signs or symptoms such as sinus tachycardia, dyspnea, facial or upper extremity swelling, or headaches.

All patients who received RT to the subclavian territory should undergo bilateral, upper extremity blood pressure evaluations during their annual physical examination as a nominal screening for subclavian stenosis. In a series of 59 noncancer patients undergoing evaluation for coronary artery bypass surgery, an upper extremity systolic pressure difference between arms of ≥15 mm Hg identified all patients with ≥50% narrowing of the subclavian.

Signs of great vessel atherosclerosis or SVC stenosis may also be appreciated on available CT imaging or echocardiography. Patients being evaluated for CABG should undergo appropriate evaluation for left subclavian stenosis, as well as LIMA patency, if the LIMA is being contemplated as a graft. Notably, the internal mammary nodes are often included in regional nodal radiation in patients with breast cancer, with the internal mammary vessels (the LIMA in left-sided patients) in the first 3 intercostal spaces used as a surrogate target for these high-risk nodes.

Figure 1. 
Measurements atherosclerosis (AS) burden of baroreceptor-resident arteries in patients with ischemic stroke. A, The measured segments of bilateral carotid sinuses included ① origin of internal carotid artery, ② carotid bifurcation, and ③ distal common carotid artery. B, The measured segments of aortic arch included ④ aortic arch, ⑤ origin of brachiocephalic trunk, ⑥ origin of left common carotid artery, and ⑦ origin of left subclavian artery. C, The long-tail arrow on the left indicated a distal common carotid artery with 25% to 49% vessel circumference affected by atherosclerosis, scored 2 points; the short-tail arrow on right indicated a carotid bifurcation with 50% to 74% vessel circumference affected by AS, scored 3 points. D, The long-tail arrow on the left and the short-tail arrow on right both indicated origins of internal carotid arteries with 50% to 74% vessel circumference affected by atherosclerosis, scored 3 points. E, The short-tail arrow indicated an aortic arch with 25% to 49% vessel circumference affected by AS, scored 2 points.

The atherosclerosis of cervicocephalic arteries was also scored semi-quantitatively. The atherosclerosis conditions in each cervical and intracranial segment was scored 0 to 4 points based on the degree of atherosclerotic stenosis (0, no atherosclerotic plaque; 1, atherosclerotic plaque without obvious lumen stenosis or stenosis <50%; 2, stenosis 50%–69%; 3, stenosis 70%–99%; 4, occlusion).The cervical atherosclerosis score was the sum of atherosclerosis scores of 8 arterial segments including bilateral common carotid, subclavian, extracranial carotid, and extracranial vertebral arteries. The intracranial atherosclerosis score was computed by summing the atherosclerosis scores of 11 arterial segments included bilateral intracranial carotid, intracranial vertebral, anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral arteries, and basilar artery.

### Symptomatic obstruction of the brachiocephalic and left subclavian arteries obscured by aortic stenosis [^7fe5569e]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Stenosis or occlusion of the brachiocephalic artery represents an uncommon cause of cerebrovascular insufficiency. We report a patient with combined brachiocephalic and left subclavian obstruction with clinical manifestations of lightheadedness, syncope, and left-sided weakness who remained misdiagnosed essentially because of symmetrical pressures in the upper extremities. Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis failed to provide symptomatic relief. Eventual stenting of the brachiocephalic trunk resolved the patient's symptoms. Our report highlights the diagnostic challenges in this case of bilateral supraaortic vessel disease and shows that equal upper extremity pressures do not rule out brachiocephalic artery obstruction.

### Interpretation of peripheral arterial and venous Doppler waveforms: a consensus statement from the Society for Vascular Medicine and society for vascular ultrasound [^af505082]. Vascular Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Vertebral artery Doppler waveforms—steal patterns are described as follows: In pre-steal, a mid-systolic velocity deceleration is noted in the vertebral artery waveform and this feature becomes more prominent as subclavian artery stenosis progresses, eventually resulting in a period of reverse flow; partial steal shows alternating forward and reverse flow during each cardiac cycle and the extent of steal depends primarily on pressure gradients produced by an innominate or subclavian artery lesion; complete steal demonstrates reverse flow direction throughout the cardiac cycle.

### Axilloaxillary bypass for the treatment of subclavian artery stenosis complicated by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion: technical case report [^8ed559d4]. Neurosurgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

We successfully treated a patient with stenosis of the left subclavian artery, complicated by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, via axilloaxillary bypass surgery.

Clinical Presentation

A 67-year-old patient with a history of hypertension and cerebral infarction underwent neck irradiation for treatment of a vocal cord tumor. Three months later, he began to experience transient tetraparesis several times per day. The blood pressure measurements for his right and left arms were different. Supratentorial blood flow was markedly low. The common carotid arteries were bilaterally occluded, and the right vertebral artery was hypoplastic. Therefore, only the left vertebral artery contributed to the patient's cerebral circulation; his left subclavian artery was severely stenotic.

Intervention

The patient underwent axilloaxillary bypass surgery because the procedure avoids thoracotomy or sternotomy, manipulation of the carotid artery, and interruption of the vertebral artery blood flow. The patient has been free of symptoms for more than 5 years.

Conclusion

Neurosurgeons should be aware that extra-anatomic bypass surgery is an effective treatment option for selected patients with cerebral ischemia.

### Endovascular therapy in prevention and management of coronary-subclavian steal [^fbcf5852]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who have proximal subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) is not well established. SAS may lead to flow reversal through a patent in situ internal mammary artery graft, resulting in myocardial ischemia (coronary-subclavian steal). We review our experience in prevention and management of coronary-subclavian steal.

Methods

The medical records of patients who received treatment of symptomatic coronary-subclavian steal were reviewed. Patients who underwent subclavian artery revascularization before CABG were also included in our review. Patient demographic data, findings at presentation, imaging and treatment methods, and short-term and intermediate-term results were analyzed.

Results

Over 4 years, 14 patients with combined subclavian and coronary artery disease were identified. Nine patients had angina (n = 8) and/or congestive heart failure (n = 2) after CABG (post-CABG group). Four patients underwent treatment of SAS and one underwent treatment of recurrent stenosis before or during CABG (pre-CABG group). Among this pre-CABG group, one patient had symptoms of left arm claudication; the other four patients had no symptoms. A blood pressure gradient was commonly noted between both arms. An angiogram confirmed the proximal location of SAS in all patients, and established the presence of flow reversal in a patent internal mammary artery graft in the post-CABG group. Operative management consisted of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting of the subclavian lesion in 11 patients, PTA only in 2 patients, and carotid-subclavian bypass grafting in 1 patient. No known perioperative complications or morbidity was encountered in either group. Mean follow-up was 29 months, during which stenosis recurred in two patients, along with associated cardiac symptoms. In both patients repeat angioplasty was successful, for an assisted primary patency rate of 100%.

Conclusion

PTA and stenting to treat SAS appears to provide effective protection from and treatment of coronary-subclavian steal over the short and intermediate terms. A surveillance program is essential because of the risk for recurrent stenosis. Continued follow-up is necessary to determine long-term efficacy of this treatment compared with more conventional surgical approaches.

### Atypical and rare cause of myocardial infarction: coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS) treated by a carotid-subclavian bypass in a 71-year-old female patient [^f643c74d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The CSSS is a rare complication after CABG using the IMA, first described by Harjola and Valle in 1974. The incidence varies between 0.07 and 3.4%, early and late onsets (2–31 years after CABG) have been described. The most common cause is a stenosis or an occlusion of the left SA proximal to the origin of the LIMA graft, leading to a flow reversal and MIS after strain of the left arm.

Due to an incidence of SA stenoses of up to 2.7% in patients requiring CABG surgery and the increased use of the IMA as a CABG-conduit, a standardized preoperative screening of these patients for SA stenoses before undergoing CABG surgery using the IMA has been repeatedly recommended. In the case of a SA stenosis, a simultaneous therapy performing the CABG and an interventional or surgical therapy for the SA lesion should be considered. The clinical presentations vary from an asymptomatic steal phenomenon to silent ischemia, unspecific cardiac symptoms, rarely different forms of MIN or even heart failure. Our patient suffered from a manifest NSTEMI with elevated troponin levels and clinical symptoms. The SA stenosis may also lead to symptoms in the arm after exhaustive strain, including all symptoms of extremity ischemia, which were also present in our patient. Diagnostic procedures include bilateral blood pressure measurements (in case of physiological measurements also with careful provocative studies), as well as Doppler and duplex sonography of the SA. To evaluate the vascular configuration as well as the presence of a stenosis or occlusion and to validate the patency of the arteries, a CT- or MR-A of the aortic arch and its branches might be performed. Angiography remains the gold standard as it may be performed together with an additional CA. It can prove the patency of the CABG and allows a simultaneous therapeutic intervention of the SA pathology. Regarding the therapeutic options, interventional procedures like plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA), stent implantation, cutting balloon or laser as well as various open surgical approaches like the performance of a CSB, an aorto-subclavian bypass, a carotid-axillary bypass, an axillo-axillary bypass, a subclavian-to-carotid transposition, a subclavian-subclavian bypass or a re-insertion of the IMA-graft into the aorta have been described. In case interventional therapy is not an option or a failed interventional therapy attempt, mainly due to severe calcifications of the SA, bypass surgery is required. That is even the case in sick patients with severe CSSS symptoms, where an interventional therapy was attempted initially. Even if most CSSS might be treated interventionally, a few reports, including our case, suggest that bypass surgery is possible even in advanced stages of CSSS as demonstrated in our patient, who suffered a NSTEMI. Regarding our approach, it is crucial to rule out an ICA stenosis before performing a CSB to prevent cerebral ischemia. Regarding the surgical treatment of the CSSS in general, excellent long term results might be achieved while 5-year re-stenosis rates of POBA and stent therapies reach 41% and 16%, respectively.

### Frequency of subclavian steal syndrome in a sample of non-Western population [^91634028]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Subclavian steal syndrome (SSS) is not rarely found during ultrasound examinations. Previous reports demonstrated a relation between ethnic factors and SSS. Data regarding SSS in non-Western population are still lacking. We aimed to investigate the frequency of SSS in a sample of Egyptian population.

Methods

In a single-center observational study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of successive patients with competent ultrasound examinations of the brain supplying vessels. The patients presented to our neurovascular laboratory in the context of routine clinical practice.

Results

We enrolled 514 patients in our study. SSS was detected in 9 patients (1.8 %) with a median (IQR) age of 58 (56-63) years. One patient with second-degree SSS received a subclavian stent. Among patients with SSS, 4 patients (44.4 %) had carotid atherosclerosis, 4 patients (44.4 %) had ischemic vascular events in the posterior circulation, and two (22.2 %) had hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis ≥50 %. Using a ROC curve, an interarm SBP (systolic blood pressure) difference of ≥10 mmHg had a sensitivity of 77.8 % and specificity of 66 %, whereas a difference of ≥20 mmHg was associated with a sensitivity of 55.6 % and specificity of 92.4 % for SSS (AUC 0.79, 95 % CI 0.6-0.97, p = 0.004).

Conclusions

SSS is not rare among Egyptian population and should be in mind during ultrasound examination, especially for patient with ischemic events in the posterior circulation and those with significant interarm SBP difference.

### Results of transradial subclavian artery percutaneous interventions after bilateral or single access [^9ae9df28]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Percutaneous treatment of subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion has become more popular compared with surgical correction. We compared the early and late results of subclavian artery stenting with bilateral or single transradial access. From 2010 to 2015, we recruited 54 consecutive patients. In 35 cases, we used bilateral access, and in 19 cases, ipsilateral single access was used. Left subclavian artery was the culprit vessel in 72% of cases. There were more chronic total occlusions in the bilateral group (77% vs 21%, p = 0.0001). Transradial-only approach was used in all cases, except in 2 cases in the bilateral group where crossover to femoral access was required. Stents were implanted in 94% in bilateral group and 84% in single group (p = 0.47). Procedure duration (40 [35 to 60] vs 20 [15 to 30] minutes), contrast volume (200 [200 to 350] vs 150 [100 to 200] ml and fluoroscopy time (20 [12 to 30] vs 8 [4 to 11] minutes) were higher in bilateral group (all p values <0.0001). Procedural success was 96%. Overall, we observed three <5-cm hematomas and 3 asymptomatic radial artery occlusions at hospital discharge. After successful procedure, blood pressure equalized in 94% in bilateral group and 100% in single group (p = 0.54). Major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event-free survival up to 5 years was 97% in bilateral group compared with 84% in single group (p = 0.12). Subclavian artery patency at late follow-up was 91% in bilateral group and 95% in single group (p = 1.00). Using single or bilateral transradial approach, subclavian artery lesions or occlusions can be effectively and safely treated without the risks of femoral or brachial access.

### Inter-arm blood pressure difference as a tool for predicting coronary artery disease severity [^3ab82acb]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Osler initially defined the interarm blood pressure difference (IABPD) in 1915,since then this easily obtained noninvasive parameter is being practised all over the globe.In contrast to the right artery, the left subclavian artery forms an acute angle at its origin from the aorta, resulting in decreased blood flow. Consequently, right arm blood pressure (BP) is typically greater than left arm BP, leading in IABPD.As a clinical recommendation for hypertensive condition, an IABPD less than 10 mm Hg is regarded to be normal.In patients with advanced atherosclerosis, however, significant arm-to-arm changes in BP have been found.

Ischaemic heart illnesses are among the leading causes of death on a global scale, although the relationship between IABPD and coronary artery disease (CAD) remains poorly understood.IABPD with systolic BP (SBP) more than 5 or 10 mm Hg was an independent factor of unfavourable cardiovascular outcome and all-cause mortality, according to a cohort analysis of people without a history of cardiovascular disease.Patients with a higher IABPD SBP seemed to have a greater rate of CAD and cerebrovascular disease, as well as a higher 10-year cardiovascular risk, according to a different prospective study (CoCoNet) involving 3699 participants.Sixty-three per cent of patients with IABPD of 15 mm Hg or higher had CAD involving at least one coronary artery, and 83% of those patients with CAD had multivessel CAD, according to a study that examined the association between IABPD and CAD in 283 patients who had coronary angiography.However, seven further investigations found no significant relationship between pre-existing CAD and IABPD, while other prospective studies found that an IABPD of 10 mm Hg or above increased the development of CAD (despite the fact that these investigations were restricted by the use of non-invasive methods of diagnosis).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the link between IABPD and CAD severity in order to establish IABPD as a predictor of CAD severity. Findings from our research can help establish the role of IABPD as a tool for assessing atherosclerotic severity of CAD and thus help prevent the progression of atherosclerosis by aggressive risk factor interventions and reduce cardiovascular mortality.

Circulation (2008). Medium credibility.

Coarctation of the aorta—clinical features and examination of unrepaired adults emphasize upper–lower extremity blood pressure differences, pulse delays, and characteristic murmurs. Hypertension is described in the right arm relative to the legs unless there is an anomalous right subclavian artery, and a pulse delay between the right arm and femoral or popliteal arteries may be present. Murmurs or bruits can be heard in the left interscapular area or over parasternal regions due to collaterals, and auscultation should assess for findings suggesting bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction, or aortic regurgitation (AR).

### Blood pressure measurements in patients with Takayasu arteritis: a work of caution [^1202bfee]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Takayasu arteritis is a large vessel vasculitis among young women that affects the aorta and its branches. Disease-related subclavian or brachial obstructions can lead to hypotensive brachial blood pressure values. By contrast, arterial hypertension is also frequent in this disease, possibly unrecognized in case of solitary brachial blood pressure measurement. We present the case of a 28-year-old woman with cerebral hypoperfusion related to Takayasu arteritis. Despite "pseudo-hypotensive" brachial blood pressure values of 70 mm Hg, Doppler measurement of the ankle revealed a systolic pressure of 220 mm Hg. In Takayasu vasculitis, additional ankle pressure measurement may represent the true cardiac load and blood pressure.

### Arterial hand ulcer: a common disease in an uncommon location [^3c3ed222]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A preoperative evaluation found a weak right radial pulse relative to the left and a systolic blood pressure of 74 on the right arm and 145 on the left arm, which prompted a duplex ultrasound scan. This finding demonstrated apparent occlusion of the right subclavian, axillary, and radial arteries. On further questioning, the patient recalled a clavicular fracture in 1987 that required surgical repair and reported pain with use of the right upper extremity ever since. The location of the clavicular plate and screw corresponded with the level of subclavian stenosis. He underwent a right carotid-to-ulnar bypass, and the hand ulcers and pain completely resolved (Fig 3).

### Outcome of conservative versus interventional treatment of subclavian artery stenosis [^60f5cb8f]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the outcome of conservative treatment versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of subclavian artery stenosis in terms of long-term hemodynamic and symptomatic outcome in a retrospective, nonrandomized study.

Methods

Within a 14-year period, 295 consecutive inpatients were treated for subclavian artery stenosis. Excluding 21 (7%) surgical cases, the remaining 274 patients were treated either conservatively (n = 165) or with PTA (n = 109). Medical history, physical findings, and sonographic and angiographic data were recorded from the medical records of the 223 (81%) patients who were followed until the year 2000; 166 patients were then reinvestigated with oscillography, Doppler measurements, and duplex sonography. Outcomes of conservative versus interventional therapy were analyzed based on the intention to treat principle.

Results

After a median 42-month follow-up (interquartile range 18-85), patients treated with PTA had a 60% risk reduction for hemodynamic subclavian stenosis compared to conservative treatment (adjusted hazard ratio 0.4, 95% confidence interval 0.2-0.6, p<0.0001). However, the risk of having a symptomatic stenosis at the time of follow-up did not differ between the treatment groups (p=0.3).

Conclusions

Endovascular revascularization improves the long-term hemodynamic outcome in patients with subclavian stenosis, but many conservatively treated patients become asymptomatic during follow-up. Interventional treatment may be considered primarily for patients with severe symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency, critical ischemia, or peripheral emboli.

### Use of a pressure-sensing wire to detect sequential pressure gradients for ipsilateral vertebral and subclavian artery stenoses [^8deea945]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2005). Low credibility.

Endoluminal stent placement is safe and effective in the treatment of symptomatic ostial stenoses of the vertebral artery (VA) and proximal subclavian artery (SCA). However, determining the relative importance of an individual lesion on angiography is difficult when VA and SCA stenoses are concurrent. Pressure-sensing wires help in determining the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis. We present a case of ipsilateral VA and SCA stenoses in which a pressure-sensing wire was used in making interventional decisions.

### Surgical approach for aortic coarctation influences arterial compliance and blood pressure control [^caf1feff]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Increased arterial stiffness is linked to hypertension in adults after surgical repair for coarctation of the aorta. We evaluated the influence of surgical approaches, namely, subclavian flap repair (SFR) and end-to-end anastomosis (EEA), on arterial stiffness, blood pressure, cardiac output, and cardiac baroreceptor function in a cohort of young children after coarctation repair to determine if the surgical approach influenced longer term blood pressure control.

Methods

We measured pulse wave velocity in 21 children with a mean age of 5 years, after early (less than 6 months) coarctation repair (SFR, n = 11; EEA, n = 10), and compared these with 18 matched controls. Blood pressure was recorded on three occasions from the right arm. Cardiac output was recorded using a transthoracic bioimpedence technique. We measured spontaneous baroreceptor reflex sensitivity to evaluate whether increased arterial stiffness was associated with reduced aortic baroreflex sensitivity.

Results

Right arm systolic blood pressure (108.3 + or - 3.5 mm Hg SFR versus 97.8 + or - 2.9 mm Hg EEA, p = 0.03) and pulse wave velocity (6.0 + or - 0.2 ms(-1) SFR versus 5.2 + or - 0.2 ms(-1) EEA, p = 0.02) were significantly greater in the SFR compared with EEA group. Blood pressure and pulse wave velocity were also higher in the SFR group compared with controls. These differences were not demonstrated when comparing the EEA group with controls. There was no difference in stroke volume, spontaneous baroreceptor reflex sensitivity, or heart rate or blood pressure variability between the groups.

Conclusions

Young children undergoing SFR have higher blood pressure and stiffer upper limb arteries compared with matched children undergoing EEA. Our data suggest that better longer-term cardiovascular outcome is to be expected with the EEA surgical approach.

### Non-coronary atherosclerotic arterial disease: where are we now? [^06975d56]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease are significant vascular conditions with distinct clinical presentations and diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. The lower extremity peripheral artery is associated with worse major adverse cardiovascular events compared with coronary artery disease, but often remains underdiagnosed and undertreated. Upper extremity artery disease encompasses a range of clinical presentations resulting from atherosclerosis and other obstructive lesions in arteries such as the subclavian artery and brachiocephalic trunk. While atherosclerosis is a common cause, non-atherosclerotic factors can also influence distal lesions. This review aims to synthesize existing knowledge on both conditions, encompassing risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic modalities, and treatment options. Improved awareness and early intervention can mitigate complications and enhance patient outcomes for lower extremity peripheral artery and upper extremity artery disease.

### Arterial compression in patients with NTOS (...) [^7f116b82]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

There is a significant increase in the blood flow velocity of the subclavian artery from 163 cm/s in arm adduction to 335 cm/s with arm abduction. There is a significant decrease in the blood flow velocity of the subclavian artery from 167 cm/s in arm adduction to 0 cm/s with arm abduction. A detailed medical record review and physical examination were performed in addition to imaging studies. Patients with symptoms indicative of vascular compression received duplex scanning to assess patency. Evidence of previous thrombosis can be seen as chronic changes in the vein wall, and compression of the subclavian artery can be seen in abduction of the arm with a significant change in blood flow velocities. In our vascular laboratory, significant compression of the subclavian artery is defined as an increase of more than 50% or a decrease of more than 50% in subclavian artery flow velocities on arm abduction.

Chest radiographs were obtained to detect rib abnormalities as a potential cause of arterial compression. A subset of 22 patients was classified as having arterial compression without thrombosis or aneurysm. Patients were included in this study if they had signs and symptoms of arterial compression in addition to NTOS, received FRRS, and returned for follow-up postoperatively. Compression of the brachial plexus nerves or subclavian vessels as they pass through the thoracic outlet can cause irritation or injury to the neurovascular structures, resulting in many neurological and/or vascular signs and symptoms. Compression of the subclavian artery is rare, and most patients with NTOS only have compression of the brachial plexus nerves. However, there is a small subset of patients with a preliminary diagnosis of NTOS who are found, on further examination, to have an arterial component to their condition.

In our study, patients’ symptoms did not improve with physical therapy because of the arterial component. When patients with NTOS are found to have compression of the subclavian artery, they should be treated surgically sooner than patients who solely have neurogenic symptoms. Conservative measures should not be implemented in this patient subset because arterial compression does not allow patients’ symptoms to improve with physical therapy. Chronic compression causes repetitive injury to the subclavian artery wall, which can potentially result in stenosis or thrombosis. 4 Progressive damage to the arterial wall can lead to aneurysm formation, ultimately resulting in local occlusion or distal embolization. 5.

### Subclavian artery stenting: factors influencing long-term outcome [^4af2e89f]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

This study provides extended follow-up of a nonrandomized series of symptomatic patients who underwent subclavian stent-supported angioplasty (SSA) with emphasis on preprocedure factors that may have influenced outcome. The endpoints of mortality and restenosis were analyzed using backward stepwise logistic regression with the following clinical variables: coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insufficiency/failure, and hypothyroidism. Restenosis is reported based on prospective serial noninvasive studies and/or angiography. Mortality was evaluated by retrospective database review and inquiry to the State Department of Health and Human Services' statistical registry in patients who were lost to follow-up. Over a 9-year period (mean follow-up, 36.1 +/- 30.4 months; maximum observation, 109.5 months), 101 stents were placed in 91 consecutive patients (37 male, 54 female). The mean age at intervention was 62.03 +/- 9.3. The procedure was technically successful in 89 patients 97% (mean pre- and postoperative stenosis and pressure gradients were 90.2% +/- 9.4% vs. 3.7% +/- 6.6%, P < 0.001, and 59.9 +/- 35.2 vs. 0 mm Hg, P < 0.001, respectively), with 13 minor complications and no immediate major complications. One patient died of unrelated causes within 30 days. Per Kaplan-Meier method, for years 1 through 5, the rates of overall patency were 96%, 91%, 86%, 77%, and 72%; likewise, overall patient survival was 93%, 88%, 8%4, 81%, and 76%. No clear predictors for restenosis were discovered, although a trend toward higher recurrence was noted in women (18.5% in female vs. and 8.6% in male; P > 0.05), but the same were less likely to die during follow-up (P > 0.001). Also, the presence of hypothyroidism (P = 0.004) and increasing age (P = 0.068) were positively correlated with all-cause mortality. This study suggests that SSA is predictable, safe, and durable. The diagnosis of symptomatic subclavian disease is of prognostic importance, with age and male gender representing important predictors of all-cause long-term mortality. The strong association of increased mortality with hypothyroidism is difficult to discard and raises the question of a yet to be described thyroid steal phenomena.

### Validation of a suprasystolic cuff system for static and dynamic representation of the central pressure waveform [^542c6218]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is widely acknowledged as the predominant risk factor for cardiovascular disease.Despite the considerable impacts on human health and the economic burdens of hypertension, a significant portion of individuals reporting elevated BP experience uncontrolled hypertension.Recent understandings of cardiovascular disease are evolving and have shed light on the intricate interplay of hypertension and arterial hemodynamics in the development of BP elevation and cardiovascular risk.Pulsatile hemodynamics have distinct contributions on the components of the pulse waveform and can serve as markers for risk assessment. To that end, pulse waveform analysis aims to decipher noninvasive pressure pulsations to interrogate central cardiovascular dynamics for clinical purposes.

The gold standard for the central waveform measurement is aortic catheterization. As this procedure is invasive and time consuming, several noninvasive methods have been proposed.Applanation tonometry became the gold standard for noninvasive pulse waveform measurement after studies demonstrated the enhanced predictive capability of noninvasive central BP compared with brachial BP.Subsequent research revealed that analyzing pulse waveforms from arterial tonometry is also proficient in capturing clinically significant cardiovascular hemodynamics.,Tonometry relies on flattening an artery between the tonometer and a rigid structure.However, considering that arteries are predominantly surrounded by soft tissues, arterial applanation as described in principle is a clinical obstacle.These challenges often lead to reduced measurement repeatability, even when administered by skilled clinicians.As a result, the integration of applanation tonometry in clinical practice has faced obstacles, prompting exploration of alternative solutions that leverage cuff‐based methods.

Occlusive cuff methods use a brachial cuff with inflate‐and‐hold capabilities to capture the pulse waveform.,,,,,,,The all‐encompassing nature of the brachial cuff, encircling the entire arm, effectively confines the artery within its structure. Additionally, the automated functionality of cuff‐based systems eliminates the need of a trained clinician during operation without undermining result variability. However, the main shortcoming of cuff‐based pulse waveform acquisition devices is the low waveform resolution. Recent advances in medical technologies have addressed these issues by creating cuff‐based systems with high‐fidelity waveform acquisition.Much discussion has been dedicated to selecting the cuff pressure for the most accurate representation of central pressure, yet no consensus has been reached.,,The fluid dynamic principles behind the suprasystolic blood pressure (sSBP) hold pressure suggest that blocking flow in the subclavian artery would effectively create a pressure tap into the central cardiovascular system, giving the closest representation of a pressure‐only central waveform.

### Inter-arm blood pressure difference as a tool for predicting coronary artery disease severity [^1abff3df]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This was one of the first studies, to the best of the researchers’ knowledge, to attempt to explore the relationship between the risk of developing CAD and the Gensini score in the setting of Bangladesh. While the prevalence of CAD has increased significantly among the Bangladeshi population in recent years, few studies have been undertaken to create or apply a system for disease identification earlier.

The difference between arms’ BP is one such critical diagnostic and prognostic factor. Our study discovered a significant difference in diastolic and pulse pressures between the two arms. Among the participants in our study, 57 (51.82%) participants had normal IABPD and 53 (48.18%) participants had raised (>10 mm Hg) IABPD. Extensive research has been undertaken to gain a better understanding of the clinical importance of interarm BP, both systolic and diastolic, with the difference generally being greater in the right than in the left.This was mostly owing to the acute angle formed by the left subclavian artery, which reduced blood flow and, consequently, BP, in comparison to the right.Consistently, research has revealed that an increase in IAD difference is associated with an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,as well as a possible prognostic factor.A greater difference of 5–10 mm Hg was particularly consistent with a greater risk for the patients.

### The normal difference in bilateral indirect blood pressure recordings in hypertensive individuals [^9ec0b372]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

If there is a significant dichotomy between bilateral systolic blood pressure determinations in both arms in hypertensive individuals, it is often taken as a sign of underlying pathology. The primary objective was to determine what the normal variation might be for a significant difference between blood pressures in both arms. A clinically significant difference was chosen as a systolic blood pressure value greater than 10 mm Hg between the upper extremities, as is commonly quoted at the bedside and in the literature.

Methods

Bilateral indirect blood pressure determinations were obtained in 100 subjects with hypertension in the sitting position. The blood pressure was obtained by two observers, one the recorder and the other who obtained the blood pressure but was blinded to the actual values taken. The order of blood pressure determination in the first arm was determined prior to the study from a table of random numbers. The coefficient of variation in obtaining the blood pressure in each arm was determined in 5 of the 100 subjects. The age, sex, and handedness of each individual were recorded as demographic variables.

Results

The average left and right systolic blood pressures were 139 +/- 22 and 141 +/- 22 mm Hg, respectively. The average left and right diastolic blood pressures were 78 +/- 12 and 79 +/- 13 mm Hg, respectively. There was no significant difference between left minus right systolic or diastolic differences (paired t-test). There was no significant difference between systolic or diastolic blood pressures between gender or between left- and right-handed individuals (nonpaired t-test). The average coefficients of variation for taking right and left arm systolic pressures were 2.90% and 1.32%, respectively. Eighteen subjects (18%) had differences in systolic blood pressure between both arms exceeding 10 mm Hg (10% to 26%, 95% confidence interval).

Conclusions

Differences of more than 10 mm Hg in indirect systolic blood pressure recordings between arms are frequent in asymptomatic hypertensive individuals and do not per se indicate any pathologic condition. In the right clinical situation, differences that are noted should be repeated and should be added to the total clinical picture when used to determine whether a pathologic condition is present. Assuming no significant aortic or subclavian disease in the population tested, the specificity of the bilateral blood pressure test was 82%.

### Impact of transvenous cardiac implantable electronic devices in chronic hemodialysis patients: a single-center, observational comparative study [^b48aeda6]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The results of our current study indicate that the incidence of any systemic complications, especially CV stenosis ipsilateral to the CIED lead, was higher in patients with ipsilateral CIED and VA placement (with clinical significance), whereas any-cause mortality and cardiac mortality did not differ between the 2 groups. In contrast to a recent study that reported poor outcomes for VA with ipsilateral CIED leads, our analysis showed similar median primary and secondary patency for VA ipsilateral vs contralateral to CIED leads, and there was no significant difference in patency rate between patients with forearm vs upper arm VA.

Considering that the long-term patency of a functioning VA is extremely important for quality of life and longevity in patients with CKD requiring dialysis through an upper limb arteriovenous VA, CV stenosis is considered a serious complication contributing to dialysis VA dysfunction. CV stenosis, reported to occur in as many as 60% of non-hemodialysis-dependent patients with a CIED, is generally asymptomatic. However, chronic hemodialysis patients with ipsilateral CIED and VA placement are at particular risk of developing symptoms, such as edema of the face, neck, breast, shoulder, and arm, on account of progressive CV stenosis. Symptomatic stenosis or occlusion has been reported to be more frequently associated with high-flow VAs, because of the abnormal hemodynamics that accompanies increased blood flow through the central veins. Additionally, it has been reported that elevated venous pressures and high recirculation rates represent arteriovenous VA dysfunction, leading to reduce patency in patients with transvenous CIEDs. CV stenosis can implicate the subclavian, brachiocephalic veins, and the superior vena cava. Despite these previous reports, the association between a transvenous CIED and clinical outcomes among chronic hemodialysis patients remains controversial. In our study, the incidence of CV stenosis or occlusion was markedly low compared to previous studies ; this may be explained by the fact that our study included only the symptomatic cases confirmed by fistulogram.

### Subclavian artery disease: diagnosis and therapy [^2e35641c]. The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of brachiocephalic disease is often overlooked. Symptoms include arm claudication and vertebrobasilar insufficiency. In patients who have had the use of the internal mammary artery for coronary bypass surgery, the development of symptoms of myocardial ischemia should alert the clinician to the possibility of subclavian artery stenosis. Also, in patients who have had axillofemoral bypass, lower-extremity claudication may occur. Recognition involves physical examination and accurate noninvasive testing. Endovascular therapy has proven to be effective in alleviating symptoms in properly selected patients.

KDIGO 2021 chronic kidney disease (CKD) blood pressure—safety and clinical events with intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) target: The SBP target of <120 mm Hg is described as generally safe and, in most adults, beneficial and not associated with increased significant adverse events. In the SPRINT CKD subgroup, there was no significant difference in serious adverse events or adverse events associated with hypotension, bradycardia, and injurious falls between the intensive (<120 mm Hg SBP) and standard (<140 mm Hg SBP) arms. Among participants aged ≥75 years or ≥80 years at baseline, approximately 44% and 50% had an eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and the adverse event risk profile with intensive BP lowering remained favorable, with no differences in serious adverse events and injurious falls. Orthostatic hypotension was not associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events, falls, or syncope; however, it is reasonable to consider a change in medications or less-intensive therapy if the patient is symptomatic or BP is excessively low (e.g., SBP <100 mm Hg). In severe carotid stenosis, an SBP <120 mm Hg may be insufficient to maintain cerebral perfusion, and even an SBP of 150 mm Hg may be insufficient.

Treatment

Following a multidisciplinary team discussion involving rheumatologists, radiologists and haematologists, the treatment priority was considered to be control of the refractory hypertension. The patient underwent successful angioplasty of both the right renal artery stenosis and that involving the superior left renal artery. The arteries were balloon-dilated (to 6 mm on the left and 5 mm on the right), resulting in much improved angiographic appearances postintervention (figure 1C). Although attempts were made to cross the occluded segment involving the proximal portion of the left lower pole anomalous renal artery, these were unsuccessful. Following the procedure the blood pressure fell from 241/122 mm Hg to 130/80 mm Hg. The reduction in blood pressure was noted in the right arm, and was not measured in the left arm due to the left subclavian artery stenosis. Following the renal artery angioplasty the dose of doxazosin and bisoprolol were reduced prior to discharge. He was subsequently withdrawn from antihypertensive medication at the follow-up appointment.

### Management of vascular access inflow-outflow imbalance: a bimodal approach [^c091c099]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 3. 
50% stenosis with a high Qa. The 7 mm segment in this two-dimensional image is not flow limiting.

A stenotic lesion has a clinical effect because of its impact on blood flow. The term “critical stenosis” depends on hemodynamics associated with the lesion. Angiography alone cannot provide an estimate of the hemodynamic significance of a stenotic lesion.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based upon an arterial blood flow model,, and combined clinical with CFD analysis based upon AVF models,,,, have produced evidence that the hemodynamic changes associated with stenosis are not related to the percent decrease in luminal diameter but rather the absolute residual or minimal luminal diameter (MLD) and the length of the lesion. Clinical significance will be influenced by Qa and associated access pressure. Importantly, the determination of MLD can be more accurately accomplished because a comparator vessel is not involved. These factors favor this metric as a more reliable indicator for determining the significance of a stenotic lesion.

This principle is especially true when dealing with central venous lesions where the increased pressure resulting from a stenotic lesion can result in a markedly enlarged vein. While it may be impractical to measure MLD routinely, recognition of this principle is important, and the experienced operator can estimate MLD with a reasonable degree of accuracy.Central vein stenoses are not rare and many are asymptomatic, but they can become clinically manifest when Qa increases (arm swelling, increased venous pressure, prolonged bleeding after needle withdrawal among other problems). Dilating a venous segment to match an adjacent 12–14 mm vein is unnecessary and cannot be justified. The critical issue is the effect (if any) that the lesion has on Qa. Two lesions can appear similar based upon anatomical criteria but be quite different when Qa is considered (Figure 4). If Qa is not reduced, then the clinical problem relates to excessive inflow rather than restricted outflow. Importantly, balloon angioplasty treatment of such a non-critical venous outflow lesion not only carries the risk of associated procedural complications but may hasten progression of such lesions due to increasing neointimal hyperplasia.

### The epidemiology of subclavian artery calcification [^392507cf]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence and risk factor associations for subclavian artery calcification.

Background

Arterial calcification is a marker of atherosclerosis, and its presence portends an adverse prognostic risk. The prevalence and associated risk factors for aortic arch, carotid, renal, and coronary calcification have been well described. Fewer data are available for subclavian artery calcification.

Methods

Electron-beam computed tomography was used to evaluate the extent of vascular calcification in multiple arterial beds in 1387 consecutive individuals who presented for preventive medicine services at a university-affiliated disease prevention center. Laboratory values for blood pressure, lipids, anthropomorphic data, and self-reported medical history were obtained.

Results

Subclavian artery calcification was present in 439 of 1387 individuals (31.7%). Those with subclavian artery calcification were significantly older, had a smaller body mass index, and were more likely to also have calcification of nonsubclavian vascular beds. When adjusted for cardiovascular disease risk factors, the presence of subclavian artery calcification was significantly associated with age (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.04; P < .001), hypertension (PR, 1.20; P = .01), history of smoking (PR, 1.21; P = .01), and calcification in nonsubclavian vascular beds (PR, 1.58; P = .01). Subclavian artery calcification was also associated with an increased pulse pressure (β-coefficient = 2.2, P = .008).

Conclusions

Subclavian artery calcification is relatively common and is significantly associated with age, smoking, hypertension, and nonsubclavian vascular calcification. There may be a relationship between vascular stiffness, as manifested by a widened pulse pressure, and the presence of subclavian artery calcification.

### Insights into imaging of aortitis [^749aff3f]. Insights Into Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Two phases, early acute and late chronic, are seen in TA. In the early phase, so-called “B” symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, anorexia and malaise, are common. Chronic phase symptoms are determined by the organs involved, with fewer constitutional symptoms, and with claudication, cerebrovascular insufficiency, carotid artery pain and renal artery involvement most frequently reported. Hypertension due to renal artery involvement is particularly frequent among the Indian population.

Aortic aneurysm or stenosis has been reported in up to one-third of the cases. In the order of frequency, aneurysmal formation is seen in descending, abdominal and ascending aortic segments. Stenosis of the aorta is even more frequent, occurring in 53 % of cases based on a National Institutes of Health series, mostly affecting the abdominal aorta (up to 70 % of aortic stenosis cases).

Diagnosis

Takayasu arteritis is diagnosed based on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria (Table 2).
Age of onset younger than 40 years
Intermittent claudication
Diminished brachial artery pulse
Subclavian artery or aortic bruit
Blood pressure difference greater than 10 mmHg (arms)
Angiographic (CT, MR) evidence of stenosis

If three out of six criteria are present, the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis according to these criteria are 90 % and 98 % respectively. Laboratory tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are elevated in 70 % of patients in the acute and 50 % of patients in the chronic stage of the disease.

Ultrasound images of the vessel after PTA procedure. Abbreviation: PTA, Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty. Note: (A) Ultrasound shows an increase in the lumen diameter of the original stenosis after balloon dilation (arrow); (B) Color Doppler flow image shows adequate blood flow in the original stenosis segment (arrow)

Both procedures were performed by the same physician from the Department of Nephrology of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. After the surgery, all the patients were advised to avoid any blood sampling, use of this arm to measure blood pressure, wearing tight clothing or heavy jewelry, lifting heavy objects and compressing the affected limb etc. Patients were instructed to perform functional exercises for one week after discharge from the hospital. At the first post-operative dialysis, instruct the nurse to slowly adjust the pump-controlled blood flow rate of the dialysis machine from 180 ml/min until the dialysis machine alarmed, the dialysis line pumped, microbubbles were generated in the arterial pot, and the absolute value of the arterial pressure before the pump was measured to increase, and then stop. Record the value, which was the maximum pump-controlled blood flow rate that the patient could tolerate. Then slowly adjust the pump-controlled blood flow downward until the patient’s symptoms disappear and the blood pressure returns to normal level. Fistula’s function was obtained at 3, 6, and 9 months through outpatient follow-up visits.

Definitions and classifications

Technical success is defined as the restoration of blood flow combined with less than 30% residual diameter stenosis. Clinical success is defined as at least one successful dialysis using the AVF after treatment. Primary patency is defined as the time between vascular access creation and the first reintervention due to AVF dysfunction or thrombosis. Secondary patency is defined as the time between one or more interventions and the abandonment of this vascular access. Patency time is defined as the interval between the procedure and the first puncture for dialysis. According to the anatomical site of stenosis, the immature AVF can be divided into 3 types : type I: the juxta-anastomotic area; type II: the outflow vein, especially in the hemodialysis punctured sites; type III: the venous confluence area or central vein, especially in the cephalic-axillary vein confluence or the subclavian-innominate vein confluence.

### Subclavian steal syndrome: a rare cause of syncope-AAFP (...) [^27f85bed]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

The subclavian steal syndrome is a rare but important cause of syncope. Since recognition of this syndrome can lead to successful treatment, a review by Chan-Tack emphasizes the need for a high index of suspicion in patients with a suggestive history, risk factors and physical findings, such as symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency. The syndrome results from occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery and the development of retrograde flow to the subclavian artery from the vertebral artery. The decreased blood flow to the posterior brain and upper extremity on the affected side results in a range of symptoms. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency may produce light-headedness, dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, visual disturbances, motor deficits, confusion, focal seizures, aphasia, headaches or syncope. Reduced blood flow to the arm causes symptoms such as weakness, coldness, paresthesias or arm claudication after exercise.

Arm symptoms are generally less frequent and occur later than the vertebrobasilar symptoms. Although the incidence and prevalence of subclavian steal syndrome are unknown, it generally occurs in patients older than 55 years and has a 2: 1 male-to-female ratio. Risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, tobacco use and vigorous exercise of the affected extremity. In more than 95 percent of cases, arteriosclerosis causes occlusion of the proximal subclavian artery, but other potential causes include dissecting aortic arch aneurysm, embolism and Takayasu's arteritis. Symptoms may be precipitated by vigorous exercise of the arm, especially if combined with sudden sharp turning of the head to the affected side. Physical examination findings may include unilaterally decreased pulses on the affected side, a blood pressure difference of greater than 20 mm Hg between the arms, supraclavicular bruits and disappearance of the radial pulse on exercise or elevation of the arm.

The diagnosis may be confirmed by carotid duplex ultrasonography and magnetic resonance angiography, or arch aortography. Symptomatic patients require operative intervention such as axilloaxillary bypass, carotid-subclavian bypass or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery with stent placement. Aggressive management of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use is also essential for successful treatment of this syndrome.

Angiography findings revealed bilateral subclavian artery stenosis and left axillary artery occlusion without intracranial vasculopathy. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was normal and C-reactive protein level was 1. 6 mg/0. 1 L. Deep tendon reflexes were increased in the legs with a left extensor plantar response. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 30 mm/h and C-reactive protein level was 0. 3 mg/0. 1 L. Computed tomographic angiography revealed extensive large-artery disease involving the right brachiocephalic, left subclavian, and vertebral, bilateral axillary and common carotid arteries; the celiac trunk; and the right renal artery.

A, Coronal maximum intensity projection reconstructions at the origin of the great vessels show moderate focal narrowing of the right brachiocephalic artery and multiple focal areas of narrowing along the left subclavian and axillary arteries with segmental occlusion distally; the right subclavian artery was partially obscured by contrast in the adjacent vein, although severe stenosis and occlusion were seen distally in the right axillary artery. Focal narrowing was seen at the origin of the left vertebral artery. B, Volume rendering shows the origin of the great vessels with focal narrowing of the left subclavian artery, as well as areas of occlusion distally. Failure to reconstruct the proximal right subclavian artery is due to reflux of contrast in the adjacent vein, as detailed in panel A.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rates and C-reactive protein level during the next 4 months were normal or mildly elevated. Our patient continues to improve. Four months later, she weighed 39. 5 kg, and pulses noted here remain patent. Permanent finger contractures limit mobility and other activities of daily living. Discussion Herein, we describe a remarkable case that satisfies American College of Rheumatology criteria for both GCA and Takayasu arteritis.

### Subclavian steal syndrome in a hemodialysis patient after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of arteriovenous access [^0d675094]. The Journal of Vascular Access (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

We describe a hemodialysis patient who developed subclavian steal syndrome via an arteriovenous fistula after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

Case Description

A 55-year-old female with end-stage renal failure due to polycystic kidney disease had been treated with hemodialysis for 10years. Because of an autologous arteriovenous fistula stenosis, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed. After successful treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, the patient developed dizziness. Magnetic resonance imaging with angiography of the brain and neck revealed normal bilateral subclavian and carotid arteries. However, flow in the left vertebral artery was not detected in time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography. The left vertebral artery showed completely reversed blood flow as detected by color duplex ultrasound. We also confirmed anterograde flow in the left vertebral artery by color duplex ultrasound with arteriovenous fistula compression. Arteriovenous flows before the arteriovenous fistula stenosis and post-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were 1146 and 2239mL/min, respectively. These findings suggested high-flow arteriovenous fistula led to the subclavian steal syndrome. The patient was subsequently treated by a flow reduction in the high-flow arteriovenous access using a modified graft inclusion technique. We decreased the arteriovenous fistula flow to 851mL/min, which remained under 850mL/min, 1year later. The brain natriuretic peptide level and right-ventricular pressure also decreased after treatment. A modified graft inclusion technique was successful in decreasing the high flow of the arteriovenous fistula, and improved subclavian steal syndrome symptom and cardiac overload.

Conclusion

This case shows that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for an arteriovenous fistula may induce subclavian steal syndrome, and a modified graft inclusion technique was useful in improving the high flow of an arteriovenous fistula.

Left subclavian artery management in descending TAA undergoing TEVAR—recommendations and supportive points are as follows: In patients with descending TAA who undergo TEVAR with planned left subclavian artery coverage, revascularization of the left subclavian artery before TEVAR is recommended to prevent spinal cord injury (SCI) and potentially to reduce stroke risk and prevent other ischemic complications. In patients with descending TAA who have undergone TEVAR with left subclavian coverage and develop SCI that is unresponsive to an increase in BP or a cerebrospinal fluid drain, left subclavian artery revascularization may be considered. Up to 40% of patients undergoing TEVAR for thoracic aneurysm repair require left subclavian artery coverage, preoperative left subclavian revascularization has been shown to decrease the rates of stroke and SCI, and vertebrobasilar insufficiency and left arm ischemia can also occur without left subclavian artery revascularization. Patients with a patent left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery coronary artery bypass graft, or who are otherwise reliant on inflow from the left subclavian artery (eg, for dialysis access), should undergo left subclavian revascularization to preserve flow; patients undergoing TEVAR with left subclavian coverage may not be hemodynamically stable enough to undergo preemptive revascularization, and if such patients go on to develop SCI after TEVAR, there have been case reports of SCI reversal with secondary revascularization of the left subclavian artery.

### 2022 ACC / AHA guideline for the diagnosis and management of aortic disease: a report of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^72bf514a]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Left subclavian artery management during TEVAR—recommendations: In patients with descending TAA who undergo TEVAR with planned left subclavian artery coverage, revascularization of the left subclavian artery before TEVAR is recommended to prevent spinal cord injury (SCI) and potentially to reduce stroke risk and prevent other ischemic complications (Class 1, Level B‑NR). In patients with descending TAA who have undergone TEVAR with left subclavian coverage and develop SCI that is unresponsive to an increase in BP or a cerebrospinal fluid drain, left subclavian artery revascularization may be considered (Class 2b, Level C‑LD).

### Associations of life's essential 8 with extent of multi-territorial atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis: a cross-sectional study [^8ac3f1b3]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Measurements of thoracoabdominal CTA

Atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis in coronary, subclavian, aorta, renal, and iliofemoral arteries were conducted for all the participants on a dual-source CT scanner (SOMATOM Force, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) at baseline survey. All participants were injected with the contrast medium iodixanol (320 mg I/mL [Visipaque, GE Healthcare]) for contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CTA based on a standard operating procedure. We used a multitask deep learning network to reconstruct the 3-D anatomical geometry of the input CTA images, and calculated quantitative results for plaque and stenosis. Atherosclerosis was classified by professionals based on the 3-D geometry, quantitative results, and CTA image. The evaluated coronary arterial segments included left main, left descending, left circumflex, obtuse margin, diagonal, septal branch, right coronary, posterior branches, and right posterior descending arteries. The subclavian arterial segments included left and right arteries. The aorta arterial segments included arcus aortae and abdominal aorta arteries. The renal arterial segments included left and right arteries. The iliofemoral arterial segments included common iliac, internal iliac and external iliofemoral arteries. Atherosclerotic plaque on CTA was assessed by tissue structures > 1 mm within or adjacent to the coronary artery lumen, and atherosclerotic stenosis was defined as stenosis 50–99% or occlusion in thoracoabdominal arteries. Imaging assessment was performed by 2 well-trained raters (Z.Z.Q. and Z.Z.X.) who were blinded to participants’ clinical information. The kappa coefficients of CTA markers between raters were 0.96 for the presence of plaque, and 0.72 for artery stenosis ≥ 50%.

Measurements of ABI

We measured ABI to assess atherosclerosis in peripheral arteries using a Doppler ultrasound device (Huntleigh Health Care Ltd) at baseline survey. ABI was calculated as the ratio of ankle SBP divided by arm SBP. An ABI ≤ 0.90 was considered abnormal in peripheral arteries by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/AHA guideline.

### Failing to palpate femoral pulses in adult hypertensive patients may lead to diagnostic wandering and major cerebrovascular events in cases of undetected aortic coarctation [^ac39afbe]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Patient 1 was a 27-year-old amateur basketball player referred by a sports cardiologist for the etiological assessment of uncontrolled hypertension despite triple antihypertensive therapy (20 mg olmesartan, 20 mg lercanidipine, and 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide). The patient presented weakness of the lower limbs, NYHA II exertional dyspnea, and atypical chest pain. Doppler ultrasound imaging of the carotid and subclavian arteries displayed normal blood flow velocity waveforms. The walls of the abdominal aorta and renal, digestive, and lower-limb arteries were normal, whereas the abdominal infra renal aorta was thin, with an external diameter of 13 mm. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound revealed “ tardus-parvus ” patterns of the blood flow velocity waveforms in the abdominal aorta and all side and terminal branches. A “ tardus-parvus ” pattern is a modification in the spectral analysis of the blood flow velocity waveform that combines three criteria: an enhanced systolic rise-time (by >0.07 s), a decrease in peak systolic velocity, and a low resistive index. The internal thoracic arteries, side branches of the subclavian arteries, and the epigastric arteries were dilated and anastomosed at epigastria. Pulsed Doppler ultrasound showed high levels of anterograde blood flow in the internal thoracic arteries and high levels of retrograde blood flow in the epigastric arteries supplying the femoral arteries (Fig. 1A–G). The ankle brachial index was low, at 95/145 mmHg. Electrocardiogram-gated multidetector computed tomography angiography, confirmed AC with tight stenosis at the aortic isthmus and the development of numerous large collateral arteries around the stenosis (Fig. 1H). The patient underwent very late endovascular treatment (60 weeks after diagnosis), consisting of the implantation of an uncovered stent in the thoracic aorta, with a good anatomical and functional outcome. This therapeutic endovascular procedure was preferred over end-to-end aortic anastomosis because of the presence of numerous large collateral vessels bypassing at the site of the AC. This treatment restored normal blood flow velocity waveforms patterns in all abdominal and lower-limb arteries, reflecting the restoration of normal blood pressure perfusion regimes. The antihypertensive treatment was then eased, and blood pressure was controlled with antihypertensive bi-therapy (olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide). The long time period between diagnosis and endovascular treatment was due a one-year stay of the patient in his country of origin.

### Erdheim-Chester disease: a rare cause of bilateral renal artery stenosis, mimicking large vessel vasculitis [^73421c90]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Seven years after the initial diagnosis of cutaneous LCH, the patient was noted to have developed refractory hypertension. The refractory hypertension was investigated with CT imaging which revealed changes suggestive of aortitis, with arterial wall thickening and bilateral renal artery stenosis, leading to a rheumatology referral. On review, the patient did not have weight loss, fevers or night sweats. There were no symptoms of claudication, but mobility had declined since the operations for spinal stenosis. He did not have bony pain, chest pain or dyspnoea.

On examination, blood pressure (BP) was raised in both arms. The left arm BP measured 140/100 mm Hg and the right arm BP was 180/110. The patient remained hypertensive despite medical management with: bisoprolol 10 mg daily, amlodipine 5 mg daily, doxazosin 8 mg daily and minoxidil 400 mg daily. ACE inhibitors were not used in light of the severe renal artery stenosis, as they may precipitate deteriorating renal function. The subclavian pulse on the left was weaker than the right, in keeping with previous subclavian stenosis. Pedal pulses were palpable. The peripheries were warm and well perfused with no trophic changes. There was no detectable lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable.

### Angioplasty of flow-limiting stenosis reduces aortic and brachial blood pressure in patients with peripheral artery disease [^c1870ce4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Angioplasty Improves Regional Blood Flow in the Target Leg

Conversely to aBP and bBP lowering, iliac artery angioplasty led to a significant increase in CFA blood flow of the target leg, whereas angioplasty in the more distal femoral arteries led to a modest increase in CFA blood flow. Factors governing blood flow to the affected extremity include the number, severity, and location of stenotic lesions, and the presence of collateral vessels. It is well understood that conduit vessel function is impaired in patients affected by PAD. Our previous results have indicated a local response to peripheral angioplasty by an improved local flow‐mediated vasodilation response to angioplasty.In this study, angioplasty of conduit vessels improved arterial flow and perfusion pressure, as indicated by an elevated ABI.
