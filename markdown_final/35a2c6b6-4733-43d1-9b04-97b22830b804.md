## Question

How can ovarian cancer present

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ovarian cancer can present, including symptoms, signs, stage at diagnosis, and the implications for early detection and evaluation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching epidemiology and stage distribution to frame why presentation is often late. Then, I should verify the core symptom complex and how to operationalize it for clinical suspicion. Next, I will examine physical findings and laboratory/imaging correlates that raise concern. After that, I need to consider subtype-specific patterns and why high-grade serous disease behaves differently. Finally, I should integrate guideline-based evaluation triggers and the role of CA-125 and ultrasound, while double-checking screening caveats and the impact of late presentation on outcomes.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and stage distribution, because this shapes how ovarian cancer "looks" at presentation. Most epithelial ovarian cancers are diagnosed at advanced FIGO stages III–IV, with more than 70% presenting with distant disease, which explains why symptoms are often diffuse and non-specific rather than localized to the pelvis [^113V6crW]. Wait, let me verify the survival gradient by stage to underscore the stakes: stage I disease can approach 90–95% five-year survival, whereas stage IV survival is around 20% or lower, reinforcing why early detection efforts focus on symptomatic recognition rather than population screening [^113jhvvw] [^112i2Xif].

> I will now examine the core symptom complex. The most consistently reported symptoms include abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating or abdominal distension, early satiety or difficulty eating, and urinary urgency or frequency. Importantly, these are non-specific and overlap with benign conditions, which contributes to diagnostic delay [^116JtFhp] [^115uRYUP]. Hold on, I should verify the temporal pattern that increases suspicion: when these symptoms are new, persistent, and occur more than 12 times per month for less than a year, that pattern warrants evaluation for ovarian cancer rather than reassurance alone [^115uRYUP] [^111HbTHh].

> Next, I should review additional symptoms that, while less specific, still matter clinically. Fatigue, back pain, constipation or altered bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss or change in appetite frequently accompany disease and can be early clues, particularly when they cluster with the core symptoms above [^116JtFhp] [^117Q4znC]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "vaginal bleeding" was a classic symptom; let me reconsider. Unusual vaginal bleeding is not a hallmark of ovarian cancer and should prompt evaluation for other gynecologic pathology, but if present with the above symptoms, it should still trigger a careful workup rather than being dismissed [^notfound].

> I need to check which individual symptoms carry the highest diagnostic weight when present. Systematic reviews and symptom-index studies suggest that abdominal or pelvic mass, marked distension, and specific pain or bloating patterns substantially increase the likelihood of ovarian cancer, with positive likelihood ratios ranging from roughly 9 to 30, though absence of these symptoms does not reliably rule out disease [^116Gh8Za]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; these tools are aids, not stand-alone diagnostics, and must be interpreted in the clinical context and with appropriate imaging and surgical evaluation when indicated [^116Gh8Za].

> Let me consider the physical examination findings that should heighten suspicion. A palpable, solid, fixed, or irregular adnexal or pelvic mass, particularly in a postmenopausal woman, is concerning, as is the presence of ascites or clinical signs of peritoneal carcinomatosis such as abdominal distension and a fluid wave, which often reflect advanced disease at presentation [^116LCwj4]. I should confirm that these findings, while not pathognomonic, mandate urgent gynecologic oncology referral and comprehensive staging rather than observation [^1166pp5F].

> Next, I should review laboratory and imaging correlates that support the clinical impression. CA-125 is elevated in about 80% of advanced cases but only about half of early-stage cases, and it is non-specific, rising in many benign gynecologic and non-gynecologic conditions; thus, it should not be used as a screening test in asymptomatic women, though it can support diagnosis and monitoring when combined with symptoms and imaging [^1129NDzc] [^113ibiww]. Transvaginal ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality to characterize adnexal masses, with features such as solid components, papillations, irregular walls, and multilocularity increasing malignancy risk; in resource-limited settings, abdominal ultrasound may be the only available modality, but it still informs triage decisions [^114VRdL7].

> I will now examine subtype-specific patterns, because not all ovarian cancers behave the same. High-grade serous carcinoma, the most common and lethal subtype, often arises from the distal fallopian tube and tends to present at advanced stage with rapid peritoneal spread, which helps explain why symptoms are diffuse and disease is often bulky at diagnosis [^114Q2sZX] [^113cVLb9]. In contrast, type I tumors such as low-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, and mucinous cancers are more indolent, may be linked to precursor lesions or endometriosis, and can occasionally present earlier, though they still account for a minority of cases and overall mortality remains dominated by high-grade serous disease [^112qGbSs] [^112ABWFZ].

> But wait, what if we try to screen asymptomatic women to catch this earlier? I should double-check the evidence on screening. Major guidelines and randomized trials show that population screening with CA-125 and ultrasound does not reduce ovarian cancer mortality and can cause harm through false positives and unnecessary surgeries; therefore, routine screening is not recommended for average-risk women, and evaluation should be symptom-triggered rather than screening-based [^116u5RfR] [^113V6crW]. Hold on, I should verify the nuance: in women with hereditary risk, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is the most effective prevention strategy, and screening may be considered in select high-risk contexts, but even there, data are limited and decisions should be individualized with genetic counseling [^116Yhpmf] [^113jghwK].

> Next, I should review how to translate this into a practical clinical approach. For any woman with new, persistent, and frequent abdominal or pelvic symptoms, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, obtain a careful symptom inventory and family history, perform a targeted abdominal and pelvic exam, and proceed to transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125 when feasible. If imaging reveals a suspicious mass or if clinical suspicion remains high, urgent referral to a gynecologic oncologist for definitive surgical diagnosis and staging is indicated [^117WfZK9]. I need to ensure I emphasize that histopathology is required for diagnosis and that optimal outcomes hinge on complete cytoreduction to no gross residual disease, ideally in specialized centers with high surgical volume and multidisciplinary care [^1166pp5F] [^112pv38j].

> Finally, I should confirm the prognostic implications of late presentation to close the loop. Because most patients present with stage III–IV disease, five-year survival hovers around 20–49% overall, with markedly better outcomes in early-stage detection. This underscores why recognizing symptom patterns, avoiding anchoring on benign diagnoses, and expediting appropriate imaging and surgical evaluation can meaningfully alter outcomes for the subset who can be diagnosed earlier [^113bSAr2] [^113jhvvw]. Hold on, I should verify that while we cannot yet screen effectively, vigilance for symptomatic women remains our best lever for earlier diagnosis until biomarker-driven strategies mature [^116u5RfR] [^114cDE6n].

Ovarian cancer typically presents with **nonspecific symptoms** such as abdominal bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, early satiety, and urinary urgency or frequency [^116JtFhp] [^115uRYUP]. These symptoms are often subtle and easily attributed to benign conditions, leading to **delayed diagnosis** [^112mz8AR]. Most patients are diagnosed at **advanced stages (III–IV)** [^113V6crW], with ascites, a palpable mass, or bowel obstruction as prominent features [^116LCwj4]. Early-stage disease may be asymptomatic or present with vague discomfort, and symptoms are not specific enough for reliable screening [^111Y97kd] [^112kLxAq]. Persistent, new, or worsening symptoms — especially in postmenopausal women or those with risk factors — should prompt **urgent evaluation** with pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA-125 [^113kNcpw] [^1129NDzc].

---

## Common presenting symptoms

Ovarian cancer symptoms are typically **nonspecific and easily mistaken for gastrointestinal or genitourinary conditions** [^116JtFhp]. The most frequently reported symptoms include:

- **Abdominal bloating or distension**: Often persistent and progressive [^116JtFhp] [^116Gh8Za].

- **Pelvic or abdominal pain**: Usually dull, diffuse, and nonspecific [^116JtFhp] [^115uRYUP].

- **Early satiety or difficulty eating**: Feeling full quickly or loss of appetite [^116JtFhp] [^116LCwj4].

- **Urinary symptoms**: Urgency or frequency [^116JtFhp] [^117Q4znC].

- **Fatigue and weight loss**: Nonspecific but common in advanced disease [^116JtFhp] [^111AN4Bf].

These symptoms are often intermittent and mild initially, which contributes to **diagnostic delay** [^112wdTmg].

---

## Physical findings

On physical examination, ovarian cancer may present with the following **findings**:

- **Palpable pelvic or abdominal mass**: Especially in postmenopausal women or if the mass is solid, fixed, or irregular [^116LCwj4] [^116Gh8Za].

- **Ascites**: Fluid accumulation in the abdomen, often indicating advanced disease [^116LCwj4].

- **Bowel obstruction**: May present with nausea, vomiting, and constipation due to tumor compression or infiltration [^115tkg5p].

- **Pleural effusion**: Less common, associated with advanced disease [^notfound].

---

## Stage at presentation

Ovarian cancer is **frequently diagnosed at advanced stages** because early symptoms are nonspecific and easily overlooked [^114JmWwy]. The distribution by stage at diagnosis is approximately:

| **Stage** | **Description** | **Percentage of patients** |
|-|-|-|
| Stage I | Confined to one or both ovaries | 15–20% |
| Stage II | Extension to pelvis | 5–10% |
| Stage III | Peritoneal metastasis beyond pelvis | 60–70% |
| Stage IV | Distant metastasis | 10–20% |

---

Advanced-stage disease (stages III–IV) accounts for about **70–80% of cases**, with a five-year survival rate of approximately 20–30% [^113V6crW] [^111NPtfR].

---

## Differences in presentation by histological subtype

Ovarian cancer comprises several histological subtypes, each with **distinct clinical features**:

- **High-grade serous carcinoma**: Most common, typically presents at advanced stage with rapid progression and aggressive behavior [^114Q2sZX].

- **Endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas**: Often associated with endometriosis, may present earlier and have better prognoses [^112qGbSs].

- **Mucinous carcinoma**: Tends to present with larger, unilateral masses and may mimic gastrointestinal malignancies [^notfound].

- **Germ cell tumors**: More common in younger women, may present with acute pain due to rapid growth or rupture [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Given the nonspecific nature of symptoms, **diagnostic evaluation typically includes**:

- **Pelvic examination**: Palpation of pelvic and abdominal masses [^111HbTHh].

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Initial imaging modality to assess ovarian masses [^111Hbt9B].

- **CA-125 serum tumor marker**: Elevated in many cases, particularly in advanced disease, but nonspecific and not suitable for screening [^1129NDzc].

- **CT scan or MRI**: Further characterization of masses and assessment of disease extent [^114VRdL7].

- **Histopathological confirmation**: Definitive diagnosis requires surgical biopsy or removal of the mass [^117WfZK9].

---

## Conclusion

Ovarian cancer typically presents with **nonspecific symptoms** such as abdominal bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, early satiety, and urinary urgency or frequency [^116JtFhp]. These symptoms are often subtle and easily attributed to benign conditions, leading to delayed diagnosis [^112wdTmg]. Most patients are diagnosed at **advanced stages**, with ascites, a palpable mass, or bowel obstruction as prominent features [^113V6crW]. Early-stage disease may be asymptomatic or present with vague discomfort, and symptoms are not specific enough for reliable screening [^112kLxAq]. Persistent, new, or worsening symptoms — especially in postmenopausal women or those with risk factors — should prompt **urgent evaluation** with pelvic exam, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA-125 [^111HbTHh] [^114VRdL7].

Presentation and screening context across resource settings notes that ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, stage III or IV, and that all women are at risk for ovarian cancer with higher-than-population risk among women with genetic predisposition; personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer; infertility; and advancing age. There is currently no reliable screening method or primary prevention available for ovarian cancer in any setting; therefore, most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed on the basis of symptomatic presentation with the majority at advanced stages across all resource settings. In basic settings, chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound are typically the only imaging modalities available, and women with ovarian cancer report nonspecific symptoms that may be overlooked or misdiagnosed by primary care providers and contribute to delay in diagnosis.

### Ovarian cancer management: the role of imaging and diagnostic challenges [^114JmWwy]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Worldwide, ovarian cancer accounts for 4% of all female cancers with over 190,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The incidence rates vary considerably across the globe with the highest rates seen in Europe and the USA and low rates in Africa and Asia. Ovarian cancer has been termed a 'silent' killer with the majority of patients presenting with advanced disease due to the vague, non-specific nature of the presenting symptoms such as abdominal discomfort and bloating in 50%. The most important determinant of survival for ovarian cancer patients is the disease stage at diagnosis. Therefore there is a thrust for early detection and two large screening trials are currently underway in the UK and USA. Ovarian cancer is most commonly staged using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical-pathological staging system. Imaging findings are not a formal component of the staging system but in clinical practice they play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of suspected ovarian cancer. Adnexal masses which are shown to have benign features on imaging can undergo simple excision at a local unit by a non-oncological gynaecologist. If a mass has malignant characteristics on imaging, then a radical surgical approach is indicated and this should be performed by a gynaecological oncological surgeon at a specialist cancer centre, as optimal cytoreductive surgery has been reported to improve outcome. This review article discusses the role of various imaging modalities in the initial assessment of an adnexal mass, the contribution to management planning and to the follow-up of patients with ovarian cancer.

OVERARCHING CLINICAL QUESTION A

What are the optimal diagnosis and staging strategies for adult women with ovarian masses and/or EOC?

Evaluation and diagnosis of adult women with ovarian masses or symptoms of EOC (Recommendations 1.1–1.4)

Recommendations on evaluation and diagnosis for women with ovarian masses are provided in Tables 5 and 6 and Appendix Figures A 1, A 2, A 8, and A 9. These recommendations are adapted, and in some cases modified from the guidelines from the developers Belgian KCE, Irish NCEC, SIGN, BGCS, and ASCO and SGO and informed by clinical expertise.

Diagnostic Strategies

Discussion

These recommendations concern assessment for adult women with ovarian masses in basic, limited, and enhanced settings.

Basic-resource settings

Women with ovarian cancer may report generalized symptoms of pain, fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal bloating, or feeling full with small meals or early satiety. Other focal signs can include a patient's report of a mass noted in the abdomen or symptoms of abdominal distension, abdominal or pelvic pain, and change in bowel function with diarrhea or constipation (for the latter, symptoms of < 12 months duration and occurring more than 12 times per month). Women presenting with symptoms associated with possible EOC require an evaluation. The cause of underlying symptoms, generally nonspecific but potentially severe or life-impacting in nature, needs to be determined and may lead to a potential cancer diagnosis. A general practitioner in a basic-resource setting has to rely on the patient's history and physical examination findings to determine the need for diagnostic testing. Initial assessment by a general practitioner includes a complete physical examination, focusing on the abdominal and pelvic examination, to determine the presence of any pelvic or ovarian mass. A clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer can be discussed on the basis of certain complements of symptoms. A symptom index has been validated and may be helpful in guiding care. Measuring the serum CA-125 tumor marker alone is not validated for diagnostic use; however, if more than 300 IU/mL, can be suggestive of serous ovarian cancer. CA-125 is less useful for women who are premenopausal, with early-stage ovarian cancer, with ovarian cancer of other epithelial types, or with nonepithelial ovarian tumors.

### Improved early detection of ovarian cancer using longitudinal multimarker models [^115m4aVC]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common cancer in women, causing 152,000 deaths worldwide annually. The overall 5-year survival rate is ~40% due to late presentation, with the majority of cases diagnosed at stage III and IV, where the 5-year survival rate is only 3–19%. Stage I and II ovarian cancers have 5-year survival rates of 40–90%. Earlier detection of ovarian cancer, in particular aggressive tumours, is a possible way to improve outcomes.

Ovarian malignancies can be divided into two types differing by origin and molecular subtype and are associated with differing prognosis. Type I cancers can arise from tumours of low malignant potential, remain low grade, are slower growing and have a more favourable outcome. Type II cancers are typically high grade, aggressive, associated with poor survival, and are characterised by loss-of-function mutations of TP53 and BRCA1/2 and thus display genomic instability. It is well established that Type II cancers (mainly high-grade serous cancers) account for most ovarian cancer mortality and early detection of these tumours is likely to translate into mortality benefit.

### New insights in the pathophysiology of ovarian cancer and implications for screening and prevention [^112qGbSs]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Despite advances in medicine, ovarian cancer remains the deadliest of the gynecological malignancies. Herein we present the latest information on the pathophysiology of ovarian cancer and its significance for ovarian cancer screening and prevention. A new paradigm for ovarian cancer pathogenesis presupposes 2 distinct types of ovarian epithelial carcinoma with distinct molecular profiles: type I and type II carcinomas. Type I tumors include endometrioid, clear-cell carcinoma, and low-grade serous carcinoma and mostly arise via defined sequence either from endometriosis or from borderline serous tumors, mostly presenting in an early stage. More frequent type II carcinomas are usually high-grade serous tumors, and recent evidence suggests that the majority arise from the fimbriated end of the fallopian tube. Subsequently, high-grade serous carcinomas usually present at advanced stages, likely as a consequence of the rapid peritoneal seeding from the open ends of the fallopian tubes. On the other hand, careful clinical evaluation should be performed along with risk stratification and targeted treatment of women with premalignant conditions leading to type I cancers, most notably endometriosis and endometriomas. Although the chance of malignant transformation is low, an understanding of this link offers a possibility of prevention and early intervention. This new evidence explains difficulties in ovarian cancer screening and helps in forming new recommendations for ovarian cancer risk evaluation and prophylactic treatments.

OVERARCHING CLINICAL QUESTION B

What is the optimal surgery for women with stages I-IV EOC?

Staging for suspected stage I/II ovarian cancer (Recommendation 2.1.1)

Recommendations on staging are in Table 5, Appendix Figures A 2 and A 8, and the Data Supplement.

TABLE 5
Summary Diagnosis Recommendations by Setting

Discussion

Surgery is an essential element in ovarian cancer diagnosis and initial care, necessary for accurate diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Surgical staging follows or coincides with diagnostic interventions. Invasive intervention in patients with ovarian cancer is done for three reasons: tissue pathology diagnosis, surgical staging, or tumor debulking with the goal to achieve optimal tumor cytoreduction to R0 (no gross visible disease). In apparent early-stage ovarian cancer (stage I/II), appropriate surgical management of the ovarian mass includes minimizing risk of rupture. Surgical staging in apparent early-stage ovarian cancer provides prognostic information through comprehensive staging, if available. Complete staging helps to define prognosis and may change treatment course if a patient's disease is unexpectedly upstaged and should ideally be undertaken by a subspecialized gynecologic oncology surgeon with appropriate experience or, where limitations exist, a gynecologist or general surgeon experienced in pelvic surgery. Surgery is performed to stage and remove all visible tumors; this may involve more than one surgical procedure or more than one surgical specialist to accomplish. Because of the complexity of ovarian cancer surgery and perioperative management of patients with ovarian cancer, patients should be referred to the highest-level care center with the capacity for expert surgical and medical management.

Surgical staging involves assessment and biopsies of the pelvis and abdomen, en bloc resection of the fallopian tubes, ovaries, uterus (see the Data Supplement for options in fertility-sparing surgery), infracolic omentectomy, evaluation of the bowel serosa and peritoneal surfaces from infradiaphragmatic space to the floor of the pelvis, pericolic gutter washings, and evaluation of the inferior aspect of the diaphragm. Systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection is controversial and is only recommended when it will upstage and change the management of a patient's early-stage disease.

Basic-resource settings

In the absence of capacity to perform staging, patients should be referred to the next level of care. Where that is not possible, immediate symptom control and referral for subsequent care (surgery and/or chemotherapy) should be initiated.

### Immunotherapeutic approaches to ovarian cancer treatment [^1143DMFb]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2012, there were an estimated 239,000 new cases of ovarian cancer worldwide leading to over 140,000 deaths. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in women in the developed world, where it is also the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies. The lethality of ovarian cancer is in part due to the difficulty of early detection. Ovarian cancer causes few perceptible symptoms when localized to the ovary. Due to the asymptomatic nature of early disease, most patients do not seek medical care until the disease has progressed beyond the ovaries into the abdomen and pelvis. Nearly 75% of patients present with stage III and IV ovarian cancer. Management of ovarian cancer primarily includes cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. While clinical remissions are obtainable, the majority of patients will relapse and die of disease, with a 5-year survival of approximately 30%. Novel therapies need to be integrated into ovarian cancer treatment strategies to achieve durable clinical outcomes.

In the last two decades, advances in the understanding of ovarian cancer immunogenicity have opened the door to immunotherapeutic approaches to ovarian cancer treatment. A crucial early step in establishing the validity of ovarian cancer immunotherapy was the observation that CD3 + tumor-infiltrating T cells correlated with increased overall survival. Later work confirmed the importance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and specifically identified the CD3 +, CD8 + T cells as important antitumor effectors. The identification of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) lent additional support to an immunotherapeutic treatment strategy. TAAs aberrantly up-regulate in tumor tissue and ascites of ovarian cancer patients and include members of the cancer-testis antigen family (e.g. MAGE-A4 and NY-ESO-1), growth-activating receptors (e.g. HER2/neu), folate receptor alpha (FRα), p53, and CA125. These markers are potential therapeutic targets for eliciting an immune response specific to ovarian cancer and effecting immune-mediated tumor rejection. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved immunotherapies for prostate cancer, advanced kidney cancer, lymphoma, and metastatic melanoma, but only recently have immunotherapies targeting ovarian cancer entered clinical testing (Table 1). In this review, we discuss advances in immunotherapeutic approaches to ovarian cancer. We divide therapeutic strategies into four categories: antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors, vaccines, and adoptive cell therapy (ACT).

### Screening for ovarian cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^112kLxAq]. JAMA (2018). Excellent credibility.

U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — risk assessment and related guidance: "Women with certain hereditary cancer syndromes are at high risk for ovarian cancer", and "Women with a family history of ovarian or breast cancer may be at risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome and should discuss their family history with their health care professional". The scope clarifies that "Women who have a hereditary cancer syndrome that puts them at high risk for ovarian cancer are excluded from this recommendation". The USPSTF also states, "The USPSTF recommends that women with a family history indicating they are at risk for a deleterious gene mutation (BRCA1 or BRCA2) be referred for genetic counseling and, if indicated, genetic testing", and that "the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening with pelvic examination to detect a range of gynecologic conditions in asymptomatic, nonpregnant women". Additionally, "The clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer (eg, abdominal pain or pressure, bloating, constipation, urinary symptoms, back pain, or fatigue) are nonspecific… therefore, use of clinical symptoms for risk stratification for the early detection of disease is difficult".

### Presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis: evidence from a cross-sectional, population-based study [^112mz8AR]. The Lancet: Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Globally, cancer control strategies increasingly encompass the early diagnosis of symptomatic cancer alongside primary prevention policies and screening programmes. Several countries have introduced health system interventions that aim to expedite investigation and diagnosis of symptomatic individuals presenting in primary care, whereas public health education campaigns aimed at raising awareness of cancer symptoms are increasingly being used both in high-income countries and in low-income and middle-income countries (appendix p 2).,

By their nature, early diagnosis interventions focus on the presenting symptoms of cancer. If the selected symptoms predominantly represent advanced-stage disease, however, these initiatives might have little impact in improving cancer outcomes. Understanding associations between presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis is therefore an important consideration.

Existing evidence about associations between presenting symptoms and stage at diagnosis is scarce and confined to specific cancer sites, overlooking the fact that some symptoms at presentation (particularly those of a non-specific nature) are shared among different types of cancer; for example, abdominal pain is a common symptom of colorectal, ovarian, and renal cancer. Furthermore, symptoms are typically examined as being either present or absent, without consideration of the possible additive or interactive effects of multiple symptoms.

In this study, we therefore aimed to examine associations between common presenting symptoms of cancer and stage at diagnosis, using data from a population-based incident cohort of patients with cancer.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1980, and Jun 17, 2019, using the search terms "presenting symptom" or "symptom" AND "cancer" AND "stage", with additional hand-searching of reference lists of identified papers and relevant subject reviews. We identified 12 studies on single cancer sites (five on ovarian cancer, three on colon or colorectal cancer, one on lung cancer, one on anal cancer, one on pancreatic cancer, and one on renal cancer), of which three examined associations between presenting symptoms and stage, adjusting for possible confounders. Only one study (on patients with colorectal cancer) considered both single presenting symptoms and symptom combinations.

There have been major advances in our understanding of the cellular and molecular biology of the human malignancies that are collectively referred to as ovarian cancer. At a recent Helene Harris Memorial Trust meeting, an international group of researchers considered actions that should be taken to improve the outcome for women with ovarian cancer. Nine major recommendations are outlined in this Opinion article.

### Contemporary progress in ovarian cancer screening [^117DyHED]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Our limited understanding of the natural biology of ovarian cancer, along with its low prevalence in the general population make early detection especially challenging. To be successful at the population level, an ovarian cancer screening test must prove its beneficial effect on ovarian cancer-specific mortality while achieving near-perfect specificity in order to minimize the harms resulting from false-positive results. No current screening tests for ovarian cancer fulfill these expectations. We review the current status and the challenges of ovarian cancer screening in the context of evidence-based principles that define a valuable cancer screening program.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^112BtNZS]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Methods for the evidence review and educational material development closely followed the process for the early-onset breast cancer and uterine cancer projects. The ACOG convened an expert panel to identify the best evidence and practices from the literature and existing relevant guidelines. The panel was recruited from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology to review and summarize the evidence. The panel was supplemented by representatives from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology. Panel members were selected on the basis of expertise in evidence review and synthesis. The panel developed research questions and used the PICO criteria (P = patient, problem, or population; I = intervention; C = comparison, control, or comparator; O = outcome[s]) to frame the literature review (Box 1).

Box 1.

### How does ovarian cancer form? A new study points to microRNA… [^117Mc8R5]. NCI (2020). Medium credibility.

Cells with high levels of the microRNA, called miR-181a, were pushed over the edge to becoming ovarian cancer, scientists who led the study found. It did this by turning off two important genes, they showed. These and other findings from the NCI-funded study were published June 26 in Nature Communications. "One of defining features of ovarian tumors is a large degree of genomic instability, " said the study's lead investigator, Analisa DiFeo, Ph. D., of the University of Michigan. That means chromosomes are destroyed, copied, or stitched together with other chromosomes, she explained. But it wasn't clear how ovarian cancer cells could survive with so much DNA damage. A key finding of the new study, Dr. Annunziata said, is that miR-181a helps cells survive with unstable genomes. The current thinking is that ovarian cancer starts in fallopian tube cells that have a few gene mutations. Those abnormal cells eventually turn into a precursor of cancer, or precancer.

Years later, the precancer becomes full-blown ovarian cancer. But scientists don't know what drives the transition from mutated fallopian tube cells to precancer to ovarian cancer. There is some evidence that genome instability drives the transition, Dr. DiFeo explained. She and her team wondered whether a microRNA might be the cause of genome instability. These cells grew on top of one another, formed tumor-like structures, and had genome instability — all typical hallmarks of ovarian cancer. Cells carrying a nonworking microRNA didn't form tumors in mice. But cells with excess miR-181a formed tumors that acted like human ovarian cancer. The tumors spread to the mice's intestines, for example. It's rare to "transform a normal cell to a cancer cell with just expression of one microRNA. Typically, you need multiple for transformation, " Dr. DiFeo explained. That goes to show that microRNAs are "small but mighty, " she added.

Early-stage ovarian cancer causes vague symptoms, like bloating and feeling full quickly, that can easily be chalked up to something less serious. On top of that, it's hard to find ovarian tumors using an ultrasound. And existing blood tests can't easily distinguish ovarian cancer from a non-threatening ovarian mass. For those reasons, most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed when the disease is advanced.

### The abnormal ovary: evolving concepts in diagnosis and management [^112rqoYx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Ovarian lesions are common and require a consistent approach to diagnosis and management for best patient outcomes. In the past 20 years, there has been an evolution in the approach to abnormal ovarian lesions, with increasing emphasis on reducing surgery for benign disease, standardizing terminology, assessing risk of malignancy through use of evidence-based scoring systems, and triaging suspicious abnormalities to dedicated oncology centers. This article provides an evidence-based review of how these changes in diagnosis and management of ultrasound-detected abnormal ovarian lesions have occurred. Current recommended practices are summarized. The current literature on transvaginal screening for ovarian cancer also is reviewed and summarized.

### Epigenetic therapy for ovarian cancer: promise and progress [^113ib45T]. Clinical Epigenetics (2019). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 47%, a number that has remained constant over the past two decades. Early diagnosis improves survival, but unfortunately only 15% of ovarian cancers are diagnosed at an early or localized stage. Most ovarian cancers are epithelial in origin and treatment prioritizes surgery and cytoreduction followed by cytotoxic platinum and taxane chemotherapy. While most tumors will initially respond to this treatment, recurrence is likely to occur within a median of 16months for patients who present with advanced stage disease. New treatment options separate from traditional chemotherapy that take advantage of advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of ovarian cancer are needed to improve outcomes. Recent work has shown that mutations in genes encoding epigenetic regulators are mutated in ovarian cancer, driving tumorigenesis and resistance to treatment. Several of these epigenetic modifiers have emerged as promising drug targets for ovarian cancer therapy. In this article, we delineate epigenetic abnormalities in ovarian cancer, discuss key scientific advances using epigenetic therapies in preclinical ovarian cancer models, and review ongoing clinical trials utilizing epigenetic therapies in ovarian cancer.

In the latest NCCN Guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, the histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer are described in more depth as they vary by frequency, typical age and disease stage at presentation, treatment recommendations, and survival probabilities. The less common subtypes are also discussed. The update with the greatest impact on the treatment of ovarian cancer, however, is probably the use of maintenance therapy with poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and 3 PARP inhibitors are now included in the guidelines. These drugs have made a large difference in outcome, both for patients with BRCA mutations and in unselected patients.

### Ovarian cancer (advanced) [^117EmTMN]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK. The 5-year relative survival rate in the UK at diagnosis for women aged 15–39 years is nearly 70%. In comparison, it is only 12% for women diagnosed aged over 80 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of surgical treatments for ovarian cancer that is advanced at first presentation? What are the effects of platinum-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer that is advanced at first presentation? What are the effects of taxane-based chemotherapy for ovarian cancer that is advanced at first presentation? What are the effects of intraperitoneal chemotherapy for ovarian cancer that is advanced at first presentation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 31 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: adding taxanes to platinum-based chemotherapy, carboplatin plus a taxane, cisplatin plus a taxane, combination or single-agent platinum-based chemotherapy, docetaxel, intravenous and intraperitoneal chemotherapy, interval debulking, paclitaxel, primary surgery, and second-look surgery.

### Next steps in the early detection of ovarian cancer [^113jhvvw]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer afflicts more than 300,000 women each year worldwide. Despite improved care with cytoreductive surgery and combination chemotherapy, the majority of patients will die from their disease. When cancer is limited to the ovaries in stage I, up to 90% of patients can be cured with currently available treatment. Even when disease has spread to pelvic organs in stage II, up to 70% survive for more than 10 years. With further spread over the surface of the abdominal cavity (stage III) or outside the abdomen (stage IV), long term survival is reduced to 20% or lower. Approximately 25–30% of patients are currently diagnosed in stage I or II. It has long been assumed that increasing the fraction of women with ovarian cancer detected at an early stage could improve survival and decrease mortality.

The negative outcome of the UKCTOCS calls into question where we should go next to find an effective strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer.

a. What special considerations do primary care practitioners need to be aware of throughout the ovarian cancer care continuum? How influential are these factors in the patient experience and outcome?

Experts in literature searches from the ACOG Resource Center searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (through Ovid), and PubMed (for references not indexed through MEDLINE) for articles published between January 2000 and October 2021. Literature was organized by types of studies. Published guidelines were categorized separately from studies. A primary reviewer was assigned to each topic to review titles and abstracts and then the entire manuscript when appropriate. Reference lists from relevant articles found in the search were also reviewed. Reviewers did additional searches as necessary, including extending the search range. Internet searches were performed with standard search engines to seek guidelines, recommendations, and tools that might not have been published in peer-reviewed publications. Relevant information was evaluated and compiled into an evidence summary template by a primary reviewer. Completed templates were then reviewed by a secondary reviewer. The primary and secondary reviewers worked together to revise the evidence summary in response to the secondary reviewer's comments.

The ACOG convened the Ovarian Cancer Evidence Review Conference virtually on February 9–10, 2022, bringing together expert panel members and representatives from stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations (Appendix 1). The panel members who served as primary reviewers for each of the research topics prerecorded their presentations, which were viewed in advance by meeting participants, including the stakeholder representatives. Meeting attendees also reviewed the evidence review summaries. At the meeting, expert panel members presented a brief summary of their evidence review findings, which was followed by an open comment and discussion period with conference attendees. Comments were integrated into the evidence review summary by the primary reviewer. The revised summaries were sent to the secondary reviewer for final review, and final revisions were made by the primary reviewer (Appendices 2–8). The final evidence review summaries were used to develop the educational material (available online at).

### Can advanced-stage ovarian cancer be cured? [^112r4AVg]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer survive beyond 12 years after treatment and are effectively cured. Initial therapy for ovarian cancer comprises surgery and chemotherapy, and is given with the goal of eradicating as many cancer cells as possible. Indeed, the three phases of therapy are as follows: debulking surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible, preferably to a state of no visible residual disease; chemotherapy to eradicate any microscopic disease that remains present after surgery; and second-line or maintenance therapy, which is given to delay disease progression among patients with tumour recurrence. If no cancer cells remain after initial therapy is completed, a cure is expected. By contrast, if residual cancer cells are present after initial treatment, then disease recurrence is likely. Thus, the probability of cure is contingent on the combination of surgery and chemotherapy effectively eliminating all cancer cells. In this Perspectives article, I present the case that the probability of achieving a cancer-free state is maximized through a combination of maximal debulking surgery and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. I discuss the evidence indicating that by taking this approach, cures could be achieved in up to 50% of women with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

### Updates and new options in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [^114Myc43]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Recent advances in ovarian cancer research have expanded options for patients with ovarian cancer in 2020, but these same advances have also made decision making more complicated for physicians. Many questions remain and we expect the landscape to continue to shift and therapeutic options and treatment algorithms to become more complex. The COVID-19 pandemic has only added to the current complexity as practical considerations of in-person visits, intensive care unit bed availability, and patient concerns also factor into treatment decisions. Over the past 2 years we have made significant progress and early data suggest that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor might improve overall survival and occasionally cure advanced disease. Moreover, we know that patients treated by gynecologic oncologists at centers with high surgical volume and high rates of macroscopically complete resections have better survival outcomes. We also know that we must underline the importance of quality-of-life considerations and that we should continue to encourage women to participate in clinical trials to take advantage of and help develop future therapy strategies. Through ongoing advances, we hope that ovarian cancer will transition from a historically highly fatal disease to a chronic but treatable illness, and, increasingly, to one that is curable.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^116wpj3M]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this guideline is to provide expert guidance on the diagnosis and treatment of adult women 18 years of age or older with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer) to clinicians, public health leaders, patients, and policymakers in resource-constrained settings. The target population is adult women with ovarian masses and other symptoms of ovarian cancer as well as those diagnosed with EOC at all stages in resource-constrained settings. This guideline is not intended for patients in maximal settings, as described in Table 3.

Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, stage III or IV. All women are at risk for ovarian cancer; women with genetic predisposition; personal or family history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer; infertility; and advancing age are at higher than population-based risk. There is currently no reliable screening method or primary prevention available for ovarian cancer in any setting. Therefore, most women with ovarian cancer are diagnosed on the basis of symptomatic presentation with the majority at advanced stages across all resource settings. In basic settings, chest x-ray and abdominal ultrasound are typically the only imaging modalities available. Women with ovarian cancer report nonspecific symptoms that may be overlooked or misdiagnosed by primary care providers and contribute to delay in diagnosis. In resource-constrained settings, patients with advanced ovarian cancer may not seek care or undergo diagnosis; therefore, some deaths may not be recorded in hospital registries. Underreporting may be a contributing factor to the low numbers recorded in countries with low Human Development Index (HDI) (Table 1). The HDI refers to a composite measure of development, not limited to income alone.

### Management of ovarian cancer: a 75-year-old woman who has completed treatment [^117Grbxr]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ovarian cancer includes primary tumors of epithelial, sex cord-stromal, or germ cell origin as well as metastatic tumors that frequently originate in the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 90% of ovarian cancer is epithelial in origin and constitutes a major therapeutic challenge because of its advanced stage of presentation in most patients. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth most common cause of female cancer death in the United States, with approximately 1 in 70 women developing this disease in their lifetime. Several important advances in surgical and medical management of this disease have led to prolongation of survival and improvement of quality of life of patients with ovarian cancer. Using the case of Ms W, we discuss the signs, symptoms, risk factors, and prognostic factors of epithelial ovarian cancer; review the evidence for surgical and postoperative medical management; and present the current recommendations for screening and follow-up.

### Clinical research in ovarian cancer: consensus recommendations from the gynecologic cancer interGroup [^115B4vYw]. The Lancet: Oncology (2022). High credibility.

The Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup (GCIG) sixth Ovarian Cancer Conference on Clinical Research was held virtually in October, 2021, following published consensus guidelines. The goal of the consensus meeting was to achieve harmonisation on the design elements of upcoming trials in ovarian cancer, to select important questions for future study, and to identify unmet needs. All 33 GCIG member groups participated in the development, refinement, and adoption of 20 statements within four topic groups on clinical research in ovarian cancer including first line treatment, recurrent disease, disease subgroups, and future trials. Unanimous consensus was obtained for 14 of 20 statements, with greater than 90% concordance in the remaining six statements. The high acceptance rate following active deliberation among the GCIG groups confirmed that a consensus process could be applied in a virtual setting. Together with detailed categorisation of unmet needs, these consensus statements will promote the harmonisation of international clinical research in ovarian cancer.

### Ovarian cancer: an overview [^111Hbt9B]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Although ovarian cancer may occur at any age, it is more common in patients older than 50 years. Patients often present with nonspecific pelvic or abdominal symptoms. Initial diagnostic tests include transvaginal ultrasonography and serum cancer antigen 125 measurement; however, these tests are not specific for ovarian cancer. Conventional treatment includes surgical debulking followed by chemotherapy. Prognosis is typically determined by the cancer stage and grade, although future treatment may depend on tumor genetic composition. Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most common type of ovarian cancer, and because 70 percent of cases are diagnosed at stage III or IV, it is associated with a poor prognosis. Preventive visits provide an opportunity to identify and educate women at increased risk of ovarian cancer, but routine screening is not recommended. Women with a family history of ovarian cancer or a known associated genetic syndrome should be offered genetic counseling or a discussion of available preventive interventions, respectively.

### Ovarian cancer [^115tkg5p]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer is the commonest cause of gynaecological cancer-associated death. The disease typically presents in postmenopausal women, with a few months of abdominal pain and distension. Most women have advanced disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage III), for which the standard of care remains surgery and platinum-based cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although this treatment can be curative for most patients with early stage disease, most women with advanced disease will develop many episodes of recurrent disease with progressively shorter disease-free intervals. These episodes culminate in chemoresistance and ultimately bowel obstruction, the most frequent cause of death. For women whose disease continues to respond to platinum-based drugs, the disease can often be controlled for 5 years or more. Targeted treatments such as antiangiogenic drugs or poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors offer potential for improved survival. The efficacy of screening, designed to detect the disease at an earlier and curable stage remains unproven, with key results expected in 2015.

Adjuvant therapy is defined as drugs, radiation, or other forms of supplemental treatment following cancer surgery intended to decrease recurrence risk or primarily treat residual disease after cytoreduction. Neoadjuvant therapy is drugs, radiation, or other treatment given prior to cancer surgery to reduce tumor burden in preparation for surgery. Recurrence therapy is drugs, radiation, or other treatment used to treat recurrent cancer, control symptoms, or increase length and/ or quality of life at the time of clinical, biochemical, or radiographic evidence of recurrence following initial treatment.

### Data-driven analysis of a validated risk score for ovarian cancer identifies clinically distinct patterns during follow-up and treatment [^112i2Xif]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is currently the eighth most common cancer among women across the world, with over 300,000 cases and 200,000 deaths per year, and an estimated global incidence of 6.6 per 100,000 women per year. Detection of the cancer is usually late with less than one-third of cases discovered in stage I or II, resulting in poor prognosis with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 30–50%. The overall 5-year survival rate varies greatly depending on tumor stage at diagnosis, and it is close to 90% when the tumor is detected in stage I, but only 20% for stage IV. The precursor states of ovarian cancers have proven difficult to identify. Precise knowledge of the etiology of the cancer could help determine an optimized screening interval in relation to cancer development. However, it has been suggested that serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STIC), the presumed precursor to ovarian high-grade serous carcinomas, develop slowly with up to two decades from the first occurrence of genetic predisposing mutations. Recent molecular evidence from patient material suggests that the developing of ovarian cancer from STIC can occur in a much shorter time, across an estimated timespan of 6–7 years. Additional estimates based on tumor size and growthindicate that ovarian cancer can spend over 4 years in situ, or as stage I and II, before progressing to stages III and IV. Today discovery is mainly symptom-driven and women who experience pelvic symptoms are typically examined with transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) or computer tomography, and when these indicate an adnexal ovarian mass, surgery provides the final diagnosis. However, a majority of patients undergoing surgery actually have benign cysts, and more effective and targeted preoperative tools to predict malignancy would reduce unnecessary operations and minimize potential complications and induced premature menopause.

### Is It time to centralize ovarian cancer care in the United States? [^112pv38j]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article was to broadly review the most up-to-date information pertaining to the centralization of ovarian cancer care in the United States (US) and worldwide.

Methods

Much of the present literature pertaining to disparities in, and centralization of, ovarian cancer care in the US and internationally was reviewed, and specifically included original research and review articles.

Results

Data show improved optimal debulking rates, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline adherence, and overall survival rates in higher-volume, more specialized hospitals, and amongst higher-volume providers.

Conclusions

Patients with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, especially those with higher stages (III and IV), are better served by centralized care in high-volume hospitals and by high-volume physicians, who adhere to NCCN guidelines wherever possible. More research is needed to determine the policy changes that can increase NCCN guideline adherence in low-volume hospitals and low-provider caseload scenarios. Policy and future research should be aimed at increasing patient access, either directly or indirectly, to high-volume hospital and high-volume providers, especially amongst Medicare, lower socioeconomic status, and minority patients.

### Many ovarian cancers may start in fallopian tubes-NCI… [^113cVLb9]. NCI (2017). Low credibility.

Many Ovarian Cancers May Start in Fallopian Tubes, Study Finds, by NCI Staff Findings from a new study provide additional evidence that the most common type of ovarian cancer may originate in the fallopian tubes. Researchers also found that there is a window of several years between the development of abnormal cells, or lesions, in the fallopian tubes and the start of ovarian cancer. The researchers found that most of the genetic alterations seen in ovarian tumors in these patients were present in lesions that had formed years earlier in their fallopian tubes. This finding is important, they wrote, because it could potentially help to enable earlier detection of the disease. Currently, about 70% of women with HGSOC are diagnosed with advanced stage disease. Tracing the Origins of HGSOC Studies conducted more than a decade ago provided evidence that HGSOCs may not arise from cells of the ovary.

Instead, the studies suggested that lesions found in the fallopian tubes, called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas, might be precursors for most HGSOCs, said Christina Annunziata, M. D. Ph. D., clinical director of the Women's Malignancies Branch of NCI's Center for Cancer Research. Those earlier studies identified STIC lesions in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations who'd had prophylactic surgery to remove their fallopian tubes and ovaries to reduce their cancer risk, suggesting that the lesions could be precursors to ovarian cancer. The new study, along with findings from another molecular analysis of STICs published in the same issue of the journal, provide additional evidence that HGSOCs originate from these fallopian tube lesions, Dr. Annunziata said, regardless of whether women have. Using a mathematical model, the researchers then estimated that the average time between the development of the STIC lesions and ovarian cancer was 6. 5 years.

They found that while the lesions were slower to develop, "in patients with metastatic lesions, the time between the initiation of the ovarian carcinoma and development of metastases appears to have been rapid, " they wrote. This may explain why most cases of HGSOC are in advanced stages at diagnosis and has implications for early detection of the disease, the researchers wrote.

The development of guidelines recommendations is one of the core activities of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and European Society of Gynaecologial Oncology (ESGO), as part of the mission of both societies to improve the quality of care for patients with cancer across Europe. ESMO and ESGO jointly developed clinically relevant and evidence-based recommendations in several selected areas in order to improve the quality of care for women with ovarian cancer. The ESMO-ESGO consensus conference on ovarian cancer was held on 12–14 April 2018 in Milan, Italy, and comprised a multidisciplinary panel of 40 leading experts in the management of ovarian cancer. Before the conference, the expert panel worked on five clinically relevant questions regarding ovarian cancer relating to each of the following four areas: pathology and molecular biology, early-stage and borderline tumours, advanced stage disease and recurrent disease. Relevant scientific literature, as identified using a systematic search, was reviewed in advance. During the consensus conference, the panel developed recommendations for each specific question and a consensus was reached. The recommendations presented here are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. This article presents the recommendations of this ESMO-ESGO consensus conference, together with a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation.

### Identifying women with suspected ovarian cancer in primary care: derivation and validation of algorithm [^114R7t62]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, affecting 225 000 new patients each year. Of these, about 6700 women are in the United Kingdom, giving the UK one of the highest rates in Europe. Most women are diagnosed with stage III or stage IV cancer, for which the five year survival is 20% and 6%, respectively. Less than 30% of women are diagnosed with stage I ovarian cancer, and, of these, 90% will survive to five years. While ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death in the UK from gynaecological malignancies, there have been improvements in survival in the past two decades, which might reflect earlier diagnosis and more effective treatments. In general terms, the earlier the cancer is diagnosed, the more treatment options are available and the better the prognosis.

As there are few established risk factors, targeted screening of asymptomatic patients at risk of developing ovarian cancer is unlikely to be cost effective at present (although further information is likely to become available when the UK ovarian cancer screening trial reports in 2015–6). The challenge presented by ovarian cancer, therefore, is to make the correct diagnosis as early as possible, despite the non-specific nature of symptoms and signs. This is particularly the case in primary care, where general practitioners need to differentiate those patients for whom further investigation is warranted from those who require reassurance or a "watch and wait" policy. Moreover, primary care clinicians need to decide which patients require urgent investigation or referral and which require routine tests or referral. Earlier diagnosis, however, could improve with more targeted investigation of symptomatic patientsand increased public awareness of symptoms as encouraged by the National Awareness and Early Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI). It has been estimated that 10% of deaths from ovarian cancers might be avoidable. Other guidelines and policies aim to increase access to diagnostic investigations for general practitioners, and tools to help assess absolute risk of different types of cancer are needed to help ensure the right patients are investigated as well as to optimise the use of scarce resources including abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. For ovarian cancer, the current guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellenceencourages the use of blood tests to measure CA125 concentration for symptomatic women as a prelude to ultrasound scanning, although this has not been validated in a primary care setting. CA125 concentration is raised in half the women who have early stage ovarian cancer and 90% of those with more advanced disease.

### Novel nanotechnology approaches to diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer [^111NPtfR]. Gynecologic Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies, which is a direct outcome of missing its diagnosis at an early stage. Approximately 75% of ovarian cancer patients are initially diagnosed with disseminated intra-abdominal disease (stages III-IV) when ~30% of patients have a 5-year survival rate. In addition to the challenge of early detection of ovarian cancer, its therapy presents several challenges including the route of therapy, resistance to therapy with recurrence of cancer, and specific targeting of ovarian cancer to reduce cytotoxic side effects.

Methods

We reviewed recent literature employing nanotechnology approaches to diagnosis and therapy of ovarian cancer.

Results

Recent innovations in nanotechnology with applications in cancer diagnostics and therapy help circumvent many pre-existing problems with conventional chemotherapy and present new ways of diagnosis and therapy.

Conclusions

Nanotechnology has promising potential in enhancing early detection of ovarian cancer and treatment of recurrent disease.

### ESGO-ESMO-ESP consensus conference recommendations on ovarian cancer: pathology and molecular biology and early, advanced and recurrent disease [^113JjFAX]. Annals of Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the European Society of Pathology held a consensus conference (CC) on ovarian cancer on 15–16 June 2022 in Valencia, Spain. The CC panel included 44 experts in the management of ovarian cancer and pathology, an ESMO scientific advisor and a methodologist. The aim was to discuss new or contentious topics and develop recommendations to improve and harmonise the management of patients with ovarian cancer. Eighteen questions were identified for discussion under four main topics: (i) pathology and molecular biology, (ii) early-stage disease and pelvic mass in pregnancy, (iii) advanced stage (including older/frail patients) and (iv) recurrent disease. The panel was divided into four working groups (WGs) to each address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above, based on their expertise. Relevant scientific literature was reviewed in advance. Recommendations were developed by the WGs and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This manuscript focuses on the recommendation statements that reached a consensus, their voting results and a summary of evidence supporting each recommendation.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer [^112ABWFZ]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Is an improved diagnostic pathway already in sight?

Undoubtedly the concept of ovarian cancer has been completely revised. Ovarian cancer is now recognised as an umbrella term for different cancer types that differ widely not only on a morphological and genetic level but also in clinical behaviour. Furthermore, heterogeneity is a feature seen not only within the primary tumour but also among its metastases.

Approximately 90% of ovarian cancers constitute of epithelial ovarian cancer types. Ovarian cancer has multiple cellular origins. The most common and aggressive type is high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) which originates in the epithelium of the fallopian tube as a STIC lesion. HGSOC may manifest as an ovarian or fallopian tube mass or primary peritoneal cancer, and the term tubo-ovarian cancer is often used. In contrast, only the biologically more indolent type I cancers (low-grade serous, mucinous, endometrioid, and clear cell) derive from the ovaries. These two distinct cancer categories differ not only in origin and aggressiveness, but also in the presence of identified precursor lesions. In this context — although they comprise only the minority of ovarian cancers — it is pivotal for early detection that precursor lesions may precede ovarian cancer for several years. Serous and mucinous borderline tumours may arise within cystadenomas, and it seems that there is a continuum in their development to invasive cancers. This is supported by the fact that borderline tumours are diagnosed in women approximately 10 years younger than the average age for HGSOC and the coexistence of borderline and invasive cancer in the same histopathologic specimen (Fig. 1). Endometriosis is associated with clear cell and endometrial cancer subtypes.

### Ovarian cancer: screening and early detection [^115uRYUP]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Ultimately, the timely diagnosis of ovarian cancer will rely on clinical judgment and careful analysis of presenting symptoms within the context of a thoughtful dialogue between the patient and her physician. Symptoms most typical of ovarian cancer include bloating, abdominal or pelvic pain, and difficulty eating. In some studies, urinary symptoms are also a common presenting symptom. When these symptoms occur more than 12 times per month and are of recent onset, then ovarian cancer should be considered as a possibility. Although most women who have these symptoms do not have ovarian cancer, it is important that providers include ovarian cancer in their differential diagnosis. Through research from the past decade, we now understand that there are patterns of symptoms associated with ovarian cancer. Importantly, we now know that ovarian cancer is not a "silent disease". Finally, clinicians must always listen carefully to their patients avoid potentially harmful delays in diagnosis. Until there is a screening test, awareness is best.

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Evidence-based interventions for the prevention and early detection of ovarian cancer do not currently exist. However, several treatment guidelines, including the receipt of treatment from a gynecologic oncologist, have been shown to result in improved survival from ovarian cancer.

### Committee opinion no. 716: the role of the obstetrician-gynecologist in the early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer in women at average risk [^113U8SGc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the second most common type of female reproductive cancer, and more women die from ovarian cancer than from cervical cancer and uterine cancer combined. Currently, there is no strategy for early detection of ovarian cancer that reduces ovarian cancer mortality. Taking a detailed personal and family history for breast, gynecologic, and colon cancer facilitates categorizing women based on their risk (average risk or high risk) of developing epithelial ovarian cancer. Women with a strong family history of ovarian, breast, or colon cancer may have hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (BRCA mutation) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), and these women are at increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women with these conditions should be referred for formal genetic counseling to better assess their cancer risk, including their risk of ovarian cancer. If appropriate, these women may be offered additional testing for early detection of ovarian cancer. The use of transvaginal ultrasonography and tumor markers (such as cancer antigen 125), alone or in combination, for the early detection of ovarian cancer in average-risk women have not been proved to reduce mortality, and harms exist from invasive diagnostic testing (eg, surgery) resulting from false-positive test results. The patient and her obstetrician-gynecologist should maintain an appropriate level of suspicion when potentially relevant signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer are present.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^114VRdL7]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) diagnostic strategies in resource-constrained settings recommend that general practitioners should perform a clinical assessment and family history and, where available, aid diagnosis by ultrasound (abdominal and transvaginal ultrasound, Doppler-enhanced) AND/OR contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis (with or without thorax). In postmenopausal women with symptoms of ovarian cancer, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) value can assist in diagnosis, ovarian cancer is diagnosed with histologic confirmation in all settings, and CT-guided biopsy or laparoscopy (with sufficient resources) is preferred instead of laparotomy to obtain histologic confirmation prior to any systemic therapy.

### Epithelial ovarian cancer [^117TSZS5]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer generally presents at an advanced stage and is the most common cause of gynaecological cancer death. Treatment requires expert multidisciplinary care. Population-based screening has been ineffective, but new approaches for early diagnosis and prevention that leverage molecular genomics are in development. Initial therapy includes surgery and adjuvant therapy. Epithelial ovarian cancer is composed of distinct histological subtypes with unique genomic characteristics, which are improving the precision and effectiveness of therapy, allowing discovery of predictors of response such as mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, and homologous recombination deficiency for DNA damage response pathway inhibitors or resistance (cyclin E1). Rapidly evolving techniques to measure genomic changes in tumour and blood allow for assessment of sensitivity and emergence of resistance to therapy, and might be accurate indicators of residual disease. Recurrence is usually incurable, and patient symptom control and quality of life are key considerations at this stage. Treatments for recurrence have to be designed from a patient's perspective and incorporate meaningful measures of benefit. Urgent progress is needed to develop evidence and consensus-based treatment guidelines for each subgroup, and requires close international cooperation in conducting clinical trials through academic research groups such as the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup.

Ovarian cancer — What is the clinical need to be addressed?

Multidisciplinary working is the cornerstone for optimal management of ovarian cancer with radiological assessment crucial throughout the patient pathway. Ovarian cancer is a term that encompasses pathologically distinct malignancies, all of which can have different patterns of spread and responses to treatment. The most common type of ovarian cancer arises from the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes and ovaries (epithelial ovarian cancer, EOC); rarer subtypes and those arising from non-epithelial cells include ovarian germ cell tumours, ovarian stromal tumours and small cell carcinoma of the ovary. Management of all ovarian cancers is centred around combining surgical approaches with systemic anti-cancer treatment. Increased understanding of the biology and genomic make-up of ovarian cancer together with enhanced surgical techniques and more targeted treatments has led to paradigm shifts in the way that the disease is managed. Despite these advances, EOC continues to be the most lethal gynaecological malignancy responsible for over 200,000 deaths per year worldwide. There is no effective population screening. Ovarian cancer is associated with non-specific symptoms and many women present late with advanced disease. There is an unmet need for earlier detection, novel and more targeted treatments and a better understanding of the development of treatment resistance.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^117WfZK9]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Resource-stratified ovarian cancer assessment and treatment recommendations specify that evaluation of adult symptomatic women in all settings includes symptom assessment, family history, and ultrasound and cancer antigen 125 serum tumor marker levels where feasible, with additional imaging in limited and enhanced settings that may be requested. Diagnosis, staging, and/or treatment involves surgery, presurgical workup of every suspected ovarian cancer requires a metastatic workup, only trained clinicians with logistical support should perform surgical staging, treatment requires histologic confirmation, and the surgical goal is staging disease and performing complete cytoreduction to no gross residual disease. In first-line therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended and, in advanced stages, patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy; after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients should be evaluated for interval debulking surgery. Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic or limited settings; specialized interventions are resource-dependent, for example, laparoscopy, fertility-sparing surgery, genetic testing, and targeted therapy, and multidisciplinary cancer care and palliative care should be offered.

### Updates and new options in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer treatment [^113CBw9r]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains the gynecologic cancer responsible for the most deaths each year in industrialized countries; in 2020, it is estimated that 21,750 new cases and 13,940 deaths will occur in the United Statesand 29,000 deaths will occur in Europe. The majority of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Although there have been many significant advances in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer over the past several decades, recurrent ovarian cancer remains an almost uniformly fatal disease. Of those diagnosed with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (2014) III or IV ovarian cancer, more than 70% will have a recurrence of their disease within the first 5 years. Because the clinical need is arguably greatest for these patients, our focus here is on the treatment of advanced disease.

Several algorithms have been designed for screening both average-risk and high-risk patients, – but these have been of limited utility. Most new cases of ovarian cancer are initially diagnosed by gynecologists and primary care physicians. Pelvic masses may be found on examination or during work-up for a nonspecific symptom such as pelvic pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, or bloating, or during a visit to the emergency department for severe symptoms. Once a pelvic mass is identified, in the absence of disseminated disease, laboratory tests such as a CA 125 or an integrated serum panel – may help determine which patients should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist for surgery. Of note, however, these integrated panels, like CA 125, should not be used for screening either the general population or women at high risk for ovarian cancer. For patients diagnosed after surgery with a gynecologist, consultation with a gynecologic oncologist and a formal tumor board discussion is highly recommended to determine whether additional surgery or adjuvant therapy may be indicated. Indeed, outcomes are best when women with gynecologic cancers are treated by a gynecologic oncologist.

### A systematic review of symptoms for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer [^116Gh8Za]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Context

Ovarian cancer is common and has significant morbidity and mortality, partly because it is often diagnosed at a late stage. This study sought to determine the accuracy of individual symptoms and combinations of symptoms for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

MEDLINE was searched, identifying 2,492 abstracts, reviewing 71 articles in full, and ultimately identifying 17 studies published between 2001 and 2014 that met the inclusion criteria. Data were abstracted by two researchers, and quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 criteria adapted to the study question. Bivariate random effects meta-analysis was used where possible, and heterogeneity and threshold effects were explored using receiver operating characteristic curves. Data were analyzed in 2015.

Evidence Synthesis

Most studies were at high risk of bias, primarily because of case-control design or differential verification bias. The highest positive likelihood ratios (LRs+) were found for presence of abdominal mass (LR+, 30.0); abdominal distension or increased girth (LR+, 16.0); abdominal or pelvic pain (LR+, 10.4); abdominal or pelvic bloating (LR+, 9.3); loss of appetite (LR+, 9.2); and a family history of ovarian cancer (LR+, 7.5). No symptoms were helpful at ruling out ovarian cancer when absent. The Ovarian Cancer Symptom Index was validated in five studies and (after excluding one outlier with different inclusion criteria) was 63% sensitive and 95% specific (LR+, 12.6; LR-, 0.39). Two other symptom scores had not been validated prospectively.

Conclusions

Several individual signs and symptoms significantly increase the likelihood of ovarian cancer when present. More work is needed to validate decision rules and develop new decision support tools integrating risk factors, symptoms, and possibly biomarkers to identify women at increased ovarian cancer risk.

### SGO guidance document for clinical trial designs in ovarian cancer: a changing paradigm [^113rjnUU]. Gynecologic Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To explore and facilitate the multifaceted process of drug development and regulatory approval in ovarian cancer.

Methods

The Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) recently sought and received input from multiple stakeholders including the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Clinical Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), pharmaceutical industry, and patient advocates. This whitepaper is the work product and opinion solely of the SGO.

Results

This document summarizes the SGO's interpretation of these meetings and the current regulatory environment where there has been a paucity of recent approvals in the United States. It provides guidance in clinical trial design with the express purpose of encouraging novel drug development in ovarian cancer. Points of emphasis include: ovarian cancer heterogeneity (histologic subtypes and molecular genetic alterations), clinical trial design elements, surrogate as well as composite endpoints, and the four principles of clinical drug development (unmet medical need, discovery, safety, and efficacy).

Conclusions

There has been an evolution in the acceptance of surrogate endpoints depending upon the clinical setting in ovarian cancer. While overall survival (OS) remains the most objective clinical trial endpoint, there is now realization that demanding OS as the primary endpoint has many obstacles. Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease that is now divided by histologic subtypes. Future registration strategies will need to address disease heterogeneity. The exploration of currently acceptable clinical trial endpoints and alternative regulatory strategies will hopefully stimulate interest in novel drug development for patients with ovarian cancer.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® ovarian cancer screening: 2024 update [^1128pXRs]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer remains low in prevalence but has the highest mortality of all gynecologic malignancies. Population-based screening for ovarian cancer remains a topic of interest in contemporary practice, given that the majority of cancers encountered are high-grade aggressive malignancies, for which favorable survival is encountered in the setting of early-stage disease. This document summarizes a review of the available data from randomized and observational trials that have evaluated the role of imaging for ovarian cancer screening in average-risk and high-risk patients. When considering screening using pelvic ultrasound in average-risk patients, we found insufficient published evidence to recommend ovarian cancer screening. Randomized controlled trials have not demonstrated a mortality benefit in this setting. Screening with pelvic ultrasound may be appropriate for select patients at high risk, although the existing data remain limited as large, randomized trials have not been performed in this setting. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### The future of targeted therapies in ovarian cancer [^116RH6F9]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the second most common gynecological malignancy and the leading cause of death from gynecological cancer. Most women present with advanced disease with little prospect for cure. There have been some advances in surgical and chemotherapeutic strategies, but these approaches have led to only minor improvements in outcome. There remains a significant risk for recurrence and resistance to therapy, and hence there is a need to improve upon the current treatment options. Molecularly directed therapy aims to target tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment by blocking specific molecular changes in the cancer. The most promising agents so far are the antiangiogenic agents and polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors. This article reviews the various targeted therapeutic approaches under clinical investigation in ovarian cancer and the challenges facing their future success in the clinic.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^117PqPFj]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

PURPOSE

To provide expert guidance to clinicians and policymakers in three resource-constrained settings on diagnosis and staging of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of patients with epithelial ovarian (including fallopian tube and primary peritoneal) cancer.

METHODS

A multidisciplinary, multinational ASCO Expert Panel reviewed existing guidelines, conducted a modified ADAPTE process, and conducted a formal consensus process with additional experts.

RESULTS

Existing sets of guidelines from eight guideline developers were found and reviewed for resource-constrained settings; adapted recommendations from nine guidelines form the evidence base, informing two rounds of formal consensus; and all recommendations received ≥ 75% agreement.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Evaluation of adult symptomatic women in all settings includes symptom assessment, family history, and ultrasound and cancer antigen 125 serum tumor marker levels where feasible. In limited and enhanced settings, additional imaging may be requested. Diagnosis, staging, and/or treatment involves surgery. Presurgical workup of every suspected ovarian cancer requires a metastatic workup. Only trained clinicians with logistical support should perform surgical staging; treatment requires histologic confirmation; surgical goal is staging disease and performing complete cytoreduction to no gross residual disease. In first-line therapy, platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended; in advanced stages, patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, all patients should be evaluated for interval debulking surgery. Targeted therapy is not recommended in basic or limited settings. Specialized interventions are resource-dependent, for example, laparoscopy, fertility-sparing surgery, genetic testing, and targeted therapy. Multidisciplinary cancer care and palliative care should be offered.

Additional information can be found at. It is ASCO's view that health care providers and health care system decision makers should be guided by the recommendations for the highest stratum of resources available. The guideline is intended to complement but not replace local guidelines.

### The early detection of ovarian cancer: from traditional methods to proteomics. can we really do better than serum CA-125? [^1166PLhT]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy in the United States. More than 80% of patients present with advanced disease, with 5 year survival rates between 15% and 45%. In contrast, the survival rate for stage I disease, with malignancy confined to the ovary, is approximately 95%. Given the discrepancy in survival outcomes between early- and late-stage disease, strategies that would allow for the detection of ovarian cancer in its early stages would hold promise to significantly improve the mortality rate from ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, current screening methods for the detection of early stage ovarian cancer are inadequate. However, several recent proteomics-based biomarker discovery projects show promise for the development of highly sensitive and specific markers for gynecological malignancies, including ovarian cancer. In this review, we hope to provide an overview of the early detection ovarian cancer from traditional methods to recent promises in the proteomics pipeline.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^1164rrFn]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funded the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to create and disseminate educational material for clinicians on the early diagnosis and prevention of gynecologic cancers and early-onset breast cancer. Ovarian cancer is relatively rare, ranking 17th among all cancers in the United States, with an incidence of 10.6 per 100,000 from 2015 to 2019. However, ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in women in the United States and is the deadliest form of gynecologic cancer. Because of its high mortality rate, ovarian cancer was chosen as the second gynecologic cancer for educational material development. To ensure that these materials were based on the most current literature and guidelines, an extensive literature review was conducted. This article is the evidence summary, which is presented in detail in Appendices 2–8, available online at. The health care professional educational material is available online at.

### Ovarian cancer: a review [^116JtFhp]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on ovarian cancer:

- Definition: OC is a gynecologic malignancy that originates in the ovaries.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of OC involves the unchecked growth of abnormal cells in the ovaries that can form tumors. Ovarian tumors may also contain distinct populations of cells, termed cancer stem cells, that are responsible for tumor initiation, maintenance, and growth.
- Epidemiology: The incidence of OC is estimated at 2 per 100,000 person-years.
- Risk factors: Risk factors for OC include advancing age; a family history of ovarian, breast, or CRC; certain genetic mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2; and factors that affect ovulation, such as early menstruation, late menopause, and nulliparity.
- Disease course: OC is associated with non-specific symptoms which may include abdominal bloating, back and pelvic pain, increased abdominal girth, early satiety, constipation, fatigue, and urinary symptoms such as urgency or frequency.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis for OC is generally poor, primarily due to late diagnosis and advanced stage at presentation.

### Latest research and treatment of advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer [^1163mnYZ]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

The natural history of ovarian cancer continues to be characterized by late-stage presentation, metastatic bulky disease burden and stagnant mortality statistics, despite prolific drug development. Robust clinical investigation, particularly with modifications to primary treatment surgical goals and adjuvant therapy are increasing median progression-free survival and overall survival, although the cure rates have been affected only modestly. Maintenance therapy holds promise, but studies have yet to identify an agent and/or strategy that can affect survival. Recurrent disease is largely an incurable state; however, current intervention with selected surgery, combination and targeted therapy and investigational protocols are impacting progression-free survival. Ovarian cancer is a diverse and genomically complex disease, which commands global attention. Rational investigation must balance the high rate of discovery with lagging clinical investigation and limited patient resources. Nevertheless, growth in our armamentarium offers unprecedented opportunities for patients suffering with this disease. This Review presents and reviews the contemporary management of the disease spectrum termed epithelial 'ovarian' cancer and describes the direction and early results of clinical investigation.

### Real world challenges and disparities in the systemic treatment of ovarian cancer [^117BX1NS]. Gynecologic Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer (OC) is a global health problem, and the mortality-to-incidence ratio is expected to increase, especially in low- and middle-income countries. These regions face disparities in access to OC care, including lack of awareness, limited access to genetic and tumor testing, paucity of surgical expertise, time to approval of novel therapeutics, and treatment costs. By addressing these inequities, the core aim of this paper is to promote action through collaboration in order to overcome these barriers and promote health equity in OC management and treatment.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^115dPC46]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This guideline is not focused on screening and/or genetic tests (the prespecified population in this guideline does not include asymptomatic individuals; ASCO has a maximal setting guideline for testing for women with a personal history of ovarian cancer but acknowledges that there is no global resource to inform what is available, accessible, and paid for by population-level care in each country and/or region). Assessing heritable risk of ovarian cancer is a part of diagnosis, but the overall population for this umbrella group of recommendations is women with ovarian masses, independent of potential individual heritable risk, and does not include populations that are asymptomatic. During the diagnosis for women with ovarian masses, the guideline stresses that the most important risk-related intervention is taking family history and related counseling, in all settings, recognizing that genetic counseling is not accessible to most women outside of maximal-resource settings. A 2015 ASCO policy statement "affirms that the recognition and management of individuals at inherited risk for cancer is a core element of oncology practice. The skills required to provide cancer risk assessment services are not specific to a discipline but rather incorporate elements from oncology, medical genetics and genetic counseling, and other disciplines. ASCO recommends continued education of oncologists and other health care professionals in the area of cancer risk assessment and management of individuals with an inherited predisposition to cancer".

Family history includes the patient's age, cancer history, childbearing status and preferences, and that of close relatives (especially first- and second-degree relatives). First-degree relatives include a patient's mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, or son; second-degree relatives are the first-degree relative(s) of a patient's first-degree relatives (grandparents, grandchildren, parent(s') siblings and their children, and half-siblings). Recommendations on genetic testing and how to best manage results are still equivocal in both resource-rich and resource-constrained settings.

Basic-resource settings

Clinicians evaluating women for ovarian masses in basic-resource settings should obtain a comprehensive family cancer history. Recognizing the heritable risk of ovarian cancer, family history of ovarian cancer are key supportive data to guide diagnosis. Families of women with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer seeking genetic counseling should be referred to a higher-level center with clinicians trained in cancer risk management.

### Early detection of ovarian cancer [^117B7CXR]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

From a clinical perspective, ovarian cancer remains a major challenge. Despite advances in therapy, only a marginal improvement in overall survival has been seen in the last decades. This is mainly attributed to the fact that ovarian cancer is mostly diagnosed late and subsequently will relapse. In contrast, borderline tumours and stage I invasive ovarian cancer have excellent prognoses. Unfortunately, early detection of ovarian cancer still remains one of the unmet needs in the management of this disease.

Key points
- Ovarian cancer may cause several symptoms.
- If you have unusual vaginal bleeding, see a doctor right away. Symptoms Ovarian cancer may cause the following signs and symptoms:

- Vaginal bleeding, or discharge from your vagina that is not normal for you.
- Pain or pressure in the pelvic area.
- Abdominal or back pain.
- Bloating.
- Feeling full too quickly, or difficulty eating.
- A change in your bathroom habits, such as more frequent or urgent need to urinate and/or constipation. Pay attention to your body, and know what is normal for you. If you have unusual vaginal bleeding, see a doctor right away. If you have any of the other signs for 2 weeks or longer and they are not normal for you, see a doctor. They may be caused by something other than cancer, but the only way to know is to see a doctor. Linda's Story: Ovarian Cancer Learn about Linda's inspiring journey.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^111Z7cKA]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded funding to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to develop educational materials for clinicians on gynecologic cancers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists convened a panel of experts in evidence review from the Society for Academic Specialists in General Obstetrics and Gynecology and content experts from the Society of Gynecologic Oncology to review relevant literature, best practices, and existing practice guidelines as a first step toward developing evidence-based educational materials for women's health care clinicians about ovarian cancer. Panel members conducted structured literature reviews, which were then reviewed by other panel members and discussed at a virtual meeting of stakeholder professional and patient advocacy organizations in February 2022. This article is the executive summary of the relevant literature and existing recommendations to guide clinicians in the prevention, early diagnosis, and special considerations of ovarian cancer. Substantive knowledge gaps are noted and summarized to provide guidance for future research.

### Diagnosis and management of ovarian cancer [^111Y97kd]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer. Less than one-half of patients survive for more than five years after diagnosis. Ovarian cancer affects women of all ages but is most commonly diagnosed after menopause. More than 75% of affected women are diagnosed at an advanced stage because early-stage disease is usually asymptomatic and symptoms of late-stage disease are nonspecific. The strongest risk factors are advancing age and family history of ovarian and breast cancer. Women who have symptoms concerning for ovarian cancer should undergo a physical examination, transvaginal ultrasonography, and measurement of biomarkers such as cancer antigen 125. If results are suspicious for ovarian cancer, the patient should be referred to a gynecologic oncologist. Despite the low rate of early diagnosis, guidelines recommend against routine screening for ovarian cancer in average-risk women because screening, including routine pelvic examinations, is ineffective and associated with harm. However, a recent trial found a potential benefit of annual screening using an algorithm based on serial cancer antigen 125 measurements followed by transvaginal ultrasonography for women at increased risk, as determined by the algorithm. Women with an increased-risk family history should be referred for genetic counseling and, if genetic mutations (e.g. BRCA mutations) are identified, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy can be considered for risk reduction. In both average- and high-risk women, long-term hormonal contraceptive use reduces risk by about 50%. The treatment of ovarian cancer usually involves surgery, with or without intraperitoneal and intravenous chemotherapy. Primary care physicians have important roles in posttreatment surveillance and end-of-life care.

### Ovarian cancer [^116byz6v]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths among women and causes more deaths than any other gynecologic malignancy. It is estimated that 22,430 new cases will be diagnosed and 15,280 deaths will be attributed to ovarian cancer in the United States in 2007. Despite initial responses to surgery and chemotherapy in up to 80% of cases, more than 75% of affected women ultimately die from complications of disease progression.

### Ovarian cancer [^114Q2sZX]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2016). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer is not a single disease and can be subdivided into at least five different histological subtypes that have different identifiable risk factors, cells of origin, molecular compositions, clinical features and treatments. Ovarian cancer is a global problem, is typically diagnosed at a late stage and has no effective screening strategy. Standard treatments for newly diagnosed cancer consist of cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. In recurrent cancer, chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic agents and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors are used, and immunological therapies are currently being tested. High-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) is the most commonly diagnosed form of ovarian cancer and at diagnosis is typically very responsive to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, in addition to the other histologies, HGSCs frequently relapse and become increasingly resistant to chemotherapy. Consequently, understanding the mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and finding ways to overcome them are active areas of study in ovarian cancer. Substantial progress has been made in identifying genes that are associated with a high risk of ovarian cancer (such as BRCA1 and BRCA2), as well as a precursor lesion of HGSC called serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which holds promise for identifying individuals at high risk of developing the disease and for developing prevention strategies.

### SGO white paper on ovarian cancer: etiology, screening and surveillance [^116Yhpmf]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous, rapidly progressive, highly lethal disease of low prevalence. The etiology remains poorly understood. Numerous risk factors have been identified, the most prominent involving an inherited predisposition in 10% of cases. Women with germline mutations associated with Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer and Lynch syndromes have dramatically elevated risks (up to 46% and 12%, respectively). Risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy is the best method to prevent ovarian cancer in these high-risk women. Significant risk reduction is also seen in the general population who use oral contraceptives. Since up to 89% patients with early-stage disease have symptoms prior to diagnosis, increased awareness of the medical community may facilitate further workup in patients who otherwise would have had a delay. Despite enormous effort, there is no proof that routine screening for ovarian cancer in either the high-risk or general populations with serum markers, sonograms, or pelvic examinations decreases mortality. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether any novel biomarkers, or panels of markers, have clinical utility in early detection. Prospective clinical trials have to be designed and completed prior to offering of any of these new diagnostic tests. CA125 is currently the only biomarker recommended for monitoring of therapy as well as detection of recurrence. This commentary provides an overview on the background, screening and surveillance of ovarian cancer.
