## Question

A 15 old girl presents with cyclical abdominal pain and discomfort. Abdominal examination recalls a palpable mass. On inspection of the vulva there is a  pink structure Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A Longitudinal vaginal septum B. Transverse vaginal septum C. Imperforate hymen D. Cervical stenosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which diagnosis is most likely in a 15-year-old girl with cyclical abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, and a pink structure at the vulva, choosing among longitudinal vaginal septum, transverse vaginal septum, imperforate hymen, and cervical stenosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic clinical triad and whether it fits an obstructive outflow anomaly. Then, I should verify the differential diagnosis and how each option typically presents. Next, I will examine the significance of the pink structure at the introitus and correlate it with authoritative descriptions. Finally, I will confirm the most likely diagnosis and outline the immediate evaluation and management implications, including when ultrasound or MRI is needed [^d00bc8b3] [^86239ae2].

> Let me first confirm the clinical triad: cyclical abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, and a vulvar structure in a 15-year-old strongly suggest an obstructive uterovaginal anomaly with hematocolpos or hematometrocolpos, especially around menarche when endometrial tissue is functional and blood accumulates proximal to the obstruction [^d00bc8b3] [^86239ae2].

> Wait, let me verify the differential and how each option behaves. Imperforate hymen classically presents with primary amenorrhea, cyclical pain, and a bulging, bluish-tinged hymenal membrane at the introitus due to hematocolpos; a palpable abdominal mass reflects a distended vagina and sometimes uterus, and urinary retention or constipation are common from mass effect [^877fbe29] [^d65bae3a]. Transverse vaginal septum causes obstruction more proximally, often with a shortened vagina and no visible bluish bulge at the introitus; the hymen is usually normal, and a digital or rectal exam may reveal a bulge without a palpable cervix, prompting MRI for surgical planning [^d33e3c19] [^86239ae2]. Longitudinal vaginal septum typically does not cause complete outflow obstruction and would not produce a solitary pink bulge at the introitus; it may present with dyspareunia or retained tampon, but not the classic hematocolpos triad [^5c4edc18]. Cervical stenosis is an internal cervical canal problem and would not produce a visible vulvar mass, though it can cause hematometra and pain; it is far less likely to explain the introital finding here [^e61cdc4b].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should double-check the significance of the pink structure. At first glance, I almost said "bluish bulge", which would be textbook for imperforate hymen with hematocolpos, but wait, the stem says pink, not blue. Let me reconsider: ACOG notes that imperforate hymen with hematocolpos appears as a dark-colored or bluish-tinged bulge, whereas distal vaginal atresia appears as pink mucosa without discoloration; however, the absence of a bluish hue does not exclude imperforate hymen, especially early or with variable lighting or tissue thickness, and the overall phenotype of cyclical pain, palpable mass, and a bulging membrane at the introitus still fits imperforate hymen best among the choices provided [^d65bae3a] [^019d20bf]. I should confirm that the other options are less consistent: transverse septum would not show a bulge at the introitus, longitudinal septum would not cause complete obstruction or a solitary pink bulge, and cervical stenosis would not be visible externally, so the balance of evidence still favors imperforate hymen despite the atypical color description [^d33e3c19] [^5c4edc18].

> Next, I should review the immediate evaluation. I need to ensure a careful perineal exam in lithotomy or frog-leg position with downward labial traction to visualize the introitus and confirm the anatomy; if a swab cannot be passed behind a band of tissue, that supports a longitudinal septum rather than imperforate hymen, which would show a complete membrane without a passage [^019d20bf]. I should also obtain transabdominal pelvic ultrasound to document hematocolpos and assess uterine distension; MRI is reserved if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if I suspect a transverse septum, distal vaginal atresia, or cervical atresia that would change surgical planning [^d00bc8b3] [^86239ae2].

> I will now examine management implications. If imperforate hymen is confirmed, hymenectomy is the definitive treatment and is ideally timed after pubertal estrogenization but before prolonged symptoms; most patients have resolution of pain and no long-term fertility impact, though I should counsel on rare stenosis or adhesion risks and arrange follow-up given the potential for endometriosis after retrograde menstruation [^cf4fec6e] [^d65bae3a]. But wait, what if I'm underestimating the complexity? If ultrasound suggests a more proximal obstruction or the exam is atypical, I should escalate to MRI and consider referral to a center with expertise in complex Müllerian anomalies to avoid incomplete treatment or recurrence [^86239ae2] [^44af3b7e].

> Putting this together, the most likely diagnosis is imperforate hymen, with the pink structure representing the bulging hymenal membrane at the introitus and the palpable mass reflecting hematocolpos/hematometrocolpos from accumulated menstrual blood; the cyclical pain aligns with hormonal cycling and outflow obstruction, and the alternative options are less consistent with the physical findings and classic presentation [^877fbe29] [^d65bae3a].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **imperforate hymen** [^877fbe29], given the classic triad of cyclical abdominal pain, a palpable abdominal mass, and a pink, bulging structure at the vulva consistent with hematocolpos [^d65bae3a]. This presentation is pathognomonic for imperforate hymen with retained menstrual blood causing a bulging hymenal membrane and a distended vagina/uterus [^d841b3c9]. Transverse vaginal septum would not show a vulvar bulge, longitudinal vaginal septum would not cause complete obstruction, and cervical stenosis would not produce a visible vulvar mass [^d33e3c19] [^5c4edc18].

---

## Clinical features supporting imperforate hymen

- **Cyclical abdominal pain**: Typical of imperforate hymen due to retained menstrual blood (hematocolpos) causing distension and pain [^877fbe29].
- **Palpable abdominal mass**: Reflects a distended vagina and/or uterus from accumulated blood [^d841b3c9].
- **Pink bulging structure at vulva**: The imperforate hymen appears as a thin, bulging membrane with a pink or bluish hue due to hematocolpos [^d65bae3a] [^5e7caa78].

---

## Differential diagnosis and exclusion of alternatives

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Reason for exclusion** |
|-|-|-|
| Transverse vaginal septum | - Cyclical pain <br/> - Amenorrhea <br/> - Possible mass | - No visible vulvar bulge <br/> - Hymen is usually normal [^d33e3c19] |
| Longitudinal vaginal septum | - Incomplete obstruction <br/> - Dyspareunia <br/> - Retained tampon | - Does not cause complete obstruction or a bulging vulvar mass [^5c4edc18] |
| Cervical stenosis | - Amenorrhea <br/> - Cyclical pain <br/> - Hematometra | - No visible vulvar mass <br/> - Internal cervical obstruction [^e61cdc4b] |

## Pathophysiology of imperforate hymen

Imperforate hymen is a congenital anomaly in which the hymenal membrane fails to perforate, blocking vaginal outflow [^877fbe29]. At puberty, menstrual blood accumulates, causing **hematocolpos**, vaginal/uterine distension, and a visible bulge at the introitus [^d65bae3a].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Physical examination**: Confirm a bulging, thin hymenal membrane without perforation [^d65bae3a].
- **Ultrasound**: Identify hematocolpos/hematometra and exclude other anomalies [^d00bc8b3].
- **MRI**: If diagnosis is uncertain or complex anomalies are suspected [^86239ae2].

---

## Management

Definitive management is **hymenectomy** to drain retained blood and restore outflow; timing after pubertal estrogenization reduces recurrence and improves healing [^57af669a] [^cf4fec6e].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **imperforate hymen** with hematocolpos, given the classic features and the absence of findings pointing to alternatives [^877fbe29].

Imperforate hymen—neonatal and pubertal presentations and initial management are described as follows: the imperforate hymen may present in the neonatal period as a hydrocolpos or mucocolpos with a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass at the introitus, and surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients with intervention usually deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, typical findings include a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos that distends further with the Valsalva maneuver; pain may be pelvic or abdominal, cyclic or acute, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia.

Introduction Imperforate hymen is a rare congenital anomaly, seen in about 1 in 2, 000 newborn females. The most common symptoms in pubescent females include cyclical abdominal pain, amenorrhea, urinary retention, constipation, and back pain. Most symptoms are preceded by the buildup of vaginal fluids in the vagina and/or the uterus. Hematocolpometra can lead to a substantial abdominal mass that can apply obstructive pressure to both the urinary tract, as well as lower intestinal tract. Case Report A 12-year-old girl with chronic abdominal pain and constipation returns to the Emergency Department with diffuse abdominal pain. The first time the patient was evaluated she underwent an abdominal x-ray, which noted a nonspecific bowel gas pattern without evidence of free air or obstruction, an unremarkable urinalysis, and was noted to have a mild normocytic anemia. The patient was discharged home with instructions to double her dose of polyethylene glycol.

### Imperforate hymen: a cause of abdominal pain in female adolescents [^d841b3c9]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

A 16-year-old girl presented with primary amenorrhea and had had cyclical abdominal pain for almost a year. At examination we observed a painful mass in the lower abdomen and normal secondary sex characteristics. Perineal examination showed a bluish bulging hymen. Transabdominal ultrasonography revealed a dense mass in the pelvis measuring about 12×11 cm. We diagnosed an imperforate hymen with haematocolpos and haematometra. The hymen was opened surgically and a large quantity of menstrual blood was drained from the vagina and uterus. Postoperative recovery was normal without any pain. The patient now menstruates regularly. An imperforate hymen occurs in 0.05% of women. It is important to be aware of this while examining a female adolescent presenting with cyclical abdominal pain and primary amenorrhea. Late discovery of an imperforate hymen may lead to pain, infections, hydronephrosis and endometriosis with subfertility as a possible consequence.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^019d20bf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Physical examination for suspected hymenal obstruction—evaluation aims to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies and includes abdominal and perineal examination; optimal technique uses dorsal lithotomy or frog-legged position with downward labial traction to visualize the distal introitus. A moist cotton or nasopharyngeal swab can be placed through a perforation and gently tented to the introitus to confirm the diagnosis; if the swab cannot be passed behind a band of hymenal tissue, a longitudinal vaginal septum is likely, and ultrasonography is recommended. Imperforate hymen with hematocolpos reveals a dark-colored or bluish-tinged bulge without hymenal fringe, whereas distal vaginal atresia appears as pink mucosa without discoloration; a speculum rarely is helpful or necessary, and a digital rectal examination can be less painful than a vaginal examination for adolescents and may be particularly helpful to confirm the presence of the cervix or assess the distance from the hematocolpos to the perineum.

Medical and family history for adnexal masses—personal medical and detailed gynecologic history with symptom review are critical, and family history and review of other risk factors will help assess malignancy likelihood. Symptom patterns refine the differential: the potential for pregnancy should be evaluated in all women of reproductive age because ectopic pregnancy is in the differential; unilateral, intermittent, and then acutely worsening pelvic pain may indicate ovarian torsion; indolent progressive pelvic pain with fevers, chills, vomiting, and vaginal discharge may indicate an infectious etiology such as a tubo-ovarian abscess; women with acute or chronic dysmenorrhea or pain with intercourse may have an endometrioma; persistent bloating, generalized abdominal pain, and early satiety may be signs of malignancy; and abnormal or postmenopausal bleeding may be caused by estrogen produced by sex cord-stromal tumors.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^d00bc8b3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies—ACOG Committee Opinion Number 779—outlines presentation and diagnostic evaluation. Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies may present after puberty with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, recurrent vaginal discharge, or infertility, and the evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging, with the genital examination critical to differentiate key causes. Pelvic ultrasonography is the initial imaging method recommended for a patient with cyclic pain and amenorrhea or a patient with persistent dysmenorrhea, but diagnosis of a uterine or vaginal anomaly by imaging before puberty can be challenging and misleading. If the diagnosis is not certain or there is a concern for specified distal obstructive anomalies, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended, and consultation with a radiologist experienced with imaging of uterovaginal anomalies may be helpful to determine the most accurate diagnosis.

### Familial occurrence of imperforate hymen [^d9873de5]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Imperforate hymen is uncommon, occurring in 0.1 % of newborn females. Non-syndromic familial occurrence of imperforate hymen is extremely rare and has been reported only three times in the English literature. The authors describe two cases in a family across two generations, one presenting with chronic cyclical abdominal pain and the other acutely. There were no other significant reproductive or systemic abnormalities in either case. Imperforate hymen occurs mostly in a sporadic manner, although rare familial cases do occur. Both the recessive and the dominant modes of transmission have been suggested. However, no genetic markers or mutations have been proven as etiological factors. Evaluating all female relatives of the affected patients at an early age can lead to early diagnosis and treatment in an asymptomatic case.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^d33e3c19]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies—physical examination recommendations and key findings include that examination should begin with an evaluation of sexual maturity (Tanner staging) and an abdominal examination for tenderness or an abdominal mass due to an enlarged obstructed uterus. The genital examination is critical to differentiate an imperforate hymen from labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia, and downward labial traction can separate the labia to visualize the distal introitus. An imperforate hymen with hematocolpos reveals a dark-colored or bluish-tinged bulge without hymenal fringe, while distal vaginal atresia appears as pink mucosa without discoloration. If a digital examination is tolerated, a shortened vagina without a palpable cervix may be consistent with a transverse septum, cervical atresia, or vaginal agenesis; in obstructive hemivagina with ipsilateral renal anomaly, a bulge may be present along the patent vaginal wall that deviates the patent vagina away from the obstructed side, and the cervix on the patent side is frequently pulled medially toward the septum and may be difficult to palpate. If a speculum examination is tolerated, using a smaller, shortened, Huffman speculum or a nasal speculum may allow visualization of a vaginal septal microperforation, and in adolescents a digital rectal examination is often less painful than a vaginal examination and may help confirm cervical presence or assess distance from the hematocolpos to the perineum with vaginal or hymenal obstructions.

### Imperforate hymen mimicking acute appendicitis in an adolescent woman: a rare presentation [^2ef3c0ce]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Imperforate hymen is a rare congenital malformation of the female genital tract. The condition poses several diagnostic challenges owing to its low incidence and often atypical presentation. Classical symptoms include amenorrhoea and cyclical abdominal pain. Delayed diagnosis leads to potentially irreversible and lifechanging sequelae including infertility, endometriosis and renal failure. A premenarchal 13-year-old girl with a background of chronic constipation presented with symptoms mimicking acute appendicitis. The underlying cause was imperforate hymen and retrograde menstruation. The diagnosis was made during diagnostic laparoscopy. As with this patient, pre-existing symptoms are often troublesome long before the true diagnosis is made. This case report highlights the importance of recognising imperforate hymen as a potential cause of acute abdominal pain in premenarchal adolescent girls. The clinical picture may present as right or left iliac fossa pain. Early identification reduces the risk of adverse complications and avoids unnecessary and potentially harmful interventions.

### Hematocolpos due to imperforate hymen: a case report and literature systematic review [^ceb64444]. International Urogynecology Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Hematocolpos is a rare condition, where menstrual blood fills the vagina, instead of being expelled, due to a series of uterovaginal pathologies, the most frequent of which is the imperforate hymen. To date, few cases of hematocolpos have been reported in the literature.

Methods

We report a case of hematometrocolpos due to imperforate hymen initially misdiagnosed as constipation and subsequently as ovarian mass; moreover, the present study undertakes a systematic review of studies on hematometrocolpos due to imperforate hymen to synthesize available knowledge on epidemiology, diagnosis, and management about this rare condition.

Results

A total of 35 studies, describing 61 patients, were identified. The presence of hematocolpos should be suspected in premenarchal patients complaining of low abdominal pain, abdominal swelling, and urinary retention. Genital examination disclosing a tender, pale hymen and ultrasound represent a useful tool for diagnosis. The goal of the management is to timely perform hymenotomy to drain the hematocolpos, followed by hymenectomy to prevent recurrence. Follow-up is needed to diagnose possible recurrences.

Conclusions

In the case of an adolescent girl complaining of genital pain associated with primary amenorrhea, hematocolpos due to imperforate hymen should be suspected.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion summary, number 780 [^5e7caa78]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

At puberty, a patient with an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by the hematocolpos behind it. Other findings that may be present include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia. On evaluation, the goal is to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies, such as labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia. Surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients. After confirmation of the diagnosis, surgical intervention usually is deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. It is important to complete an abdominal and a perineal examination. If the physical examination reveals a bulging hymen and ultrasonography reveals hematocolpos, further imaging is not required. However, if the diagnosis is not certain or there is a concern for a distal vaginal atresia, cervical atresia, an obstructed uterine horn, or transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum, magnetic resonance imaging is recommended. The ideal time for surgical intervention on hymenal tissue is before the onset of pain and after onset of pubertal development, when the vaginal tissue is estrogenized. Surgical management of clinically significant hymenal variations involves excision of the hymenal tissue and rarely is associated with long-term sequelae. If there is concern that the patient has a distal vaginal atresia or a transverse vaginal septum, the patient should be referred to a center with expertise in the management of these conditions.

### Pelvic pain in young girls: not only dysmenorrhoea! [^45cdcd13]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Imperforate hymen is the most frequent cause of haematocolpos, although it is a rare malformation (1:2000). We present two cases of young girls with cyclic abdominal pain and urinary symptoms. At gynaecological examination, they all presented imperforate hymen and ultrasound revealed significant vaginal distension. X-shaped hymenectomy was performed in all patients. The later the diagnosis of imperforate hymen, the higher the risk of complications like haematometra, haematosalpinx, haemoperitoneum and infections such as tubo-ovarian abscesses, peritonitis and endometriosis (retrograde menstruation theory).

### Acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age: keys to suggest a complication of endometriosis [^a563a435]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Endometriosis is a common disease, which can present with a variety of symptoms, and not exclusively chronic symptoms. A complication of endometriosis should always be kept in mind as a possible cause for acute symptoms in a woman of reproductive age, and the patient’s history should always be asked for and considered. MRI is the best imaging modality to reach the diagnosis of endometriosis, but an accurate diagnosis is possible on CT, especially in the presence of stellar, mildly enhanced, infiltrative lesions in suggestive areas. Save the complications of endometriomas, the main differential diagnoses are malignant tumors.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^d65bae3a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion—diagnosis of imperforate hymen at puberty highlights typical presentation and evaluation steps. At puberty, an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia. On evaluation, the goal is to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies such as labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia. It is important to complete an abdominal and a perineal examination. If the physical examination reveals a bulging hymen and ultrasonography reveals hematocolpos, further imaging is not required. However, if the diagnosis is not certain or there is concern for a distal vaginal atresia, cervical atresia, an obstructed uterine horn, or transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended. Typically, an imperforate hymen is an isolated issue and does not have long-term effects on fertility, sexual function, or obstetric outcomes.

### Early detection of imperforate hymen prevents morbidity from delays in diagnosis [^31d9661c]. Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

Although it is detectable at all ages through inspection of the external genitalia, imperforate hymen (IH) is a diagnosis that is missed commonly. We hypothesized that children with late diagnoses (predefined as > or =8 years of age, chosen to reflect the timing of normal menarche) would be more likely to be symptomatic, undergo more diagnostic testing, and lack appropriate documentation in their medical records, compared with children with earlier diagnoses (ie, <8 years of age).

Methods

All patients with IH were identified through searches of 3 hospital databases with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. The medical records of eligible subjects were reviewed by a single, blinded researcher. Comparisons were made between children diagnosed at younger versus older ages.

Results

A bimodal distribution of age at diagnosis was demonstrated; 43% (n = 10) of girls were diagnosed at <8 years of age, and 57% (n = 13) were diagnosed at > or =8 years of age. Among older girls, 100% were symptomatic (abdominal pain and/or urinary symptoms; duration of symptoms: 1-120 days), whereas 90% of cases in the younger group were detected incidentally. Documentation was lacking for breast development (77%), pubic hair development (69%), and menstrual history (46%) among the older girls. Older children were more likely to present symptomatically (odds ratio: 42.0; 95% confidence interval: 3.1-1965.7) and to undergo ancillary testing (odds ratio: 20.3; 95% confidence interval: 1.6-983.1).

Conclusions

Two distinct populations of girls with IH exist, ie, those diagnosed without symptoms at a young age and those not diagnosed until >8 years of age. By incorporating an examination of the external genitalia into their routine practice, clinicians caring for children can prevent the significant delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and morbidity associated with the latter group.

### Current evaluation of amenorrhea: a committee opinion [^8fcd03dc]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Anatomic defects—Müllerian agenesis and complete androgen insensitivity are highlighted: when the uterus and vagina are absent with otherwise normal female sexual characteristics, Müllerian agenesis is usual and accounts for approximately 15% of primary amenorrhea, and it must be differentiated from complete androgen insensitivity, which is rare (incidence as low as 1 in 60,000) yet comprises approximately 5% of primary amenorrhea. Distinguishing features include serum testosterone in the normal male range or higher in complete androgen insensitivity, confirmation by a 46, XY karyotype, and clinical clues of family history, absent pubic hair, and occasional inguinal masses; the incidence of gonadal malignancy is 14%–22% and it rarely occurs before age 20, and removal of the gonads should be offered after breast development and attainment of adult stature through a patient-centered process. Other anatomic defects include imperforate hymen (1 in 1,000 women), transverse vaginal septum (1 in 80,000 women), and isolated absence of the vagina or cervix, which more often present with cyclic pain and retained blood rather than primary amenorrhea.

### Hematometrocolpos disguised as abdominal pain [^2f5bd160]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hematometrocolpos caused by an imperforate hymen is a common form of vaginal outflow obstruction. This is a rare pediatric anomaly that can present with atypical or vague symptomatology, such as abdominal pain or constipation or urinary retention in the setting of amenorrhea. It is essential to obtain a gynecologic history and inquire about menstrual cycles to properly evaluate a young female with such a common complaint as abdominal pain. Failure to perform a gynecologic examination in the emergency department setting may delay diagnosis and appropriate care for this rare condition, which can lead to serious complications.

Case Report

This case describes a 12-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain and urinary symptoms. Because of the severity of the patient's pain on abdominal examination, we obtained a computed tomography scan of her abdomen and pelvis, which showed findings consistent with hematometrocolpos. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Obstruction of the female genital outflow tract is a rare occurrence. Because abdominal pain is such a common complaint, not only in the pediatric emergency department but also in the outpatient setting, the diagnosis of hematometrocolpos may easily go undiagnosed for months or even years. Obtaining a complete gynecologic history is key when evaluating young females with abdominal pain or urinary retention. Early detection and timely management can prevent serious complications and long-term sequelae. This patient had a successful outcome and early surgical management of her hematometrocolpos which was caused by an imperforate hymen.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 728: Müllerian agenesis: diagnosis, management, and treatment [^01265c53]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Müllerian agenesis—initial evaluation and exclusion of obstructive anomalies outlines key examination and imaging steps. The initial evaluation of an adolescent patient with primary amenorrhea includes a physical examination to assess for signs of appropriate or delayed puberty. In patients with müllerian agenesis, thelarche and adrenarche will be appropriate for age, but genitourinary examination will reveal a distal vagina that may be shortened without a palpable cervix, and imaging will not identify a typical midline uterus. An evaluation to exclude obstructive anomalies, including imperforate hymen, distal vaginal atresia, transverse vaginal septum, and cervical atresia, should be performed. On physical examination, the imperforate hymen with hematocolpos will appear as a bluish-colored bulging membrane without the typical hymenal fringe; distal vaginal atresia may appear as a pink vaginal dimple and may be bulging without a hymenal fringe; and a low transverse vaginal septum usually will have a normal hymen with more proximal obstruction of the vaginal canal. A rectal examination often will identify a bulging of the proximal vagina; imaging studies are indicated to delineate internal anatomic structures, and postpubertal pelvic imaging usually will reveal hematocolpos, or hematometra, or both.

### European society of paediatric radiology abdominal imaging task force recommendations in paediatric uroradiology, part IX: imaging in anorectal and cloacal malformation, imaging in childhood ovarian torsion, and efforts in standardising paediatric uroradiology terminology [^7efba1c0]. Pediatric Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinically acute severe pain on either side of the abdomen or the pelvis, often with an intermittent character, is common. Nausea and vomiting, fever and/or a palpable abdominal mass may be present. Other symptoms include peritoneal pain and gastrointestinal or urinary tract symptoms. But there is no single symptom or sign that can confirm or preclude ovarian torsion. Often nonspecific biomarker inflammatory responses can be observed such as leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and increased IL-6 and CD64. In patients post menarche, ectopic pregnancy is considered (and potentially ruled out by looking at the level of human chorion gonadotropin) as well as ovarian tumors looking at additional tumor markers, e.g. alpha-fetoprotein.

The first imaging procedure to assess suspected childhood ovarian torsion is usually an immediate US scan, which allows for assessment of the ovaries as well as other potential causes of lower abdominal pain (Fig. 9). In children, a sufficiently filled bladder is very helpful – one should consider filling the bladder if ovaries cannot initially be depicted. On US, the most striking finding is an enlarged ovary with increased echogenicity typically with small peripheral cysts that exhibit echoes and sometimes layered sedimentation due to hemorrhagic infarction (Fig. 10). Displacement of the ovary and the uterus to the ipsilateral side is common. US should be performed using a transducer with the highest feasible frequency (in neonates 18–10 MHz, in infants 5–12 MHz, in older girls usually frequencies range between 2 and 8 MHz). Harmonic imaging can be helpful and a linear transducer will improve depiction of the typical small periphery follicles. Both ovaries and the uterus as well as the adnexal structures and the vascular supply should always be assessed, although there is a poor correlation of color Doppler findings with the diagnosis, particularly for ruling out ovarian torsion due to the ovary’s dual blood supply. A typical and diagnostically decisive sign is the twisted pedicle with a whirlpool/spiral sign of the ovarian pedicle. Free fluid in the pelvis is often seen. An ovarian or para-ovarian mass may be present, and is sometimes the cause of the torsion (i.e. a large cyst or an ovarian tumor; Fig. 10). The only proof for torsion by (Doppler) sonography is the presence of a whirlpool sign combined with lack of visible/depictable circulation, whereas the absence of depictable Doppler signals alone cannot predict ovarian torsion and the presence of Doppler signals in an otherwise abnormal ovary does not preclude torsion. Nevertheless, Doppler sonography cannot predict viability.

### Müllerian aplasia with severe hematometra: a case report of diagnosis and management in a low resource setting [^1a5d578f]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Müllerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome is described as congenital absence of the proximal vagina with or without absence of the cervix and uterus, most often recognized after the onset of primary amenorrhea.

Case

An 18-year-old woman presented to a free medical clinic in Arcahaie, Haiti with primary amenorrhea, abdominal distention, and cyclic monthly abdominal pain. Physical exam was significant for uterus palpable superior to the umbilicus, absence of vagina, and rectal exam without palpable vagina or cervix. Transabdominal and transperineal ultrasound examinations did not reveal hematocolpos. Exploratory laparotomy revealed severe endometriosis with bilateral hematosalpinx, markedly distended uterus, no proximal vagina, and normal ovaries. Uterine specimen was filled with blood and no clear cervix was present.

Summary and Conclusion

Diagnosis of vaginal and cervical agenesis is complicated in low-resource settings and treatment must be modified when subspecialty care and consistent follow-up are not available.

### Imperforate hymen presenting as chronic low back pain [^c9b7a6d8]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Imperforate hymen in an adolescent usually presents with cyclic abdominal pain or with pelvic mass associated with primary amenorrhea. We present a 13-year-old girl with chronic lower back pain of 6 months' duration as the only complaint. On physical examination, multiple trigger points were detected in the quadratus lumborum and gluteus medius muscles bilaterally. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hematometrocolpos secondary to an imperforate hymen. Hymenectomy was performed, with complete resolution of the back pain. Myofascial pain syndrome with a viscerosomatic reflex is a possible explanation for the clinical presentation of our patient.

### Adnexal torsion in adolescents: ACOG committee opinion No, 783 [^5b8eb9e0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adnexal torsion in adolescents—presentation and diagnosis—Adnexal torsion is the fifth most common gynecologic emergency, and the most common clinical symptom of torsion is sudden-onset abdominal pain that is intermittent, nonradiating, and associated with nausea and vomiting. In pediatric and adolescent females, torsion may involve an ovary without an associated mass or cyst in as many as 46% of cases, but although more than one half of cases of pediatric and adolescent adnexal torsion occur in the setting of an adnexal mass, cancer in this age group rarely presents as adnexal torsion. There are no clinical or imaging criteria sufficient to confirm the preoperative diagnosis of adnexal torsion, Doppler flow alone should not guide clinical decision making, and in 50% of cases, adnexal torsion is not found at laparoscopy.

### Picture of the month (...) [^9348ae4d]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

The differential diagnosis of an interlabial mass in a newborn infant or a young girl includes hydrocolpos, prolapsed urethra, prolapsed ureterocele, paraurethral cyst, and rhabdomyosarcoma of the vagina. 1, 2 Although it may be difficult to distinguish between these lesions, evaluation of the relationship of the urethral opening to the mass and the quality of the mass are key to the proper diagnosis. In our patient, findings from pelvic ultrasonographic examination disclosed a large, fluid-filled vagina secondary to an imperforate hymen. Hymenotomy resulted in drainage of 500 mL of milky fluid. Hydrocolpos is the distension of the vagina and uterus by accumulated mucus and/or blood secreted by the uterine and cervical glands stimulated in utero by maternal estrogen or withdrawal of estrogen after birth. Imperforate hymen, transverse vaginal septum, or vaginal atresia may be responsible for this lesion.

Accumulated secretions behind an intact hymen or a low transverse vaginal septum may produce the interlabial mass. The mass may compress the adjacent bladder, ureters, bowel, or pelvic veins, resulting in urinary retention, constipation, or edema of the lower extremities. Whereas an imperforate hymen and low septum rarely are associated with other congenital anomalies, a mid or high septum and vaginal atresia are almost always associated with other gastrointestinal or genitourinary anomalies. 3 Half of all cases of hydrocolpos are identified in the newborn period, and the other half are diagnosed during adolescence.
4. Prolapsed urethra most commonly occurs in black, premenarcheal girls. The mass is smooth, round, bright red or cyanotic, and completely encircles the urethral meatus. The vaginal opening should be identified posterior to the mass. The mucosa of the prolapsed urethra is friable, resulting in a presenting complaint of spotting, vaginal bleeding, or hematuria.

5 Urine can be obtained by passing a catheter through the central lumen. Congenital abnormalities are not associated with this lesion. A prolapsed ureterocele appears as a smooth, round, red to purplish-blue, depending on the duration of prolapse, interlabial mass. The urethral opening may not be easily identifiable because it surrounds the mass. If urination occurs, urine will flow around the mass.

### Magnetic resonance imaging of acquired disorders of the pediatric female pelvis other than neoplasm [^f8b3dd2b]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Transabdominal US remains the primary screening imaging modality of the pediatric female pelvis. However, MRI has become an invaluable adjunct to US in recent years. MRI offers superb soft-tissue contrast resolution that allows for detailed evaluation, particularly of the ovaries and their associated pathology. MRI can yield diagnostic information that is similar to or even better than that of US, especially in nonsexually active girls in whom transvaginal US would be contraindicated. MRI is generally a second-line examination and is preferred over CT because it does not involve the use of ionizing radiation. MRI might be underutilized in this population, particularly in differentiating surgical from nonsurgical conditions. This article reviews the relevant anatomy and discusses imaging of acquired conditions that involve the pediatric female genital tract, illustrating associated pathology with case examples.

Adnexal torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain in middle childhood and, in general, the diagnosis is often delayed due to the lack of specificity of symptoms and imaging tests. We describe the case of a girl in middle childhood who came to the emergency department for pain in the right iliac fossa of approximately 15 hours of evolution associated with partial refusal of food intake and vomiting. The initial examination showed normal vital signs, a soft abdomen, pain on palpation in the lower region, but no signs of peritoneal irritation, a mild leucocytosis with no other signs of infection and the initial abdominal ultrasound showed no objective pathology. Finally, after clinical worsening and a repeat imaging test, she was diagnosed with right ovarian torsion.

Case presentation

A 25 years old gravida 3, and para 2 (both are alive) mother presented with the complaint of advanced labor pain of 18 h duration. She came by ambulance transport from a 35 km distant rural health center to Bele Primary Hospital, Wolaita Zone, Southern Ethiopia. The mother did not remember her last normal menstrual period but claims to be amenorrheic for the last 9 months. During the current pregnancy; she had no antenatal care visit, no history of vaginal bleeding, no abdominal pain, and no other danger signs of pregnancy. She has no previous history of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and pelvic surgery. She has also no history of contraceptive use. Both her last deliveries were at home with no complications. During the physical examination, her vital signs were in the normal range. Pink conjunctiva and non-icteric sclera. On abdominal examination, 38 weeks sized uterus, fetal heart beat was 148 bpm, cephalic presentation, longitudinal lie, multiple fetal poles were not appreciated, there was 3 uterine contractions in 10 min with moderate strength and bladder was not distended. On the genito-urinary examination (per vagina), cervix was fully dilated, vertex presentation, fetal head visible at vulva, normal position, no sign of caput or molding, the membrane was ruptured with clean amniotic fluid.

Basic laboratory investigations were done, her hematocrit level was 35%, and her blood group was “O positive”. Other serologic tests were also done for HIV, Hepatitis, and syphilis and all were negative and urine analysis was also negative for microscope exam.

Vaginal delivery summary, this mother gave birth to alive female neonate weighing 3300gm with an Apgar score of 8 and 9 in the 1 st and 5 th minutes respectively by spontaneous vaginal delivery and 3 rd stage of labor managed actively.

But after the delivery of the neonate, her abdomen shows three tumor features i.e. contracted 20 weeks sized uterus and palpable masses at both left and right upper quadrants. The mass was non-tender and slightly hard and smooth at the left side posterior to the uterus and irregular at the right side (Fig. 1). Bimanual exploration of the uterus was made to look for after coming 2 nd twin and speculum examination also performed to explore the presence of additional cervical canal and double uterus, but only one cervical opening was appreciated. The posterior fornix was bulged.

### A new magnetic resonance imaging-based PUMCH classification system for congenital cervical malformations: devising a standardised diagnosis pathway [^e61cdc4b]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital cervical malformations (CCMs) are rare deformities of the female lower genital tract. These malformations are believed to be caused by the abnormal fusion of the Müllerian ducts and/or lack of subsequent canalisation during development and manifest as the absence or underdevelopment of the cervix. The prevalence of CCMs in the population ranges from 1 to 1.25 cases per 100,000 people, and congenital vaginal agenesis coexists in approximately half of these patients. The likelihood of CCM should be highly suspected in pubertal young women with primary amenorrhoea, cyclical abdominal pain, or a pelvic mass ; a lengthy delay in diagnosing this condition (i.e. 1–5 years) often results in the development of endometriosis. Prompt clinical management of CCM is crucial to alleviate any obstructions and prevent severe complications that may lead to irreversible damage to reproductive potential, as such sequelae may require interventions such as salpingectomy and hysterectomy.

Hysterectomy has traditionally been a widely accepted and effective treatment option for CCM. Although advances in surgical techniques and reconstructive expertise led to other viable conservative options, such as canalisation, such methods may cause serious complications. Currently, treatment selection is primarily based on the type of cervical malformation and presence of the vagina. CCMs are classified as type C4 female genital tract anomalies by the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology/European Society for Gynaecological Endoscopy and as type IB congenital anomalies by the American Fertility Society/American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Although the most widely accepted system is that of Rock et al, which is based on a study of 30 patients, there remains ongoing controversy regarding the clinical practicality of CCM subclassifications.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive tool that is routinely used to diagnose CCM owing to its high soft tissue contrast and multiplanar imaging capability. This imaging modality provides high-quality and accurate anatomical information, thereby aiding in the early diagnosis of cervical malformations. However, Rock et al’s subclassification primarily relies on anatomical structures; this necessitates confirmation via postsurgical evaluation and creates a challenge in terms of detecting anomalies based solely on imaging tests. To date, a comprehensive subclassification of MRI-based morphological and signal features in a statistically significant number of patients is lacking. Hence, there is an unmet need for a widely accepted and practically employable CCM classification system that can guide appropriate surgical management.

### Adnexal torsion in adolescents: ACOG committee opinion No, 783 [^e64f8ed8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adnexal torsion in adolescents—conclusion and surgical management state that the differential diagnosis of an adolescent presenting with abdominal pain should include adnexal torsion, and a minimally invasive surgical approach is recommended with detorsion and preservation of the adnexal structures regardless of the appearance of the ovary. Surgeons should not remove a torsed ovary unless oophorectomy is unavoidable, such as when a severely necrotic ovary falls apart, and continued educational efforts targeted at relevant providers are needed, while collaborative care pathways should be encouraged. Adolescents are a unique population with specific needs; thus, special care for placement of ports and lower insufflation pressure may be indicated, and multispecialty collaboration is crucial to optimize care and ensure that minimally invasive detorsion with ovarian preservation is the standard treatment provided to adolescents with adnexal torsion.

### A rare cause of acute abdominal pain: herlyn-werner-wunderlich syndrome [^6e1221f3]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich (HWW) syndrome is a rare müllerian duct anomaly with uterus didelphys, unilateral obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. Patients with this syndrome generally present after menarche with pelvic pain and mass and, rarely, primary infertility in later years. Strong suspicion and knowledge of this syndrome are mandatory for an accurate diagnosis. A 14-year-old female patient presented with acute retention of urine and abdominopelvic pain. Her condition was diagnosed with the use ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as a case of HWW syndrome. She was treated with vaginal hemiseptal resection. The HWW syndrome should be considered among the differential diagnoses in girls with renal anomalies presenting with pelvic mass, symptoms of acute abdominal pain, and acute urinary retention.

### Congenital atresia of uterine isthmus: successful diagnosis and end-to-end anastomosis [^e13f432d]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Müllerian duct anomalies are rare and occasionally diagnosed in adolescents with primary amenorrhea, abdominal pain, and sexual difficulties. They are present in a variety of forms and sometimes difficult to appropriately classify. The management of malformations remains controversial.

Case

A 15-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea and cyclic lower abdominal pain was found on laparoscopic examination to have an asymmetric ball-shaped uterus with isthmus stenosis suspended in the pelvis. The junction between the lower segment of uterus and the cervix was very thin and stenotic with scar-like tissue changes. Combined with pathologic evaluation, it was finally diagnosed as congenital atresia of uterine isthmus. Thus, an end-to-end anastomosis was performed instead of surgical resection.

Summary and Conclusion

Müllerian duct anomalies in a variety of forms can be difficult to diagnosis correctly and treat appropriately. Preservation of reproductive ability is the first objective of all treatments.

The evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging, and accurate diagnosis is critical to manage the obstruction properly. The best long-term outcome is achieved with a complete evaluation, clear understanding of the anomaly, mobilization of appropriate surgical resources, sufficient preoperative counseling, and planned surgical intervention, and females at high risk of obstruction should be monitored closely for early signs and symptoms of obstruction during pubertal development and initial menses.

### Nongynecological endometriosis presenting as an acute abdomen [^1f622ee9]. Emergency Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a highly prevalent disease that affects up to 10 % of menstruating women. Patients commonly present with pelvic pain or infertility, although the range of clinical symptoms varies widely. Affected women may be asymptomatic or experience mild, moderate, or severe pain that fluctuates with hormonal cycles. Patients who suffer extreme pain may seek immediate care and present to the emergency department with clinical signs of an acute abdomen. In the case of patients without a prior history of endometriosis, the differential diagnosis is broad and making the correct clinical and radiologic diagnosis in the emergency setting can be challenging. In some cases, the diagnosis is only made after surgical or histopathological analysis. Prompt and accurate clinical and radiological evaluation is necessary because complications of endometriosis, such as bowel obstruction and appendicitis, may require immediate surgical intervention. This pictorial essay analyzes nongynecological manifestations of endometriosis that may have a clinical presentation of an acute abdominal emergency. Atypical clinical presentations and unusual sites and complications of endometriosis are discussed, as well as the differential diagnostic considerations. The radiologic features of endometriosis are shown on multiple modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound.

### Teenager with abdominal pain and decreased appetite [^fd7b5252]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

A 16-year-old girl presented to her primary care physician with a one-month history of decreased appetite and abdominal pain. She had normal bowel movements and no vomiting, but her periumbilical pain limited her ability to finish most meals. She had gradual weight loss over the previous 2 years, and during the previous 4 years, she intermittently received counseling for depression after the loss of her mother. Her initial physical examination and laboratory evaluation were unremarkable. She was referred to a nutritionist, adolescent medicine, and pediatric gastroenterology. Her presentation evolved over time, which ultimately led to a definitive diagnosis.

### Transverse vaginal septum presenting as secondary amenorrhoea: a rare clinical presentation [^0704581d]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Transverse vaginal septum is one of the variants of Mullerian duct anomaly, caused as a result of defective fusion or recanalisation of vaginal and Mullerian organs. At an early age, it commonly presents as primary amenorrhea along with cyclical abdominal pain while later on usually it presents as dyspareunia and infertility. Our 22-year-old patient presented with secondary amenorrhea. It is very unusual for a transverse vaginal septum to cause secondary amenorrhea. MRI and clinical examination raised the suspicion of transverse vaginal septum causing secondary amenorrhea. She attained regular menstrual cycle after septum excision. The proposed theory behind it is obliteration of microperforated transverse vaginal septum because of menstrual blood and cell debris. Thus, a rare possibility of transverse vaginal septum should also be considered as a differential diagnosis of secondary amenorrhea.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^9605c2e2]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Chronic constipation—history and physical examination emphasize history of urinary symptoms and obstetric history, including “number of pregnancies, history of hysterectomy, injuries, and repairs,” and “Consideration should be given for inquiring about a history of sexual assault or the presence of an eating disorder,” with “a careful assessment of symptoms and frequency and consistency of bowel movements (BMs) [that] may help distinguish among constipation subtypes.” The text notes that “Patients with infrequent, hard stools may be more likely to have colonic inertia, whereas those with incomplete evacuation and straining may be more likely to have pelvic floor dysfunction, and the presence of abdominal pain may indicate IBS,” but “the history alone may be inadequate to clearly establish a diagnosis because many patients will have symptoms associated with more than 1 subtype.” For examination, “The physical examination is directed at the abdominal and anorectal components,” the abdomen is “nontender but may be remarkable for distention or discomfort on palpation,” “Special attention should be paid to the presence of palpable abdominal masses,” and “External anorectal inspection should include specific attention to the presence of distorted anatomy or a bulky lesion, such as a neoplasm.” Digital rectal examination can reveal “anal hypertonia, paradoxical puborectalis contraction, rectocele, anorectal mass, [and] stricture.”

### Imperforate hymen causing hematocolpos and urinary retention [^45dc8916]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute urinary retention is rare in the pediatric population and is typically caused by an obstructing entity. It may result from hematocolpos caused by imperforate hymen. Imperforate hymen is rare, with an associated incidence of 1 in 2000 people. Nonetheless, in a pediatric age female who presents with urinary retention and who has a history of primary amenorrhea or a history of cyclical pelvic pain an examination of the external genitalia should be performed to rule out this condition.

Case Report

A 12-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with urinary retention and was discharged with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection. She returned the following day to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a fluid-filled vagina measuring 12.5 cm. Her bladder measured 15.4 cm. The patient was taken to the operating room for further evaluation by the consulting gynecologist. At the time of surgery, 1000 mL of urine were evacuated after catheterization. Three hundred milliliters of chocolate-colored fluid, consistent with menstrual blood, were evacuated at time of hymenotomy. Hymenotomy was performed with a cruciate incision. No complications were encountered. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: To date, there have been >40 reported cases of imperforate hymen causing hematocolpos and subsequent urinary retention. However, given the rarity of imperforate hymen, hematocolpos leading to acute urinary retention can still be missed. Untreated urinary retention can lead to a compromise in bladder function and subsequent kidney damage.

### Nearly normal congenital cervical fragmentation: a hard-to-diagnose and successful end-to-end anastomosis [^5e74ccb9]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Congenital cervical fragmentation is a very rare genital tract malformation that usually presents in adolescence with primary amenorrhea and cyclic, monthly, lower abdominal pain. We report a nearly normal case of congenital cervical fragmentation and successful end-to-end anastomosis.

Case

A 15-year-old girl presented with primary amenorrhea with cyclic, monthly lower abdominal pain lasting for 15 months without any abnormal imaging findings (pelvic CT scan, ultrasonography, and hysteroscopy). Misdiagnosis and appendectomy was performed at the time of the initial lower abdominal pain. Diagnostic combined hysteroscopy and laparoscopy were performed in our hospital, and cervical fragmentation was diagnosed. A converted laparotomy end-to-end anastomosis was performed successfully, and regular menstruation was restored after the operation.

Summary and Conclusion

The malformation of nearly normal congenital cervical fragmentation is existent and hard to diagnose. As long as the patient has persistent primary amenorrhea with cyclic, monthly lower abdominal pain, even if no abnormal findings on imaging, obstructive malformation of the reproductive duct should be the primary suspicion. Diagnosis and treatment should occur as early as possible to preserve the patient's fertility. End-to-end anastomosis is the best method for this type of patient.

### Spontaneous reformation of imperforate hymen after repeated hymenectomy [^ff087e38]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Imperforate hymen prevents menstrual blood drainage, which causes cyclic lower abdominal pain and amenorrhea. Untreated patients might develop serious complications such as endometriosis and infertility. Hymenectomy represents the adequate treatment.

Case

In a 16-year-old female virgin presented with recurrent lower abdominal pain, urine retention, and secondary amenorrhea after 3 hymenectomy surgeries. The examination revealed imperforate hymen. A fourth hymenectomy was performed with continuous locked sutures over all of the edges.

Summary and Conclusion

Recurrent imperforate hymen after hymenectomy should be suspected if symptoms recur. Diagnosis can be achieved through meticulous clinical examination and appropriate imaging techniques.

### Acute abdominal pain as a result of a ruptured hematosalpinx: a rare complication of an unusual Müllerian anomaly [^6d0501dd]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 15-year-old virgin Caucasian female presented to the emergency room with a 40-hour history of acute left lower quadrant abdominal pain and nausea. Evaluation suggested a left pelvic kidney with obstructed ureter being the etiology. Her pain continued to escalate so further workup with laparoscopy was performed. This demonstrated a left pelvic sidewall hemi uterus with ruptured hematosalpinx. This is an unusual clinical presentation of a müllerian anomaly not previously documented.

Discussion

The differential diagnosis of acute unilateral abdominal pain in adolescent females should include müllerian anomalies. The incidence of this diagnosis is low but the evaluation and treatment can be performed in an expeditious manner if the diagnosis is considered. The laparoscopic excision of a unilateral noncommunicating uterine horn is a valid and recommended treatment approach of this rare malformation.

### Adnexal torsion in adolescents: ACOG committee opinion No, 783 [^7a973a16]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Adnexal torsion in adolescents—clinical presentation and preoperative evaluation: When evaluating adolescents with suspected torsion, there are no clinical or imaging criteria sufficient to confirm the preoperative diagnosis, and patients with a clinical suspicion for adnexal torsion should undergo emergent diagnostic laparoscopy. The most common clinical symptom is sudden-onset abdominal pain that is intermittent, nonradiating, and associated with nausea and vomiting; nausea and vomiting are reported in 62% and 67% of cases, respectively. Clinical signs include abdominal tenderness, which is reported in up to 88% of patients, whereas rebound and peritoneal signs are reported in only 12–27% of patients, and a bimanual examination generally is not necessary or tolerated in pediatric and adolescent patients.

### Early diagnosis of imperforate hymen may prevent morbidity (...) [^accc8c1c]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Imperforate hymen is a rare disorder that can manifest clinically as abdominal pain, back pain, constipation, urinary symptoms, primary amenorrhea, and peritonitis. Some-times it is acquired secondary to sexual abuse. It is easily diagnosed; however, late diagnosis may be associated with greater morbidity and more testing than earlier diagnosis. Posner and Spandorfer performed a retrospective medical record review to determine whether there was a difference in symptoms and medical evaluation in patients diagnosed with imperforate hymen before eight years of age compared with patients diagnosed at eight years or older. In a computerized search of medical records spanning 13 years from a large tertiary care center, researchers found 23 patients with imperforate hymen. Of these, 10 were diagnosed before four years of age, and the remaining 13 were 10 years or older at diagnosis.

One girl in the younger group was symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, compared with all of the girls in the latter group. In this older group, almost one half were given preliminary diagnoses other than imperforate hymen, with 11 undergoing ancillary diagnostic testing. In the younger group, only one child underwent testing before diagnosis. Three children in the younger group had ultrasound examinations to confirm the physical examination findings, whereas eight of the 12 ultrasound examinations performed in the older group were part of the diagnostic work-up of symptoms. The authors conclude that protracted symptoms relating to imperforate hymen might be avoided with early diagnosis. Imperforate hymen readily can be detected by a physical examination of the hymenal area while the child lies in frog-leg or knee-chest position. In older patients, imperforate hymen presents as a bulging mass at the vaginal introitus.

The authors suggest that an external genitalia examination included in routine newborn and infant evaluations could prevent morbidity in later years. Treatment is with surgical hymenectomy, but the optimal timing of this is unclear.

### Herlyn-werner-wunderlich syndrome: a very rare urogenital anomaly in a teenage girl [^df045dfe]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich (HWW) syndrome is an uncommon variant of Müllerian duct anomalies, consisting of uterine didelphys, obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. It usually presents in a post-pubertal adolescent or adult woman in whom hematometrocolpos produces a pronounced mass effect and pain on the side of the obstructed hemivagina.

Case Report

We report the case of a 13-year-old girl who presented to the emergency radiology department with sudden onset of severe pain at the right lower quadrant of the abdomen; imaging confirmed the diagnosis of HWW syndrome. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: When unilateral renal agenesis and uterus didelphys coexist, the first thing that the physician should remember is to confirm or refute the presence of a blind vagina for diagnosis of HWW syndrome.

### An adolescent with acute abdominal pain and bowel wall thickening [^8b1d5361]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2018). Low credibility.

: A 15-year-old girl was admitted with acute crampy abdominal pain and repeated vomiting over the preceding 2hours; no fever, diarrhoea or abdominal trauma was reported. She had started oestrogen-progestin contraception 3months ago. She had sought medical advice twice in the previous weeks for self-limiting episodes of right hand swelling, without urticaria. On examination, she was unwell and in pain, with severe tenderness in the right lower quadrant, without guarding or rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds were diminished. Blood tests were unremarkable. Two hours after admission, an abdominal ultrasound scanning showed an impressive wall thickening (>1cm) of the terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon (figure 1). Abundant free intraperitoneal fluids in the pelvis and in the hepatorenal recess were present.edpract;103/1/22/EDPRACT2016311823F1F1EDPRACT2016311823F1Figure 1Marked caecal wall thickening evidenced at the ultrasound scanning.

### OHVIRA syndrome: clinical implications of a delayed diagnosis [^4dd46a3b]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Obstructed Hemi Vagina with Ipsilateral Renal Agenesis (OHVIRA) syndrome is a rarely encountered müllerian duct anomaly. Delayed diagnosis is common due to normal onset of puberty and menstruation. We report a case of a woman in her early 20s with a background history of multiple emergency department visits, ward admissions and surgeries for chronic abdominal pain. She was reviewed at 1month postlaparotomy for recurrent pelvic abscess and was finally diagnosed to have an OHVIRA syndrome, 11 years after her first clinical presentation. Excision of the vaginal septum completely resolved her symptoms. We are reporting this case to highlight the clinical implications resulting from the delayed diagnosis, to look into factors contributing to the delay and to highlight the importance of having a high index of suspicion to diagnose this unique condition.

### Cervicovaginal cellular angiofibroma [^c9563c3f]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Investigations

The abdominal examination did not reveal any abnormalities. There was no abdominal swelling or pain. On vaginal examination, a large mass was palpable in the fornix posterior. Speculum investigation revealed a finger-shaped and easy-bleeding mass in the posterior fornix.

Transvaginal ultrasound showed a uterus in anteverted and anteflexed position with a large mass presumably arising from the posterior wall of the uterus and growing through the posterior fornix (figures 1 and 2). The lesion was identified as homogeneous hypoechogenic and presented with a regular outer contour and some internal shadowing. There was one feeding blood vessel. No adnexal abnormalities were seen. These characteristics suggested a benign cervical mass, favouring the diagnosis of a leiomyoma.

Transvaginal ultrasound imaging. Transverse view of the mass with a maximum diameter of 5.91 cm.

MRI of the abdomen was additionally performed and a solid mass of 5 cm, projecting in the pouch of Douglas (figures 3 and 4A, B) was identified. A preferred diagnosis of an exophytic subserosal cervical leiomyoma was made.

As the findings on medical imaging together with the patient’s age were reassuring, the chance of malignancy became less probable. A biopsy was already taken during a vaginal examination at the referring hospital. The anatomopathological (AP) examination confirmed the diagnosis of a benign mesenchymal tumour, but no further subclassification was possible at the time.

### Early detection of imperforate hymen prevents morbidity from delays in diagnosis (...) [^8b905d72]. publications.aap.org (2005). Low credibility.

Objective. Although it is detectable at all ages through inspection of the external genitalia, imperforate hymen is a diagnosis that is missed commonly. We hypothesized that children with late diagnoses would be more likely to be symptomatic, undergo more diagnostic testing, and lack appropriate documentation in their medical records, compared with children with earlier diagnoses. Methods. All patients with IH were identified through searches of 3 hospital databases with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes. The medical records of eligible subjects were reviewed by a single, blinded researcher. Comparisons were made between children diagnosed at younger versus older ages. Results.

A bimodal distribution of age at diagnosis was demonstrated; 43% of girls were diagnosed at <8 years of age, and 57% were diagnosed at ≥8 years of age. Among older girls, 100% were symptomatic, whereas 90% of cases in the younger group were detected incidentally. Documentation was lacking for breast development, pubic hair development, and menstrual history among the older girls. Older children were more likely to present symptomatically and to undergo ancillary testing. Conclusions. Two distinct populations of girls with IH exist, ie, those diagnosed without symptoms at a young age and those not diagnosed until >8 years of age.

By incorporating an examination of the external genitalia into their routine practice, clinicians caring for children can prevent the significant delays in diagnosis, misdiagnosis, and morbidity associated with the latter group. Comments.

Evaluation of average-risk women with symptoms or signs—Clinicians should maintain an appropriate level of suspicion and evaluate women with frequent, new-onset symptoms while recognizing that most symptomatic women will not have ovarian cancer. A case–control study demonstrated that women with more than 12 days per month of new onset (less than 12 months’ duration) symptoms, including an increase in abdominal size or bloating, pelvic or abdominal pain, or difficulty eating or feeling full quickly had increased odds of having ovarian cancer compared with women without these symptoms; the study suggested that women with these symptoms should be evaluated, and ovarian cancer should be included in the differential diagnosis, and women and obstetrician–gynecologists should be aware that the vast majority with these symptoms will not have ovarian cancer.

### Unique presentation of hematometrocolpos mimicking cauda equina syndrome: severe back pain and urinary incontinence in an adolescent girl [^b7558626]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Imperforate hymen with hematometrocolpos in adolescent females is a rare pediatric condition. Classical presentation includes abdominal pain or a pelvic mass in female patients with primary amenorrhea. Atypical complaints and reluctance among emergency physicians to perform genital examination in the emergency department or the pediatric emergency department (PED) may delay correct diagnosis.

Case Report

We report a unique, cauda equina syndrome-like presentation of hematometrocolpos secondary to imperforate hymen in a 13-year old, previously healthy girl with primary amenorrhea. In the PED, the unusual clinical presentation of severe back pain and urinary incontinence initially mimicked cauda equina syndrome and led to delayed correct diagnosis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The novelty of this case is a cauda equina-like presentation of imperforate hymen secondary to hematocolpos. This report illustrates the highly variable clinical presentation of this rare gynecological pediatric entity. It underlines the importance of considering this rare condition in the differential diagnosis of severe upper or lower back pain alongside voiding abnormalities including urinary retention and incontinence in adolescent females with primary amenorrhea. Above all, the importance of performing a thorough history and genital examination in this subgroup early in the investigation process in the PED emerges from this case. Essentially, excellent clinical judgment and genital examination by the emergency physician may minimize unnecessary radiological investigations and ultimately, accelerate correct diagnosis and expedite appropriate surgical treatment. However, not only pediatric and adult emergency physicians, but also pediatricians and general practitioners should be aware of this entity and its diverse clinical presentation.

### Spontaneously conceived 17-week heterotopic pregnancy: a challenging and unusual diagnosis [^70e8cbeb]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Case presentation

A 37-years-old pregnant woman, gravida 2 para 1, consulted our emergency clinic at 16 2/7 weeks of amenorrhoea for abdominal pain, which started 2 days before. Her pregnancy was spontaneously conceived. She was initially treated with cefuroxime prescribed by her gynaecologist who suspected cystitis, but failed to improve. In our service, she had problem of acute left pelvic pain irradiating to the back and left thigh. The patient denied having had vaginal bleeding, urinary or digestive symptoms. She did not have any relevant medical history, except for a normal vaginal delivery 16 months earlier.

On clinical examination, her heart rate was 84 beats/min, blood pressure was 100/55 mm Hg with a temperature of 37.3°C. The abdominal wall was tender without guarding nor rebound. On pelvic examination, there was a small quantity of blood in the vagina, and no adnexal mass was palpable on bimanual examination. The uterus was measured at 17 cm, as expected for the gestational age.

### Obstructive reproductive tract anomalies [^13b54b9a]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 7% of girls will have an anatomic abnormality in their reproductive tract, diagnosed before or after puberty.

Objective

It is important for providers to be aware of the obstructive reproductive tract conditions, the way in which various conditions present, and the way in which such conditions should be managed.

Design

Systematic review of the literature using the GRADE evidence system.

Results

There is limited data in most areas of obstructive reproductive tract anomalies; however, some retrospective and prospective series with small numbers are still useful to guide clinical practice.

Conclusions

Recommendations are based on limited or inconsistent scientific evidence. Recommendations are based primarily on consensus and expert opinion.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: expert practical guidance [^8cbfa4c8]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Comments

As with FGIDs in general, a comprehensive patient assessment is needed to rule out red flags and to characterize the FACP. We recommend that the assessment includes an evaluation of family history (especially for malignancy, gastrointestinal diseases, and other conditions that could affect their management), current and recent medication, characteristics of pain (nature, location, duration, quality, frequency, and severity), and eating/bowel habits (including known food allergies, intolerances, and triggers). In selected patients and at the discretion of the doctor, a physical examination (including bowel sounds and digital rectal examination) and limited laboratory tests may be appropriate, and psychosocial assessment may also be helpful, particularly if the patient has preexisting psychiatric comorbidities or there are indicators of significant psychological stress.The physical examination should assess the pain location and whether there is a palpable mass, abnormal or absent bowel sounds, rebound tenderness, rigidity/resistance, distension, and/or guarding. Experience in IBS shows that relevant laboratory tests might include complete blood cell counts and other targeted blood tests (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and/or celiac serology), thyroid and liver function tests, and stool studies (eg, fecal calprotectin and/or occult blood test), as indicated.,Abdominal ultrasound investigations can sometimes be helpful and are cheap and simple to undertake in most settings.There are also certain other signs and symptoms that may require additional evaluation. For example, for pain in women that seems to be related to the menses, a gynecologic evaluation should be considered.Similarly, for pain brought on by physical exertion, a cardiology assessment should be sought. If the initial investigations raise concerns or are equivocal, referral for a computerized axial tomography scan might be considered.

Assuming none of the red flag signs/symptoms are present and no abnormalities are identified at the physical examination, laboratory tests, or other investigations, a diagnosis of FACP may be considered if the symptoms are described by the present definition. If the FACP is tightly related to changes in bowel evacuation, IBS is the most probable diagnosis and should be confirmed using the Rome IV criteria.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^cf4fec6e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 780—Outcomes and follow-up indicate that most patients will have resolution of pain after hymenectomy. Imperforate hymen is not associated with concomitant uterine anomalies, and in the absence of symptoms postoperative uterine imaging usually is not required. Although stenosis and adhesions have been reported after hymenectomy, these complications are extremely rare, and in these situations dilator therapy may be considered. If an adolescent is doing well after the procedure, she may not need additional care; however, because of the risk of endometriosis after hematometrocolpos, she should be encouraged to return if she experiences significant dysmenorrhea.

### An unusual cause of postpartum abdominal pain: case report [^486b4c8f]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department. It extends to all populations regardless of age, sex, or socioeconomic status. After gathering a history and examining the patient, most Emergency Physicians form a differential diagnosis and initiate an appropriate work-up. However, in the postpartum woman, additional causes must be considered and treated accordingly, knowing that there are consequences for both mother and child. We present a case of a postpartum woman presenting with right-sided abdominal pain, the cause of which, although atypical, has potential for significant morbidity and mortality if it goes undiscovered.

### Management of acute obstructive uterovaginal anomalies: ACOG committee opinion, number 779 [^44af3b7e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Obstructive uterovaginal anomalies may present after puberty with amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, recurrent vaginal discharge, or infertility. The evaluation of a patient with a suspected obstructive reproductive anomaly should include a detailed medical history, physical examination, and imaging. The genital examination is critical to differentiate a patient with an imperforate hymen from a patient with labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia. Pelvic ultrasonography is the initial imaging method recommended for a patient with cyclic pain and amenorrhea or a patient with persistent dysmenorrhea. It is important to note that diagnosis of a uterine or vaginal anomaly by imaging before puberty can be challenging and misleading because of the small size of the prepubertal uterus and the lack of endometrial stimulation and menstrual distention of the vagina. Consultation with a radiologist experienced with imaging of uterovaginal anomalies may be helpful to determine the most accurate diagnosis. In general, obstructive vaginal and uterine anomalies are not surgical emergencies, and the complexities of these conditions are best managed by gynecologic care providers familiar with the surgical management of these conditions. Given the high risk of stenosis and complications associated with transverse vaginal septum, distal vaginal atresia, and cervical atresia, referral to a center with expertise in the management of these anomalies is paramount. The best long-term outcome is achieved with a complete evaluation, clear understanding of the anomaly, mobilization of appropriate surgical resources, sufficient preoperative counseling, and planned surgical intervention.
