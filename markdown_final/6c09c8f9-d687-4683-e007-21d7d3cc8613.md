## Question

Can you have shoulder pain from hemoperitoneum

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether shoulder pain can result from hemoperitoneum. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy that would plausibly transmit pain from the peritoneal cavity to the shoulder. Then, I should verify whether blood in the peritoneal cavity can irritate the diaphragm and phrenic nerve. Next, I will look for direct clinical evidence linking hemoperitoneum to shoulder pain across different etiologies. After that, I should consider confounders like pneumoperitoneum and surgical positioning to ensure I'm not conflating mechanisms. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically actionable conclusion and note exceptions and diagnostic implications.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy. The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve, which arises from cervical roots C3–C5, and the same cervical segments also supply the shoulder and clavicular regions. This shared segmental innervation provides a classic pathway for referred pain from subdiaphragmatic irritation to the ipsilateral shoulder, often termed Kehr's sign when due to splenic pathology [^9bebd0b8] [^80b8202f].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology. Irritation of the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm — whether from gas, inflammatory fluid, or blood — can activate phrenic afferents and produce referred shoulder pain. This is well established in the laparoscopy literature for CO2 pneumoperitoneum and is mechanistically analogous for hemoperitoneum, where blood pools under the diaphragm and acts as a chemical and mechanical irritant [^92d84456] [^8b9959b7].

> I will now examine direct clinical evidence. Multiple case reports and series document shoulder pain accompanying hemoperitoneum: splenic rupture after colonoscopy with hemoperitoneum and left shoulder pain, atraumatic splenic rupture with left shoulder pain and shock, ruptured ovarian cyst with right shoulder-tip pain and acute anemia, and hepatic rupture in HELLP with right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder. These patterns align with the expected C3–C5 referral distribution [^d180361c] [^a0d6b01f] [^e4eafcdf] [^c1f3706a] [^71cdef47] [^2376e67c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should distinguish hemoperitoneum-related shoulder pain from other common causes. Post-laparoscopic shoulder pain is frequent and largely driven by residual CO2 irritating the diaphragm; that is a different, though related, mechanism than hemoperitoneum. Similarly, surgical positioning and musculoskeletal strain can contribute to shoulder pain after operations, so I need to ensure that when blood is present, the timing and distribution fit a referred phrenic pattern rather than purely positional or incisional pain [^92d84456] [^8b9959b7] [^355b3355].

> Let me consider laterality and distribution to strengthen the inference. Right shoulder pain suggests irritation under the right hemidiaphragm (liver, gallbladder, right ovary), whereas left shoulder pain suggests irritation under the left hemidiaphragm (spleen, distal pancreas, left ovary). This anatomic mapping is consistent with the cited cases and with the neuroanatomy of phrenic referral, reinforcing that hemoperitoneum can indeed produce shoulder pain when blood accumulates subdiaphragmatically [^c1f3706a] [^d180361c] [^71cdef47].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence. While much of the data are observational and case-based, the convergence across diverse etiologies (splenic, hepatic, ovarian, iatrogenic) and the coherence with established neurophysiology make the association biologically plausible and clinically reliable. Guidelines for HELLP explicitly advise imaging when shoulder pain accompanies right upper quadrant pain, underscoring the diagnostic weight of this symptom complex [^046ec50d] [^71cdef47].

> But wait, what if the shoulder pain is musculoskeletal or cardiac? I need to ensure we keep a broad differential. Shoulder pain can also reflect rotator cuff disease, cervical radiculopathy, or referred cardiac pain; however, when shoulder pain coexists with acute abdominal pain, peritoneal signs, or hemodynamic instability — especially in the presence of free intraperitoneal fluid — hemoperitoneum with diaphragmatic irritation should be prioritized and urgently evaluated with appropriate imaging and resuscitation [^c3c3b011] [^e8f14299] [^420e3df1].

> In summary, yes — shoulder pain can result from hemoperitoneum when blood irritates the diaphragm and triggers phrenic nerve–mediated referred pain. The pattern is typically ipsilateral to the bleeding source, often appears within hours of the inciting event, and may precede or accompany abdominal pain. Recognizing this sign can expedite diagnosis of life-threatening intra-abdominal hemorrhage and guide timely intervention [^80b8202f] [^e4eafcdf] [^71cdef47].

Yes, shoulder pain can occur with hemoperitoneum due to **diaphragmatic irritation** from blood beneath the diaphragm, causing referred pain via the phrenic nerve (C3–C5) to the shoulder — a classic Kehr's sign [^80b8202f]. This is most often seen with **splenic injury** (traumatic or atraumatic) [^e4eafcdf] [^4377fe41] but also with hepatic rupture, ectopic pregnancy, and other sources of free intraperitoneal blood [^71cdef47] [^5463e17f]. Shoulder pain from hemoperitoneum is typically sudden, severe, and worsened by inspiration or movement, and it mandates urgent evaluation for bleeding and hemodynamic instability [^71cdef47].

---

## Pathophysiology of shoulder pain in hemoperitoneum

The mechanism is **referred pain** from diaphragmatic irritation: blood in the peritoneal cavity irritates the peritoneal surface of the diaphragm, stimulating the phrenic nerve (C3–C5), which also supplies the shoulder, producing ipsilateral shoulder pain [^80b8202f]. This is the same mechanism behind post-laparoscopic shoulder pain from CO2 irritation, but in hemoperitoneum, blood is the irritant [^92d84456].

---

## Clinical evidence linking hemoperitoneum to shoulder pain

Multiple clinical reports and reviews document shoulder pain with hemoperitoneum, particularly in **splenic injury**:

- **Splenic rupture**: Traumatic or atraumatic splenic rupture frequently presents with left upper quadrant pain radiating to the left shoulder (Kehr's sign) [^80b8202f] [^e4eafcdf].
- **Colonoscopy-associated splenic injury**: Case reports describe left shoulder pain with hemoperitoneum after colonoscopy-induced splenic laceration [^d180361c] [^a0d6b01f].
- **Hepatic rupture**: Subcapsular hematoma or hepatic rupture (e.g. HELLP) can cause right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder [^71cdef47] [^2376e67c].
- **Ectopic pregnancy**: Ruptured ectopic pregnancy with hemoperitoneum often presents with shoulder pain due to diaphragmatic irritation [^notfound].

## Clinical characteristics of shoulder pain in hemoperitoneum

Shoulder pain from hemoperitoneum typically has the following features:

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Onset | Sudden, often concurrent with acute abdominal pain |
| Location | Ipsilateral to the bleeding source (left shoulder for splenic injury; right shoulder for hepatic injury) |
| Quality | Sharp, severe, persistent |
| Aggravating factors | Inspiration, movement, supine position |
| Associated symptoms | Abdominal pain, distension, nausea, vomiting, hemodynamic instability |

---

## Diagnostic implications

Shoulder pain in the setting of acute abdominal pain or trauma should **prompt evaluation for hemoperitoneum**. Key steps include:

- **Focused assessment**: Look for peritoneal signs, hypotension, and tachycardia [^80b8202f].
- **Imaging**: FAST ultrasound for unstable patients; CT for stable patients to identify free fluid and the bleeding source [^420e3df1].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, coagulation profile, type and crossmatch [^notfound].

---

## Clinical significance and management

Shoulder pain from hemoperitoneum signals **significant intra-abdominal bleeding** and a high risk of hemodynamic instability. Management depends on severity:

- **Stable patients**: Observation, serial exams, and transfusion as needed [^96aeff60].
- **Unstable patients**: Emergent laparotomy or angiographic embolization for hemostasis [^997bc42b].
- **Source-specific therapy**: Splenectomy or splenic embolization for splenic injury; hepatic artery embolization or surgical packing for hepatic rupture [^4377fe41] [^71cdef47].

---

## Conclusion

Shoulder pain can occur with hemoperitoneum due to **diaphragmatic irritation** from subdiaphragmatic blood, producing referred pain via the phrenic nerve. This is a critical clinical clue, especially in splenic or hepatic injury, and warrants immediate evaluation and management of the underlying hemorrhage [^80b8202f].

### Shoulder pain after laparoscopic antireflux surgery: a single-center, randomized, open-label trial [^f2d82210]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery is widely accepted as the preferred approach for managing various abdominal conditions, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, and abdominal and hiatal hernias. Compared to open surgery, laparoscopy offers several advantages, such as reduced wound size, decreased analgesia requirements, shorter hospital stays, less postoperative pain, and faster recovery. However, it is frequently associated with postoperative cervical and shoulder pain — complications that are relatively uncommon in open procedures.

Although the incidence of post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) is up to 80% on the first postoperative day, its precise etiology remains unclear. It has been proposed that pneumoperitoneum, caused by carbon dioxide insufflation, induces peritoneal stretching and irritation of the diaphragm and phrenic nerves, leading to referred pain in the shoulders, proximal upper limb, and cervical region. Other plausible secondary mechanisms include regional musculoskeletal tension resulting from patient positioning, frequent head hyperextension maneuvers during the procedure, and exposure to thermal changes (e.g. cold temperatures) in the operating room.

Notably, shoulder pain may be more pronounced after laparoscopic antireflux surgery (LARS) and other foregut procedures, where extensive manipulation of mediastinal and abdominal structures can increase the risk, severity, and frequency of PLSP. Contributing factors likely include mechanical traction on blood vessels and nerves as well as surgical manipulation at the diaphragmatic crura (e.g. suturing, mesh reinforcement, relaxing incisions). These interventions may facilitate the release of local inflammatory mediators (i.e. chemokines), further exacerbating inflammation and phrenic nerve irritation.

Several multimodal pharmacological strategies (e.g. intraperitoneal anesthesia, intrathecal administration of anesthetics) as well as non-pharmacological approaches (e.g. low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum, Hemovac drainage, shoulder massage, pulmonary recruitment maneuvers, intraperitoneal drainage, and intraperitoneal saline irrigation) have been explored to mitigate PLSP and reduce opioid-derived medication use. However, most of these interventions have shown inconsistent efficacy or face barriers (e.g. scalability, costs, safety profile) to widespread implementation in surgical practice. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two easily implementable and inexpensive adjunctive strategies for PLSP relief: (i) intraoperative local anesthetic instillation over the left hemidiaphragm (targeting phrenic nerve irritation mechanisms) and (ii) postoperative use of a commercially available back massager after primary LARS (targeting musculoskeletal tension mechanisms).

### Shoulder pain after laparoscopic antireflux surgery: a single-center, randomized, open-label trial [^d1f618f3]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Although several non-pharmacological strategies have been shown to reduce PLSP (e.g. low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum, Hemovac drain placement, pulmonary recruitment maneuvers, opening and closing of intraperitoneal drainage, and intraperitoneal saline irrigation), we believe that standardizing and routinely implementing these procedures could increase costs and risks. Furthermore, these strategies may be technically challenging for healthcare providers (e.g. limited surgical working space and visibility with low-pressure carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum) and somewhat cumbersome for patients (e.g. postoperative drains). Therefore, future studies evaluating large-scale implementation (i.e.g.eneralizability) of alternative strategies, such as the use of intraperitoneal local anesthetics, are highly warranted.

Our study has multiple limitations. Despite several efforts and an extended recruitment period, we were unable to meet the enrollment goals established by the a priori sample size estimation, resulting in a relatively small sample size. Additionally, the use of simple randomization did not ensure a balanced distribution of participants and baseline characteristics between groups as initially expected. Due to the nature of the interventions, blinding was not feasible for either participants or investigators. Furthermore, a potential attrition bias arose, as all participants who did not complete follow-up assessments or received an "inadequate" intervention were allocated to the back massager group; however, for the primary outcome, both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were conducted. Finally, although we evaluated multiple outcomes — opioid-derived medication use and the incidence and severity of postoperative pain — we acknowledge that only opioid consumption provides an objective measure of intervention efficacy. The assessment of pain using a visual analog scale is inherently subjective, potentially introducing an insensitivity bias due to individual variations in pain perception.

### Splenic laceration post colonoscopy: a rare complication [^d180361c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The number of colonoscopies performed in the United States is increasing each year. Although the procedure is generally safe and effective, complications can arise. Splenic laceration is an extremely rare complication of colonoscopy.

Case Report

A 71-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain and left shoulder pain accompanied by nausea within 24 h of undergoing a colonoscopy. A computed tomography scan showed hemoperitoneum, with findings suggestive of a splenic laceration. Upon laparoscopy, the patient was found to have a splenic laceration with active bleeding. She was treated with splenectomy. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Colonoscopy is one of the most commonly performed outpatient procedures in the United States. As such, being able to recognize potential complications of the procedure is essential. With the number of colonoscopies being performed each year increasing, the emergency physician should be aware of the remote possibility of splenic injury as a cause of abdominal pain whenever a history of recent colonoscopy is elicited from the patient.

### What is the evidence for the use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum? A systematic review [^a116cb0b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pain after laparoscopic procedures can be divided into three components: referred shoulder pain, superficial or incisional wound pain, and deep intra-abdominal pain. Referred pain is most often attributed to CO 2 -induced diaphragm and/or phrenic nerve irritation causing referred pain to the C4 dermatoma, stretching of the diaphragm, and/or residual pockets of gas in the abdominal cavity. Deep intra-abdominal pain is mainly caused by bowel traction, stretch of the abdominal wall, and compression of intra-abdominal organs.

Although Gurusamy et al. state that pain reduction does not always have clinical implications, there are several studies stating the importance of a clinically significant reduction in postoperative pain. Relative few number of blinded studies addressed postoperative pain after low-pressure PNP. However, in two of three blinded studies, a clinically relevant difference was found after 1 day. Only one blinded study assessed pain scores beyond 24 h and did not find a clinically relevant difference.

Overall inconsistency was minimal since in 15 of the 19 RCT's a reduction in pain for low-pressure PNP was found. Reduction in pain scores ranged from 0.2 to 3.0 points on day 1. Except for 1 study, there were no studies reporting higher pain scores in patients who underwent low-pressure laparoscopy. Meta-analysis of pain scores showed significant less pain for low-pressure PNP, this difference was clinically relevant after 2 and 3 days.

The establishment of CO 2 PNP increases intra-abdominal volume, thereby causing the diaphragm to move cranial. In combination with the fact that muscle relaxation during surgery impairs the excursion of the diaphragm, this can lead to compression of the lower lung lobes, resulting in increased dead space, ventilation perfusion mismatch, and decreased tidal volume. Furthermore, CO 2 is a highly soluble gas and is rapidly absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation. The resulting hypercapnia can only be avoided by compensatory hyperventilation. While low-pressure PNP was beneficial for the compliance of the lungs when compared to standard-pressure PNP, perioperative pulmonary parameters and postoperative pulmonary function tests are comparable, indicating that healthy individuals, with the aid of artificial ventilator adjustments, are able to compensate for pulmonary function reduction.

### Cocaine-associated hemoperitoneum following atraumatic splenic rupture: a case report and literature review [^e4eafcdf]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Splenic rupture in the absence of trauma is exceedingly rare. Although atraumatic splenic rupture (ASR) is uncommon, it warrants early recognition due to the potentially fatal consequences and thus should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with left upper quadrant abdominal pain. A recent systematic review of atraumatic splenic rupture found there to be six major etiological groups: neoplastic processes (30.3%), infectious (27.3%), inflammatory (20.0%), iatrogenic (9.2%), mechanical (6.8%), and normal spleen (6.4%). ASR of the normal spleen is defined by four criteria: no history of trauma, no evidence of extrasplenic disease known to affect the spleen, no perisplenic adhesions to suggest previous trauma, and normal spleen on gross and histologic exam.

Clinical presentation of ASR mimics traumatic splenic rupture. Abdominal pain, especially in the left upper quadrant, or chest pain with radiation to the left shoulder, caused by subdiaphragmatic irritation, are classic symptoms of splenic pathology. There is often little or no clinical history to suggest splenic pathology, and the diagnosis is often made after imaging, which often includes ultrasonography or CT scan.

There are no definitive guidelines on management of ASR, although it is often modeled after that of traumatic splenic rupture. Treatment may include operative or non-operative therapy, depending upon the patient's hemodynamic stability and degree of splenic injury. The large amount of fluid within the abdomen could support operative evaluation with exploratory laparotomy. Factors favoring non-operative management in this case included total clinical stability, a soft abdomen, and duration of greater than 24 hours from the inciting event. The American Association for the Surgery of Trauma criteria for degree of splenic injury correlates with failure of conservative treatment. Given that a splenic etiology was not confirmed until the ultrasound after discharge, his injury could not be graded. At the time of follow-up, the subcapsular hematoma measured less than 10% of the surface area, consistent with a grade 1 injury. Even in the setting of non-operative management, surgical teams are often involved or are the primary team managing inpatient surveillance. Work-up in patients with ASR should include studies to rule out the common causes, including neoplastic, infectious, and inflammatory processes. As this patient's work-up was negative, we conclude that the patient had a normal spleen with ASR and associate the splenic rupture with cocaine use.

### Interventions to reduce shoulder pain following gynaecological laparoscopic procedures [^8b9959b7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopy is a common procedure used to diagnose and treat various gynaecological conditions. Shoulder-tip pain (STP) as a result of the laparoscopy occurs in up to 80% of women, with potential for significant morbidity, delayed discharge and readmission. Interventions at the time of gynaecological laparoscopy have been developed in an attempt to reduce the incidence and severity of STP.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and safety of methods for reducing the incidence and severity of shoulder-tip pain (STP) following gynaecological laparoscopy.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL from inception to 8 August 2018. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and registers of ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions used during or immediately after gynaecological laparoscopy to reduce the incidence or severity of STP.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes: incidence or severity of STP and adverse events of the interventions; secondary outcomes: analgesia usage, delay in discharge, readmission rates, quality-of-life scores and healthcare costs.

Main Results

We included 32 studies (3284 women). Laparoscopic procedures in these studies varied from diagnostic procedures to complex operations. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations were risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency. Specific technique versus "standard" technique for releasing the pneumoperitoneumUse of a specific technique of releasing the pneumoperitoneum (pulmonary recruitment manoeuvre, extended assisted ventilation or actively aspirating intra-abdominal gas) reduced the severity of STP at 24 hours (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.82 to -0.50; 5 RCTs; 670 participants; I² = 0%, low-quality evidence) and reduced analgesia usage (SMD -0.53, 95% CI -0.70 to -0.35; 4 RCTs; 570 participants; I² = 91%, low-quality evidence). There appeared to be little or no difference in the incidence of STP at 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 0.87, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.82; 1 RCT; 118 participants; low-quality evidence). No adverse events occurred in the only study assessing this outcome. Fluid instillation versus no fluid instillationFluid instillation is probably associated with a reduction in STP incidence (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.66; 2 RCTs; 220 participants; I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence) and severity (mean difference (MD) (0 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) scale) -2.27, 95% CI -3.06 to -1.48; 2 RCTs; 220 participants; I² = 29%, moderate-quality evidence) at 24 hours, and may reduce analgesia usage (MD -12.02, 95% CI -23.97 to -0.06; 2 RCTs; 205 participants, low-quality evidence). No study measured adverse events. Intraperitoneal drain versus no intraperitoneal drainUsing an intraperitoneal drain may reduce the incidence of STP at 24 hours (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.46; 3 RCTs; 417 participants; I² = 90%, low-quality evidence) and may reduce analgesia use within 48 hours post-operatively (SMD -1.84, 95% CI -2.14 to -1.54; 2 RCTs; 253 participants; I² = 90%). We are uncertain whether it reduces the severity of STP at 24 hours, as the evidence was very low quality (MD (0 to 10 VAS scale) -1.85, 95% CI -2.15 to -1.55; 3 RCTs; 320 participants; I² = 70%). No study measured adverse events. Subdiaphragmatic intraperitoneal local anaesthetic versus control (no fluid instillation, normal saline or Ringer's lactate)There is probably little or no difference between the groups in incidence of STP (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.23; 4 RCTs; 336 participants; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence) and there may be no difference in STP severity (MD -1.13, 95% CI -2.52 to 0.26; 1 RCT; 50 participants; low-quality evidence), both measured at 24 hours. However, the intervention may reduce post-operative analgesia use (SMD-0.57, 95% CI -0.94 to -0.21; 2 RCTs; 129 participants; I² = 51%, low-quality evidence). No adverse events occurred in any study. Local anaesthetic into peritoneal cavity (not subdiaphragmatic) versus normal salineLocal anaesthetic into the peritoneal cavity may reduce the incidence of STP at 4 to 8 hours post-operatively (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.93; 2 RCTs; 157 participants; I² = 56%; low-quality evidence). Our other outcomes of interest were not assessed. Warmed, or warmed and humidified CO 2 versus unwarmed and unhumidified CO 2 There may be no difference between these interventions in incidence of STP at 24 to 48 hours (OR 0.81 95% CI 0.45 to 1.49; 2 RCTs; 194 participants; I² = 12%; low-quality evidence) or in analgesia usage within 48 hours (MD -4.97 mg morphine, 95% CI -11.25 to 1.31; 1 RCT; 95 participants; low-quality evidence); there is probably little or no difference in STP severity at 24 hours (MD (0 to 10 VAS scale) 0.11, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.97; 2 RCTs; 157 participants; I² = 50%; moderate-quality evidence). No study measured adverse events. Gasless laparoscopy versus CO 2 insufflationGasless laparoscopy may be associated with increased severity of STP within 72 hours post-operatively when compared with standard treatment (MD 3.8 (0 to 30 VAS scale), 95% CI 0.76 to 6.84; 1 RCT; 54 participants, low-quality evidence), and there may be no difference in the risk of adverse events (OR 2.56, 95% CI 0.25 to 26.28; 1 RCT; 54 participants; low-quality evidence). No study measured the incidence of STP.

Authors' Conclusions

There is low to moderate-quality evidence that the following interventions are associated with a reduction in the incidence or severity, or both, of STP, or a reduction in analgesia requirements for women undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy: a specific technique for releasing the pneumoperitoneum; intraperitoneal fluid instillation; an intraperitoneal drain; and local anaesthetic applied to the peritoneal cavity (not subdiaphragmatic). There is low to moderate-quality evidence that subdiaphragmatic intraperitoneal local anaesthetic and warmed and humidified insufflating gas may not make a difference to the incidence or severity of STP. There is low-quality evidence that gasless laparoscopy may increase the severity of STP, compared with standard treatment. Few studies reported data on adverse events. Some potentially useful interventions have not been studied by RCTs of gynaecological laparoscopy.

### Low-pressure versus standard-pressure pneumoperitoneum in laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^cedd784d]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

It has been previously demonstrated that the rise of intra-abdominal pressures and prolonged exposure to such pressures can produce changes in the cardiovascular and pulmonary dynamic which, though potentially well tolerated in the majority of healthy patients with adequate cardiopulmonary reserve, may be less well tolerated when cardiopulmonary reserve is poor.

Nevertheless, theoretically lowering intra-abdominal pressure could reduce the impact of pneumoperitoneum on the blood circulation of intra-abdominal organs as well as cardiopulmonary function. However, the evidence remains weak, and as such, the debate remains unresolved. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to demonstrate the current knowledge around the effect of pneumoperitoneum at different pressures levels during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Materials and methods

This systematic review and meta-analysis were reported according to the recommendations of the 2020 updated Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions.

Results

This systematic review and meta-analysis included 44 randomized controlled trials that compared different pressures of pneumoperitoneum in the setting of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Length of hospital, conversion rate, and complications rate were not significantly different, whereas statistically significant differences were observed in post-operative pain and analgesic consumption. According to the GRADE criteria, overall quality of evidence was high for intra-operative bile spillage (critical outcome), overall complications (critical outcome), shoulder pain (critical outcome), and overall post-operative pain (critical outcome). Overall quality of evidence was moderate for conversion to open surgery (critical outcome), post-operative pain at 1 day (critical outcome), post-operative pain at 3 days (important outcome), and bleeding (critical outcome). Overall quality of evidence was low for operative time (important outcome), length of hospital stay (important outcome), post-operative pain at 12 h (critical outcome), and was very low for post-operative pain at 1 h (critical outcome), post-operative pain at 4 h (critical outcome), post-operative pain at 8 h (critical outcome), and post-operative pain at 2 days (critical outcome).

Conclusions

This review allowed us to draw conclusive results from the use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum with an adequate quality of evidence.

### Incidence and risk factors for acute shoulder pain after hepatectomy: a nested case-control study [^355b3355]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

It is widely acknowledged that laparoscope-assisted techniques induce shoulder pain during gynecological operations and cholecystectomy. Shoulder pain is caused by diaphragmatic irritation caused by insufflation gas. The use of a lower-pressure technique reduces the incidence of shoulder pain. It was also found that residual CO 2 is involved in the maintenance of shoulder pain. In this study, patients undergoing open surgery also experienced shoulder pain, suggesting that laparoscopy is not the only factor. Surprisingly, the use of laparoscopes did not increase the odds of shoulder pain. The possible explanations are as follows: (1) compared with laparoscopic surgery, open surgery requires a more sufficient separation of the liver, which may enhance the irritation of the diaphragm; and (2) because of the laparoscopic field and the concern regarding bleeding, laparoscopic procedures are usually gentler, especially during separation of tissues.

Surgical duration was not associated with the incidence of shoulder pain. Previous studies reported that surgical duration was a risk factor for thoracic and gynecological laparoscopic surgery [8 9]. However, we failed to replicate the findings of this study. This intriguing result could be attributed to the influence of both the surgical procedures and pneumoperitoneum on the diaphragm. Typically, the surgical duration is an important manifestation of surgical difficulty. This result suggests that the extent of resection does not contribute to the risk of shoulder pain.

A recent study also emphasized that patients with a lower BMI showed a higher incidence of shoulder pain after laparoscopic surgery for infertility. By contrast, another study found that BMI was higher in patients with postoperative shoulder pain. In the present study, we found that BMI was not associated with the risk of shoulder pain.

This study had some limitations. First, the number of possible risk factors was relatively limited mainly because the range of surgical resection was not included in this study. As hepatectomy is a non-standardized surgical procedure because of the size and site of the tumor, a variety of procedures cannot be simply classified. The liver is anatomically close to the diaphragm; therefore, the influence of surgical procedures on shoulder pain should not be ignored. Further studies with larger cohorts are required to investigate the impact of surgical site on shoulder pain. Second, medication administration and use of epidural anesthesia during anesthesia were unstandardized. Third, the surgical approaches were determined by the surgeons and patients. As a result, most patients with intra-abdominal adhesions undergo open surgery. Although the effect of intra-abdominal adhesion on shoulder pain is unknown, it could also increase the risk of bias in this study.

### Effect of postoperative trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after gynecological laparoscopic procedures: a randomized clinical trial [^843a0d68]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic gynecologic surgery has evolved from a limited surgical procedure used only for diagnostic purposes to a major surgical approach for treating a multitude of malignant and non-malignant pathologies. It is currently one of the most common surgical procedures performed by gynecologists. Although laparoscopic surgery has proven its superiority over laparotomy in terms of improved post-operative pain scores, postoperative shoulder pain remains a major concern following laparoscopic surgeries. Shoulder pain is reported to occur in 35 to 70% of laparoscopic surgeries. The pain can be severe and is usually relieved in 24–48 h, but rarely persists for over 72 h after surgery. The precise mechanism of this shoulder pain remains unclear. The main hypothesis is the presence of residual carbon dioxide (CO 2) in the abdominal cavity that causes irritation of the phrenic nerve and referred pain to the shoulders. Other theories include peritoneal stretching, diaphragmatic irritation or injury, and shoulder abduction during surgery.

Various preventative measures have been proposed intraoperatively to try to reduce residual CO 2 in the abdominal cavity including: low insufflation rate and pressure, Valsalva maneuvers, filling the abdominal cavity with Lactated Ringers, and active deflation of the abdomen. To our knowledge, there are no available published studies looking at the effect of postoperative Trendelenburg positioning on the incidence of shoulder pain after laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. The Trendelenburg position might decrease pain by reducing the mechanical pressure exerted by CO 2 on the diaphragm and the upper abdominal muscles. CO 2, known for its high solubility, would also be displaced to the pelvis that has a rich vasculature which in turn speeds up the resorption of pneumoperitoneum.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effect of postoperative Trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after gynecologic laparoscopic procedures. We hypothesize that maintaining the patient in Trendelenburg for 24 h postoperatively will significantly decrease postoperative shoulder pain.

### Pulmonary recruitment maneuver reduces the intensity of post-laparoscopic shoulder pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b51b1fef]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) is a common complication following laparoscopic surgeries. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate whether pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM) was beneficial to alleviated shoulder pain after laparoscopic procedures.

Methods

We reviewed existing literature in the electronic database from the date of inception to January 31, 2022. The relevant RCTs were independently selected by two authors, after which data extraction, assessment of the risk of bias, and comparison of results.

Results

This meta-analysis included 14 studies involving 1504 patients, among which 607 patients were offered pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM) alone or in combination with intraperitoneal saline instillation (IPSI), while 573 patients were treated with passive abdominal compression. The administration of PRM significantly decreased the post-laparoscopic shoulder pain score at 12 h (MD (95%CI) − 1.12(–1.57, − 0.66), n = 801, P < 0.001, I² = 88%); 24 h (MD (95%CI) − 1.45(–1.74, − 1.16), n = 1180, P < 0.001, I² = 78%) and at 48 h (MD (95%CI) − 0.97(–1.57, − 0.36), n = 780, P < 0.001, I² = 85%). We observed high heterogeneity in the study and analyzed the sensitivity but failed to identify the cause of the heterogeneity, which may have resulted from the different methodologies and clinical factors in the included studies.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that PRM can reduce the intensity of PLSP. More studies may be needed to explore the usefulness of PRM in more laparoscopic operations besides gynecological surgeries and determine the optimal pressure of PRM or its appropriate combination with other measures. The results of this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution owing to the high heterogeneity between the analyzed studies.

### Effect of postoperative trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after gynecological laparoscopic procedures: a randomized clinical trial [^dfec0af5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Aydemir et al. demonstrated that Trendelenburg position is both quick and effective, with improvement in pain scores as early as ten minutes after Trendelenburg positioning. Acute and fast improvement of shoulder pain was supported by our study as the most acute drop in shoulder pain score was noted from 0 to 6 h (Fig. 2). Beyond 6 h, the pain score was maintained more or less at the same level and did not improve further. Since some patients are unable to tolerate Trendelenburg position for a long time, adopting it for a shorter period of time may be enough to significantly improve shoulder pain scores. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal duration of this intervention for shoulder pain management.

Many other methods to decrease postoperative shoulder pain have been described in the literature. The most recent Cochrane review by Kaloo et al. reviewed all interventions mentioned in the literature on shoulder pain following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Trendelenburg position is not listed as one the possible interventions in this review article. Among all the described methods, authors concluded that potentially beneficial interventions in the reduction of postoperative shoulder pain include: a specific technique for releasing the pneumoperitoneum (such as pulmonary recruitment maneuvers, extended assisted ventilation or active aspiration of intra-abdominal gas), intraperitoneal fluid instillation, placement of an intraperitoneal drain and local anesthetic application into the peritoneal cavity (not sub diaphragmatic). Comparing these interventions to postoperative Trendelenburg positioning through randomized controlled trials is important to evaluate which of them all is most beneficial, and which carries the lowest risk of adverse events.

### Incidence and risk factors for acute shoulder pain after hepatectomy: a nested case-control study [^804a9f4c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is a common complication after hepatic surgery. The incidence of post-hepatectomy shoulder pain varies between 42 and 75%. In clinical observations, we found that some patients had severe postoperative shoulder pain, while the effect of conventional postoperative analgesia was limited. Recent research has shown that phrenic nerve block alleviates post-hepatectomy shoulder pain. The mechanism of this therapy is that shoulder pain is a referred pain via the phrenic nerve. A previous cohort study showed that shoulder pain occurred more frequently in patients receiving epidural anesthesia while undergoing hepatectomy. Pneumoperitoneum also plays a role in shoulder pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Overall, there is a paucity of studies on shoulder pain after hepatectomy. The only previous study on post-hepatectomy shoulder pain was a retrospective cohort study. Patients were grouped according to the type of anesthesia. In addition, the sample size in this study was relatively small. Multiple factors are likely associated with shoulder pain after hepatectomy. Identifying the risk factors contributes to the prevention of shoulder pain. To the best of our knowledge, no study with a large sample size has been conducted to determine the possible risk factors for shoulder pain after hepatic surgery.

To fill the gap, in the current study, we hypothesized that some risk factors may increase the incidence of shoulder pain. To this end, we conducted a nested case-control study of hospitalized surgical patients.

### Prevention of postlaparoscopic shoulder and upper abdominal pain: a randomized controlled trial [^f094836a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

To estimate the effectiveness of combined intervention with the pulmonary recruitment maneuver and intraperitoneal normal saline infusion to reduce postlaparoscopic shoulder and upper abdominal pain.

Methods

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo the combined intervention (n = 50) or to a control group (n = 50). Postlaparoscopic shoulder pain and upper abdominal pain were evaluated at 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively.

Results

At 12, 24, and 48 hours, the incidence of laparoscopic-induced shoulder pain was lower in the intervention group (54%, 46%, and 30%, respectively) than in the control group (72%, 70%, and 50%, respectively; P = 0.008, P = 0.001, and P = 0.004, respectively). The number needed to treat for benefit to reduce shoulder pain incidence was six (95% confidence interval [CI] 4–21) at 12 hours, five (95% CI, 3–10) at 24 hours, and five (95% CI, 4–15) at 48 hours. The incidence of laparoscopic-induced upper abdominal pain also was lower in the intervention group (78%, 72%, and 58%, respectively) than in the control group (92%, 90%, and 70%, respectively) at 12, 24, and 48 hours postoperatively (P = 0.006, P = 0.001, and P = 0.077, respectively). The number needed to treat for benefit to reduce upper abdominal pain incidence was eight (95% CI, 5–24) at 12 hours and six (95% CI, 4–14) at 24 hours.

Conclusions

Combined intervention with the pulmonary recruitment maneuver and intraperitoneal normal saline infusion is easy to implement in daily clinical practice to significantly reduce postlaparoscopic shoulder and upper abdominal pain.

### Splenic rupture following colonoscopy: two cases with CT findings [^a0d6b01f]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Splenic injury following colonoscopy is extremely rare. We report a 75-year-old woman and a 35-year-old woman who presented to the emergency room with left upper quadrant and left shoulder pain following colonoscopy. Both patients were diagnosed by computed tomography (CT) with splenic injuries and hemoperitoneum. One patient was successfully managed conservatively, and one patient needed emergent open splenectomy. The possibility of splenic injury should be considered in post-colonoscopy patients with left upper quadrant or left shoulder pain.

### Infarcted splenule – a case report [^59271781]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain and left shoulder pain. A computed tomography scan was obtained, which demonstrated a rounded soft tissue density with surrounding stranding. It was interpreted as an infarcted splenule. Due to the increasing severity of the patient's symptoms, a laparoscopic exploration was performed. Pathology demonstrated an infarcted splenule. As infarcted splenules are rare, an understanding of its pathogenesis and familiarity with the corresponding imaging findings may be helpful for its diagnosis in the patient with the appropriate clinical scenario. It is important to recognize this entity as a cause of abdominal pain that can be managed nonsurgically.

### Pulmonary recruitment maneuver reduces the intensity of post-laparoscopic shoulder pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^75596043]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Fourteen RCTs were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis comparing passive abdominal compression with PRM alone or in combination with IPSI. The results indicated that the application of PRM alone or in combination with IPSI could significantly decrease PLSP VAS scores at 12 h, 24 and 48 h postoperatively, compared with passive abdominal compression. However, this strategy was ineffective at reducing the intensity of postoperative wound pain, upper abdominal pain, and the incidence of PONV.

Although the mechanism of PLSP is not fully understood yet, it may involve the following hypotheses. First, carbonic acid that is converted from (CO 2) by carbonic anhydrase on the surface of the diaphragm can stimulate the phrenic nerve ending and transmits pain signals to the central nervous system (CNS). Moreover, the loss of suction from the liver and traction of the visceral ligament caused by residual gas in the enterocoeles can also directly cause pain. It is suggested that residual CO 2 in the abdominal cavity can remain for several days after laparoscopy and postoperative shoulder pain may be correlated with the volume of CO 2 under the right hemidiaphragm. The last hypothesis involves tissue trauma caused by the rapid insufflation of the pneumoperitoneum and the hyperdistention of the abdominal cavity, which results in overstretching of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers, traumatic straining of nerves, tearing of blood capillaries, and release of inflammatory mediators, which in turn elicits the referred pain to the shoulder.

### Sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation relieves shoulder pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^b5ac7744]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In the current study, sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation reduced the incidence and severity of PLSP during 3 days after TLH. The result is consistent with the study by Saadati K et al, in which peritoneal irrigation with sodium bicarbonate reduced the intensity of PLSP in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. On the other hand, the administration of sodium bicarbonate did not show an impact on incisional and visceral pain following surgery. Additionally, we did not found a significant difference in blood gas analysis and any serious complications. Therefore, sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation is an effective and safe method to prevent shoulder pain following laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Five aetiologies have been proposed for the underlying cause of PLSP including carbonic acid production, microvascular peritoneal hemorrhages, peritoneal dehydration and damage, visceral ligament traction, and neuropraxia. Besides, arm abduction and muscle pain associated with succinylcholine, a depolarizing muscle relaxant, might be relevant to shoulder pain following follow laparoscopy. However, none of the above-mentioned reasons can alone explain the phenomenon.

Previous studies mostly focused on the reversion of the physical effects of CO2 pneumoperitoneum. Increasing intra-abdominal pressure during procedure causes the loss of a "suction" effect between the liver and diaphragm, allowing traction on the triangular and coronary ligaments of the liver that leads to PLSP. The patients undergoing low-pressure laparoscopic surgery had significantly lower PLSP scores. Moreover, the volume of residual pneumoperitoneum has been proved as a contributing factor and positively correlated with the intensity of PLSP. Therefore, evacuating residual CO2 to prevent PLSP is likely the first precaution. Varied approaches based on removing CO2 include pulmonary recruitment maneuver (PRM), intraperitoneal normal saline infusion, and both combined. Furthermore, the application of body position change to facilitate gas drain is also effective to reduce PLSP. However, the therapeutic potential of all these strategies needs support from the evidence from large-size sample clinical studies.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum: causes and significance [^79e7e341]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum is an uncommon cause of acute abdominal pain. When it occurs, it may be catastrophic. There are a myriad of causes for spontaneous hemoperitoneum and an underlying cause should always be looked for if the patient survives the initial event. This article describes the imaging findings of spontaneous hemoperitoneum and discusses the relative merits of multiple imaging modalities used for the diagnosis of the hemoperitoneum and an underlying cause. In addition, we outline the etiology of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, which includes hepatic, splenic, gynecologic, and vascular causes, and bleeding disorders.

### Shoulder pain after laparoscopic antireflux surgery: a single-center, randomized, open-label trial [^fa3897cd]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Shoulder pain is a well-described source of postoperative morbidity after laparoscopic procedures, often necessitating additional analgesics (i.e. opioids) for breakthrough symptom relief. Previous studies have reported a PLSP incidence ranging from 35 to 80% after benign abdominal and gynecological procedures, which is primarily attributed to phrenic nerve irritation caused by carbon dioxide insufflation. However, foregut procedures, such as LARS, warrant special consideration, as they involve extensive manipulation of the crural diaphragm and both mediastinal and abdominal structures, potentially increasing the incidence and severity of shoulder pain. Although various pharmacological and non-pharmacological adjuvant strategies have been explored, findings have been inconsistent, and no universally accepted intervention is currently available for routine prevention of this complication.

We conducted a randomized, single-center, open-label trial with three arms to compare postoperative opioid consumption and the incidence and severity of localized pain by anatomical region. We found that: (i) the incidence of PLSP within 7 days after LARS was remarkably high, reaching up to 97.3%; (ii) instillation of bupivacaine hydrochloride over the left hemidiaphragm at the end of surgery significantly reduced the risk of requiring opioid-derived medications for pain control within the first 7 postoperative days compared to a control group (55.6% vs. 100%); and (iii) the use of a commercial back massager did not significantly decrease opioid use or reduce the frequency or severity of PLSP.

### Effectiveness of different noninvasive physiotherapy in relieving postlaparoscopic shoulder pain: a protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis [^d2740220]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of laparoscopic technology in clinical practice has increased significantly and has been characterized by an increasing emphasis on minimally invasive techniques. Compared with traditional open surgery, its small trauma, less bleeding and fast recovery have become the recognized advantages, and laparoscopic surgery is a reliable alternative to open surgery. Despite these advantages, laparoscopic surgery still brings common shoulder pain to patients. According to statistical survey, the incidence of postoperative laparoscopic shoulder pain in cholecystectomy, appendectomy, diagnostic laparoscopic surgery and adjustable gastric band surgery is 35%~80%, and this relatively high morbidity is a challenging problem. Sometimes, the extent of this postlaparoscopic shoulder pain exceeds the pain caused by the incision site. Severe symptoms may lead to prolonged discharge and readmission with additional medical expenses and seriously affecting the physical and mental health and quality of life.

The underlying pathogenesis of PLSP is uncertain, but the earliest previous studies have shown that the acidic environment produced by the residual abdominal carbon dioxide dissolved in the abdominal fluid, which subsequently stimulates the diaphragm, reflexively causes shoulder pain. In a subsequent period of time, some researchers have proposed another theory that carbon dioxide gas enters the abdominal cavity, leading to overstretching of the fibers in the diaphragm, resulting in complete occlusion of the intraneural vessels and complete nerve ischemia, causing partial vascular tear and traumatic nerve pulling. This factor causes stimulation of the phrenic nerve located on the peritoneum, leading in reflex shoulder pain. Numerous studies suggest that the pathogenesis of PLSP is complex. Currently, these mechanisms are all thought to be factors contributing to PLSP.

At present, the treatment goal of PLSP is mainly to relieve the symptoms, and it is difficult to achieve a complete cure. Clinically common treatments include drug therapy and nerve block therapy. Common analgesic drugs are lidocaine, duloxetine, and clonidine, ropivacaineand parecoxib sodium. Nerve block therapy is the most basic treatment modality for pain diseases. For some patients with neurologic disorders, invasive nerve block therapy is often used for treatment, such as phrenic nerve block, stellate ganglion block, cervical plexus block, suprascapular nerve blockand plane block of erector spinal muscles. Invasive nerve therapy is more traumatic and expensive, and improper operation will also cause nerve damage, vascular damage and some sequelae. In recent years, many noninvasive physiotherapy gradually appear in clinical treatment, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture and massage.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture in a child with COVID 19 [^96aeff60]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Any child with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, in whom abdominal pain develops and extends to the left supraclavicular region (the left shoulder), should be highly suspected of having splenic rupture. Acute abdominal pain can be caused by a wide range of conditions, some of which are life-threatening making the diagnosis challenging. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the diagnostic uncertainty for children with abdominal pain has increased. Gastrointestinal symptoms, which mimic an acute abdomen, can be the primary manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other side, it is well accepted that the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain should include pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome (MIS-C), which manifests as abdominal pain in 50% of affected children. The abdominal pain in MIS-C can be so severe that patients were misdiagnosed with peritonitis or another surgical abdominal condition in many cases reported in the literature. A thorough history and physical exam can usually narrow the differential diagnosis. The main differential diagnoses in our case were splenic rupture and splenic artery thrombosis. Chest and abdominal CT with contrast along with additional laboratory examinations, helped us exclude other differential diagnosis as pneumonia, pancreatitis, malignancies, etc.

Splenic rupture is characterized by nonspecific abdominal soreness in the left upper quadrant with or without distention, syncope, and a rapid drop in blood pressure, as in our case. It is usually diagnosed later and is a major challenge for radiologists. In cases where the patient is hemodynamically stable and can safely undergo the diagnostic imaging procedure, a CT allows confirmation of the presumptive diagnosis. If the splenic injury is minor, conservative therapy consisting of fluids, with or without blood transfusion(s), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission for close monitoring may be sufficient. When conservative management fails to achieve hemodynamic stabilization, splenectomy may be indicated.

Four adult cases of splenic rupture caused by SARS-COV-2 infection are described in the literature. Three of these patients required an emergency splenectomy due to unresponsive hemorrhagic shock, as was the case in our case. Only one case underwent a splenic artery embolization procedure to stop the hemorrhage. Regardless of etiology, suspicion, and immediate management of atraumatic splenic rupture according to the degree of splenic injury are crucial.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture in a child with COVID 19 [^0250bf7d]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is usually mild. Rarely they can be severely affected with respiratory failure and multisystem involvement. Recent studies have revealed that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects not only the respiratory system but also other vital organs in the body. SARS-CoV-2 tropism for the spleen has already been demonstrated in patients infected with the virus. It appears to have a direct effect on the spleen and lymph nodes, resulting in severe tissue damage. Infections are a significant etiological factor in atraumatic splenic rupture. Recently, there have been a few reports of atraumatic splenic rupture in adults with COVID-19, implying that SARS-CoV-2, like other infections, could be the cause.

We present the first case of atraumatic splenic rupture in a child, most likely caused by COVID-19. The spleen is a highly vascular organ that filters approximately 10–15% of total blood volume per minute and significant blood loss can occur after rupture from either the parenchyma or the splenic vascular supply. The most common cause of splenic rupture is trauma, while atraumatic splenic rupture is uncommon. Clinical signs of early shock appear if intra-abdominal bleeding exceeds 5–10% of blood volume. Splenic rupture is typically characterized by left-sided abdominal pain and hemodynamic instability. In approximately half of the cases, there is left shoulder-tip pain (Kehr's sign), which is caused by intraperitoneal blood, causing diaphragmatic irritation. Splenic rupture is generally not considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, in the absence of trauma. A high index of suspicion for atraumatic splenic rupture is important not only because the condition is uncommon, but also because a delayed diagnosis and treatment of splenic rupture can be life-threatening.

### The intensity of postlaparoscopic shoulder pain is positively correlated with the amount of residual pneumoperitoneum [^07664773]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Residual carbon dioxide, which is inevitably retained in the abdominal cavity after laparoscopy, plays an important role in inducing postlaparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP). The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the volume of a residual pneumoperitoneum and the intensity of PLSP.

Design

A prospective cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).

Setting

A university hospital.

Patients

A total of 203 patients undergoing laparoscopy for nonmalignant gynecologic diseases.

Interventions

Gynecologic laparoscopy.

Main Outcome Measures

The volume of the residual pneumoperitoneum was measured by performing chest radiography 24 hours after surgery. The pneumoperitoneum was graded as high volume (defined as ≥ the median volume of the pneumoperitoneum) and low volume (defined as < the median volume). Perioperative data including PLSP intensity scores were collected.

Results

The median volume of the residual pneumoperitoneum was 17.0 mL (0.5–133.8 mL). The intensity of PLSP was significantly higher in the high-volume group compared with the low-volume group (p < .001). A lower volume of the pneumoperitoneum was associated with less analgesic requirement (p = .032), a shorter hospitalization period (p = .007), and higher satisfaction from the surgery (p = .005). The residual gas volume and PLSP score exhibited a positive correlation that was statistically significant (r = 0.735, p < .001).

Conclusion

The volume of the residual pneumoperitoneum was positively correlated with the intensity of shoulder pain after laparoscopy. Therefore, surgeons should release as much gas as possible from the peritoneal cavity at the end of laparoscopy.

### Managing hepatic complications of pregnancy: practical strategies for clinicians [^71cdef47]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Liver haematoma, rupture, infarction

Liver-related complications of both pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome include subcapsular haematoma, rupture and infarction. Development of a subcapsular haematoma is thought to complicate 0.9%–1.6% of cases of HELLP syndrome. Haematomas can remain contained or can rupture and haemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity, which is one of the most life-threatening complications of HELLP syndrome. Because of the rarity of these complications, the literature is limited to case reports.

Diagnosis

Subcapsular liver haematomas usually develop in the late second or third trimester. Patients can present with epigastric or right upper quadrant pain radiating to the right shoulder, nausea, vomiting and hypotension. When hepatic rupture occurs, patients develop abdominal distension from haemoperitoneum and hypovolaemic shock. Bloods typically show a severe thrombocytopaenia and moderate elevations of aminotransferase concentrations, but elevations to 4000–5000 IU/L have been reported. Imaging should be performed in any patient with HELLP syndrome or pre-eclampsia with right upper quadrant pain, shoulder pain or shock, regardless of the LFTs as they do not correlate with findings on imaging.CT or MRI of the liver confirm the diagnosis. CT is the imaging of choice, as it is faster and safer for the unstable patient.

Hepatic infarction is less common than hepatic haematoma but can also complicate pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome. Infarction can present with right upper quadrant pain and fever, associated with severe elevations in aminotransferases (1000–2000 IU/L or higher) and leukocytosis. The diagnosis is also confirmed with liver imaging, where infarction is typically seen in a peripheral location of the right liver.

Management

Contained subcapsular haematomas with haemodynamic stability should be managed conservatively with close observations and repeat imaging to monitor the size of the haematoma. Blood transfusions and coagulation support should be used as required and prophylactic antibiotics considered. Patients with hepatic rupture should be transferred to a transplant centre.

Haemodynamic instability suggests active bleeding and urgent hepatic angiography should be performed. Haemostasis can be achieved by embolisation of the hepatic artery or surgical methods, such as packing of the liver, hepatic artery ligation or resection of the affected liver. Transplant should be considered in cases of refractory haemorrhage or rapidly progressing ALF and has been successful in case reports.

### Ectopic pregnancy: a heart beating case [^d5b5158e]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal pregnancy is a rare event that occurs in western countries in 1.3% of ectopic gestations. Delayed diagnosis and attempted removal of the fetus have occasionally resulted in massive and even fatal intraperitoneal hemorrhage. We present a case of an ectopic pregnancy at the intraabdominal surface of the left diaphragm, which was removed successfully with laparoscopic hydrodissection. This case report demonstrates that awareness of this condition is important when the location of the pregnancy cannot be found in the lower abdominal cavity, especially if the patient has unexplained complaints such as shoulder pain.

### Incidence and risk factors for acute shoulder pain after hepatectomy: a nested case-control study [^78a89a2e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This observational study investigated the incidence and risk factors of shoulder pain after hepatectomy. The total incidence of shoulder pain was 41.7%, and epidural anesthesia increased the odds of shoulder pain. By contrast, advanced age decreased the risk of shoulder pain.

The total incidence of shoulder pain was consistent with that reported in a previous study. Owing to the larger sample size, we further found that shoulder pain occurred only on the left side in a small number of patients. A possible explanation is that a large portion of the liver is located on the right side of the body. Hence, intraoperative manipulation is more likely to stretch the right side of the diaphragm. Although the influence of the intraoperative position on shoulder pain could not be excluded, we found that shoulder pain was also common in patients in the supine position during surgery. This suggests that myofascial pain caused by intraoperative posture is not the primary cause of shoulder pain. We inferred that operative manipulation around the liver irritated the diaphragm, resulting in shoulder pain.

Younger age has been recognized as a predictive factor for postoperative pain. Younger individuals have a higher risk of moderate-to-intense pain after surgery. The overall mean difference in pain intensity between the young and the old is 1.5 points (a total of 10). However, the effect of age on shoulder pain remains controversial. Wada et al. reported that younger age was a risk factor for gynecological laparoscopy. By contrast, Nutchanart et al. found that age was not associated with the incidence of shoulder pain after thoracic surgery. In this study, we found that younger patients had a higher risk of shoulder pain after hepatectomy. The possible mechanisms are age-related anatomical, physiological, and biochemical changes, as well as intrinsic plasticity of somatosensory pathways in old patients. The effect of age on the logistic regression analysis was minimal because the effect was based on every additional year of age.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum: a bloody mess [^71887dfd]. Emergency Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Spontaneous hemoperitoneum may be a life-threatening occurrence. It most frequently presents with acute abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used modality in the initial work up of these patients, but sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) play a role in the diagnosis. The etiology is varied, yet may be broadly classified into gynecologic, hepatic, splenic, vascular, and coagulopathic causes. This review will describe the common imaging findings of spontaneous hemoperitoneum, as it presents through the emergency room, and will detail the underlying causes and significance of spontaneous hemoperitoneum.

Laparoscopic, or minimally invasive, techniques are diagnostic and therapeutic procedures performed at the abdominal and pelvic level that are less harmful than laparotomies, and are associated with a lower degree of pain at the surgical site, fewer days of hospitalization, better aesthetic outcomes, and less blood loss. However, laparoscopic procedures are associated with a longer surgical time. Furthermore, in 80% of cases, post-laparoscopy pain occurs in the shoulder, neck, head and/or upper limbs — pain that does not typically occur following laparotomy.

In addition to the visceral and/or incisional pain perceived at the surgical site, laparoscopic procedures require distension of the anatomical cavity using CO 2 (pneumoperitoneum) to improve visualization by camera. This distension irritates the peritoneum, which is believed to be responsible for the development of referred pain in the cervicoscapular region, due to its innervation by the phrenic nerve. This type of referred pain does not occur in the postoperative period following laparotomy.

Incisional pain and referred pain are not mutually exclusive, and they exhibit distinct clinical courses and characteristics. Referred pain reaches its maximum intensity 24 h after surgery, shows a poorer response to conventional analgesic treatments, and persists longer than incisional or visceral pain. The occurrence of post-laparoscopic referred pain increases in patients over the age of 50 and is also associated with longer surgical durations.

To manage post-laparoscopic referred pain, various procedures have been used. On the one hand, attempts have been made to address it using strategies targeting the presumed cause of the pain, namely subdiaphragmatic irritation due to gas. Thus, the reduction of residual gas, either through aspiration or drainage, has generally yielded positive results. In this sense, it has been hypothesized that the positive outcomes observed with Trendelenburg positioning are due to the facilitation of residual gas displacement from the diaphragm to the pelvis, thereby promoting reabsorption. Similarly, with the aim of mobilizing and expelling gas from the abdominal cavity, pulmonary recruitment techniques have been applied. These consist of performing air insufflations prior to extubation and have shown favorable results. To minimize diaphragmatic stretching caused by gas, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum techniques have also been employed, with fairly high levels of evidence supporting their effectiveness in reducing shoulder pain. Beyond causal treatments, the evidence for analgesic and anesthetic interventions is mixed. These include lidocaine patches, intraperitoneal administration of anesthetics or dexamethasone, ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block, or neuromodulation using TENS.

### Spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy presenting with hemoperitoneum [^ecd63ab4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Heterotopic pregnancy is a condition in which intra- and extrauterine pregnancies occur at the same time. Spontaneous heterotopic pregnancy is a rare event, with incidences ranging from 1 in 30,000 pregnancies to as high as 1 in 6 pregnancies assisted by reproductive technology.

Case Report

A 34-year-old woman presented with a 10-week history of amenorrhea, pelvic pain, and generally feeling unwell. Ultrasonography revealed a 10-week intrauterine viable pregnancy and free fluid in the abdominal cavity. Emergency laparotomy was performed and a ruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy was encountered on the right tube with hemoperitoneum. Salpingectomy was performed. Her intrauterine pregnancy was intact with positive fetal cardiac activity when she was discharged. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Heterotopic pregnancy should be kept in the differential diagnosis of any patient with an intrauterine pregnancy presenting with abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, or free fluid in the abdominal cavity.

### Sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation relieves shoulder pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^ecfa6bc7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Laparoscopic surgery has been widely accepted in the diagnosis and management of gynecologic organ-related diseases, as it provides minimization of surgical wound, less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay, rapid recovery, and a better cosmetic outcome, compared to conventional laparotomy. However, there are still 35%–80% of patients complaining of moderate to severe pain affects the quality of life within 3 days to a week after gynecologic laparoscopic surgery, resulting in delayed discharge or interference of coming back to normal activities.

Laparoscopic gynecological surgery-related pain consists of skin incision (well localized), visceral organs (diffuse and poorly localized), and shoulder pain. The abdominal incisional and visceral pain appears immediately after the operation and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugsor local incisional infiltration, are generally considered to be effective to alleviate the pain. However, post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) is supposed to be referred pain due to carbon dioxide [CO2] pneumoperitoneumand occurs approximately 8 hours postoperatively, later than incisional pain, and displays less responsiveness to analgesics. Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to prevent PLSP.

Substantial evidence has shown that CO2 pneumoperitoneum be the main source of PLSP. Carbonic anhydrase located on the moist surface of the peritoneum and diaphragm converts CO2 to carbonic acid, resulting in a reduction in the peritoneal pH which irritates the peritoneal and diaphragmatic nerves, thus leading to PLSP. Elevating the pH value of the diaphragm might block the phrenic nerve stimulation induced by CO2 theoretically, which has been proved by the evidence of carbonic anhydrate inhibitor-acetazolamide in the reduction of PLSP dramatically.

Sodium bicarbonate, a well-known alkaline liquid, is also used for peritoneal lavage in some specific cases, such as diffuse peritonitis-induced acid environment. Here, we hypothesize that sodium bicarbonate might neutralize the acid environment induced by CO2 pneumoperitoneum, and then relieve PLSP. The study was designed to determine whether sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation could reduce PLSP in patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH).

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in a 29-week pregnancy with a history of endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature [^495fbe69]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 1
Summary of cases with spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy.

TABLE 2
Demographic and clinic characteristics of patients with spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy.

In a prospective population‐based cohort study conducted by Mazzacco et al.in Italy, it was reported that at the time of hospital admission abdominal pain was present in 89.6% of SHIP patients, hypotensive symptoms in 27.6%, hypovolemic shock in 24.1%, and fetal distress in 37.9%. The differential diagnosis includes conditions involving extra‐pelvic structures such as traumatic splenic artery and vein bleeding, splenic and hepatic injury, and ovarian artery rupture. Additionally, cases involving uterine rupture and placental abruption, which present with abdominal pain and fetal distress, can also lead to massive bleeding. Challenges in early diagnosis arise from symptoms that are non‐specific and can mimic other conditions. A comprehensive review of current literature suggests that early assessment of these patients, manifesting hemodynamic instability or fetal bradycardia, warrants emergency laparotomy without delay for imaging methods. In instances where hemodynamic stability and fetal well‐being are confirmed through imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging, the application of minimally invasive techniques such as laparoscopy and artery embolization facilitates the continuation of pregnancy and might even prevent complications in newborns resulting from preterm births. Given the presence of symptoms such as back and abdominal pain, hypotensive symptoms, and later, the manifestation of fetal distress after initial follow‐up in our patient, a definitive diagnosis was established following explorative laparotomy. However, diagnostic imaging modalities could be used in cases lacking hemodynamic instability and reassuring fetal well‐being. Expectant management could then be considered as an alternative option, aiming to reduce urgent C‐section rates and mitigate negative neonatal outcomes.

### Spontaneous splenic rupture: a rare first presentation of diffuse large B cell lymphoma [^4377fe41]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Spontaneous splenic rupture (SSR) is a rare but potentially life-threatening entity. It can be due to neoplastic, infectious, haematological, inflammatory and metabolic causes. An iatrogenic or an idiopathic aetiology should also be considered. Depending on the degree of splenic injury and the haemodynamic status of the patient, it can be managed conservatively. A 61-year-old man presented to the emergency department with an acute abdomen, hypovolaemic shock and clotting abnormalities. However, his focused assessment with sonography for trauma showed no evidence of an aortic aneurysm, rupture or dissection. Further investigation with a CT angiogram aorta confirmed a subcapsular splenic haematoma with free fluid in the pelvis and a mass in the superior pole of the spleen. He was diagnosed with an SSR. He was initially managed non-operatively. However, his repeat CT showed an enlarging haematoma and he underwent embolisation of his splenic artery. Ultrasound-guided core biopsy of his splenic mass confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This paper will discuss the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis and management of SSR. Furthermore, it provides an important clinical lesson to maintain a high index of clinical suspicion for splenic injury in patients presenting with left upper quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder. This case also reinforces the importance of close observation and monitoring of those individuals treated conservatively for signs of clinical deterioration.

### Pulmonary recruitment maneuver reduces shoulder pain and nausea after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^61c2cc60]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cholelithiasis affects up to 20% of the population in developed countries. The surgical treatment of choice worldwide is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Pain and nausea following the procedure are important reasons for prolonged hospital stay and readmissions. In a previous study, we found that a pulmonary recruitment maneuvre (PRM) reduced pain after bariatric surgery, consistent with results from other studies, mainly gynecological. This trial aimed to investigate postoperative pain when performing a ventilator-piloted PRM at the end of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Nausea was analyzed as a secondary endpoint.

The theory behind the benefit of PRM is that part of the post-laparoscopic pain is due to trapped intra-abdominal CO 2. The entrapped gas may irritate or stretch the diaphragm, cause local acidosis and supposedly initiates referred shoulder pain via its effect on the phrenic nerve. PRM lowers the diaphragm, which in turn raises the intra-abdominal pressure, hence mechanically facilitates evacuation of CO 2.

### The effect of mechanical ventilation tidal volume during pneumoperitoneum on shoulder pain after a laparoscopic appendectomy [^2d6a9a70]. Surgical Endoscopy (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Postlaparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) frequently occurs after various laparoscopic surgical procedures. Its mechanism is commonly assumed to be overstretching of the diaphragmatic muscle fibers due to the pressure of a pneumoperitoneum, which causes phrenic nerve-mediated referred pain to the shoulder. Based on this hypothesis, we speculated that during inspiration, the lung could squeeze out the phrenic nerve with carbon dioxide gas against the constantly pressurized abdominal cavity with increasing tidal volume (V(T)). Thus, we examined whether mechanical ventilation with a low V(T) (LTV, V(T) 7 ml/kg) during a pneumoperitoneum might reduce PLSP in patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy compared with ventilation with the traditional V(T) (TTV, V(T) 10 ml/kg).

Methods

In a prospective trial, 64 adult patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy were randomly assigned to two groups of 32 each (LTV and TTV groups). Intravenous ketorolac was used as a postoperative rescue analgesic. The 2-, 4-, 24-, and 48-h postoperative incidence and severity of PLSP, severity of surgical pain, and need for rescue analgesia was assessed.

Results

The overall incidence of PLSP was similar in both groups (57.1% in the LTV group vs. 65.5% in the TTV group). Compared with the TTV group, the incidence and PLSP verbal rating scale (VRS) did not decrease in the LTV group throughout the study period. No statistically significant differences were observed in the VRS surgical pain score, the cumulative ketorolac consumption at each time point, or the time to first rescue analgesia.

Conclusions

Mechanical ventilation with a reduced 7 ml/kg V(T) during a pneumoperitoneum does not reduce the frequency and severity of PLSP after laparoscopic appendectomy compared with ventilation with the traditional V(T) (10 ml/kg).

### Unusual lesions of sternum associated with shoulder pain… [^900e8be3]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Pain in the shoulder joint may often present a difficult diagnostic problem. 1 Abnormalities of the cervical part of the spinal column, lesions within the chest cavity, disease of the coronary arteries, irritation of the diaphragm, neurological lesions, and disease of the gallbladder are among the conditions commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of pain in the shoulder joint or its surrounding structures. Little attention has been paid to lesions of the sternum as a cause of referred pain in the shoulder, possibly because lesions of this bone are relatively uncommon. We have recently seen at Mayo Clinic three cases of sternal lesions, in which the patients' chief complaint, either throughout the illness or at one point during it, was pain in the shoulder. Two of the patients had demonstrable limitation of movement at the shoulder joint; one had paresthesias in the forearm of the affected side. In none of. Dunlap RW, Ivins JC.

### Comparison of impacts of intraperitoneal saline instillation with and without pulmonary recruitment maneuver on post-laparoscopic shoulder pain prevention: a randomized controlled trial [^f2137d20]. Surgical Endoscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraperitoneal isotonic saline instillation (SI) and pulmonary recruitment maneuver (RM) were indicated to alleviate post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) effectively. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of the single strategy using SI alone and the combined strategy using SI and RM on PLSP reduction.

Methods

Subjects undergoing elective gynecologic laparoscopy were randomly allocated to a control group (no intervention, n = 48) and two intervention groups (single strategy of SI alone, n = 48; combined strategy of SI and RM, n = 48). In the control group, carbon dioxide was removed only via passive evacuation through the port sites at the completion of the laparoscopic procedure. In the saline instillation group, 20-mL/kg of body weight SI was performed. In the combined strategy group, RM using five pulmonary inflations was performed, in addition to SI. The PLSP scores, which were the primary outcome, were recorded using a visual analog scale postoperatively.

Results

The PLSP scores 24 and 48 h after surgery were significantly lower in the two intervention groups than in the control group (P = 0.014 and P = 0.001, respectively), while no significant differences were observed between the two intervention groups.

Conclusions

The single strategy using SI alone is as effective as the combined strategy of SI and RM for removing residual carbon dioxide and consequently preventing PLSP. Therefore, considering the potential risks of pulmonary or hemodynamic complications associated with RM, the single strategy using SI alone might be a better choice than the combined strategy.

### Shoulder tip pain during and after caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia: incidence, severity, and associated factors in a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia [^1026dcb6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, several clinical variables were significantly associated with the severity of shoulder tip pain following cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Notably, intraoperative blood loss of less than 500 mL was linked to reduced odds of experiencing severe STP. This finding supports the hypothesis that larger volumes of intra-abdominal blood may irritate the peritoneum and diaphragm, triggering referred pain via phrenic nerve pathways. Our results also revealed that women with one or two previous cesarean deliveries were more likely to report severe pain compared to those with three prior cesarean sections, while no such association was observed among women with no prior cesareans. This non-linear relationship could reflect on factors other than intra-abdominal adhesions, surgical difficulty, or neural sensitization from repeated procedures and warrant further exploration.

In addition, patients positioned in a head-up (reverse Trendelenburg) position intraoperatively were significantly less likely to report severe pain, consistent with prior evidence that this positioning may help reduce diaphragmatic irritation by minimizing cephalad blood pooling. Similarly, the observed association between a lower sensory block level (T10) and reduced pain severity may be explained by the fact that higher blocks can potentially lead to intercostal muscle paralysis and impaired chest wall mechanics, thereby increasing susceptibility to blood or air accumulation beneath the diaphragm.

These findings collectively highlight the multifactorial nature of STP and underscore the need for tailored perioperative strategies to mitigate this common postoperative discomfort. It also emphasise the need for increased awareness among anaesthetists and obstetric teams of shoulder tip pain as a significant postoperative burden. Active intraoperative management of bleeding and appropriate postoperative analgesia may help reduce its impact. Additionally, structured documentation and routine enquiry about this symptom during recovery assessments could improve recognition and care.

This study is, to our knowledge, the first in Ethiopia and sub-Saharan Africa to explore this topic using a prospective design. However, it is limited by its single-centre setting, modest sample size, and non-randomised observational design, which restrict generalisability and causal inference. Incomplete achievement of the recommended T4 sensory block and routine use of intrathecal opioids may have confounded the analysis of spinal block height and shoulder tip pain. Additionally, we were unable to assess factors such as surgical technique and had no follow-up to evaluate the persistence of pain. Randomised controlled trials comparing different surgical and anaesthetic techniques, as well as investigations into preventive strategies such as patient positioning, peritoneal suctioning, and pre-emptive analgesia, would add further clarity.

### Effect of postoperative trendelenburg position on shoulder pain after gynecological laparoscopic procedures: a randomized clinical trial [^9bebd0b8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

As previously noted, shoulder pain is reported to occur in 35 to 70% of laparoscopic surgeries, mostly to the patients' right side. The phrenic nerve originates from the C3 to C5 cervical nerves in the neck and descends through the thorax to innervate the diaphragm. A link between phrenic nerve irritation and this referred type of pain is suggested in the literature. Severe postoperative shoulder pain may lead to patient dissatisfaction but also to pulmonary complications such as atelectasis and pneumonia as patients are unable to take deep breaths. This study supports the theory that Trendelenburg position displaces retained CO 2 gas towards the pelvis and away from the diaphragm, thereby decreasing phrenic nerve irritation and hence shoulder pain, as well as a quicker resorption of the soluble CO 2 gas in a highly vascular area which is the pelvis.

This study is the first to assess the effect of Trendelenburg position on postoperative shoulder pain following laparoscopic gynecologic surgery. Only one other study by Aydemir et al. looked prospectively at the effect of Trendelenburg position on postoperative shoulder pain, however the study subjects were patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

It is difficult to compare both studies because they are not identically designed. This study is prospective and randomized while the other is non-randomized. Moreover, the duration of the study intervention (Trendelenburg positioning) as well as the study subjects and the nature and duration of the surgical procedures are different. While this study required that patients be placed in Trendelenburg position for 24 h postoperatively and measured the pain scores at 4, 6, 12 and 24 h, the study by Aydemir et al. placed patients in extreme Trendelenburg position upon reporting shoulder pain for only 10 min at a time, and recorded pain scores 10 min afterwards. The degree of Trendelenburg was not mentioned. Pain scores were statistically significantly improved thereby supporting the theory that Trendelenburg position decreases the phrenic nerve irritation caused by the CO 2 gas. Similar to this study results, total analgesic consumption over 24 h was statistically significantly improved in the experimental compared to the control group.

### ESR essentials: gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in women: a primer for emergent evaluation-practice recommendations by the European society of emergency radiology [^ced025af]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Haemoperitoneum due to gynaecological causes

Gynaecological causes of haemoperitoneum are many and include sexual intercourse, intense exercise, corpus luteum bleeding, ruptured haemorrhagic ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy, and ruptured endometriotic cyst. On US, peritoneal or pelvic fluid demonstrates low-level echoes, and US can also identify the cause. On CT, the free peritoneal fluid has a relatively high attenuation. CT can demonstrate the volume of haemoperitoneum, presence of septations or loculation (which suggest endometriosis), and active bleeding, which guides interventional management. Active bleeding may be seen on the arterial or, most usually, on the venous phase, reflecting intermittent or venous haemorrhage. On MRI, signal intensity of haemoperitoneum depends on age of the blood.

Ectopic pregnancy including ruptured ectopic pregnancy

Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is a common cause of pregnancy-related APP. Early diagnosis and treatment have decreased the incidence of EP rupture, which is potentially life-threatening. In EP, the fertilised oocyte implants outside of the uterine endometrium, most commonly in the fallopian tubes (93–98% of all EP, of which 75% are ampullary, 13% isthmic and 12% fimbrial). The differential diagnosis includes non-gynaecological adnexal masses. Table 4 outlines factors which increase the risk of EP.

Table 4
Factors which increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy

A serum β-hCG value > 2000 mlU/mL (IRP International Reference Preparation) without intrauterine pregnancy but with an extraovarian mass is highly suggestive of an EP. On TVUS, an adnexal mass separate from the ovary is seen in most, but not all, tubal pregnancies. Other signs include the "tubal ring sign": a thick echogenic ring surrounding an extrauterine gestational sac and the "ring of fire sign" due to peripheral hypervascularity of the hyperechoic ring (Fig. 7). If the trophoblast invasively grows into the fallopian tube, EP rupture and hemoperitoneum occurs.

### Sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation relieves shoulder pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^51ffc4d7]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Some other studies investigated the role of local intraperitoneal anesthesia in the reduction of PLSP. Local intraperitoneal administration of anesthetic might cause a reversible interruption of nervous conduction, subsequently, inhibit the visceral afferent signaling, and reduce the shoulder pain. However, the results of these studies was not consistent. Local anesthetic toxicity and post-operative nausea and vomiting remain the main reason limiting its further application. Phrenic nerve block targeted on the irritation of CO2 insufflation to the sub-diaphragmatic intra-peritoneal surface has also been shown to prevent PLSP effectively.

In our study, the incidence of PLSP in the saline group was 31.4%, lower than 80% reported in some known literature. We contributed it to strict patient selection, excellent anesthesia and analgesia program, experienced gynecologists, and appropriate pneumoperitoneum pressure. Intra-peritoneal normal saline infusion could also remove CO2 from the abdominal cavity to decrease PLSP. The different distribution of pain between left and right shoulders indicated that the acid intra-peritoneal environment caused by CO2 insufflation was not the only cause of shoulder pain. PLSP is therefore assumed as a multifactorial result in nature.

Homogenizing patients to highlight the role of sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation was the merit of the study design. However, there were some limitations in the study. First of all, we did not analyze the sub-population of age and duration of operative time, which had been reported as the risk factors of PLSP. Secondly, TLH related perineal pain be not included in the present study despite of causing discomfort to patients to some extent. Furthermore, the sample size was still small, although the number had been calculated in a statistical manner.

In summary, sub-diaphragmatic irrigation with sodium bicarbonate could decrease the intensity of shoulder pain during 3 days following TLH, but it had no impact on incisional and visceral pain without an increase in side effects. Our study indicated that sodium bicarbonate sub-diaphragmatic irrigation might be an effective and safe method to reduce PLSP.

### Parecoxib increases muscle pain threshold and relieves shoulder pain after gynecologic laparoscopy: a randomized controlled trial [^608f5586]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the past two decades, gynecologic laparoscopies have gradually replaced traditional laparotomies due to lower morbidity, quicker recovery, and less postoperative pain. However, laparoscopic procedures often lead to a referred pain, postlaparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP), which may cause more discomfort to the patients than surgical pain. Moreover, our previous study showed that PLSP hindered patients' early postoperative activities following gynecologic laparoscopy. Although the exact mechanism of PLSP is still not clear, a leading hypothesis is that an irritation of the phrenic nerve caused by local acidosis and diaphragmatic overstretching results in neural hypersensitivity of the third and fourth spinal cervical nerves (C3–C4), and subsequently induces a referred shoulder pain. Nowadays, the growing evidences suggest that the decline of pain threshold induced by peripheral and central sensitization is involved in the generation of referred pain.–To date, however, no study has examined the changes of pain threshold in shoulder muscles after laparoscopies.

The activation of spinal cyclooxygenase (COX) plays an important role in the development of hyperalgesia, and the inhibition of COX-2 can effectively inhibit central sensitization in humans. Therefore, we hypothesized that pressure pain threshold (PPT) is correlated with the generation of PLSP, and COX-2 inhibitors may reduce PLSP through alleviating pain hypersensitivity in the shoulder muscles innervated by C3–C4.

The aim of this study was to explore the correlation between PPT level and the intensity of PLSP, and to investigate the effect of parecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on the changes of PPT levels of the muscles innervated by different cervical nerves after gynecologic laparoscopy.

### Analgesic benefits of pre-operative versus postoperative transversus abdominis plane block for laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a frequentist network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^a03e649a]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the analgesic effects of pre-operative and postoperative TAP blocks in patients undergoing LC. Based on 34 randomised controlled trials, we found that postoperative TAP block reduced postoperative 24-hour opioid consumption and PONV compared to pre-operative TAP block. The VAS scores were similar in the two groups.

Pain following laparoscopy has somatic, visceral, and referral components. Somatic pain arises from skin incisions during surgical port insertion, stretching of the abdominal wall due to CO 2 insufflation, and surgical stimulation of the parietal peritoneum. It travels across the thoracolumbar spinal nerves (T6-L1), leading to sharp and well-localised pain rather than dull pain. In contrast, tissue traction, compression, or surgical dissection of the abdominal organs causes diffuse and dull visceral pain. This latter noxious impulse is transmitted by autonomic nerves (T5–9, greater splanchnic nerve, celiac ganglion, and vagus). Furthermore, pneumoperitoneum and gallbladder stimulation may cause diaphragm inflammation, activating the phrenic nerve (C3–5) and causing referred shoulder pain. The most significant component, in this case, is somatic pain.

### Diatrizoate meglumine (Hypaque sodium) [^cd98e0d8]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

SPLENOPORTOGRAPHY

Indication

Splenoportography is usually performed under mild preoperative sedation and under local anesthesia.

Contraindications

Splenoportography should not be performed on any patient for whom splenectomy is contraindicated, since complications of the procedure at times make splenectomy necessary. Other contraindications include prolonged prothrombin time or other coagulation defects, significant thrombocytopenia, and any condition which may increase the possibility of rupture of the spleen.

Precautions

Prior gastrointestinal x-ray examination should include particular attention to the lower esophageal area. A hematologic survey, including prothrombin time and platelet count, should be performed. To minimize risk of bleeding, manipulation during or after entry of the needle should be avoided. Caution is advised in patients whose spleen has recently become tender and palpable.

Following splenoportography, the patient should lie on his left side for several hours and should be closely observed for 24 hours for signs of internal bleeding.

Adverse Reactions

Internal bleeding is the most common serious complication of splenoportography. Although leakage of up to 300 mL of blood is apparently not uncommon, sometimes blood transfusions and, rarely, splenectomy, may be required to control hemorrhage. Peritoneal extravasation may cause transient diaphragmatic irritation or mild to moderate transient pain which may sometimes be referred to the shoulder, the periumbilical region, or other areas. Because of the proximity of the pleural cavity, accidental pneumothorax has been known to occur. Inadvertent injection of the medium into other nearby structures is not likely to cause untoward consequences.

Dosage and Administration

A preliminary small "pilot" dose is injected to confirm splenic entry, followed usually by rapid injection of 20 mL to 25 mL of HYPAQUE meglumine 60 percent. Rapid serial exposures are started with the injection of the dose and continued until contrast is observed in the entire portal system.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected retroperitoneal bleed [^420e3df1]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The initial diagnosis of retroperitoneal bleeding can be challenging by physical examination and clinical presentation. Prompt imaging can make the diagnosis and be lifesaving. When selecting appropriate imaging for these patient's, consideration must be made for sensitivity and ability to image the retroperitoneum, as well as speed of imaging. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Splenic rupture after colonoscopy: report of a case and review of literature [^786e6688]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In our case the colonoscopic exam was easily conducted and there was no therapeutic intervention except for a biopsy of small rectal polyps.

Differently from the cases published in the literature, in which the clinical manifestation appeared between 2 hours and 10 days, our patient presented with vague and non specific chest pain soon after the endoscopic exam, but the clinical picture related to the splenic rupture was delayed by 13 days.

In most of the cases the patients report left upper quadrant abdominal pain which can be referred to the left shoulder (Kehr sign). The latter sign is not specific and could also be present after uncomplicated colonoscopies. Only one of the reported cases presented with complete lack of pain. In more typical cases, the physical finding can vary from tenderness localized at the epigastrium and left upper quadrant with reduction or absence of gastric tympanism, to diffuse peritoneal signs. Other common signs are those related to the hemodynamic alterations and vary from pallor, hypotension, tachycardia, dyspnea, to the more dramatic signs of shock.

### Coagulation-induced diaphragm fenestrations after laparoscopic excision of diaphragmatic endometriosis [^6d8ebe44]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To present an unusual consequence of laparoscopic treatment of diaphragmatic endometriosis, to discuss the possible etiologies, and to propose proper management.

Design

A step-by-step explanation of 2 surgeries of the same patient using intraoperative video sequences (Canadian Task Force classification III).

Setting

University hospital.

Patient

A 32-year-old woman.

Interventions

Two Laparoscopic surgeries.

Measurements and Main Results

Endometriosis is estimated to affect 11% of the population [1,2], with an estimated 12% of these patients having extrapelvic endometriosis [3]. When the diaphragm is involved, the disease potentially causes severe and debilitating symptoms such as catamenial chest or shoulder pain. Serious complications may involve pneumothorax and hemopneumothorax [4–6]. Diaphragmatic endometriosis is more common than realized and has been shown to occur simultaneously in 50% to 80% of cases with pelvic endometriosis [7,8]. A 32-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with severe disabling dysmenorrhea and right shoulder pain. Despite progestin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and opioid treatment, pain relief remained inadequate. A laparoscopy was performed revealing diaphragmatic endometriosis, which was completely excised. A revision was necessary 14 months later because of pain recurrence in the right hemithorax and suspicion of new or persistent endometriotic lesions. The laparoscopy revealed small diaphragm fenestrations that were closed after exclusion of recurrent diaphragmatic or pleural endometriosis. No chest tube was placed, and the postoperative course was uneventful. Hormonal suppressive treatment was continued. Since the operation the patient has been pain free. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee ruled that approval was not required for this study (Req-2017-00415).

Conclusion

The diaphragm fenestrations were possibly the result of tissue necrosis caused by thermocoagulation after excision of deep endometriotic lesions during the first surgery. Using a CO 2 laser for the vaporization of superficial lesions is favorable because of the smaller depth of penetration compared with electrocautery and better access to hard to reach areas [9,10]. Endometriotic lesions involving the entire thickness of the diaphragm should be completely excised and the defect repaired with either sutures or staples [11–13].

The primary outcome variable was the subjective assessment of pain referred to the head, neck, shoulder, or arm. It was measured using the McGill questionnaire in its validated version adapted to the Spanish population. This is a multidimensional pain questionnaire consisting of 66 items in 4 dimensions: current pain intensity in 5 categories (mild/moderate/strong/strenuous/unbearable), pain assessment using a visual analogue scale, pain localization using a body map in which patients can identify the areas where they perceive the painful sensation by using human silhouettes, and subjective qualities of pain. Of the 4 dimensions, pain assessment using a visual analogue scale and referred pain territories were recorded.

In addition, based on the identification of the location of referred pain after laparoscopy, several self-reported questionnaires, validated and cross-culturally adapted to the Spanish language, were used. Specifically, these were the QuickDASH questionnaire for shoulder and/or upper limb pain, the HIT-6 scale for headaches, and the Neck Disability Index (NDI) questionnaire for neck pain.

The QuickDASH questionnaire is an instrument consisting of 11 items answered on a 5-point Likert-type scale and containing questions about symptoms and the ability to use the instruments of the upper limbs during the last week. It presents evidence of validity and reliability and has been validated for use in Spanish in its abbreviated version.

The HIT-6 scale is an instrument that assesses the negative effects of headache on normal activity using 6 questions/items: Headache frequency, limitation of daily activities (both occupational and social), fatigue, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and response to treatment. Each question is scored between 6 and 13 points, for a total score between 36 and 78 points. Higher scores indicate greater impact, and scores less than or equal to 49 points are considered to have little or no impact. This questionnaire provides evidence of validity and reliability and has been cross-culturally adapted for use in Spanish.

The NDI assesses neck pain and its impact on basic activities of daily living. It uses 10 items to measure self-reported disability related to neck pain, and it has shown to be valid when compared with other measures of pain and disability. Each item is measured on a scale of 0 (no disability) to 5 (maximum disability), and an overall score out of 100 can be obtained, which is calculated by summing the scores for each item and multiplying it by two. It provides evidence of validity and reliability and has been cross-culturally adapted for use in Spanish.

### Successful laparoscopic management of diaphragmatic pregnancy: a rare case report and brief review of literature [^8389e8b6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 33-year-old chinese woman with a history of previous cesarean section was referred to her local emergency room with 8 weeks' delay of menstruation and frequent increasing pain in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen and intense reflex sensitivity in the right shoulder for a duration of one day. In her medical history there was no record of use of an IUD, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal surgery, intrauterine device, or previous ectopic pregnancy. Laboratory evaluation showed quantitative hCG of 3129.94 IU/L and hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL. TVS examination demonstrated no evidence of intrauterine pregnancy, a normal bilateral adnexa and a large amount of free fluid in the abdomen. Considering the above factors, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed. A 90-mm-long mixed hypodense mass was evident on the upper surface of the right liver lobe. She was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy implanted in the liver and advised to transfer the patient to tertiary referral center. The patient traveled to our hospital and presented to the emergency room with increasing abdominal pain and weakness. On examination, her pulse was 109beats/minute and blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg. Diagnostic abdominocentesis was performed and found blood uncoagulable. Given the concern for ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock, she was taken laparoscopic surgery immediately. The laparoscopy revealed a significant hemoperitoneum (of approximately 1500 mL of blood). The uterus and ovaries appeared normal, with a corpus luteum cyst in 50 mm on the left ovary. There was no evidence of bleeding from the pelvic organs while a mount of free blood appearred aroundding perihepatic and spleen. The upper abdomen was inspected and a active bleeding was discovered from the mass with the size of 80 mm* 50 mm on the surface of diaphragm (Fig. 1). The mass was completely resected from the diaphragm. When villus tissues invade the diaphragm, bleeding occurred at the attachment site, a bipolar electrocoagulation was placed to achieve hemostasis. The patient was stable and discharged 3 days after surgery with instruction for making follow-up weekly. The pathology of 7 days after surgery confirmed ectopic pregnancy (Fig. 2). Her hCG levels returned to the normal range in two weeks.

### From acute to chronic pain after thoracic surgery: the significance of different components of the acute pain response [^45443c00]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Postthoracotomy pain syndrome (PTPS) is a serious and frequent complication after thoracic surgery. It affects 21–61% of patients–and reduces activities of daily living in up to 60% of patients, yet the cause of PTPS has not been established. Though conflicting evidence exists, sex, age, and preoperative pain have been identified as possible predictive factors. As in several other chronic postsurgical pain syndromes,–acute postoperative pain is one of the strongest predictors of PTPS,–but the mechanism remains unclear. Intraoperative nerve damage has been suggested as a cause of both acute and chronic postoperative pain,–; however, several studies have indicated that nerve damage is only part of the cause for PTPS.–Another possibility is that the intense postoperative pain causes plastic changes in the central nervous system, leading to central sensitization.

The acute pain response after thoracic surgery primarily consists of thoracic pain and shoulder pain ipsilateral to the operation. While thoracic pain is usually considered the dominating pain, shoulder pain is described as the dominating pain problem in up to 45% of patients. Thoracic pain is believed to be partly somatic and partly neuropathic, whereas shoulder pain is believed to be partly somatic and partly referred visceral pain from the mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura.–It is well known that different types of pain have different implications for the nervous system, and referred pain has been suggested to be a sign of neuronal plasticity and thus an indicator of chronic pain.

Whether some components of the acute pain response after thoracic surgery are more important than others in predicting PTPS has not previously been reported.

Thus, the aim of this study was to examine which components of the acute pain response after thoracic surgery were associated with PTPS and if any signs of a general central hypersensitivity could be identified in patients with PTPS before or after the operation. We hypothesized that both acute thoracic and referred pain would predict PTPS.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in a 29-week pregnancy with a history of endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature [^20ee4d20]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Endometriosis is a common gynecological disease that affects at least 10% of women in reproductive age. Although it is known as one of the causes of infertility, it is also associated with negative pregnancy outcomes. Miscarriage, preterm birth, placenta‐associated complications (pre‐eclampsia, abruptio placenta, and placenta previa), hemorrhage, acute abdomen (spontaneous uro‐hemoperitoneum, uterine rupture, and bowel perforation), fetal dystocia, stillbirth, and cesarean delivery are among these negative outcomes. Endometriosis was shown to be present in 71% of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHIP) cases.SHIP is defined as sudden, nontraumatic intraperitoneal bleeding that occurs during pregnancy or up to 42 days postpartum. The incidence ranges between 4 and 4.9 per 100 000 births. Although seen rarely, it is associated with perinatal morbidity and mortality due to maternal hemodynamic instability. Pregnancies in women older than 35, previous history of abdominal surgery, use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) for conception, multiple pregnancy, and endometriosis are some of the known risk factors for SHIP.SHIP is most commonly encountered during the second half of pregnancy and necessitates emergency surgical intervention. This often results in high neonatal mortality rates secondary to preterm birth. Due to its nonspecific clinical presentation, including symptoms such as abdominal pain, signs of hypovolemic shock, and fetal distress, the final diagnosis is typically established intraoperatively. Despite its rare occurrence, early diagnosis and appropriate management are of utmost significance, given its potential to be a life‐threatening condition.

In this study, we present the case of a 30‐year‐old 29‐week pregnant patient with a history of endometriosis surgery who was admitted to our emergency department with SHIP.

### Efficacy of ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block for acute post-hepatectomy shoulder pain: a randomized controlled trial [^66df07cc]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute shoulder pain commonly occurs after hepatectomy, which greatly influences patients' postoperative recovery. Our previous study has reported that the incidence of acute post-hepatectomy shoulder pain was approximately 40%. The primary etiology involves intraoperative surgical trauma irritating the diaphragm, which causes referred shoulder pain via the phrenic nerve. Surgical sites involving the right liver lobe increase the risk of postoperative shoulder pain, as the right liver lobe is closely adjacent to the diaphragm. The efficacy of phrenic nerve block after hepatectomy further confirms that shoulder pain is associated with diaphragmatic irritation via the phrenic nerve.

To enhance the visual field, a padded cushion is often placed under the right waist of the patient, potentially resulting in right shoulder ligament strain. The effectiveness of parecoxib on shoulder pain after thoracic surgery suggests that postoperative shoulder pain may include musculoskeletal pain. Overall, shoulder ligament strain and referred pain might represent a dual etiology for postoperative shoulder pain. A previous study found no correlation between intraoperative analgesia use and postoperative shoulder pain. Additionally, neither pregabalin nor gabapentin has been shown to reduce the incidence or intensity of referred shoulder pain. Consequently, nerve block has become a mainstream treatment option, for example, phrenic nerve block for shoulder pain after non-shoulder surgeries. The phrenic nerve arises from the anterior roots of the C3-C5 nerves. The incidence of a phrenic nerve block is nearly 100% following an interscalene brachial plexus block (ISB) with high-volume local anesthetics. Compared to other approaches to brachial plexus nerve block, such as the axillary and supraclavicular approaches, the interscalene approach more effectively meets the needs of shoulder pain management. Theoretically, an interscalene brachial plexus block may target both mechanisms underlying shoulder pain. However, to the best of our knowledge, no clinical trial has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an ISB for post-hepatectomy shoulder pain.

To fill the gap, we designed this randomized controlled trial, aiming to examine our hypothesis that ISB could alleviate shoulder pain without significant complications.

### Maneuvers to decrease laparoscopy-induced shoulder and upper abdominal pain… [^92d84456]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

The mechanism of laparoscopy-induced shoulder pain is mainly derived from carbon dioxide retention within the abdomen, subsequently irritating the phrenic nerve and causing referred pain in the C4 dermatome. 10–13 Moreover, carbon dioxide trapped between the liver and the right diaphragm, irritating the diaphragm, also causes upper abdominal pain. 14–16 All make the patient uncomfortable after laparoscopic surgery. Although the incidence and intensity of laparoscopy-induced upper abdominal pain are not clear, the problem is worthy of intervention. Shoulder pain was described as a sharp pain and soreness. At 24 and 48 hours, the incidence of postoperative shoulder pain was significantly lower in the INSI group than in the control group and the PRM group.

In other studies, these patients were treated with low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, and the data also showed that INSI significantly reduced the incidence and intensity of shoulder pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy at 12 and 24 hours. 19, 27, 28 In our study, convention-pressure pneumoperitoneum was used. In addition, the effect of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum was not tested in this study because 2 studies showed the superiority of the use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum in reducing laparoscopy-induced pain compared with conventional-pressure pneumoperitoneum. 27, 28 The mean postoperative pain score was lower. by 2. 64 in the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum group and the incidence of shoulder pain was also lower compared with conventional-pressure pneumoperitoneum.

27 Finally, the analgesic requirements did not differ among the 3 groups in this study, which suggested that these strategies may need further modification to improve clinical efficacy. Moreover, other causes might be overlooked. For example, the retention of some intraperitoneal blood or inflammatory cystic fluid or residual carbon dioxide might contribute to it.

### Pulmonary recruitment maneuver reduces shoulder pain and nausea after laparoscopic cholecystectomy: a randomized controlled trial [^989301c2]. World Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This trial is the first that evaluated the effect of PRM on postoperative pain solely in patients treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and the second to use the ventilator to perform PRM. We found that a PRM significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative shoulder pain during the postoperative 48-h period. This is consistent with previous studies. The NNT, to benefit from reduced shoulder pain incidence was 6, similar to NNT reported by Tsai et al.

In studies investigating shoulder pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the prevalence has been 36–80% (control populations). In this study, 64.3% of the control population suffered from shoulder pain, 44.7% in the PRM group. There seems to be a positive correlation between volume of sub-diaphragmatic gas and intensity in shoulder pain. Recent studies found that PRM efficiently evacuate sub-diaphragmatic gas.

Incidence of wound pain differed at two occasions, 4 and 24 h after surgery, in favor of the control group. Wound pain incidence did not differ between the groups when evaluating the entire 48-h postoperative period. Kiyak et al. found wound pain score being lower in the control group 6 h after surgery, and Davari-Tanha et al. reported lower incision site pain in the control group 24 h after surgery. Two studies by Tsai et al. and one study by Güngördük did not find any difference between groups regarding neither incidence nor intensity of wound pain. The varying results, and lack of a connecting theory, leave us in doubt of a correlation. Ryu et al. evaluated the effect of PRM combined with saline instillation on postoperative pain in wounds and shoulders. Their results showed that the relative pain severity was differently perceived postoperatively. Wound pain was considered more intense than shoulder pain in the intervention group, while the control group perceived shoulder pain more intense than wound pain. Possibly, not experiencing shoulder pain shifts the attention to other pain areas.

### Diatrizoate sodium (Hypaque sodium) [^b45b0e4c]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

SPLENOPORTOGRAPHY

INDICATION

Splenoportography is usually performed under mild preoperative sedation and under local anesthesia.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Splenoportography should not be performed on any patient for whom splenectomy is contraindicated, since complications of the procedure at times make splenectomy necessary. Other contraindications include prolonged prothrombin time or other coagulation defects, significant thrombocytopenia, and any condition which may increase the possibility of rupture of the spleen.

Precautions

Prior gastrointestinal x-ray examination should include particular attention to the lower esophageal area. A hematologic survey, including prothrombin time and platelet count, should be performed. To minimize risk of bleeding, manipulation during or after entry of the needle should be avoided. Caution is advised in patients whose spleen has recently become tender and palpable.

Following splenoportography, the patient should lie on his left side for several hours and should be closely observed for 24 hours for signs of internal bleeding.

Adverse Reactions

Internal bleeding is the most common serious complication of splenoportography. Although leakage of up to 300 mL of blood is apparently not uncommon, sometimes blood transfusions and rarely, splenectomy, may be required to control hemorrhage. Peritoneal extravasation may cause transient diaphragmatic irritation or mild to moderate transient pain which may sometimes be referred to the shoulder, the periumbilical region, or other areas. Because of the proximity of the pleural cavity, accidental pneumothorax has been known to occur. Inadvertent injection of the medium into other nearby structures is not likely to cause untoward consequences.

Dosage And Administration

A preliminary small "pilot" dose is injected to confirm splenic entry, followed usually by rapid injection of 20 mL to 25 mL of HYPAQUE sodium 50 percent. Rapid serial exposures are started with the injection of the dose and continued until contrast is observed in the entire portal system.

CONTRAST ENHANCEMENT OF COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHIC HEAD IMAGING

Precautions

Metastatic Brain Lesions: Large doses of contrast media should be avoided in patients with suspected metastatic brain lesions. Intravenous administration of large doses to these patients is more likely to result in convulsions; however, these occurrences are rare. This has been attributed to tissue accumulation of the medium in the presence of blood brain barrier disruption caused by disease. Appropriate measures for seizure management should be immediately available.

Convulsion: (See PRECAUTIONS — General).

Dosage And Administration

Bolus intravenous injection of 50 mL to 100 mL, or up to 150 mL by infusion. The rate of injection and the timing of scans will depend principally on the expected nature of the pathology. Dosage in children is proportional to adults, based on weight.

### Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy complicated by liver rupture or hematoma: a systematic review of 391 reported cases [^247fc02e]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

There is a wide variation of the clinical presentations and the severity of symptoms and signs of SHRP. Some present with very mild symptoms before the sudden and massive circulatory collapse. The upper abdominal pain was the most frequent (83.3%), followed by hemodynamic instability (62.4%), nausea/vomiting (24.5%), and shoulder pain (13.2%). Almost half (46.1%) of patients had at least one, 34.5% at least two, and 6.5% at least three symptoms or signs. However, 12.9% of women were asymptomatic. Therefore, a lack of specific symptoms or signs leads to diagnostic dilemmas and delays in definitive diagnosis and management.

Most hemodynamically unstable women (majority with liver rupture) or those who developed eclampsia died. Both conditions were the only predictors of mortality. Also, these conditions remain frequent in both analyzed periods. Over 96% of hemodynamically unstable women died in both periods. Hemodynamic instability is highly lethal despite modern diagnostics and treatment options. Less than 10% become hemodynamically unstable more than 24 hours from delivery. Hemodynamical instability was not associated with the difference in number or liver lobe involvement. Fetal mortality was associated with the same conditions, or to be more precise, it is associated with maternal mortality. Fetal survival rises with gestational age.

Most pregnancies were completed by CS, with a higher incidence in the second period (53.3% vs. 81.2%). The higher incidence of CS in the second period resulted from the earlier use and more accurate diagnostic modalities, while the fetus was still alive. Also, better interdisciplinary support, more primiparous women, advancements in obstetrics, intrapartum monitoring, and neonatal care during the last decades lead to successful CS and fetal outcomes. A relatively high rate of vaginal delivery results from intrapartum or postpartum SHRP. Increased intra-abdominal pressure during vaginal delivery, sometimes accompanied with Kristeller's maneuver (forbidden after 2007), can result in SHRP.

Imaging modalities were more frequent during the second period. During the first period, the diagnosis was made mainly by laparotomy (62.2%), while the second period had an equal ratio of surgical and radiological diagnoses (ultrasound 22.7%, CT 13.3%, and combined 12.7%).

### Shoulder pain after laparoscopic antireflux surgery: a single-center, randomized, open-label trial [^46eeb52e]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Compared to other laparoscopic abdominal or pelvic procedures, LARS appears to have a higher incidence of postoperative PLSP. Sarli et al. and Gharaibeh et al. reported a PLSP incidence of 21% and 60.5%, respectively, after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and rates after gynecologic laparoscopic procedures range from 35 to 80%. In our study almost all patients (i.e. 97.3%) reported PLSP in the early postoperative period. This finding supports the notion that, beyond diaphragmatic distension and subsequent phrenic nerve irritation caused by pneumoperitoneum, the type of surgery and the extent of mechanical manipulation of the diaphragm and mediastinum may play a significant role in increasing the frequency and severity of PLSP after foregut procedures.

This prospective study with frequent evaluation time points allowed us to characterize the presentation of PLSP specifically after LARS. In contrast to earlier reports on PLSP after cholecystectomy, where peak intensity was observed between 6 and 12 h after the procedure with a constant decrease until 48 h, our study found that after LARS, peak severity occurred between 1 and 3 h after the procedure, followed by a gradual decline up to day 7. This suggests that PLSP after LARS may present earlier and persist longer. This difference may be attributable not only to the nature of the procedure and the associated pathophysiological mechanisms discussed earlier but also to evolving anesthesia practices (i.e. more conservative, with reduced anesthesia facilitated by multimodal approaches and new monitoring tools) aiming for a faster patient recovery.

The intraperitoneal use of local anesthetics has been previously described. Nevertheless, their efficacy for PLSP after foregut procedures remains questionable. In 2015, McDermott et al. reported results from a randomized controlled trial investigating the use of aerosolized intraperitoneal 1% ropivacaine (5 mL) in laparoscopic Nissen fundoplications or cholecystectomies. A total of 40 individuals were assigned to the intervention and 47 to placebo. Although no statistical significance was reached, the incidence of PLSP after 6 h at rest among patients treated with the intraperitoneal anesthetic was lower (52.5 vs. 71.7%, p = 0.066). The authors also noted relatively lower shoulder pain severity within the first 30 min after surgery (particularly for the subset of patients who underwent cholecystectomy); nevertheless, the effects beyond 24 h were not explored.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^046ec50d]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

HELLP syndrome — epidemiology, clinical features, and management — is present in 0.2%-0.6% of pregnancies and can occur in patients with normal blood pressure; it is diagnosed clinically, and liver biopsy is not advised. When symptoms are present, 65% of patients have weight gain and right upper quadrant pain or epigastric pain, 35% have nausea or vomiting, and 30% have headache as well as malaise. Jaundice is noted in up to 40% of patients, hypertension is present in 85% of cases, proteinuria is commonly noted, and disseminated intravascular coagulation can occur. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is the hallmark of the disorder and the only treatment available for HELLP is delivery, which should occur as soon as maternal stabilization is achieved. If abdominal pain, shoulder pain, or hypotension develop, imaging must be performed to rule out hepatic hemorrhage, rupture, or infarction, which can occur in up to 45% of patients; management includes coagulation support, antibiotics, and transfusion, and urgent angiography and hepatic artery embolization or surgical intervention is indicated if supportive measures are unsuccessful.

### Hemothorax caused by costal exostosis injuring diaphragm: a case report and literature review [^219d8545]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Osteochondromas, also known as exostoses, are the most common benign tumors of bone and can be classified into isolated and multiple osteochondroma, and they can be observed in 1–2% of the population. The multiple form is an autosomal dominant syndrome referred to as hereditary multiple exostosis or familial osteochondromatosis, accounting for 55% of rib osteochondromas. Osteochondromas are lesions on the surface of the bone composed of both cortical and medullary bone with hyaline cartilage caps, which tend to grow away from the joint through tensile forces of tendons and ligaments. The presence of cortical and medullary continuity of the tumor with the underlying bone is a pathognomonic feature that establishes the diagnosis.

Osteochondromas tend to occur at the metaphyseal region of the long bones of the extremities, but have also been reported to exist in other areas such as the scapula, pelvis, clavicle, rib and vertebra. Among primary chest wall tumors primarily occurring in the rib, fibrous dysplasia is the most common cause of a benign rib growth, followed by osteochondromas. Osteochondromas of the ribs generally originate from the costochondral junction but may also occur at the costovertebral junction. Despite our patient coming in with an osteochondroma slightly more lateral to the costochondral junction, it was histopathologically confirmed to be consistent with a benign osteochondromatous proliferation. A great majority of osteochondromas is asymptomatic, painless, slow-growing mass, and incidentally found. Those symptomatic osteochondromas usually present in younger patients, 75–80% are discovered before the 20th year of age. However, osteochondromas occurring in adolescence or in adult patients can grow in size and become symptomatic as a result of mechanical irritation of the surrounding soft tissues or peripheral nerves, spinal cord compression, or vascular injury. In the case of a patient with a symptomatic osteochondroma of the rib, symptoms may range from hemothorax or pneumothorax to cardiac symptoms, diaphragmatic rupture and spinal nerve injuries due to extrinsic compression, and a palpable lump or malignant transformation. The diagnosis of the patient is osteochondroma located on the rib and manifests as spontaneous hemothorax owing to the diaphragmatic injury. In addition, our patient reported her repeated left shoulder pain lasting for more than 2 months, which was probably a clue of left diaphragm friction by the exostosis. The mechanisms underlying diaphragmatic injury due to exostosis include direct force by a sharp bony spur or repetitive erosion by particularly pointed bony extrusions during respiratory movements. Injury to the diaphragm, pleura, heart, and lung have all been reported rarely, and they could cause a life-threatening condition if untreated timely. Most previous reports have also not addressed any significant traumatic event or impact prior to the occurrence of symptoms, including the case of our patient. Literatures concerning solitary rib osteochondroma leading to hemothorax are listed in the Table 1, which demonstrates different organs injury including the diaphragm, lung, pleura and pericardium in turn. Occasionally it is unable to judge the exact cause of hemothorax, but a favorable outcome after the resection of solitary rib exostosis.

A 47-year-old woman, with no previous medical problems, presented to the Accident and Emergency department with left shoulder pain following a fall onto her left side from a horse. Physical examination was unremarkable and she was discharged with simple analgesia. However, 2 h later, she re-presented with worsening left shoulder pain, dizziness and mild epigastric discomfort. A new examination revealed blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg, which dropped to 95/65 mm Hg on standing, a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15 and pulse of 62 beats/min. She was resuscitated with 2 litres of Hartmann's fluid. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scan of her abdomen was negative. Then, 1 h later she experienced generalised abdominal pain and developed postural hypotension. However she remained bradycardic (heart rate 45–60 beats/min). Repeat examination revealed peritonitis. A further FAST scan showed free fluid in the left hypochondrium. A CT scan demonstrated a complex tear of the spleen, for which she underwent an emergency total splenectomy. Her postoperative recovery was uncomplicated.

### Sub capsular splenectomy for delayed spontaneous splenic rupture in a case of sickle cell anemia [^f9b47231]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Case report

KSM, a 50 year old man presented with severe pain over left hypochondrium and left lower chest wall, moderate fever on and off for one month. Pain increased on deep inspiration and radiated to left shoulder. There was no history of trauma or any disease process. On examination, only positive sign was some tenderness over left hypochondrium. Ultrasonography revealed chronic rupture of spleen with some hemoperitonem in the perisplenic area and small pleural effusion. (Figure 1) Biochemical workup did not show any abnormality, except a positive test for sickle cell trait. Patient was taken up for splenectomy because of severe pain. On exploratory laparotomy left quadrant was found cordoned off by omental adhesions. On taking down the adhesions, 250 mL of darkish blood was drained form the area around the spleen. Dense adhesions prevented separation of spleen from diaphragm, left lobe of liver, stomach and left flexure of colon. Attempt was made to ligate splenic vessels, by opening the lesser sac, but dense adhesions prevented success of this step. Sub capsular splenectomy (SCS, from within the pseudo capsule formed due to inflammation) starting from near the diaphragm, was performed so as to avoid inadvertent iatrogenic trauma to neighboring structures. (Figure 2) Splenic vessels were identified inside the capsule and ligated by transfixing en-mass with 1–0 silk. Splenic capsule was found thickened and densely adherent to neighboring structures. (Figure 3) Abdomen was closed after a thorough lavage and a tube drain was inserted in the left sub diaphragmatic region. Removed spleen (Figure 4) was sent for histopatholgical examination.

### Atraumatic splenic rupture in a man in his 70s: unusual cause of acute abdomen and shock [^8fa20a0b]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

A man in his 70s presented to the emergency department (ED) with ongoing abdominal pain for the last 2 weeks, rating this a 6/10 on the pain scale. Although initially thought to be resolving, the patient reported a sudden exacerbation of pain on the morning of presentation, reportedly triggered by stretching. He lost consciousness but sustained no head injury. On waking, he described the pain to encompass the entirety of the abdomen, though localised to the left upper quadrant with radiation into the left shoulder. This pain was exacerbated by breathing but not by palpation. He was an otherwise fit man with stage one hypertension. Relevant social history included a current smoker with an extensive pack-year history of 55 years. This man had no family history of any conditions. On further questioning, the pain initially started after lifting a heavy dumbbell; however, the patient denied any trauma or injury. Other associated symptoms included an intense cough with no sputum production and partial constipation over the last 2 weeks.

On admission at 09:50, the patient's blood results were largely unremarkable. The platelet count was 207×10⁹/L, the white blood cell (WBC) count was 6.1×10⁹/L, with neutrophils at 4.7×10⁹/L and lymphocytes at 1.0×10⁹/L, all within normal differential limits. Notable abnormalities included a reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min/1.73 m², an elevated C-reactive protein of 17 mg/L and a shortened activated partial thromboplastin time of 20.3 s. Venous blood gas analysis showed a haemoglobin (Hgb) level of 146 g/L. On examination, there was guarding of the abdomen and tenderness over the epigastric and paraumbilical areas. The ED this man visited had a local policy for acute abdominal pain, allowing emergency clinicians to order a CT abdomen pelvis with intravenous contrast, bypassing a normal surgical referral.

The patient had an initial systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 100/49 mm Hg, however while in the ED, this dropped to 66/42 mm Hg. He was moved to the resuscitation area and intravenous fluid boluses were administered, managing to correct his systolic pressure to > 90 mm Hg.

### Referred shoulder pain from ventriculoperitoneal shunts. report of three cases [^260059ec]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

The authors report on three pediatric patients with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts who presented with chronic right shoulder pain. Imaging revealed that the distal peritoneal catheter was positioned between the right hemidiaphragm and liver. Following surgical repositioning of the distal tubing, all patients experienced resolution of their shoulder pain, which has not recurred. Although seemingly rare, referred shoulder pain from a VP shunt should be added to the list of complications seen with this method of cerebrospinal fluid diversion. The clinician who cares for patients with VP shunts may wish to evaluate cases of shoulder pain without obvious neural or musculoskeletal cause by performing imaging of the distal shunt tubing.

### The clinical considerations of interscalene brachial plexus block in the treatment of post-hepatectomy shoulder pain [response to letter] [^6b629872]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor

In the commentary on our previously published article, the authors have raised numerous constructive suggestions and significant concerns. We consider these concerns to be beneficial for the clinical application of interscalene brachial plexus block in managing postoperative shoulder pain. Consequently, we address these concerns in our response.

In our previous study, we identified epidural anesthesia as a risk factor for postoperative shoulder pain after hepatectomy. In our published paper, we noted that the use of epidural postoperative analgesia could more effectively manage incisional pain postoperatively. In clinical practice, the majority of anesthesiologists do not prefer postoperative intravenous analgesia for the prevention of shoulder pain. We posit that selecting intravenous analgesia postoperatively, concurrent with an epidural block, could further increase the risk of incisional pain in patients. In the design of our study, epidural postoperative analgesia was utilized by both patient groups. Although epidural analgesia may increase the overall risk of postoperative shoulder pain, it does not introduce confounding bias in intergroup comparisons. Postoperative intravenous analgesia was not employed in our study, as utilizing two types of postoperative analgesia in a single study could increase confounding bias. Consequently, further research is warranted to elucidate the effect of interscalene brachial plexus block on shoulder pain in the context of intravenous analgesia.

The development of phrenic nerve-sparing block techniques is progressing rapidly. In our study, the interscalene brachial plexus block was selected primarily for its dual mechanism: its ability to infiltrate the phrenic nerve to address referred pain and to provide peripheral blockade, thereby alleviating shoulder pain induced by surgical positioning. Prior research has demonstrated that intraoperative noxious stimuli, which irritate the diaphragm and are transmitted via the phrenic nerve to the C3-5 dermatomes, constitute the predominant mechanism for referred pain following hepatic surgery. Consequently, our trial design did not include forgoing intervention on the phrenic nerve. Regarding the comparison of interscalene brachial plexus block with other nerve blocks, this was not addressed in our study. The aim of our study was to initially establish the efficacy of interscalene brachial plexus block and subsequently, via additional non-inferiority trials, assess its comparative effectiveness against other nerve blocks for managing postoperative shoulder pain.

### Diaphragmatic breathing for referred pain after total laparoscopic hysterectomy: a randomized clinical trial [^d915867b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The objective of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing exercises for the treatment of referred pain in TLH. Our results show that these exercises are more effective than active cervical mobilizations under similar self-administration and dosage conditions in terms of daily repetitions and time spent. Thus, breathing exercises achieve an earlier reduction in referred pain intensity, promoting a faster recovery of function in neck pain and headaches. This faster recovery of function could not be demonstrated for arm pain, where the small sample size (n = 14) may have been a factor preventing it, although a better trend in progression was observed in the DBG. Furthermore, since arm pain was always accompanied by pain in either the head or neck–shoulder region, and these areas improved with breathing exercises, it seems plausible that diaphragmatic exercises may also be beneficial for arm pain.

Various strategies are commonly used to address post-laparoscopic referred pain. Some interventions aim to prevent its onset during the surgical procedure. The literature has reported the effectiveness of approaches such as phrenic nerve anesthetic infiltration, intraperitoneal irrigation with local anesthetics, lung recruitment or forced air insufflations at the end of surgery, low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, or the insertion of postoperative catheters to eliminate pneumoperitoneum. Additionally, the preventive use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory patches and perioperative administration of pregabalin have shown promising results. Once referred pain has developed, standard analgesics are used — typically non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with opioids employed as rescue medication.

Combinations of two or more pain management strategies (e.g. peripheral nerve blocks, intraperitoneal local anesthetics, systemic analgesics, or local anesthetics with adjuvants) have been shown to offer greater efficacy and longer duration of effect in reducing postoperative pain and opioid use than monotherapies. In fact, opioids are now recommended as part of multimodal therapy or restricted to cases where multimodal analgesia without opioids proves insufficient. According to our findings, diaphragmatic breathing could be added as a complementary strategy, as none of the participants reported adverse effects suggesting harm or interaction with the standard analgesic regimen.

### Effect of ultrasound-guided phrenic nerve block on shoulder pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy-a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^7c9ae718]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Post-laparoscopic shoulder pain (PLSP) frequently follows a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A proposed mechanism for PLSP is the irritation or injury of the phrenic nerve by the CO 2 pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic surgery. Here, we investigated whether a phrenic nerve block (PNB), performed under ultrasound guidance, could reduce the incidence and severity of PLSP after laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Method

Sixty patients were randomized into two groups, with one group receiving PNB with 4 mL (30 mg) of 0.75% ropivacaine (group P, n = 28) and a control group (group C, n = 32). The existence and severity of PLSP were assessed for 2 days postoperatively. A pulmonary function test (PFT) and diaphragmatic excursion test were performed pre- and postoperatively.

Results

With ultrasound guidance, all PNBs were performed successfully in group P. In group P, the overall incidence and severity of PLSP decreased significantly. There were no significant differences in incisional pain, visceral pain, and analgesic requirements between the groups. Right-side diaphragmatic excursion decreased significantly in group P at 1 h postoperatively. The PFT results and respiratory discomfort assessed by a modified Borg's scale were not different significantly between the groups.

Conclusion

Based on these findings, ultrasound-guided PNB can prevent or reduce the PLSP without clinically significant respiratory discomfort.

### Liver imaging and pregnancy: what to expect when your patient is expecting [^2376e67c]. Insights Into Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

It is important to note that Doppler US results show decreased total hepatic blood flow before and at the onset of symptomatic HELLP syndrome. This is probably due to sinusoidal fibrin depositions and obstruction, and disease progression induces liver ischemia, infarction (frequently with fever), periportal necrosis, microthrombi, and/or intrahepatic hemorrhage/hematoma, then capsular lesions including bleeding, and ultimately liver rupture. Although US is the first-line imaging test, CT with or without intravenous contrast administration is the gold standard to detect and follow-up complications (Fig. 2). Studies have reported a marked increase in liver stiffness on US, especially during eclampsia; thus, this measurement could be recommended in the future.

Fig. 2
Hepatic rupture in a 27-year-old woman around childbirth. The patient complained of severe right upper quadrant and scapular pain. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were augmented, prothrombin time was 30%. Transverse abdominal US scan (a) shows the presence of hypoechoic areas (*), free fluid around the liver (stars), and striated thickening of the gallbladder walls (arrow), raising suspicion for pre-eclampsia. Axial (b) and coronal (c) CT scan on portal venous phase (b) demonstrate hepatic lacerations (arrowhead) with surrounding hemoperitoneum and a large peritoneal hematoma (*). Patient underwent emergency cesarean section and liver transplant

The imaging findings of HELLP include liver hypertrophy, hyperechoic thickening of the periportal space (portal halo sign), thickening of the Glisson capsule and gallbladder wall, ascites, and pleural effusion. On US, probe compression may increase abdominal pain. Infarction is seen as peripheral hypoechoic bands on US, hypo-attenuating, non-enhancing on CT, and ill-defined with a slightly high T2 signal on MRI (Fig. 3). Liver hematomas, usually located in the right liver, present as heterogeneous, subcapsular lesions, often with hemoperitoneum. Intrahepatic hematoma and hepatic rupture are the main life-threatening complications. The latter is seen as a focal irregularity with an adjacent sentinel clot. Foci of active bleeding mirror the attenuation/intensity of the aortic lumen (Fig. 4).

### ESR essentials: gynaecological causes of acute pelvic pain in women: a primer for emergent evaluation-practice recommendations by the European society of emergency radiology [^352d361b]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

MRI is a second-line test in suspected EP, demonstrating haemoperitoneum, a heterogeneous, partly haemorrhagic adnexal mass representing the gestational sac and haematosalpinx within a dilated tube and mural enhancement. MRI is better than CT at demonstrating direct signs (ectopic gestational sac — 92% diagnostic accuracy) (Fig. 7) and indirect signs (haematosalpinx, adnexal haematoma, hemoperitoneum). 100% diagnostic accuracy is achieved if the gestational sac is visible along with two indirect signs. MRI protocol should include T2✱W sequences in 3 planes to identify low signal fresh haematoma within the adnexal mass with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 95%, 100% and 96%, respectively, in diagnosing EP.

### Acute type A aortic dissection complicated by acute pancreatitis and abdominal hemorrhage: a case report of following exploratory laparotomy [^172014f4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

On postoperative day 39, the patient complained of left shoulder and left upper quadrant pain, and a repeat abdominal CT showed pancreatitis with pseudocyst, splenic rupture and hemorrhage in the abdominal pelvic cavity (Fig. 1 H). A repeat contrast-enhanced abdominal CT on the following day showed pancreatitis with pseudocyst, splenic rupture with active bleeding, and the bleeding was accumulated in the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1 I). Hemoglobin was 84 g/L. Ultrasound-guided paracentesis catheterization was performed and 1400 mL of dark red bloody fluid was extracted. Subsequently, exploratory laparotomy was performed, during which multiple abscesses around the pancreas were observed, the venous vessels in the tail of the pancreas were eroded and ruptured by the infected lesion (Fig. 1 J), and the abdominal abscess was incised and drained and the spleen was removed (Fig. 1 K). On the 42nd day after operation, abdominal CT showed that after splenectomy and abdominal abscess drainage, pancreatitis and pseudocysts improved than before. The patient gradually recovered and was discharged from the hospital on the 65th day after surgery. No special discomfort was reported during the outpatient follow-up.

### Hemoperitoneum assessment in ectopic pregnancy [^01bb1d74]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify routine clinical, ultrasound, and biologic criteria to assess the volume of hemoperitoneum in women with ectopic pregnancy (EP).

Methods

Except for patients with hemodynamic shock, all women assigned to surgical laparoscopic treatment for confirmed EP at Poissy Saint Germain en Laye Hospital between January 2004 and December 2007 were included in the study. The patients underwent abdominal and digital pelvic examination, and standardized ultrasonography. Ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to select criteria associated with an increase in hemoperitoneum. The diagnostic accuracy of each variable was then calculated for different hemoperitoneum cut-off values.

Results

The study included 215 patients. Pelvic pain of 4 or above on a numeric rating scale (odds ratio [OR], 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3–4.1), abdominal guarding or rebound tenderness (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.0–10.8), hemoglobin under 10 g/dL (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 4.2–35.8), presence of fluid at transvaginal ultrasound (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4–9.2), and fluid in Morison pouch at abdominal ultrasound (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.0–15.9) were found to be independently associated with hemoperitoneum.

Conclusion

Both clinical examination and standardized ultrasonography were found to be useful for accurate evaluation of hemoperitoneum in patients presenting with EP.

### Sphenopalatine ganglion block for ipsilateral shoulder pain following open pancreaticoduodenectomy [^5a68f8bb]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Background

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (aka Whipple procedure) is one of the most complex surgeries and is often associated with a high rate of major complications and severe postoperative pain. Incisional abdominal pain after pancreaticoduodenectomy can be well controlled with epidural techniques and additional intravenous opioids. Although significantly more common in patients who undergo laparoscopic surgeries, some patients who undergo open procedures may experience postoperative ipsilateral shoulder pain. This type of pain is caused by the irritation of tissues supplied by the phrenic nerve. To treat shoulder tip pain, which is precipitated by diaphragmatic irritation, the C3, C4 and C5 nerve roots must be blocked, but as this would inhibit phrenic nerve function and cause apnoea, it is not an option. Furthermore, this type of pain is often not responsive to systemic analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids.

To our knowledge, there is no effective established treatment for patients experiencing shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy. Sphenopalatine ganglion block (SPGB) was first reported as a treatment for unilateral facial pain symptom complex in 1908 and has since then been used to treat a number of painful conditions. This is the first report of a successful treatment of intractable ipsilateral shoulder pain after an open pancreaticoduodenectomy with topical transnasal SPGB using a cotton-tipped applicator. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this report.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 193 summary: tubal ectopic pregnancy [^08ea484d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

Adverse effects of systemic methotrexate administration — Adverse effects of methotrexate usually are dependent on dose and duration; gastrointestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, and stomatitis are the most common after multiple doses, and vaginal spotting is expected. Abdominal pain can occur 2–3 days after administration and, absent signs of rupture or significant hemoperitoneum, usually can be managed expectantly by monitoring hemoglobin and intraperitoneal fluid with transvaginal ultrasonography. Elevation of liver enzymes is a less commonly reported adverse effect and typically resolves after discontinuation; alopecia is rare at low doses; and pneumonitis has been reported, with counseling to report fever or respiratory symptoms.

### Abdominal ectopic pregnancy following a frozen embryo transfer cycle: a case report [^79bf6f33]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

Herein, we reported a primary abdominal pregnancy on the posterior surface of uterus with massive hemopritoneum at early stage of gestation. In previous studies, cases of massive hemoperitoneum associated with abdominal pregnancy before 7 weeks of gestation were rare, which were reported in the omentum, the uterosacral ligament, and the vesicouterine peritoneum. These cases suggest that the implantation site may affect the onset of bleeding. In our case, this high-risk patient did not develop any signs of acute abdominal pain and the small abdominal gestational sac can be easily misdiagnosed as hemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts in the setting of abundant hemoperitoneum. Our experience shows that massive intraperitoneal hemorrhage with no gestational sac in the uterine cavity at early gestational stage may be sign of a possible abdominal pregnancy. Thus, these symptoms provide a clue to the early diagnosis of an abdominal pregnancy in early gestation. The clinicians should bear in mind the possibility of this kind of rare condition.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^e8f14299]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

### Heterotopic pregnancy presenting with acute left chest pain [^9600f212]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Heterotopic pregnancy is the simultaneous existence of intrauterine and ectopic gestations. Heterotopic pregnancy is an extremely rare entity in natural cycle; however, it is increasing due to widespread use of assisted reproductive techniques. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in avoiding short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, early diagnosis is often difficult due to the presence of intrauterine pregnancy that impedes the diagnosis and early treatment for ectopic component. Clinical symptoms are not generally helpful in diagnosis, and signs of the ectopic pregnancy usually predominate. Patients will most likely present with abdominal pain, adnexial mass, enlarged uterus, peritoneal irritation signs, and a positive pregnancy test. We present a case, admitted to the emergency department, with atypical symptoms including acute left chest pain radiating to left shoulder, at 5 weeks' gestation.

### Symptomatic pneumoperitoneum after endoscopic removal of adjustable gastric band [^d151d963]. Obesity Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Endoscopic removal of an adjustable gastric band is a feasible procedure with few complications, according to our series of 8 patients. We report the case of a 56 year-old woman who underwent endoscopic removal of a gastric band which had eroded through the gastric wall; this procedure was performed under general anesthesia, while the surgical group removed the subcutaneous port. The patient developed a large pneumoperitoneum after the procedure, and complained of back, shoulder and epigastric pain. A plain abdominal X-ray confirmed the pneumoperitoneum, and esophagogastric radiography with water-soluble contrast did not show a perforation. The treatment approach was conservative. This experience demonstrates an expected complication of endoscopic removal of an adjustable gastric band, and that the treatment may be conservative. The technique of band removal and the mechanism of pneumoperitoneum are discussed.

Ectopic pregnancies in three different patients. a – c Teenager with intense abdominal pain and persistent vaginal bleeding. Grey-scale US images show a large amount of partially echogenic abdominal fluid (asterisk) and a pelvic haematoma (star) surrounding the uterus (U). A round, thick-walled para-uterine cystic mass (arrow) with vascularised wall and a fetal pole was noted with Colour Doppler (d). No gestational sac was identified within the endometrial cavity. Laparoscopic surgery confirmed a ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy with extensive hemoperitoneum. e – g Axial post-contrast CT images in a different patient with a ruptured tubal EP. Normal right adnexa is noted (black arrow), separate from a ring-enhancing right para-uterine cystic mass (dotted arrow) which increases the likelihood that the cystic mass represents an ectopic pregnancy. Active bleeding from the ruptured tubal pregnancy is visible during the arterial phase (arrowhead). h Woman in her 20's presenting in the emergency department with acute pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. Coronal T2 WI shows an eccentric gestational sac (arrow) with a fetal pole (arrowhead) located in the interstitial segment of the right Fallopian tube, next to the uterus (U). MRI is more helpful in evaluating ectopic interstitial pregnancy, which is a diagnostic challenge on ultrasound

Haemoperitoneum in EP is not necessarily indicative of tubal rupture but the larger the amount of fluid, the higher the likelihood of such.

CT is now increasingly performed on pregnant women either because pregnancy status is unknown, there is clinical deterioration before serum β-hCG is available, or the early urine pregnancy test is false-negative. On CT, an adnexal area of low attenuation with a dramatic enhanced ring adjacent to the ipsilateral ovary and associated haemoperitoneum suggests EP. In EP rupture, active bleeding can be seen (Fig. 7). The main CT differential diagnosis of EP is a CL cyst because (1) the wall of a CL may show strong enhancement, (2) a CL cyst may rupture in the peritoneum, and (3) a CL cyst may occur in the setting of early pregnancy. If clinical symptoms and serum β-hCG levels do not allow differentiation of these two entities, the site of the adnexal cystic mass may be a clue: a CL cyst is intraovarian, unlike an EP.

### A healthy young woman with massive hemorrhagic ascites [^b52de302]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Retrograde menstruation is the backward movement of menstrual fluids. The underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The converse current itself is benign, but the result can be abdominal pain caused by peritoneal irritation and, eventually, endometriosis. The case was of a 25-year-old woman with lower abdominal pain accompanied by significant hemoperitoneum. Physical examination and inspection using abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography failed to reveal a differential diagnosis. Detailed history taking revealed sexual activities during her menstrual period, which allowed for a diagnosis of retrograde menstruation. These findings emphasize the importance of extensive history taking.

### Shoulder tip pain during and after caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia: incidence, severity, and associated factors in a tertiary hospital in Ethiopia [^1928b3b5]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study identified a high incidence of shoulder tip pain among women undergoing elective caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, with nearly half of participants affected either during or after surgery. Postoperative shoulder tip pain was more common than intraoperative pain, and the majority of pain was moderate in severity. These findings suggest that shoulder tip pain is a prevalent and potentially under-recognised complication in this population.

Our incidence findings are consistent with previously reported ranges of 26.6% to 49.5% in studies from Turkey and Iran. The predominance of right-sided pain aligns with earlier reports, and may be explained by anatomical and physiological factors, including the distribution of phrenic nerve fibres and gravitational pooling of blood or air in the right subdiaphragmatic space.

The significant association between shoulder tip pain and intraoperative blood loss > 500 mL supports hypotheses that peritoneal irritation, likely caused by subdiaphragmatic blood collection, contributes to phrenic nerve-mediated referred pain. Although previous studies have speculated on this mechanism, our study provides supportive statistical evidence for this link. Other examined variables, including maternal demographics, gestational age, prior caesarean deliveries, and intraoperative positioning, were not significantly associated with incidence of shoulder tip pain.

This study revealed that the recommended sensory block level of T4 for caesarean section was achieved in only 15% of participants, indicating a potential gap in the quality of anaesthesia care provided. In theory, inadequate sensory block may result in peritoneal irritation, which is considered a possible cause of shoulder tip pain (STP). However, in our analysis, we did not find a statistically significant association between sensory block level and the occurrence of STP. The routine use of intrathecal opioids in our setting may have mitigated the effects of peritoneal irritation, thereby blunting the expected relationship. Interestingly, ordinal logistic regression analysis demonstrated that women who achieved only a T10 sensory block were significantly less likely to report severe STP compared to those who achieved a T4 block (OR = 0.03, 95% CI [-5.88, -0.98], p = 0.006). This counterintuitive finding suggests that factors other than block height may play a more prominent role in influencing STP severity. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to better elucidate this relationship.

Methods

Study population

All patients assigned for surgical treatment for EP between January 1999 and March 2003, by laparoscopy or by laparotomy, were included in the study.

The patients were identified from the hospital's computerized Medical Information System. The indication for surgical treatment of EP was left to the attending consultant gynaecologist, and surgery took place either at the time of presentation or after failure of medical treatment using methotrexate. At our institution medical treatment is offered on the basis of: absence of significant pain and stable hemodynamics, normal serum haemoglobin concentration and white cell count as well as serum hCG concentration < 5000 IU/L; patient accepting the medical treatment and its follow-up.

### Spontaneous hemoperitoneum in a 29-week pregnancy with a history of endometriosis: a case report and review of the literature [^03130489]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

At the time of arrival, the patient's vital signs were recorded as follows: pulse 77/min, blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, temperature 36.2°C, and oxygen saturation of 99%. Obstetric ultrasound revealed a single fetus with a positive heartbeat, increased amniotic fluid volume, and an estimated fetal weight consistent with gestational age. The placenta was visualized as normal on the posterior uterine wall, and the cervical length measured 22 mm. No abundant free fluid or bleeding was observed, ruling out uterine rupture as a concern. The non‐stress test showed reactivity without any contractions. The patient's hemoglobin level at the time of arrival was 8.3 g/dL. Due to intensifying abdominal pain, a general surgery consultation was requested. Thirty minutes later, decelerations appeared on the non‐stress test, and repeat hemoglobin values dropped to 7.2 g/dL, with blood pressure at 70/50 mm Hg and a pulse rate of 95/min. Consequently, the decision was made for laparotomy and emergency delivery of the baby. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and entry was made into the abdominal cavity. Upon entering the abdomen, a significant amount of blood and coagulum was observed. Subsequently, the uterus was opened via a Kerr incision, and a male fetus weighing 1555 grams was delivered, with Apgar scores of 4 and 6. Umbilical cord blood gases revealed a pH of 6.8 and an anion gap of −21.4. The newborn was admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). A wide exploration was conducted, involving the removal of a massive coagulum, which amounted to nearly 1000 cc of blood. An active bleeding site, displaying a decidual appearance, was identified on the left side of the uterus near the broad ligament. Bleeding was successfully controlled with sutures. Subsequently, due to observed bleeding in the upper abdomen near the spleen, a general surgeon was summoned to the operation. The current transverse incision was extended superiorly up to the umbilicus along the midline. As no active bleeding site was observed in this region, three drainage tubes were inserted, and the abdomen was closed. The patient received one unit of erythrocyte suspension intraoperatively and two units postoperatively. Additionally, only one unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was infused during the postoperative period. The patient was discharged from the hospital on the fourth day. The newborn was discharged from the hospital on the 48th day with no complications.

### Successful laparoscopic management of diaphragmatic pregnancy: a rare case report and brief review of literature [^d0a65df0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Abdominal ectopic pregnancies are rare category of ectopic pregnancies. We describe a ectopic pregnancy implanted on the surface of diaphragm and highlight the difficult clinical course of an abdominal ectopic pregnancy managed with strategic procedural intervention.

Case presentation

A 33-year-old Chinese woman with abdominal pain was diagnosed with ectopic pregnancy implanted in the liver according to CT and advised to transfer the patient to tertiary referral center. The patient had a significant increasing abdominal pain and intense reflex sensitivity in the right shoulder when she presented to our hospital. Laparoscopic surgery was decided immediately with the impression of ruptured abdominal pregnancy and hemorrhagic shock. It was found that ectopic pregnancy was implanted on the diaphragmatic surface. The pregnant tissue was completely resected from the diaphragm and bipolar electrocoagulation was used to control bleeding. The patient was stable and discharged 3 days after surgery in a good condition.

Conclusion

CT or MRI should be considered as an alternative to TVS in the management of ectopic pregnancy patients with unusual presentations. A thorough observation of the entire pelvis and upper abdomen during laparoscopic exploration is crucial for diagnosis.

### A unique case of diagnosis of a heterotopic pregnancy at 26 weeks-case report and literature review [^80711ca0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Heterotopic pregnancy (HP) is a rare condition where at least two pregnancies are present simultaneously at different implantation sites and one of them located in the uterine cavity. Its prevalence varies from 1 to 30 000 in a natural cycle to around 1 in 100 in an assisted ones. Like in ectopic pregnancy, abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding with positive pregnancy test are the common syndromes, but the diagnosis is more complicated. Even in the era of high-resolution ultrasound imaging and Doppler techniques, most of the time, the diagnosis is based on the presence of acute abdominal symptoms.

In the first trimester, unrecognized heterotopic pregnancy can be a cause of nontraumatic acute abdomen. We present a unique case of heterotopic pregnancy recognized at 26 weeks of gestation when the patient presented with hemoperitoneum after tubal rupture. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of such late symptomatic heterotopic pregnancy in the medical literature.

### Phrenic nerve block at the azygos vein level versus sham block for ipsilateral shoulder pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a randomized controlled trial [^b1132f9b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

KEY POINTS

Question: Does phrenic nerve block (PNB) at the azygos vein level reduce ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)?
Findings: Although PNB at the level of the deformed vein did not reduce the incidence of ISP after VATS when considered as an anesthetic block, the post hoc analysis supports the role of this approach in the analgesic management of ISP.
Meaning: PNB at azygous vein level is moderately effective in reducing ISP without absolving it completely.

Ipsilateral shoulder pain (ISP) commonly occurs after thoracic surgery. The incidence of ISP is reportedly 31%–85%. Notably, ISP is not effectively ameliorated by administration of local anesthetics through a thoracic epidural catheter, which is highly effective for incision pain. ISP can impair respiration, mobility, and physical therapy in the early postoperative period; it is also difficult to relieve pharmacologically. Thus, an effective and safe solution for the management of ISP is needed.

ISP is considered to be the result of referred pain from irritation caused by surgical invasion to the pericardium, mediastinum, or diaphragm, transmitted via the phrenic nerve. This mechanism is supported by the occurrence of ISP when phrenic nerve stimulation devices are used. Furthermore, intraoperative phrenic nerve block (PNB) by local anesthetic infiltration of periphrenic fat tissue near the diaphragm has been reported to effectively reduce ISP. However, at the level of the diaphragm, many sensory fibers from the pericardium and mediastinum have already left the phrenic nerve; therefore, targeting the phrenic nerve more cranially is presumably more effective. To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the usefulness of local anesthetic infiltration around the phrenic nerve at the azygos vein level.

We hypothesized that infiltration of local anesthetic around the phrenic nerve at the azygos vein level would be effective for reducing ISP. The aim of this study was to test the effect of PNB on postoperative ISP following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), through assessment of the incidence of ISP after VATS.
