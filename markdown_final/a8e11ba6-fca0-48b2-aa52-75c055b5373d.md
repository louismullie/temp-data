## Question

Glycemic control in diabetes mellitus during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about glycemic control in diabetes mellitus during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching clinical rationale and risks of dysglycemia in pregnancy. Then, I should verify the preconception glycemic targets and medication adjustments. Next, I will examine pregnancy-specific glucose targets and how they differ by diabetes type. After that, I need to check the role and limitations of A1C in pregnancy. Then, I will review monitoring modalities, including SMBG and CGM, and clarify when CGM is preferred. I will now examine pharmacologic therapy, especially insulin as first-line and the role of metformin and glyburide. Next, I should review lifestyle interventions and individualized targets. Finally, I will consider postpartum follow-up and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with attention to evidence gaps and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the clinical rationale and risks. Hyperglycemia in pregnancy is linked to increased risks of congenital anomalies with pregestational diabetes, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth, and these risks scale with the degree and chronicity of dysglycemia, which is why timely, tight but safe glycemic control is emphasized across guidelines [^116CedBQ] [^115qgRLe] [^111zF3tx].

> I need to verify preconception targets and medication strategy. For those planning pregnancy, aim for A1C less than 6.5% if safely achievable, and at minimum less than 7% before conception to reduce congenital anomaly risk; insulin is preferred for type 1 diabetes and generally for type 2 diabetes in pregnancy, with discontinuation of teratogenic or insufficiently studied agents such as GLP-1 receptor agonists prior to conception and transition to safer regimens to avoid rebound hyperglycemia [^115USq8t] [^111hELfa] [^115baues] [^116Jmq4B].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pregnancy glucose targets; I should confirm the specific thresholds. During pregnancy, fasting plasma glucose should be 70–95 mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial 110–140 mg/dL, and 2-hour postprandial 100–120 mg/dL; for GDM managed without insulin, the upper limits are fasting less than 95 mg/dL, 1-hour less than 140 mg/dL, and 2-hour less than 120 mg/dL, with less stringent goals acceptable if significant hypoglycemia occurs [^114P5vpJ] [^111VBmoT] [^115fnj3h] [^1148F6c3].

> Wait, let me verify the role of A1C in pregnancy because interpretation shifts. Due to increased red cell turnover, A1C is physiologically lower in pregnancy; the ideal pregnancy A1C target is less than 6% if achievable without significant hypoglycemia, with relaxation to less than 7% as needed, and A1C should be treated as a secondary measure after capillary glucose monitoring, obtained about monthly given these dynamics [^114VmJfC] [^114P5vpJ] [^111VBmoT].

> I will now examine monitoring modalities. Self-monitoring of blood glucose remains foundational with fasting and postprandial checks to guide therapy; CGM is strongly recommended in type 1 diabetes and can be considered in type 2 diabetes and GDM, with the caveat that evidence for hard outcomes is strongest in T1D and mixed for T2D/GDM, so CGM should complement, not replace, SMBG, and estimated A1C or glucose management indicator calculations should not be used in pregnancy [^117J9k71] [^116ARv8B] [^11333J5n] [^116Dsgod] [^114VqaLs].

> Let me think about pharmacotherapy hierarchy and safety. Insulin is first-line in pregnancy for T1D, T2D, and GDM requiring pharmacotherapy because it does not cross the placenta and allows precise titration; metformin and glyburide are not preferred first-line due to placental transfer and uncertain long-term fetal effects, though metformin may be considered when insulin is declined or unavailable, and glyburide is generally discouraged given higher neonatal hypoglycemia risk and limited efficacy in some contexts [^115baues] [^1114MJ7K] [^1157LJBr] [^112Rm8po] [^113yHRdQ].

> But wait, what if the patient cannot safely achieve standard targets due to hypoglycemia. I should confirm that ADA advises individualization; if standard pregnancy targets precipitate significant hypoglycemia, less stringent goals are appropriate, and hypoglycemia thresholds in pregnancy commonly use less than 70 mg/dL for blood glucose and less than 63 mg/dL for sensor glucose, with therapy adjusted accordingly [^117GD5B4] [^111VBmoT].

> Next, I should review lifestyle interventions and trajectory of control. Medical nutrition therapy and approximately 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity are foundational, with attention to distributed, fiber-rich carbohydrates and individualized meal patterns; importantly, achieving glycemic control early after GDM diagnosis and maintaining it through pregnancy associates with fewer perinatal complications, reinforcing the need for proactive, sustained control rather than late catch-up [^114quHj6] [^116CedBQ].

> I need to ensure postpartum planning is addressed. Screen for persistent diabetes or prediabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum with a 75-g OGTT using nonpregnant criteria, and if normal, continue lifelong screening every 1–3 years; in those with prior GDM, consider metformin for diabetes prevention when indicated, and coordinate endocrine follow-up to bridge preconception care for future pregnancies [^115tA8hM] [^116rwByW] [^116rvxmK].

> Hold on, I should verify technology-specific nuances. For T1D, CGM improves glycemia and neonatal outcomes and is recommended; hybrid closed-loop systems with pregnancy-specific targets are reasonable in experienced centers, though targets and algorithms vary and require experienced teams; for T2D/GDM, CGM is reasonable but evidence for superiority over SMBG is limited, so device selection should be individualized and supported by education and data review workflows [^117J9k71] [^1158Znsd] [^1178ujoB] [^114VqaLs].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence and uncertainties so I do not overstate claims. Many glycemic target recommendations are consensus-based with limited high-quality RCTs, particularly for T2D and GDM; Cochrane reviews suggest few differences between very tight and tight-moderate targets in T1D and highlight uncertainty in GDM, and contemporary guidelines emphasize individualized care and shared decision-making given these gaps [^1155YWmT] [^114PnPgd] [^117GD5B4].

> To synthesize a practical approach, I should double-check the sequence. Preconception: optimize A1C, switch to insulin-based regimens, stop teratogenic agents, and provide intensive education; during pregnancy: use SMBG with CGM as indicated, treat to fasting 70–95 mg/dL and postprandial targets with A1C as a secondary monthly metric, escalate to insulin when lifestyle fails, and individualize if hypoglycemia emerges; postpartum: screen at 4–12 weeks and arrange longitudinal diabetes surveillance and prevention strategies [^114PmDbR] [^111VBmoT] [^115tA8hM] [^116rwByW].

---

Glycemic control in pregnancy requires **fasting glucose < 95 mg/dL** and **1-hour postprandial < 140 mg/dL** or **2-hour < 120 mg/dL** [^114PmDbR] [^111VBmoT], with A1C ideally < 6% if achievable without hypoglycemia [^114VmJfC] [^114P5vpJ]. Insulin is **first-line** [^115baues] when lifestyle fails [^1114MJ7K], and metformin or glyburide are not first-line due to placental transfer and limited long-term safety data [^1157LJBr] [^114mxSaU]. CGM is recommended for type 1 diabetes [^117J9k71] and considered for type 2 or GDM when available [^11333J5n] [^114VqaLs]; SMBG is standard otherwise [^112YjWUs]. Postpartum, screen for persistent diabetes at 4–12 weeks [^115tA8hM] and then every 1–3 years [^116rwByW].

---

## Glycemic targets during pregnancy

The ADA 2025 provides **specific glycemic targets** for pregnant individuals with diabetes [^111VBmoT]:

| **Parameter** | **Target value** |
|-|-|
| Fasting plasma glucose | ≤ 95 mg/dL (≤ 5.3 mmol/L) |
| 1-hour postprandial glucose | < 140 mg/dL (< 7.8 mmol/L) |
| 2-hour postprandial glucose | < 120 mg/dL (< 6.7 mmol/L) |
| Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) | < 6% (< 42 mmol/mol) if achievable without significant hypoglycemia; relax to < 7% (< 53 mmol/mol) if necessary [^114VmJfC] |

---

These targets aim to balance maternal **hypoglycemia risk** with the need to reduce fetal complications, such as macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and congenital anomalies [^111zF3tx].

---

## Monitoring strategies

Effective glycemic control relies on **frequent glucose monitoring**. The following methods are recommended:

- **Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)**: Recommended for all pregnant individuals with diabetes, typically four times daily (fasting and 1- or 2-hour postprandial) [^112YjWUs] [^11463pSi].

- **Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)**: Strongly recommended for individuals with type 1 diabetes [^117J9k71] and considered for those with type 2 diabetes or GDM, particularly when SMBG is insufficient or hypoglycemia is a concern [^11333J5n] [^115CjstQ].

- **HbA1c monitoring**: Recommended monthly during pregnancy due to altered red blood cell turnover, with targets as specified above [^114P5vpJ].

---

## Pharmacological management

Insulin is the **preferred pharmacological treatment** during pregnancy because of its safety and efficacy [^115baues]. Oral agents such as metformin and glyburide are not recommended as first-line therapy due to placental transfer and limited long-term safety data [^1157LJBr] [^114mxSaU]. Insulin regimens should be individualized and adjusted frequently to maintain glycemic targets [^113jJAg7].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Lifestyle modifications, including **medical nutrition therapy** and regular physical activity, are foundational to glycemic control in pregnancy [^1114MJ7K]. These interventions should be tailored to individual needs and monitored closely for effectiveness [^114quHj6].

---

## Postpartum glycemic management

After delivery, **glycemic monitoring should continue**, with screening for persistent diabetes at 4–12 weeks postpartum using a 75-g OGTT [^115tA8hM]. Lifelong screening for type 2 diabetes or prediabetes is recommended every 1–3 years for individuals with a history of GDM [^116rwByW].

---

## Impact of glycemic control on maternal and fetal outcomes

Optimal glycemic control significantly reduces the risk of maternal complications (e.g. preeclampsia, cesarean delivery) and fetal complications (e.g. macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, congenital anomalies) [^116CedBQ]. Conversely, poor glycemic control increases the risk of adverse outcomes, including preterm birth and stillbirth [^111gjYZK].

---

## Challenges and barriers

Achieving glycemic targets in pregnancy is challenging due to physiological changes, patient adherence, and healthcare system factors. Individualized care, patient education, and access to diabetes technologies (e.g. CGM) are critical to overcoming these barriers [^113jJAg7] [^113eN36W].

---

Glycemic control in diabetes during pregnancy requires **strict targets**, frequent monitoring, and individualized management. Insulin is the **preferred pharmacological treatment**, with lifestyle interventions as foundational therapy. Optimal glycemic control significantly improves maternal and fetal outcomes, but achieving these targets requires overcoming significant clinical challenges.

### Continuous glucose monitoring in pregnancy [^1151PSBc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Optimal glycemic control is associated with improved outcomes. Continuous glucose monitoring is a less invasive alternative to blood glucose measurements. Two types of continuous glucose monitoring are available in the market: real time and intermittently scanned. Continuous glucose monitoring is gaining popularity and is now recommended by some societies for glucose monitoring in pregnant women. In this review, we discuss the differences between the two types of continuous glucose monitoring, optimal treatment goals, and whether there is an improvement in maternal or neonatal outcomes.

### Approach to the patient with diabetes during pregnancy [^112V6WF3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

The epidemics of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) globally are paralleling an increase in the number of women with T2DM becoming pregnant. Because T2DM is frequently undiagnosed before pregnancy, the risk of major malformations in the developing fetus is increased due to uncontrolled hyperglycemia. The lack of preconception care and the increase in complications of pregnancy due to the coexistence of obesity and T2DM are of concern from both an individual and a public health standpoint. Rapid achievement of normoglycemia with limited weight gain is critical to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes in all women with diabetes during pregnancy, regardless of the type of diabetes. This article will focus on T2DM preceding pregnancy due to its increasing prevalence and potentially dire fetal and maternal consequences. Euglycemia before, during, and after all pregnancies complicated by diabetes results in the best opportunity for optimal outcomes for mother and infant.

### Insulin therapy in pregnancy [^114zda1S]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Insulin therapy is essential for optimal glycemic control during pregnancy in women with type 1 diabetes and is frequently required to optimize control in women with type 2 diabetes. Less commonly, women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) require insulin for glycemic control. However, because of its greater prevalence, GDM is the most common reason for insulin use in pregnancy. The most frequently used insulin regimen in pregnancy is a basal/bolus combination of long- and short-acting insulin preparations. There is no evidence base to support one treatment regimen over another. Therapy should be individualized and based on local expertise.

### Different intensities of glycaemic control for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes [^1155YWmT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal glycaemic control target in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes is unclear, although there is a clear link between high glucose concentrations and adverse birth outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials comparing different glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included three trials, all in women with type 1 diabetes (223 women and babies). All three trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, unclear methods of randomisation and selective reporting of outcomes. Two trials compared very tight (3.33 to 5.0 mmol/L fasting blood glucose (FBG)) with tight-moderate (4.45 to 6.38 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, with one trial of 22 babies reporting no perinatal deaths orserious perinatal morbidity (evidence graded low for both outcomes). In the same trial, there were two congenital anomalies in the very tight, and none in the tight-moderate group, with no significant differences in caesarean section between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.73; evidence graded very low). In these two trials, glycaemic control was not significantly different between the very tight and tight-moderate groups by the third trimester, although one trial of 22 women found significantly less maternal hypoglycaemia in the tight-moderate group. In a trial of 60 women and babies comparing tight (≤ 5.6 mmol/L FBG); moderate (5.6 to 6.7 mmol/L); and loose (6.7 to 8.9 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, there were two neonatal deaths in the loose and none in the tight or moderate groups (evidence graded very low). There were significantly fewer women with pre-eclampsia (evidence graded low), fewer caesarean sections (evidence graded low) and fewer babies with birthweights greater than 90th centile (evidence graded low) in the combined tight-moderate compared with the loose group. The quality of the evidence was graded low or very low for important outcomes, because of design limitations to the studies, the small numbers of women included, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Many of the important outcomes were not reported in these studies.

Authors' Conclusions

In a very limited body of evidence, few differences in outcomes were seen between very tight and tight-moderate glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes, including actual glycaemic control achieved. There is evidence of harm (increased pre-eclampsia, caesareans and birthweights greater than 90th centile) for 'loose' control (FBG above 7 mmol/L). Future trials comparing interventions, rather than glycaemic control targets, may be more feasible. Trials in pregnant women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes are required.

### Different intensities of glycaemic control for women with gestational diabetes mellitus [^114PnPgd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has major short- and long-term implications for both the mother and her baby. GDM is defined as a carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia or any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy from 24 weeks' gestation onwards and which resolves following the birth of the baby. Rates for GDM can be as high as 25% depending on the population and diagnostic criteria used, and overall rates are increasing globally. There is wide variation internationally in glycaemic treatment target recommendations for women with GDM that are based on consensus rather than high-quality trials.

Objectives

To assess the effect of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (26 September 2022), and reference lists of the retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, and quasi-RCTs. Trials were eligible for inclusion if women were diagnosed with GDM during pregnancy and the trial compared tighter and less-tight glycaemic targets during management. We defined tighter glycaemic targets as lower numerical glycaemic concentrations, and less-tight glycaemic targets as higher numerical glycaemic concentrations.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods for carrying out data collection, assessing risk of bias, and analysing results. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility for inclusion, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data for the four included studies. We assessed the certainty of evidence for selected outcomes using the GRADE approach. Primary maternal outcomes included hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. Primary infant outcomes included perinatal mortality, large-for-gestational-age, composite of mortality or serious morbidity, and neurosensory disability.

Main Results

This was an update of a previous review completed in 2016. We included four RCTs (reporting on 1731 women) that compared a tighter glycaemic control with less-tight glycaemic control in women diagnosed with GDM. Three studies were parallel RCTs, and one study was a stepped-wedged cluster-RCT. The trials took place in Canada, New Zealand, Russia, and the United States. We judged the overall risk of bias to be unclear. Two trials were only published in abstract form. Tight glycaemic targets used in the trials ranged between ≤ 5.0 and 5.1 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose and ≤ 6.7 and 7.4 mmol/L postprandial. Less-tight targets for glycaemic control used in the included trials ranged between < 5.3 and 5.8 mmol/L for fasting plasma glucose and < 7.8 and 8.0 mmol/L postprandial. For the maternal outcomes, compared with less-tight glycaemic control, the evidence suggests a possible increase in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy with tighter glycaemic control (risk ratio (RR) 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.69, 2 trials, 1491 women; low certainty evidence); however, the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of effects that encompass both benefit and harm. Tighter glycaemic control likely results in little to no difference in caesarean section rates (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17, 3 studies, 1662 women; moderate certainty evidence) or induction of labour rates (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.18, 1 study, 1096 women; moderate certainty evidence) compared with less-tight control. No data were reported for the outcomes of subsequent development of type 2 diabetes, perineal trauma, return to pre-pregnancy weight, and postnatal depression. For the infant outcomes, it was difficult to determine if there was a difference in perinatal mortality (RR not estimable, 2 studies, 1499 infants; low certainty evidence), and there was likely no difference in being large-for-gestational-age (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.29, 3 studies, 1556 infants; moderate certainty evidence). The evidence suggests a possible reduction in the composite of mortality or serious morbidity with tighter glycaemic control (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.29, 3 trials, 1559 infants; low certainty evidence); however, the 95% CI is compatible with a wide range of effects that encompass both benefit and harm. There is probably little difference between groups in infant hypoglycaemia (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.18, 3 studies, 1556 infants; moderate certainty evidence). Tighter glycaemic control may not reduce adiposity in infants of women with GDM compared with less-tight control (mean difference -0.62%, 95% CI -3.23 to 1.99, 1 study, 60 infants; low certainty evidence), but the wide CI suggests significant uncertainty. We found no data for the long-term outcomes of diabetes or neurosensory disability. Women assigned to tighter glycaemic control experienced an increase in the use of pharmacological therapy compared with women assigned to less-tight glycaemic control (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.59, 4 trials, 1718 women). Tighter glycaemic control reducedadherence with treatment compared with less-tight glycaemic control (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.51, 1 trial, 395 women). Overall the certainty of evidence assessed using GRADE ranged from low to moderate, downgraded primarily due to risk of bias and imprecision.

Authors' Conclusions

This review is based on four trials (1731 women) with an overall unclear risk of bias. The trials provided data on most primary outcomes and suggest that tighter glycaemic control may increase the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. The risk of birth of a large-for-gestational-age infant and perinatal mortality may be similar between groups, and tighter glycaemic targets may result in a possible reduction in composite of death or severe infant morbidity. However, the CIs for these outcomes are wide, suggesting both benefit and harm. There remains limited evidence regarding the benefit of different glycaemic targets for women with GDM to minimise adverse effects on maternal and infant health. Glycaemic target recommendations from international professional organisations vary widely and are currently reliant on consensus given the lack of high-certainty evidence. Further high-quality trials are needed, and these should assess both short- and long-term health outcomes for women and their babies; include women's experiences; and assess health services costs in order to confirm the current findings. Two trials are ongoing.

### Current practices in gestational diabetes [^114quHj6]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite recognized maternal and fetal risks, gaps remain in defining optimal glycemic targets, pharmacotherapy thresholds, and implementing first-line gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) treatments. Medical nutrition therapy and 150 minutes of weekly moderate exercise are essential but face adherence challenges due to time constraints and psychological stress. Individualized support and structured guidance can enhance success. Insulin is the preferred pharmacologic option for its efficacy and safety, yet treatment must consider individual pathophysiology. With rising GDM prevalence, novel therapeutic strategies are critical to improving maternal health and ensuring the long-term well-being of affected children.

Diabetes in pregnancy guideline summary — prevalence, risks, preconception care, and technology: Using an evidence-based approach, this guideline addresses management of individuals with preexisting type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus across the preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum periods. The prevalence of preexisting diabetes mellitus has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, with increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Preconception care is very important to minimize the risk of congenital defects and to maintain good glycemic control, and during pregnancy, pregnancy-specific diabetes care is required to reduce negative outcomes. Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump technology have shown benefit by simplifying glycemic monitoring and insulin administration; improvements in glycemia and perinatal outcomes have been reported with CGM compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose, and hybrid closed-loop pump systems combine CGM and insulin pump technologies with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. Optimization of glycemia, correct dietary advice, safe medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.

Summary

Using an evidence-based approach, Diabetes in Pregnancy: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline addresses important clinical issues in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) preconceptionally, during pregnancy, and in the postpartum period.

The prevalence of preexisting diabetes mellitus (PDM) has grown exponentially in the last 2 decades, primarily due to a marked increase in the prevalence of T2DM. PDM carries increased risk for adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, preterm delivery, macrosomia, and congenital defects. Preconception care (PCC) is very important to minimize the risk of congenital defects as well as to maintain good glycemia in the preconception phase and during pregnancy. PDM requires pregnancy-specific diabetes care to reduce negative outcomes. In the last few years, technology has progressed to address the unique challenges individuals face in managing diabetes in pregnancy. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump technology have shown benefit by simplifying glycemic monitoring and insulin administration. Improvements in glycemia and perinatal outcomes have been reported with CGM use when compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) pump systems combine CGM and insulin pump technologies with increasingly sophisticated algorithms. As technology becomes more integrated into the routine management of diabetes in pregnancy, practitioners need to provide individualized device selection, counseling, education and self-management support to ensure patient autonomy and safety. Optimization of glycemia, correct dietary advice, safe medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.

Research and investment in implementation and delivery of PCC are crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity now. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking, so clinical studies in this context are necessary.

Background

Preexisting diabetes (PDM) increases the risk of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Reduction of maternal hyperglycemia prior to and during pregnancy can reduce these risks. Despite compelling evidence that preconception care (PCC), which includes achieving strict glycemic goals, reduces the risk of congenital malformations and other adverse pregnancy outcomes, only a minority of individuals receive PCC. Suboptimal pregnancy outcomes demonstrated in real-world data highlight the need to further optimize prenatal glycemia. New evolving technology shows promise in helping to achieve that goal. Dysglycemia is not the only driver of poor pregnancy outcomes in PDM. The increasing impact of obesity on pregnancy outcomes underscores the importance of optimal nutrition and management of insulin sensitizing medications during prenatal care for PDM.

Objective

To provide recommendations for the care of individuals with PDM that lead to a reduction in maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes.

Methods

The Guideline Development Panel (GDP) composed of a multidisciplinary panel of clinical experts, along with experts in guideline methodology and systematic literature review, identified and prioritized 10 clinically relevant questions related to the care of individuals with diabetes before, during and after pregnancy. The GDP prioritized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of different interventions (eg, PCC, nutrition, treatment options, delivery) during the reproductive life cycle of individuals with diabetes, including type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Systematic reviews queried electronic databases for publications related to these 10 clinical questions. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and develop recommendations. The approach incorporated perspectives from 2 patient representatives and considered patient values, costs and resources required, acceptability and feasibility, and impact on health equity of the proposed recommendations.

Results

In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest asking a screening question about pregnancy intention at every reproductive, diabetes, and primary care visit. Screening for pregnancy intent is also suggested at urgent care/emergency room visits when clinically appropriate (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations. In individuals with diabetes mellitus who have the possibility of becoming pregnant, we suggest use of contraception when pregnancy is not desired (2 | ⊕⊕OO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence in women with diabetes, where PCC-including contraception as a key component-showed a clinically significant association with improvements in first-trimester HbA1c and the rate of congenital malformations, together with indirect evidence from the general population regarding the reduction of unplanned pregnancies and pregnancy terminations with the use of contraception. In individuals with T2DM, we suggest discontinuation of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) before conception rather than discontinuation between the start of pregnancy and the end of the first trimester (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on limited data on risk of exposure to GLP-1RA receptor agonists during pregnancy. In pregnant individuals with T2DM already on insulin, we suggest against routine addition of metformin (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the benefit of adding metformin to insulin to achieve decrease in rates of large for gestational age infants did not outweigh the potential harm of increasing the risk of small for gestational age infants or adverse childhood outcomes related to changes in body composition. In individuals with PDM, we suggest either a carbohydrate-restricted diet (< 175g/day) or usual diet (> 175g/day) during pregnancy (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on the GDP judgment that the available evidence was limited and very indirect, resulting in significant uncertainty about the net benefits or harms. As such, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation either for or against a carbohydrate intake cutoff of 175g/day. In pregnant individuals with T2DM, we suggest either the use of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). There is lack of direct evidence supporting superiority of CGM use over SMBG for T2DM during pregnancy. There is indirect evidence supporting improved glucometrics with the use of CGM for individuals with T2DM outside of pregnancy, substantial improvements in neonatal outcomes for individuals with T1DM using CGM during pregnancy and the potential for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes with improved glucometrics in individuals with T2DM. In individuals with PDM using a CGM, we suggest against the use of a single 24-hour CGM target < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L) in place of standard-of-care pregnancy glucose targets of fasting < 95mg/dL (5.3mmol/L), 1-hour postprandial < 140mg/dL (7.8mmol/L), and 2-hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL (6.7mmol/L) (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that associated adverse pregnancy outcomes with a fasting glucose > 126mg/dL (7mmol/L). In individuals with T1DM who are pregnant, we suggest the use of a hybrid closed-loop pump (pump adjusting automatically based on CGM) rather than an insulin pump with CGM (without an algorithm) or multiple daily insulin injections with CGM (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on a meta-analysis of RCTs which demonstrated improvement in glucometrics with increased time in range (MD +3.81%; CI -4.24 to 11.86) and reduced time below range (MD -0.85%; CI -1.98 to 0.28) with the use of hybrid closed-loop pump technology. In individuals with PDM, we suggest early delivery based on risk assessment rather than expectant management (2 | ⊕OOO). This was suggested based on indirect evidence that risks may outweigh benefits of expectant management beyond 38 weeks gestation and that risk assessment criteria may be useful to inform ideal delivery timing. In individuals with PDM (including those with pregnancy loss or termination), we suggest postpartum endocrine care (diabetes management), in addition to usual obstetric care (2 | ⊕OOO). As the postpartum period frequently overlaps with preconception, this was suggested based on indirect evidence demonstrating a strong association between PCC and both reduced HbA1c at the first prenatal visit and congenital malformations.

Conclusion

The data supporting these recommendations were of very low to low certainty, highlighting the urgent need for research designed to provide high certainty evidence to support the care of individuals with diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. Investment in implementation science for PCC is crucial to prevent significant mortality and morbidity for individuals with PDM and their children. RCTs to further define glycemic targets in pregnancy and refinement of emerging technology to achieve those targets can lead to significant reduction of harm and in the burden of diabetes care. Data on optimal nutrition and obesity management in pregnancy are lacking. More research on timing of delivery in women with PDM is also needed.

### The effect of high-fibre diets on glycaemic control in women with diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y28f8]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Effective dietary strategies are essential for the management of diabetes in pregnancy to address hyperglycaemia and reduce requirement for pharmacotherapy during fetal development and growth. However, there is minimal evidence regarding the most effective dietary strategies to improve glycaemia in women with diabetes in pregnancy.

The role of fibre intake in the management of glycaemia outside of pregnancy is well established, but its role in women with diabetes in pregnancy is unclear. Although guidelines recommend consumption of 30 g/day of dietary fibre for adults, most of the population consume much lower quantities. Increasing fibre intake therefore has the potential to offer a feasible, economical and safe method of improving glycaemia in pregnancy. However, a key area of controversy surrounds the optimal quality and quantity of carbohydrate in the diet of pregnant women with diabetes. Many women with diabetes in pregnancy are recommended to consume a lower carbohydrate diet, but this can reduce fibre intake, which may not be beneficial.

We aimed to identify if dietary fibre, including fibre‐rich diets and supplementation, was associated with benefits upon glycaemic control in women with diabetes in pregnancy using a systematic review. We hypothesised that higher intakes of dietary fibre, irrespective of source, would improve markers of glycaemic control compared to a control or standard intake.

### Insulin management for gestational and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy [^113jJAg7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Insulin is preferred as the first-line agent for glucose management of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy when nutritional and lifestyle modifications are unable to achieve pregnancy-specific glucose targets. Individual heterogeneity in defects of insulin secretion or sensitivity in liver and muscle, unique genetic influences on pregnancy glycemic regulation, and variable cultural and lifestyle behaviors that affect meal, activity, sleep, and occupational schedules necessitate a personalized approach to insulin regimens. Newer insulin preparations have been developed to mimic the physiologic release of endogenous insulin, maintaining appropriate basal levels to cover hepatic gluconeogenesis and simulate the rapid, meal-related, bolus rise of insulin. Such physiologic basal-bolus dosing of insulin can be administered safely, achieving tighter glycemic control while reducing episodes of hypoglycemia. Insulin initiation and titration require understanding the pharmacodynamics of different insulin preparations in addition to a patient's glycemic profiles, effect of variable nutritional intake and mealtimes, physical activity, stress, timing of sleep cycles, and cultural habits. Educating and empowering patients to learn how their glucose responds to insulin, portion and content of meals, and physical activity can increase personal engagement in therapy, flexibility in eating patterns, and improved glycemic control. This Clinical Expert Series article is focused on optimizing insulin management (initiation, dosing, and titration) of gestational and type 2 diabetes in pregnancy.

The frequency of GDM is rising globally and may also increase further as less-stringent criteria for the diagnosis are potentially adopted. The additional burden placed on the health care system by increasing cases of GDM requires consideration of diagnostic approaches and currently used treatment strategies. Debate continues to surround both the diagnosis and treatment of GDM despite several recent large-scale studies addressing these controversial issues. As many now have come to reassess their approach to the management of GDM, we provide information in this review to help guide this process. The goal for each health care practitioner should continue to be to provide optimum care for women discovered to have carbohydrate intolerance during pregnancy.

### Approach to the patient using diabetes technology in pregnancy [^1142sofL]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Diabetes in pregnancy increases risk for complications for the pregnant patient and neonate. Tight glycemic control to maintain glucose levels as close to nondiabetic ranges as possible can lower risk for these complications. Achieving strict glycemic targets can be challenging, and technologies including continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pumps have the potential to improve diabetes control and pregnancy outcomes. The aim of this review is to present and appraise the current data about use of these technologies in pregnancy. In pregnancies with type 1 diabetes (T1D), CGM can improve glycemic control and reduce risk for neonatal complications. International consensus guidelines recommend more than 70% time in pregnancy target range (TIR) of 63 to 140mg/dL (3.5–7.8mmol/L), and there are data to suggest higher TIR in pregnancies with T1D can reduce risk for neonatal complications including fetal overgrowth and pregnancy complications like preeclampsia. Recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated improved glycemic outcomes with use of HCL insulin pumps in pregnancy with T1D, though the results vary depending on the system used and available glycemic targets. In pregnancies with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), retrospective data suggest CGM can improve glycemia but there are limited data about outcomes or optimal CGM targets. Studies have reported glycemic measures for pregnancies without diabetes, which may serve as a guide for further outcomes studies of T2D and GDM. Access to diabetes technology and the necessary health care systems to support use of these devices may be barriers that contribute to health care disparities.

Preprandial testing is also recommended when using insulin pumps or basal-bolus therapy so that the prandial rapid-acting insulin dosage can be adjusted. Postprandial monitoring is associated with better glycemic outcomes and a lower risk of preeclampsia.

Discussion

Diabetes in pregnancy is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of maternal and neonatal complications, as well as higher healthcare costs. Preexisting diabetes in pregnancy is complex and is associated with significant maternal and neonatal risk. Optimization of glycemic control, medication regimens, and careful attention to comorbid conditions can help mitigate these risks and ensure quality diabetes care before, during, and after pregnancy.

CGM has the potential to enhance diabetes management during pregnancy by providing patients and clinicians with detailed and real-time data, overcoming many of the limitations associated with traditional BGM. Substantial evidence supports the use of CGM in helping women with T1D achieve glycemic targets during pregnancy and the postpartum period. In contrast, data on CGM use in pregnant women with T2D or GDM remain limited, with larger RCTs currently underway. Additional studies are still required to determine the optimal alarm thresholds when using CGM are used during pregnancy.

Moreover, further research is needed to establish appropriate glycemic targets for CGM use in pregnant women with T2D and GDM. The current decision to initiate CGM in pregnant individuals with T2D or GDM should be individualized based on treatment regimen, clinical context, requirements, comorbidities, patients preferences, and whether the CGM systems has been validated for use during pregnancy with published accuracy data.

In summary, overall, continuous glucose monitors are valuables tools for monitoring glucose fluctuations in pregnancies complicated by any form of diabetes. Robust studies have investigated accuracy, user acceptability, and safety evaluations in pregnant populations. CGM provides real-time data and alerts, enabling early interventions that can mitigate both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, thereby reducing adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with disglycemia.

Hypoglycemia thresholds and goal individualization in pregnancy — The most appropriate hypoglycemia threshold level in pregnancy has not been validated but has ranged from < 60 mg/dL (< 3.3 to 3.9 mmol/L) in the past. Current recommendations for hypoglycemia thresholds include blood glucose < 70 mg/dL (< 3.9 mmol/L) and sensor glucose < 63 mg/dL (< 3.5 mmol/L). If an individual cannot achieve these goals without significant hypoglycemia, aim for less stringent goals based on clinical experience and individualization of care.

Implement and Evaluate

The measure of success of the public health approach aimed at improving both primary and secondary prevention is the extent to which it realizes a major reduction in the health impact of CHD in the entire population. While acknowledging that more research is needed, it is also important to develop and implement solutions based on what is already known. For example, maternal pregestational diabetes mellitus is an established risk factor for CHD, 51, 52, 53 and primary prevention targeting diabetes mellitus before conception is possible today. 54, 55, 56 It is also well established that diabetic women who are in optimal glycemic control immediately before and during pregnancy can reduce their risk of having a baby with CHD to nearly the level of those without pregestational diabetes mellitus. 51, 54, 55 More concerted efforts could be undertaken to target screening and management of diabetes mellitus among childbearing‐aged women at high risk of diabetes mellitus, with implementation of both individual‐ and population‐level interventions. These efforts would include increasing awareness among childbearing‐aged women and healthcare providers about the risk of CHD associated with pregestational diabetes mellitus, as well as improving access to screening and care for diabetes mellitus to increase the proportion of childbearing‐aged women with pregestational diabetes mellitus in optimal glycemic control. Modeling has estimated that ≈2670 congenital heart defects could be prevented annually in the United States if interventions succeeded in ensuring all women with pregestational diabetes mellitus were in optimal glycemic control immediately before and during pregnancy. 52

### Intensive glycemic control in gestational diabetes mellitus: a randomized controlled clinical feasibility trial [^114un5ME]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Overweight and obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for adverse perinatal outcomes, and they are also more likely to have suboptimal glycemic control. However, there is a paucity of data evaluating whether lower glycemic targets could improve outcomes.

Objective

To evaluate the feasibility of intensive glycemic control in overweight and obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

Materials and Methods

We randomized 60 overweight or obese women with gestational diabetes mellitus, diagnosed between 12 and 32 weeks' gestation to either intensive (fasting < 90 mg/dL, 1 hour postprandial < 120 mg/dL) or standard (fasting < 95 mg/dL, 1 ho postprandial < 140 mg/dL) glycemic targets. Maternal glucose was assessed in 2 ways: blinded continuous glucose monitors, worn for 5 days at 2 time points (at 12–32 weeks and again at 32–36 weeks), and self-monitored glucose measurement 4 times per day. All women underwent standardized dietary counseling, and medical therapy was prescribed as needed to achieve glycemic control.

Results

Between December 2015 and December 2017, we randomized 60 women to either intensive (n = 30) or standard (n = 30) glycemic control. Baseline characteristics including maternal age, body mass index, and gestational age at diagnosis were similar between the intensive and standard groups. Medical therapy was more common in women in the intensive group than those in the standard group (83 vs 57%, P = 0.02). Women in the intensive glycemic control group had lower glucose values as assessed by continuous glucose monitors at including 24-hour mean (-8.1; 95% confidence interval, -12.0 to -4.3 mg/dL; P < .0001) and 1-h postprandial (-11.8; 95% confidence interval, -19.7 to -3.9 mg/dL, P = 0.004) values. Hypoglycemia < 60 mg/dL was uncommon and did not differ between groups.

Conclusion

Intensive glycemic targets can be used in overweight and obese women with minimal hypoglycemia, and this approach results in improved glycemic control when compared to standard glycemic targets. Further studies are needed to determine whether intensive glycemic targets can improve maternal and neonatal outcomes in high-risk women with gestational diabetes mellitus.

### Interventions in women with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the pre-pregnancy, pregnancy and postpartum periods to optimise care and health outcomes: a systematic review [^117Q6bat]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

In line with the global prevalence of diabetes, the number of pregnancies complicated by Type 2 diabetes is increasing. In England and Wales in 2021/2022, 55% of women with diabetes in pregnancy were reported to have Type 2 diabetes, many of whom face health inequalities before and during pregnancy. Infants of women with Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy are at greater risk of adverse outcomes including perinatal and neonatal death, compared to those of women with Type 1 diabetes. Diabetes in pregnancy can also increase the risk of small and large for gestational age (SGA and LGA respectively), gestational hypertension, pre‐eclampsia and pre‐term delivery.

To optimise pregnancy preparation and outcomes, current guidelines advise intervention in the pre‐pregnancy period for women with Type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom (UK), including achieving an HbA1c ≤ 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), high dose folic acid (5 mg) supplementation, identification and management of diabetes complications and hypertension, and ceasing potentially teratogenic medication. However, multiple factors impact this population's ability to effectively prepare for pregnancyand implementation of this advice has thus far proven suboptimal with only around 10% of women with Type 2 diabetes meeting these targets. Furthermore, we previously reported a high proportion of obesity (65%), smoking (23%) and illicit/recreational drug use (9%) among women with Type 2 diabetes planning pregnancy compared to women without diabetes. Together, this evidence highlights the significant challenges to pre‐pregnancy care, demonstrating the need for targeted interventions in the pre‐pregnancy period for women with Type 2 diabetes.

In pregnancy, women with Type 2 diabetes are typically advised to conduct self‐monitoring of blood glucose levels, with additional advice on diet and exercise, and treatment with metformin and/or insulin to optimise blood glucose management. Insulin requirements vary through pregnancy and during delivery. Between 16 and 37 weeks' gestation, an increase in insulin resistance means that the daily insulin requirement can almost double that of the pre‐pregnancy requirement. A largely uniform approach to the use of metformin and insulin in the management of Type 2 diabetes in pregnancy has resulted in a lack of studies evaluating optimal dosing or regimens that may optimise glycaemia. Furthermore, most studies evaluating the efficacy of behaviour change interventions in pregnancy are tailored towards gestational diabetes, highlighting the need to conduct interventions that may improve pregnancy outcomes in women with Type 2 diabetes.

### Cost effectiveness of early metformin in addition to usual care in the reduction of gestational diabetes mellitus effects (EMERGE) – A randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial [^11278W5V]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), defined as carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia with onset during pregnancy, is a global health problem.GDM is associated with increased risks of adverse maternal outcomes and adverse foetal outcomes, and increased healthcare utilisation and costs. Moreover, both women and infants are at increased long‐term risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

While improved glycaemic control is associated with improved maternal and foetal outcomes, there is uncertainty about the optimal management approach following GDM diagnosis. Current clinical guidelines recommend an initial strategy of medical nutritional therapy and exercise, with pharmacotherapy reserved for those who fail to achieve glycaemic control after lifestyle management. Insulin is considered first‐line pharmacotherapy effective in achieving glycaemic control and improving several maternal and perinatal outcomes. However, insulin is also associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including increased rates of maternal and infant hypoglycaemia, excess gestational weight gain, higher rates of caesarean birth and neonatal intensive care unit admission.

Recent evidence on the safety of metformin in pregnancy supports its emergence as an alternative therapeutic approach to insulin for the management of GDM. Compared to insulin, metformin is reported to be associated with improved maternal and foetal metabolic outcomes for GDM. However, concerns exist about higher rates of spontaneous pre‐term birth, and small for gestational age outcomes. Importantly, these data reflect current clinical practice, where metformin is only prescribed when there is a failure to achieve glycaemic control with lifestyle modification. An alternative approach involves the early initiation of metformin at GDM diagnosis, with goals of improved glycaemic control, reduced need for insulin therapy and other clinical advantages beyond glycaemic control.

The EMERGE randomised controlled trial (RCT) tested the hypothesis that early metformin was associated with superior GDM outcomes. Although the trial reported that early metformin in addition to usual care was not superior for the composite primary outcome (insulin initiation or a fasting laboratory glucose value ≥ 5.1 mmol/L at either week 32 or 38 of gestation (risk ratio (RR), 0.89; 95% CI: 0.78–1.02; p = 0.13)), it demonstrated positive and statistically significant impacts on multiple secondary maternal and foetal outcomes. Further, although the trial was not primarily designed to assess safety, it did provide reassurance that early metformin does not increase the risk of adverse events in mothers or infants.

In addition to the evidence on the safety and clinical effectiveness, decisions regarding the adoption of health technologies in clinical practice should depend upon their expected cost‐effectiveness. This article reports on the cost‐effectiveness of early metformin in addition to usual care for GDM based on the EMERGE RCT.

Continuous glucose monitoring vs self-monitoring of blood glucose in pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus — recommendation and remarks: In pregnant individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), we suggest either continuous glucose monitor (CGM) or self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) (2 | ⊕OOO). Frequent glucose monitoring is critical in T2DM in pregnancy to appropriately modify treatment regimens with the increasing insulin resistance of pregnancy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends that CGM in pregnancy should be combined with SMBG to achieve optimal pre- and postprandial targets, and if CGM is not used, the standard of care is to continue SMBG 4 times daily. Technical remarks state that both CGM and SMBG are considered reasonable alternatives during pregnancy, there is limited direct evidence of superiority of CGM use in T2DM, CGM may offer a potential advantage over SMBG in certain subgroups of individuals with preexisting T2DM, and ideal glycemic ranges, CGM metrics, and % time in range (TIR) for individuals with T2DM may be different compared to those which have demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in T1DM.

### Timing of medically indicated delivery in diabetic pregnancies: a perspective on current evidence-based recommendations [^115qgRLe]. American Journal of Perinatology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes complicates 6 to 7% of all pregnancies in the United States. Poor glycemic control is associated with multiple immediate and long-term adverse effects on both the mother and fetus. Although uniformity exists in the antenatal management of this disease, there is a paucity of evidence-based studies upon which to dictate the optimal time of delivery among affected women. The potential risks of delayed neonatal pulmonary maturation including respiratory distress syndrome and transient tachypnea of the newborn associated with early delivery must be balanced with the increased incidence of fetal demise, overgrowth, and birth injury related to diabetes in late gestations. Even among diabetic women with optimal glycemic control, the risk of stillbirth in the third trimester is considerably higher than their normal counterparts. The current paradigm of delaying delivery to 39 weeks in women with controlled and uncomplicated diabetes has been challenged by recent evidence advocating delivery by 38 weeks to improve perinatal outcomes. However, additional well-designed and adequately powered prospective studies are needed to better understand the short- and long-term implications of the optimal timing of delivery in this high-risk population. This article reviews the most current literature regarding the optimal timing of delivery in pregnancies complicated by diabetes mellitus and gestational diabetes mellitus.

Recommended glycemic goals for nonpregnant adults are shown in Table 9. The recommendations are based on those for A1C, with listed blood glucose levels that appear to correlate with achievement of an A1C of < 7%. The issue of pre- versus postprandial SMBG targets is complex. Elevated postchallenge (2-h OGTT) glucose values have been associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of FPG in some epidemiological studies. In diabetic subjects, some surrogate measures of vascular pathology, such as endothelial dysfunction, are negatively affected by postprandial hyperglycemia. It is clear that postprandial hyperglycemia, like preprandial hyperglycemia, contributes to elevated A1C levels, with its relative contribution being higher at A1C levels that are closer to 7%. However, outcome studies have clearly shown A1C to be the primary predictor of complications, and landmark glycemic control trials such as the DCCT and UKPDS relied overwhelmingly on preprandial SMBG. Additionally, a randomized controlled trial presented at the 68th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association in June 2008 found no CVD benefit of insulin regimens targeting postprandial glucose compared with those targeting preprandial glucose. A reasonable recommendation for postprandial testing and targets is that for individuals who have premeal glucose values within target but have A1C values above target, monitoring postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) 1–2 h after the start of the meal and treatment aimed at reducing PPG values to < 180 mg/dl may help lower A1C.

As noted above, less stringent treatment goals may be appropriate for adults with limited life expectancies or advanced vascular disease. Glycemic goals for children are provided in Section VII. A.1.a. Severe or frequent hypoglycemia is an absolute indication for the modification of treatment regimens, including setting higher glycemic goals.

Regarding goals for glycemic control for women with GDM, recommendations from the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational Diabetes Mellitus were to target the following maternal capillary glucose concentrations:
preprandial: ≤ 95 mg/dl (5.3 mmol/l) and either 1-h postmeal: ≤ 140 mg/dl (7.8 mmol/l) or 2-h postmeal: ≤ 120 mg/dl (6.7 mmol/l)

For women with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who become pregnant, a recent consensus statement recommended the following as optimal glycemic goals, if they can be achieved without excessive hypoglycemia:
premeal, bedtime, and overnight glucose 60–99 mg/dl
peak postprandial glucose 100–129 mg/dl
A1C < 6.0%

### Quality of guidelines on the management of diabetes in pregnancy: a systematic review [^11447SA6]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Diabetes during pregnancy can lead to severe risks for both mother and fetus when it is not managed properly. The use of rigorously developed guidelines with a robust implementation process can have a positive influence on the management of diabetes during pregnancy. This study aims to compare recommendations and assess the quality of clinical guidelines on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and pre-existing diabetes mellitus during pregnancy.

Methods

Guidelines were selected by searching PubMed, the Guideline Clearing House and Google. All guidelines developed since 2000 on diabetes during pregnancy in English or Dutch were considered. Recommendations of the guidelines were compared. Furthermore, the quality was assessed by two authors independently, using the AGREE instrument.

Results

Eight guidelines were included. According to the AGREE instrument, the quality of most guidelines was low. The domains editorial independence, stakeholder involvement and rigour of development had the lowest scores. Recommendations were mainly comparable on glycemic control, preconceptional counseling and prenatal care and labour. Differences between recommendations were found for screening on GDM and induction of labour.

Conclusions

The quality of most guidelines concerning the management of diabetes during pregnancy needs to be improved. A more systematic approach in the development of these guidelines, more attention for updating procedures and piloting of the guidelines and involvement of target users and patients is recommended.

### American diabetes association "Standards of medical care-2020 for gestational diabetes mellitus": a critical appraisal [^1149QbMP]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health problem, affecting about one in every six pregnancies globally. The field of GDM diagnosis continues to be marred by controversy, and a need to develop consensus has often been highlighted. While recommendations by major professional organizations provide consensus opinion and better our understanding on a given subject, the existence of nearly 30 different guidelines on the subject of GDM, each with a different perspective, does bring in an element of confusion.

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) "Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes" developed by ADA's multidisciplinary Professional Practice Committee is updated and published annually. The standards provide clinicians and researchers with evidence-based guidelines on a broad range of topics including classification and diagnosis of diabetes, targets for glycemic control, use of technology to improve diabetes care, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment of hyperglycemia, management of in-patient hyperglycemia, recognition and management of microvascular and macrovascular complications, and management of diabetes in special groups.

The guidelines provided by American Diabetes Association (ADA) on diagnosis and management of hyperglycemia in pregnancy are widely followed. Herein, we provide a critical appraisal of the recently published document, highlighting its strength and limitations with regard to the diagnosis of GDM. Finally, we provide a brief personal perspective on the subject.

### Gestational diabetes: underpinning principles, surveillance, and management [^111BahPN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycemia with onset during pregnancy. The article aims to provide clinicians with a working framework to minimize maternal and neonatal morbidity. Landmark historical and recent data are reviewed and presented to provide clinicians with a quick, easy reference for recognition and management of GDM. Data presented tie in insights with underlying pathophysiologic processes leading to GDM. Screening and diagnostic thresholds are discussed along with management upon diagnosis. Good clinical practice regarding screening, diagnosis, and management of GDM effectively reduces risk and improves outcomes of women and fetuses in affected pregnancies.

### Medications for managing preexisting and gestational diabetes in pregnancy [^115roF3h]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Persons with gestational and pregestational diabetes during pregnancy may require pharmacologic agents to achieve pregnancy glycemic targets, and the available medications for use in pregnancy are limited. Insulin is the only FDA-approved medication for use in pregnancy and has the greatest evidence for safety and efficacy. Metformin and glyburide are the most commonly used oral agents in pregnancy. Understanding each medication's unique pharmacokinetics, potential side effects, fetal or childhood risks, gestational age of medication initiation and patient's diabetes care barriers are important aspects of shared decision-making and choosing a regimen that will achieve glycemic and pregnancy goals.

### Glycemic control trajectories and risk of perinatal complications in gestational diabetes… [^116CedBQ]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that gestational diabetes interventions should help individuals achieve glycemic control early after diagnosis and throughout pregnancy to decrease the risk of perinatal complications. Importance Glycemic control is the cornerstone of gestational diabetes management. Glycemic control trajectories account for differences in longitudinal patterns throughout pregnancy; however, studies on glycemic control trajectories are scarce. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that slowly improving to near-optimal and slowly improving to suboptimal glycemic control trajectories were associated with increased risk of perinatal complications. Future interventions should help individuals achieve glycemic control early after gestational diabetes diagnosis and throughout pregnancy to decrease the risk of perinatal complications. Gestational diabetes, one of the most common pregnancy complications, 1 affects around 8% of pregnancies each year in the US.

2 Gestational diabetes is associated with a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, cesarean delivery, macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and increased long-term risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 3 Randomized clinical trials of treatment of gestational diabetes using medical nutrition therapy and insulin therapy reduced the rate of perinatal complications, 4, 5 suggesting that glycemic control may improve perinatal outcomes. The essential role of glycemic control in gestational diabetes management has been widely acknowledged, with the American Diabetes Association recommending the use of self-monitoring of blood glucose as the primary measure of glycemic control during pregnancy.

6 However, large-scale, population-based data on glycemic control profiles based on serial self-monitoring of blood glucose measurements and their associations with perinatal complications among individuals with gestational diabetes are sparse. 7 Furthermore, conventional dichotomization of glycemic control status does not capture the progressive changes of glycemic control during pregnancy. Trajectory 1 represented the stably optimal glycemic control trajectory with the largest proportion of individuals in our study, which started with a 1. 0 probability of optimal glycemic control at gestational diabetes diagnosis and maintained that until delivery. T2 represented the rapidly improving to optimal glycemic control trajectory, which started with less than 0.

2 probability of achieving optimal glycemic control, reached optimal control by 8 weeks after diagnosis and maintained it except for a slight decrease during the last 2 weeks before delivery.

### Maternal diabetes: anticipatory guidance for use of CGM in… [^1167fVQ2]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Gestational diabetes mellitus is one of the most common complications of pregnancy, and its prevalence has been steadily increasing. GDM increases the risk of adverse outcomes for both the patient and their child during the prenatal and perinatal periods. The primary goal of GDM treatment is to reduce risks to the pregnant patient and their child. Effective glycemic management during pregnancy is essential to avoid complications such as congenital anomalies, preeclampsia, macrosomia and preterm birth. Behavioral management — including nutrition therapy and physical activity — is recommended as the initial approach to achieve glycemic targets, and it may be sufficient for many patients with GDM. However, if health behavior changes alone do not achieve glycemic targets in GDM, pharmacologic therapy is recommended, and insulin is generally the first-line pharmacologic therapy.

Treating GDM with behavioral management and medication has been shown to improve outcomes, including decreased rates of preeclampsia, shoulder dystocia and macrosomia. Multiple professional societies, including the ADA and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology, recommend fasting and postprandial glucose monitoring and endorse specific glycemic targets during pregnancy. Glucose monitoring can be helpful to support health behavior changes and guide medication adjustments. Emerging evidence supports the American Diabetes Association's recommendation that continuous glucose monitoring — which is recommended as standard therapy for people with diabetes who are treated with insulin — may be beneficial for patients with GDM. AAFP has produced an anticipatory guidance resource detailing care for patients with a GDM diagnosis, as well as CGM options for pregnant and postpartum patients.

Make these small changes to provide optimal care for patients diagnosed with GDM through glucose monitoring during pregnancy and postpartum. The content on this page was independently developed by the AAFP with support from Dexcom, Inc.

### CGM for management of type 2 diabetes in pregnancy… [^111Zxvfw]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

CGM for Management of Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy ClinicalTrials. gov ID.
- Use continuous glucose monitoring or self-monitoring of blood glucose to monitor blood sugar control from enrollment until delivery
- Have blood drawn at enrollment, 24 weeks, 34 weeks and delivery to measure hemoglobin A1c levels and store blood for future analysis
- Complete surveys about social support, environmental stressors, diabetes distress and glucose monitoring satisfaction at research visits. Participants randomized to CGM will receive a Dexcom G7 CGM and be instructed how to apply it, access the CGM data, and how to interpret and respond to trend arrows and alerts. Participants will replace the CGM device with a new sensor every 10 days for the entire pregnancy. Participants randomized to SMBG will be instructed to perform SMBG at least 4 times daily and share their glucose data with their provider according to standard care.

We will utilize ACOG and ADA recommendations for glycemic targets in pregnancy a standardized protocol with graduated goals for glycemic control to ensure consistency across arms and study sites. For pregnant individuals randomized to CGM, the target range will be 63–140mg/dL. For pregnant individuals randomized to SMBG, the targets will be fasting < 95mg/dL, 1-hour postprandial less than 140mg/dL and 2-hour postprandial less than 120mg/dL. CGM reports and glucose logs will be reviewed at least every 1–2 weeks, and therapy adjustments will be recommended if less than 70% of glucose values are at target, regardless of the method of glucose monitoring. Additional therapy adjustments will be encouraged to achieve greater than 70% glucose values at target so long as there is not significant hypoglycemia.

Telehealth visits may be utilized in addition to outpatient in person visits at the discretion of the provider, but should be used similarly for the CGM and SMBG groups. This protocol for glycemic management will be followed at all times including both at outpatient visits and during inpatient antepartum hospitalization. Intrapartum glycemic control, fetal testing and timing and route of delivery will be determined by the clinical provider in accordance with ACOG recommendations.

### Gestational diabetes mellitus: update on screening, diagnosis, and… [^114FHnkM]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universal testing for abnormal glucose tolerance in early pregnancy, but some patients may benefit from first-trimester screening. With GDM, exercise improves fasting and postprandial glucose control, but the effects on patient-centered outcomes are unknown. 32–34 Combining diet and exercise interventions reduces the risk of LGA infants. 34, 35 Higher maternal age, BMI, and fasting blood glucose levels and earlier gestational age at diagnosis reduce the likelihood that glucose can be controlled by lifestyle modifications alone.
36. Daily glucose monitoring typically consists of measuring the fasting glucose value and three postprandial values, reviewed weekly. Consensus thresholds for hyperglycemia in pregnancy include more than 95 mg per dL fasting, more than 140 mg per dL one hour post-prandial, and more than 120 mg per dL two hours postprandial.

Glyburide can be considered for glucose control in patients who are unable or prefer not to take insulin or metformin. 4, 25 Like metformin, glyburide crosses the placenta, and the long-term developmental impact of in utero exposure is unknown. Although glyburide is equivalent to metformin for glucose control during pregnancy, it increases the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and may increase the risk of preeclampsia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and stillbirth. 4, 25, 44, 50. INTRAPARTUM MANAGEMENT Intrapartum management of GDM is largely extrapolated from data on patients with preexisting diabetes, which suggests that glucose levels should be maintained between 70 and 110 mg per dL. 25, 30 Patients with diet-controlled GDM may be less likely to develop hyperglycemia in labor, but evidence is lacking.

63 A retrospective study of 3, 680 infants of mothers with GDM or type 1 or 2 diabetes demonstrated no association between maternal intrapartum glucose levels and neonatal hypoglycemia after adjusting for neonatal size, gestational age, and sex. 64 Additional studies have found inconsistent improvement in fetal hypoglycemia with intrapartum maternal glucose control, suggesting intrapartum maternal glucose may play a smaller role in immediate neonatal glucose control than previously thought. 65–67.

### Screening, diagnosis, and management of gestational diabetes… [^114ysdUp]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

LIFESTYLE CHANGES Initial treatment for GDM involves diet and activity modification. Women with GDM should receive individualized nutrition counseling from a registered dietitian, which commonly includes a recommendation to limit carbohydrate intake to 33% to 40% of calories. 2 No high-quality data exist on the optimal diet for women with GDM. A Cochrane review of nine small trials comparing different types of dietary advice did not demonstrate any significant differences in perinatal outcomes. 22 Some, but not all, trials suggest that a low glycemic index diet may result in improved glycemic control. 23, 24. The role of ultrasonography in pregnancies complicated by GDM varies among clinicians and institutions. Some physicians obtain serial ultrasonography to monitor fetal growth in patients with GDM.

Several small trials have found that instituting tighter glycemic control for women with accelerated fetal growth may result in a lower incidence of large-for-gestational-age infants. 2, 46 Limited evidence suggests that induction of women with GDM at 39 weeks, compared with further expectant management, is associated with a lower risk of macrosomia and shoulder dystocia, 47 without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery. 48 Expectant management beyond 39 weeks is also associated with an increased risk of stillbirth, although the absolute risk remains low. 51 Women with diet-controlled GDM rarely require intrapartum insulin.

52 A variety of protocols exist to guide intrapartum management of blood glucose among women receiving insulin, but in general, glucose levels should be monitored every one to two hours during active labor, and 5% dextrose or insulin infused as needed to maintain glucose levels between 70 and 110 mg per dL. Women with GDM rarely need oral agents or insulin immediately after delivery. Before discharge, it is reasonable to confirm that fasting glucose values are normal. However, short- and long-term follow-up is critical. Women with GDM should undergo screening at six to 12 weeks postpartum with a fasting glucose measurement or 75-g two-hour glucose tolerance test; up to 36% of women with GDM may have persistently abnormal glucose tolerance.
