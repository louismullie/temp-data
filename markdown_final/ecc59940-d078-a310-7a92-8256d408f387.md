## Question

Bed bugs treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about bed bug treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the infestation and distinguishing bed bugs from look-alikes. Then, I should verify the clinical approach to bite reactions and what actually helps patients. Next, I will examine integrated pest management (IPM) principles and the hierarchy of environmental controls. After that, I need to check chemical strategies, resistance considerations, and safety. Finally, I will consider special populations, prevention, and how to measure success, while continuously validating claims against the best available evidence and correcting any missteps along the way.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and not jump to conclusions based on bites alone, because bites are nonspecific and can mimic scabies, fleas, mosquitoes, or allergic urticaria; I should look for live bugs, cast skins, eggs, or fecal spots clustered around sleeping areas, and remember that some patients have no reaction at all, which complicates reliance on skin findings alone [^d7b2754d] [^ba91b4b5] [^74ac7f5b]. Hold on, I should verify that infestations are confirmed before initiating control; public health guidance emphasizes expert confirmation and discourages treating based solely on bite complaints, so I need to ensure we have objective evidence of infestation before proceeding [^01474042] [^2011478d].

> Next, I should review the clinical management of bite reactions; wait, let me verify that there are no evidence-based pharmacologic treatments proven superior to supportive care. The JAMA review and CDC guidance indicate that most bites resolve with minimal symptomatic care and good hygiene to prevent secondary infection, and that topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines are reasonable for pruritus, though high-quality trials are lacking and outcomes likely do not differ from no treatment in many cases [^d7b2754d] [^2e58b65f] [^141b5a55]. I should double-check that antibiotics are reserved for documented secondary bacterial infection, not used prophylactically, and that severe systemic reactions are rare but may require urgent care, including epinephrine for anaphylaxis when indicated [^2e58b65f] [^d7b2754d].

> Now, I will examine the environmental strategy; IPM is the cornerstone, and I need to ensure I articulate it correctly. IPM integrates multiple methods — monitoring, physical removal, heat or cold, structural exclusion, and judicious pesticides — and is consistently endorsed by CDC/EPA as the most effective and environmentally sensitive approach, especially when residents participate fully and when programs are coordinated in multifamily settings [^82952a4b] [^970ae05d] [^1c8d126c]. Hold on, I should verify that nonchemical measures alone are often insufficient in moderate to severe infestations; yes, EPA/CDC notes nonchemical-only control is frequently less effective and more resource intensive, reinforcing the need for integrated tactics [^82952a4b].

> I will now examine nonchemical controls in order of priority; let me think about which have the strongest practical evidence. Mattress and box spring encasements reduce harborage and facilitate detection, and should be rip-resistant and escape-proof; passive interceptors under bed legs trap bugs and enable monitoring; vacuuming with a HEPA vacuum dedicated to pest control reduces numbers; decluttering removes hiding places; and heat treatment of infested items or whole rooms at temperatures around 50–60°C kills all life stages, though it requires specialized equipment and safety planning [^a3db19c9] [^ba061b87] [^47348cbc] [^9175fe0f]. Wait, I initially thought freezing was uniformly effective; let me reconsider — while freezing can kill bed bugs, it requires sustained low temperatures and adequate exposure time, so it is less practical than heat in many settings and should be reserved for items that cannot be heated [^notfound].

> Next, I should review chemical controls and resistance; I need to ensure I do not overstate any single product. Pyrethroids remain common, but resistance is widespread, so product selection should be guided by local resistance patterns and rotated with non-pyrethroid classes when possible; desiccants like silica gel and diatomaceous earth provide residual activity without resistance, and professional application of residual insecticides to harborage sites is often necessary, sometimes requiring multiple treatments [^82952a4b] [^f0f43c99] [^b4cad036]. Hold on, I should verify safety messaging: misuse of insecticides, especially foggers or outdoor products indoors, has caused illnesses and fatalities; therefore, treatments should follow labels, minimize exposure, and prioritize lower-toxicity options when feasible [^1ad10a7e] [^82952a4b].

> Let me consider special populations and settings; I should confirm that guidance aligns with best practices. In multifamily housing, coordinated IPM across units is essential because bed bugs move through walls and shared infrastructure; in healthcare or residential facilities, early detection, laundering, encasements, and professional pest control are standard; for travelers, inspection and luggage precautions reduce risk of introduction; and for individuals with limited resources, encasements, interceptors, and heat-capable laundry access are prioritized interventions [^82952a4b] [^a69044f0] [^7904b0e9] [^b4600a8a]. But wait, what if the patient is immunocompromised or has severe reactions? In that case, I should escalate supportive care and coordinate expedited environmental control to reduce ongoing exposure while monitoring for secondary infection or systemic symptoms [^notfound].

> I should confirm how to measure success and when to declare control; I need to ensure we are not stopping too early. Monitoring should combine visual inspections with traps or interceptors, and in some programs canine detection is used to verify elimination, but any canine alert should be confirmed visually before declaring success; absence of live bugs for several months after treatment, coupled with sustained resident education and surveillance, supports durable control [^a3db19c9] [^7336c9bb] [^01474042]. Hold on, I should verify that early detection and rapid response reduce costs and recurrence; yes, federal strategy documents emphasize that early, coordinated IPM lowers treatment burden and prevents spread within communities [^f69694e6] [^970ae05d].

> Finally, I need to ensure prevention is embedded to reduce reinfestation; let me review practical steps. Prevention hinges on avoiding introduction via used furniture or travel, reducing harborage through sealing and decluttering, and instituting routine monitoring in high-risk settings; community-wide education and, where feasible, policy measures such as landlord–tenant protocols and access to laundry facilities improve outcomes and equity [^b4600a8a] [^eade62b3] [^5d81be80]. I should double-check that these align with CDC/EPA guidance; yes, the joint statements consistently call for IPM-based prevention, early detection, and stakeholder coordination to sustain control gains [^82952a4b] [^1c8d126c].

Bed bug treatment requires a **multi-pronged approach** that combines patient care with environmental control. For patients, provide **symptomatic care** with topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines for pruritus, and treat secondary infections with antibiotics if needed [^2e58b65f] [^141b5a55]. For the environment, use **integrated pest management (IPM)** [^82952a4b] — heat or cold treatments, vacuuming, encasements, and targeted insecticides — and coordinate with a licensed pest control professional for persistent infestations [^9b76a5aa]. Educate patients on prevention, including travel precautions and early detection, to reduce reinfestation risk [^7904b0e9] [^eade62b3].

## Clinical management of bed bug bites

### Patient assessment

During assessment, confirm the diagnosis by identifying **linear, pruritic erythematous papules** on exposed skin, often in clusters or lines, and correlate with environmental evidence such as blood spots on bedding or live bugs in sleeping areas [^ba91b4b5] [^1437fcba]. Also assess for secondary infection (impetigo, cellulitis) and document the extent of lesions and patient-reported symptoms [^aaac1710].

---

### Symptomatic treatment

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Medium-potency creams (e.g. triamcinolone 0.1%) applied twice daily for 5–7 days reduce inflammation and pruritus [^notfound].

- **Oral antihistamines**: Non-sedating agents (e.g. cetirizine, loratadine) for daytime; sedating agents (e.g. diphenhydramine) at night for severe pruritus [^notfound].

- **Secondary infection management**: Topical or systemic antibiotics for impetigo or cellulitis (e.g. cephalexin 500 mg orally four times daily for 7–10 days) [^notfound].

---

### Patient education

Explain that bed bugs are not known to transmit disease and that **bites are not contagious** [^061ea3b8] [^402d2060]. Provide written instructions on home preparation for pest control, including laundering, decluttering, and vacuuming [^82952a4b].

---

## Environmental control and eradication

### Integrated pest management (IPM)

IPM is the **cornerstone of bed bug control**, combining non-chemical and chemical methods with ongoing monitoring [^82952a4b].

| **Method** | **Description** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Heat treatment | Professional whole-room heating to ≥ 50°C for several hours | Highly effective; kills all life stages |
| Cold treatment | Freezing infested items at ≤ -18°C for ≥ 4 days | Effective for small items |
| Vacuuming | Frequent HEPA vacuuming of mattresses, furniture, and crevices | Reduces population; must be repeated |
| Encasements | Mattress and box spring covers trap bugs and aid detection | Effective long-term control |
| Insecticides | Targeted use of pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, or desiccants | Effective when resistance is managed |

---

### Professional pest control

Engage a **licensed pest control professional** for moderate to severe infestations or when DIY measures fail [^9b76a5aa]. Professionals use IPM, including residual insecticides, dusts, and growth regulators, and may employ canine detection for early identification [^7336c9bb].

---

## Prevention strategies

### Travel precautions

- **Inspection**: Check hotel rooms for signs of bed bugs (blood spots, live bugs) before unpacking [^7904b0e9].

- **Luggage management**: Keep luggage off the floor and bed; use luggage racks or bathroom counters [^7904b0e9].

- **Post-travel**: Launder all clothing on high heat; vacuum luggage thoroughly [^notfound].

---

### Home prevention

- **Early detection**: Use interceptors under bed legs and conduct regular inspections [^a3db19c9].

- **Clutter reduction**: Minimize hiding places by decluttering and sealing cracks [^ba061b87].

- **Secondhand items**: Inspect and treat used furniture or clothing before bringing them indoors [^b4600a8a].

---

## Special considerations

### Vulnerable populations

In vulnerable populations, **homeless shelters** require coordinated IPM, resident education, and access to laundry facilities [^eade62b3]. In healthcare settings, implement strict IPC policies, staff training, and rapid response protocols [^811eb0a3].

---

### Insecticide resistance

Resistance is common; **rotate insecticide classes** and use non-chemical methods to mitigate resistance [^b4cad036] [^82952a4b].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule **follow-up visits** to assess treatment response and adherence, and reinforce education. Continue environmental monitoring with interceptors and visual inspections to detect recurrence early [^a3db19c9].

---

Bed bug treatment success depends on **coordinated patient care and environmental control**. Use IPM, educate patients, and monitor for recurrence to achieve durable elimination.

### Bed bugs (cimex lectularius) and clinical consequences of their bites [^d7b2754d]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Bed bug (Cimex lectularius) infestations are rapidly increasing worldwide. Health consequences include nuisance biting and cutaneous and systemic reactions. The potential for bed bugs to serve as disease vectors and optimal methods for bed bug pest control and eradication are unclear.

Objectives

To present current knowledge of the health and medical effects of bed bugs and to explore key issues in pest control and eradication efforts.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1960-October 2008) for articles using the keywords bed bugs, Cimex lectularius, humans, parasitology, pathogenicity, and drug effects. For pest control, PubMed and Toxline searches (1960-October 2008) were performed using the keywords bed bugs, Cimex, control, prevention, and eradication. Manual searches of older journals, textbooks, pest control trade journals, and newspapers (1892-October 2008) were also performed.

Study Selection

Original accounts or investigations of bed bugs, clinical responses with sufficient detail of cause and effect between the bed bug bite and clinical response, and convincing evidence of substantiated presence of bed bug exposure. For pest control, documentation that an eradication measure quantitatively decreased bed bugs.

Data Extraction

A trained medical reference librarian assisted with the literature search. Two authors with expertise in the diagnosis, treatment, and eradication of bed bugs reviewed the clinical articles. One author evaluated the pest control articles.

Data Synthesis

Fifty-three articles met inclusion criteria and were summarized. Only 2 clinical trials concerning bed bugs were identified and tested the ability of pest control interventions to eradicate bed bugs. Although transmission of more than 40 human diseases has been attributed to bed bugs, there is little evidence that they are vectors of communicable disease. A variety of clinical reactions to bed bugs have been reported, including cutaneous and rarely systemic reactions. A wide range of empirical treatments, including antibiotics, antihistamines, topical and oral corticosteroids, and epinephrine, have been used for bite reactions with varying results. No evidence-based interventions to eradicate bed bugs or prevent bites were identified.

Conclusions

Treatment options for cutaneous and systemic reactions from bed bug bites have not been evaluated in clinical trials and there is no evidence that outcomes differ significantly from those receiving no treatment. Evidence for disease transmission by bed bugs is lacking. Pest control and eradication is challenging due to insecticide resistance, lack of effective products, and health concerns about spraying mattresses with pesticides.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^1c8d126c]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Federal Strategy on Bed Bugs — this strategy advocates a logical, integrated approach to bed bug management with a focus on cooperation among all levels of government and communities, states that effective implementation should decrease costs to communities and achieve better bed bug control, and emphasizes that continuous measurements of progress will be key to efficient use of resources and essential to prevent the reoccurrence of widespread infestations in the United States.

### Joint statement on bed bug control in the United States from the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. environmental protection agency (EPA) [^82952a4b]. EPA/CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Integrated pest management for bed bugs — Integrated pest management (IPM) is described as "an effective and environmentally sensitive approach" that "uses current, comprehensive information on the life cycles of pests and their interaction with people and the environment", applying this with available methods "to manage pest damage by the most economical means, and with the least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment". Bed bug control is "most effective when an IPM approach is implemented with diligent participation by the residents", and in multi-family housing participation is "required of the building management". A comprehensive IPM program may include "using monitoring devices, removing clutter where bed bugs can hide, applying heat treatment, vacuuming, sealing cracks and crevices to remove hiding places, using non-chemical pesticides (such as diatomaceous earth) and judicious use of effective chemical pesticides". Although non-chemical means alone "may sometimes" control bed bugs, this approach is "often very difficult, potentially less effective, and usually more resource intensive". The document notes that "bed bug infestations will not go away without intervention", which "is most effective when populations are low", and that a coordinated community IPM program "can alleviate both the discomfort and cost of managing bed bugs". EPA and CDC "recommend that pest management and environmental health professionals throughout the U.S. continue to use IPM strategies as they address the bed bug issue".

Community bed bug control — public health, regulatory, and pesticide challenges note that when a community starts to experience bed bug infestations, control is often more challenging because local public health departments have very limited resources to combat this problem and bed bugs frequently are not seen as a priority; municipal codes struggle to identify those responsible for control of bed bug infestations, with disputes between tenants and landlords and high treatment costs and transient populations making it difficult or impossible to assign responsibility; pesticide resistance and limited control choices make treatment more difficult, with some bed bug populations resistant to almost all pesticides registered to treat them and residents using over-the-counter or homemade preparations that are ineffective or even dangerous and may promote further resistance; and pesticide misuse is a potential public health concern, as residents may use pesticides not intended for indoor residential use or apply registered products at greater application rates than the label allows, resulting in a much greater risk of pesticide exposure for those living in the home.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^d030c673]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Federal Strategy on Bed Bugs — workgroup research needs specify actions to strengthen control and prevention. Because both basic and applied research will provide the foundation for new, more effective control options, the workgroup recognizes the need to promote partnerships that leverage resources and expertise; integrate the results of peer-reviewed research into management programs through education, training and communications; further investigate potential health effects from bed bugs, including potential to trigger an allergic reaction; improve access to study sites and the potential use of human subjects; quantify the costs for control, prevention and the value of tailoring intervention efforts to unique communities; develop inexpensive, practical control and prevention protocols for residents owners and managers; improve access to research colonies, including field strains; and maintain defined strains of bed bugs with known resistance to insecticides.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^01474042]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Collaborative strategy on bed bugs — confirmation of infestation, integrated pest management (IPM) actions, and progress metrics are specified. Bed bugs can be difficult to differentiate from other common insects, and a qualified expert should confirm the presence of a bed bug infestation before control efforts begin; once a licensed pest control professional or other expert confirms the infestation, site occupants and staff follow the predetermined IPM plan to efficiently control the infestation, and if no IPM plan is in place, follow research-based recommendations available at EPA's bed bug website (www.epa.gov/bedbugs). The workgroup identified actions managers/owners/occupants and pest control professionals can take: Encourage discussions with a licensed pest control management company or other professional knowledgeable about the control of bed bugs about appropriate ways to quarantine infested items; Advocate for clear guidelines to minimize potential for bed bugs to develop resistance to pesticides; and Establish minimum acceptable standards for detecting an active infestation compared with a prior infestation. Measuring progress can include community or locality infestation rates; data showing availability and distribution of information and educational materials from the surveillance system, coupled with data showing increased knowledge of residents and housing employees; documentation showing a reduction in bed bug control expenses over time; documentation that monitors and resident surveys that show no activity for months after one or two treatments of an active infestation; and satisfaction surveys that show an increase in satisfaction.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^3ea9e28a]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Bed bug management when elimination is not feasible — containment and reduction steps: when complete elimination is not feasible, people living or working in an infested area can take steps to prevent the spread of this pest to new areas within the community and strive to reduce the bed bug population(s) as much as possible given the characteristics of the infested site, and in this way, local efforts in even the most difficult cases can contribute to the management of bed bugs throughout the community.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^382a9e2d]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Federal Strategy on Bed Bugs — nature of the problem outlines that bed bug infestations can occur in many settings, can be unknowingly transported on belongings, and may spread to adjacent rooms or housing units, with small isolated infestations easier to control while extensive, complex infestations can persist. The United States has recently seen increases in bed bug populations, and CDC and EPA issued a Joint Statement on Bed Bug Control in the United States. Documented consequences include reactions to bed bug bites ranging from no observable reaction to mild or severe allergic reactions, secondary infections of the skin, mental health implications for people living in infested homes, and time-consuming and expensive control measures. Management remains a major challenge for governments, industry, and the public, and this strategy provides guidance to help minimize negative effects on human health and the economy.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^6be65979]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Bed bug bites can result in clinical manifestations; the most common are small clusters of extremely pruritic, erythematous papules or wheals that represent repeated feedings by a single bed bug. Less common but more severe manifestations include grouped vesicles, giant urticaria, and hemorrhagic bullous eruptions. Bites should be managed symptomatically with topical emollients, topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, or some combination of these treatments.

Health professionals should be aware of this reemerging urban pest to facilitate prompt diagnosis of affected patients and treatment of the underlying environmental infestation. Bed bug bites must be differentiated from scabies, body lice, and other insect bites. Diagnostic clues include clustering and timing of bed bug bites. Unlike body lice, bed bugs are rarely found on affected persons or their clothing, and persons with good personal hygiene who enter an infested area are likely to be bitten.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^eec94dc2]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Bed bug research — measuring progress — notes that measuring research efforts is critical to evaluating and directing research funding, and that improvements in basic research can be measured by increases in publication of research outcomes in peer-reviewed journals, new patents, shared resources that can be used by the bed bug research community, research projects that contribute to solutions, and trained bed bug biologists. It adds that improvement in applied research may be indicated by transfers of intellectual property, translation of research into operational manuals and other sources of information for those who manage bed bugs, improved, more effective products available to the public and businesses, improved communication with the public and businesses, a current baseline of the problem, comparison of the outcome of interventions to a baseline, and new strategies for detection, prevention and control.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^5d81be80]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Collaborative strategy on bed bugs — stakeholders and shared information: stakeholders in the community who have an interest in bed bug control include schools, housing providers, social service providers, pest management firms, local businesses, law enforcement, and local public health departments, and communities can lower costs and improve bed bug control by working with all of their stakeholders to develop and share infestation rates, levels of resistance to specific pesticides, needs and existing resources to support underserved groups of people, and cultural considerations that potentially affect management efforts and recommendations. The federal government can help communities by providing information and educational materials based on the best scientific information and expert knowledge available, facilitating interactions among communities to leverage knowledge and experience, encouraging objective evaluations of interventions, and promoting research activities to improve prevention and control techniques.

---

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^970ae05d]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Bed bug control — conclusions on integrated pest management (IPM) and stakeholder roles — state that integrating several methods for controlling bed bugs in response to IPM surveillance data is likely to be more successful against bed bugs than application of any single method, and that reducing bed bug populations throughout a community provides an opportunity to reduce the probability of new infestations. With few exceptions, the federal government does not have a role in direct interventions against bed bugs, but it does have an important role in providing reliable information, coordinating stakeholders and providing resources for research to achieve long-term solutions, while many other stakeholders have been active in efforts to manage the bed bug problem. The page further notes that as improvements continue, indications are that IPM is the best approach in most situations, and that public awareness and dissemination of accurate information is helpful for earlier detection, greater chances of successful elimination of infestations, reduction in spread of infestations and more efficient use of resources.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^f69694e6]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Federal Strategy on Bed Bugs — surveillance, IPM, and evaluation — states that "The following types of data can show whether programs and activities are successfully preventing bed bug infestations:" including "Results of inspections such as bed bug numbers from monitoring devices, visual inspections, or numbers of locations where scent-detecting canines alert"; and "Increased knowledge or behavior change of participants completing training or receiving educational materials, as measured by polls and questionnaires". It explains that "Even if residents diligently engage in prevention activities, bed bugs can still infest an area and an infestation may become well established before anyone notices", and that "If an IPM plan is in place that details specific roles in dealing with an infestation, bed bug experts can stop the infestation before it becomes overwhelming". It notes that "In most cases, the longer an infestation remains unchecked, the harder and more expensive it will be to eliminate", and that "Reliable and cost-effective early detection methods and educational efforts can help communities by lowering overall treatment costs and reducing new infestations". It adds that "Effective site-specific IPM plans tailor educational efforts and procedures to the community" and that plans should address factors affecting effectiveness, including "Cultural considerations", "Availability of qualified bed bug control professionals", and "Pesticide and applicator availability".

### Joint statement on bed bug control in the United States from the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. environmental protection agency (EPA) [^970dc090]. EPA/CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Bed bug infestations — economic burden and control logistics emphasize that economically, bed bug infestations are a burden on society with substantial losses from health care, lost wages, lost revenue and reduced productivity, and that the cost of effectively eliminating bed bugs may be significantly more than for other pests because control usually requires multiple visits by a licensed pest control operator and diligence by those experiencing the infestation. Control in multi-family homes is much more difficult than in single family homes because bed bugs frequently travel between units by direct transport by humans or through voids in the walls, and there are additional costs and complexities associated with coordinating and encouraging participation from multiple residents.

### Bed bugs in healthcare settings [^811eb0a3]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2012). Low credibility.

Infestations caused by bed bugs have resurfaced during the past decade across all continents. Even though bed bugs primarily cause skin manifestations in humans, a major stigma is placed upon people or institutions found to carry them. It is important for healthcare facilities to be prepared for this pest by implementing policies, carefully selecting materials used for hospital furniture, and educating providers on early identification and control.

---

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^2011478d]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Integrated pest management (IPM) for bed bugs — surveillance, monitoring, and verification are emphasized, noting that identifying and planning for complicating factors when designing a site-specific IPM plan are important and that bed bug populations vary in their level of resistance to pesticide products. If pesticides are used to control bed bugs, it is critical to select those that will be effective against the infestation, and continuing to monitor for pests at the site being treated is a critical element of any IPM-based management program because monitoring provides an objective measure of progress toward the goal of eliminating the infestation. Bites alone are a very poor indicator of an infestation, so using community-wide surveillance to identify bed bug sources and how they move between residences can help target resources, and communities should use IPM best-management practices and reliable surveillance data to verify the presence of living bed bugs when there is a report of bed bugs. Bed bug sightings at schools can help identify potential infestations in the community; however, this information is very sensitive and should be handled discreetly.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^159a4d64]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Collaborative strategy on bed bugs — stakeholder collaboration and site-level actions highlight that community control efforts can be significantly improved when the community has access to quality resources and information, and the workgroup recognizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders to provide science-based information and educational materials about the importance of early detection, share success stories about management efforts, identify and promote research activities that may lead to reliable, portable and affordable detection methods, ensure that scientifically sound information is collected and made readily available to stakeholders about bed bugs including effective monitoring and control strategies and properly labeled chemical insecticides and related regulatory requirements, facilitate the incorporation of new discoveries into training, education and communication materials, and encourage funding for basic and applied research on bed bugs, bed bug biology, and effective control techniques and products, and conduct such research or facilitate funding where possible. Under actions to improve surveillance and IPM, by having an IPM plan for bed bugs in place, occupants and staff will be able to act quickly and confidently if they find bed bugs; those living or working at a property can conduct basic bed bug inspections as an added step to existing scheduled routines, which will help minimize costs; residents should not serve as the sole source for reporting bed bug infestations; inspecting every area at risk for bed bug infestation will help find bed bug infestations while they are still relatively easy to eliminate; and the frequency of such inspections should be part of the IPM plan, based on the local situation.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^b4600a8a]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Federal Strategy on Bed Bugs — prevention and IPM actions — lists practical measures including "Carefully inspecting all used clothing and furniture for bed bugs to avoid bringing them into the home"; "Choosing appropriate control techniques for treating existing infestations to increase effectiveness of treatment and to reduce movement of bugs into adjacent units"; and, in multifamily dwellings, "Encouraging managers or owners of multifamily dwellings, when possible, to invest in" washers/dryers on each floor and portable heating units. Additional steps include "Sealing cracks and crevices around baseboards, light sockets, etc., to discourage movement through wall voids"; "Encouraging managers of multifamily dwellings to install door sweeps on the bottom of doors to discourage movement into hallways"; and "Implementing IPM plans in high-risk settings (hostels, shelters, etc.), to encourage" "Inspecting and/or treating incoming personal belongings with a portable heat chamber; Routinely monitoring areas around where people sleep or rest; and Identifying and destroying reservoir populations whenever possible".

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^eade62b3]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Bed bug prevention — actions to improve prevention state that people living with bed bugs can take steps to reduce opportunities for bed bugs to migrate to new locations, and that by developing a strategy in advance people who travel or have jobs that may expose them to bed bugs can reduce the likelihood of bringing bed bugs home; integrating prevention strategies into IPM plans can help property owners and agents keep their buildings free of bed bugs. Education and communication are described as the foundation for effectively preventing bed bug infestations, with Priority Area IV (Education and Communication) providing more information, and the workgroup envisions prevention program modules including accurate identification of bed bugs, early detection of new or persistent infestations, sources for science-based technical information (particularly for high-risk settings), and open communication to foster collaboration rather than stigma. Creating a prevention program involves three main steps: minimizing movement of bed bugs to new locations; creating living spaces that are less receptive to bed bug infestations; and identifying and eliminating significant infestations that can serve as reservoirs for spreading bed bugs. The workgroup believes successful community programs will include preventing movement by treating existing infestations quickly and notifying all neighbors, and making areas less receptive by removing clutter, installing mattress and box spring encasements (if funds are severely limited, at least encase the box springs), installing, inspecting, and maintaining interception devices or traps, and providing clothes dryers hot enough to kill bed bugs. Additional actions named include examining the effectiveness of potential prevention techniques through research and other projects, establishing programs to inform employees about exposure recognition and response, continuing to inform HUD stakeholders about housing policy, and providing technical information and help when infestations occur in settings under federal oversight such as during disaster relief efforts or at military sites.

### Bed bug (spp.) colonization of human host [^74ac7f5b]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We present a unique case of a human acting as a host to a colony of bed bugs. Interestingly, the patient harbored the insects, yet did not exhibit any visible arthropod bites. The classic appearance of bed bug bites would be 2–5–mm pruritic, erythematous papules or vesicles with a central punctum on exposed skin areas. However, clinical presentation is highly variable, and some people will have no reaction at all to bites. Older adults may be less likely to have a reaction than younger adults. Our patient may have had no reaction to bites or desensitization from repeated bites, which might explain his lack of cutaneous lesions. His peripheral neuropathy may have prevented him from detecting the insects or feeling any pain or pruritus. His acute encephalopathy may have contributed to his lack of awareness of the infestation and inability to explain the findings.

In our patient, the source of his MRSA bacteremia could not be determined. An infectious disease team was consulted and suspected the skin or lungs as potential sources. Notably, necrotic tissue and a compromised skin barrier were present under the right great toenail, providing a potential source of his MRSA bacteremia. While colonization of Cimex lectularius with MRSA has been described, transmission of MRSA by bed bugs has not been demonstrated. A pulmonary source was also suspected. However, 2 bronchoscopies demonstrated negative cultures, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was negative.

We describe a treatment for bed bug colonization of human tissue. Manual debridement of the colony and treatment with isopropyl alcohol were the primary components of the intervention. The clinical implications of adding topical permethrin and oral ivermectin versus debridement alone are unclear. However, as pyrethroids are a main component of insecticides used to combat Cimex spp. permethrin can be deemed a reasonable, well-tolerated treatment for bed bug infestation in an inpatient setting or when barriers to followup exist. Ivermectin leads to paralysis and death of arthropods by interfering with neurotransmission. Ivermectin treatment has been described in the treatment of pediculosis capitis (head lice). In our patient, the benefit of ivermectin is unclear, and debridement with isopropyl alcohol was likely most effective.

### Cimex lectularius ("Bed bugs"): recognition, management, and eradication [^e7d19c39]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

Reports of bed bug infestations in major cities in the United States and abroad have been in the public press. Physicians and other clinicians who care for children need to be able to recognize bed bug bites and understand the social, psychological, and medical implications that this diagnosis will have on patients and their families. In this article, a case presentation serves to guide discussion regarding establishing the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and the management of bed bug bites and their complications. Integrated pest management programs involving housing managers, residents, and professional pest exterminators provide both chemical and nonchemical solutions for eradication of bed bug infestations.

CDC and EPA joint statement on bed bug control — resurgence and control approach: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed this document to highlight emerging public health issues associated with bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) in U.S. communities. The United States is experiencing an alarming resurgence of bed bug populations, which experts suspect is associated with increased resistance to available pesticides, greater international and domestic travel, lack of knowledge regarding control due to prolonged absence, and the decline or elimination of effective vector/pest control programs at state and local public health agencies. Public health agencies across the country have been overwhelmed by complaints about bed bugs, and an integrated approach involving federal, state, tribal and local public health professionals together with pest management professionals, housing authorities and private citizens will promote development and understanding of best methods for managing and controlling bed bugs and preventing future infestations. Research, training and public education are described as critical to an effective strategy for reducing public health issues associated with the resurgence of bed bug populations.

What is already known on this topic?

Head lice infestation is a significant public health problem affecting people irrespective of socioeconomic backgrounds.
Several interventions including insecticides, occlusive agents and physical methods are available for head lice treatment.

What this study hopes to add?

Despite the presence of several interventions, there is no reliable comparative data on the relative efficacy and safety of the interventions.
It is not well established whether the dose, formulation, number of treatments and duration of head lice interventions have any meaningful impact on treatment outcomes.
There is no strong evidence on the ovicidal activity of existing treatments.

### Joint statement on bed bug control in the United States from the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. environmental protection agency (EPA) [^4bc82587]. EPA/CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Bed bug control — role of U.S. government agencies and the public — includes coordinated federal, state, local, and community actions. CDC, EPA, and other federal agencies are working closely with state, tribal and local health departments, academia and private industries to monitor and understand the resurgence of bed bugs, and CDC is partnering with experts to support effective control while encouraging increased bed bug research due to very limited prior research. EPA's primary responsibility is to ensure pesticides with public health uses are safe and effective, carrying this out through rigorous scientific screening and registration limits to prevent harm to people or the environment. EPA recognizes growing pesticide resistance in some bed bug populations and is working with industry and researchers to identify new compounds, and it is educating the public, pest professionals, and public health officials about bed bug biology and IPM, which is critical to long-term control. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is funding research and education focused on low-income, multi-family housing. State, tribal, and local government agencies and health departments play a critical role in protecting the public. The public, together with local health agencies, must be involved in control and management and must be provided with knowledge of best practices; in some cases, a coordinated community control program may be necessary to reduce or eliminate bed bug populations.

### Bedbugs: how to diagnose and manage cases of infestations [^00cfa1cb]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Bedbugs are on the rise in urban populations across the world, perhaps reflecting the ban on the use of organophosphates in many countries worldwide. They are flat obligate haematophagous insects, preferring humans, and as a consequence the bedbug bites lack toxins and can often go unnoticed for some time. Bites can, however, cause weals, purpura, petechiae, vesicles, pustules, papular urticaria, localized infection and rarely anaphylaxis. Infestations have to be confirmed by finding the bugs, usually around the bed of the person being bitten. Eradication usually requires a combination of physical (for example high temperature, mattresses protectors, traps, cold) and chemical methods (for example chrysanthemic acid derivatives plus potentiators such as geraniol and piperonyl butoxide or acetylcholine esterase inhibitors).

Bed bugs — health effects and research gaps are outlined, noting that bed bugs cause a variety of negative physical and mental health consequences, and many people have mild to severe allergic reaction to bites with effects ranging from no reaction to a small bite mark to, in rare cases, anaphylaxis. These bites can also lead to secondary infections of the skin such as impetigo, ecthyma, and lymphangitis, and bed bugs may also affect the mental health of people living in infested homes with reported effects including anxiety, insomnia and systemic reactions. Research on the public health effects of bed bugs has been very limited over the past several decades, and with bed bug populations rapidly increasing, additional research is needed to determine the reasons for the resurgence, the potential for bed bugs to transmit disease and their impact on public health.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^9b76a5aa]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). High credibility.

Bed bugs — background, clinical relevance, and control — are described for residential settings. Bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) are reddish brown, wingless insects measuring 1–7 mm in length and hide in seams of mattresses, bedding, box springs, headboards, under peeling paint, picture frames, behind loose wallpaper, and other crevices in bedroom furniture. Clues of an infestation include brown or black stains or tiny blood spots on mattresses or furniture, and complaints of tiny skin bumps upon waking should raise suspicion. Over the past 30 years, reports have increased of bed bug infestations; bed bugs can be carried on suitcases, furniture, clothing, and other personal items and may also travel short distances by migrating along pipes or ventilation ducts. Bed bug bites often result in itchy red bumps that look similar to or slightly larger than mosquito bites and usually appear on body parts exposed during sleep; bed bugs have not been proven to transmit infectious diseases, individuals with bed bug bites are not contagious, and scratched skin can become secondarily infected with normal skin bacteria. Successful eradication is best accomplished by professionals who perform a thorough inspection and, if indicated, apply an insecticide, and more than one treatment with insecticide may be required.

### Bedbug infestation [^f7be6755]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

The significant resurgence of bedbugs in the past decade has been attributed to pesticide resistance, more frequent travel, lack of public awareness, and inadequate pest control programs. Bedbugs are obligate blood parasites (insect family Cimicidae). They can withstand a large range of temperatures but are attracted to warmth and carbon dioxide. They typically feed just before dawn. Cutaneous reactions to bedbug bites can include macules, papules, wheals, vesicles, bullae, and nodules. Bites may be confused with other skin conditions. Bedbug bite reactions are typically self-limited and resolve within one to two weeks without treatment. Bedbug infestation may cause significant psychological distress. The diagnosis of a bedbug infestation is based on history, appearance of bites, and inspection of sleeping quarters. Although there is no evidence that bedbugs transmit disease, systemic reactions may include asthma, angioedema, generalized urticaria, iron deficiency anemia, and, rarely, anaphylaxis. An integrated pest management strategy should be employed to eliminate infestation. Tactics include vacuuming, heat or cold treatment, trapping devices, and pesticides.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^9175fe0f]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study delineates the broad extent of a recent resurgence of bed bug infestations in an urban environment. In light of anecdotal reports from other localities, we believe that this phenomenon is likely occurring in cities across North America and Europe. The reasons for this resurgence are unknown, although some reports have suggested a role for increasing world travel, reluctance to use insecticides because of concerns regarding toxicity, and insecticide resistance. Although initial reports in Toronto indicated that bed bug infestations were occurring primarily in homeless shelters, our study showed that bed bugs are found in a wide variety of locations in the urban environment, including single-family dwellings, apartments, and rooming houses.

Data from public health officials and pest control operators provided markedly different perspectives on the extent and localization of infestations. This difference may reflect a tendency for persons experiencing bed bug infestations in single-family dwellings to rely on pest control operators, whereas apartment dwellers and homeless shelter staff may be more likely to contact public health authorities. The Toronto experience indicates that these calls place a substantial time demand on public health personnel, who in many cities are already struggling with limited resources.

Our data suggest that bed bugs can spread from shelter to shelter, presumably transported in the personal belongings of residents. At an affected homeless shelter, 4% of residents reported having bed bug bites; given the constant turnover of shelter residents, bed bugs could potentially affect a large number of homeless people over the course of a year. In our clinical experience, homeless persons with bed bug bites suffer a substantial degree of emotional distress.

Infestations in shelters are difficult and costly to eradicate. Our observation of a high mean number of pest control treatments per affected location (Table 1) points to the likelihood that infestations will be difficult to control in other communal living settings and in hotels. The pest control literature emphasizes the importance of combining insecticide treatments with environmental measures such as daily laundering of bed linens, vacuuming rooms, and steam cleaning and vacuuming mattresses. Bed bugs can be destroyed by freezing or by heat treatments at temperatures > 50°C, but these methods are inconvenient to implement

Bed bug detection with canine teams — program considerations note that dogs can be successfully used as part of a program for early detection of bed bugs or to verify elimination, but success depends on how well both the handler and the dog have been trained and how well they work together as a team; success is most easily achieved if the dog and/or team are certified by a nationally recognized association, the resident recognizes that dogs are not perfect in detecting bed bugs and a positive identification by a dog should always be confirmed by a visual inspection before beginning treatment and a negative result should also be confirmed by another monitoring technique, and the hired team is a professional dog/handler team with a proven track record; the federal government has no oversight or advisory role for bed bug surveillance by dog/handler teams, although several states have begun programs to require training, licensing or certification for dog teams.

### Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations: a review [^1437fcba]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are caused by organisms that live on or in the skin, on clothing, or in the environment and commonly cause pruritus and rash. In 2021, approximately 622 million incident cases of scabies occurred globally. Data on bedbug infestations are limited. Body lice prevalence ranges from 4.1% to 35% among persons experiencing homelessness worldwide.

Observations

Scabies is caused by mites (Sarcoptes scabiei) that burrow into the epidermis. Transmission primarily occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an individual who has an infestation. Common scabies is characterized by excoriated pruritic papules, plaques, and pathognomonic burrows on finger/toe web spaces, volar wrists, ankles, axillae, buttocks, male genitalia, and areolae. Permethrin cream and oral ivermectin are first-line treatments for adults, with similar clearance rates by week 2 (74% with permethrin vs 68% with ivermectin; relative risk, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76–1.08). Treatment failure can occur with oral ivermectin (11.8%; 95% CI, 8.4%-15.4%) and topical permethrin (10.8%; 95% CI, 7.5%-14.5%). Bedbugs (Cimex lectularius, Cimex hemipterus) are insects that live on mattresses and furniture and feed on blood nocturnally, causing linear pruritic erythematous papules. New skin lesions on waking, cohabitants with similar symptoms, and recently residing in a high-occupancy setting should raise suspicion. Treatment requires eradication with pest management. Body lice (Pediculus humanus humanus) are insects found on clothing that travel to the skin for blood meals. Body lice bites cause pruritic excoriated macules/papules and hyperpigmentation in areas where clothing seams contact skin. Treatment and prevention require at least once-weekly bathing and laundering of clothing and bedding.

Conclusions and Relevance

Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations are common. Accurate diagnosis requires taking a history, including social drivers of health (eg, housing status, living environment), and physical examination. First-line treatments include scabicides for patients with common scabies and their close contacts. Scabies, bedbug, and body lice infestations should be treated with decontamination measures.

### Bedbugs and infectious diseases [^47348cbc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Bedbug eradication from an infested site is a challenge: Insecticide resistance has been demonstrated experimentally and is an increasing problem. Successful bedbug elimination relies mainly on good cooperation between the owner of the pest-infested site and the pest manager for site assessment, thorough inspection, identification, and eradication. An "efficient search-and-destroy" operation, as Doggett explained, must be imposed, starting by removing all bed linens and washing at a temperature > 60°C, then by checking and dismantling all furniture to access all bedbug hiding places, to identify and destroy eggs, nymphs, and adults (Figures 4 A –4 F). Alternatively, a dog specifically trained to detect bedbugs' characteristic odor can do the search. Attractive traps can also be used in highly infested locations. It is always best to vacuum first to reduce the overall bedbug population, but complete success is unlikely without remnant insecticides for residual protection against bedbug survivors. Fumigants, which are too frequently used by nonprofessionals, do not penetrate deeply into bedbug hiding places, fail to provide any residual protection, and can pose an immediate health risk to the user. Aerosolized insecticides against cockroaches, for example, are quick killing agents that can be accurately applied meticulously to specific areas (eg, mattress or cracks and crevices in furniture). The best option is a remnant insecticide, which is spread by a professional in all hiding areas identified during the inspection process. Sometimes, it may be advisable to treat adjoining rooms, even when no bedbugs were found during the inspection. Some methods can minimize the risk of infestation or expansion: regular inspections, hygiene procedures, and general education of the population. Complementary measures include modifying room temperature, destroying nearby bat or bird habitats, eliminating peeling paint and plaster, and caulking cracks and crevices in walls and furniture.

### Acute illnesses associated with insecticides used to control bed bugs – seven states, 2003–2010 [^1ad10a7e]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

The common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, is a wingless, reddish-brown insect that requires blood meals from humans, other mammals, or birds to survive. Bed bugs are not considered to be disease vectors, but they can reduce quality of life by causing anxiety, discomfort, and sleeplessness. Bed bug populations and infestations are increasing in the United States and internationally. Bed bug infestations often are treated with insecticides, but insecticide resistance is a problem, and excessive use of insecticides or use of insecticides contrary to label directions can raise the potential for human toxicity. To assess the frequency of illness from insecticides used to control bed bugs, relevant cases from 2003–2010 were sought from the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks (SENSOR)-Pesticides program and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH). Cases were identified in seven states: California, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, New York, Texas, and Washington. A total of 111 illnesses associated with bed bug-related insecticide use were identified; although 90 (81%) were low severity, one fatality occurred. Pyrethroids, pyrethrins, or both were implicated in 99 (89%) of the cases, including the fatality. The most common factors contributing to illness were excessive insecticide application, failure to wash or change pesticide-treated bedding, and inadequate notification of pesticide application. Although few cases of illnesses associated with insecticides used to control bed bugs have been reported, recommendations to prevent this problem from escalating include educating the public about effective bed bug management.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^d67a1c71]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Until recently, bed bugs have been considered uncommon in the industrialized world. This study determined the extent of reemerging bed bug infestations in homeless shelters and other locations in Toronto, Canada. Toronto Public Health documented complaints of bed bug infestations from 46 locations in 2003, most commonly apartments (63%), shelters (15%), and rooming houses (11%). Pest control operators in Toronto (N = 34) reported treating bed bug infestations at 847 locations in 2003, most commonly single-family dwellings (70%), apartments (18%), and shelters (8%). Bed bug infestations were reported at 20 (31%) of 65 homeless shelters. At 1 affected shelter, 4% of residents reported having bed bug bites. Bed bug infestations can have an adverse effect on health and quality of life in the general population, particularly among homeless persons living in shelters.

Bed bugs

Background

Bed bugs (Cimex lectularis) are reddish brown, wingless, insects measuring 1–7 mm in length. During the day, bed bugs hide in the seams of mattresses, bedding, box springs, headboards, under carpets, and behind loose wallpaper and at night they feed on the blood of sleeping humans. Clues of a possible bed bug infestation include a sweet, musty odor in the space and rust-colored blood spots on mattresses or furniture. Complaints of finding itchy skin bumps upon waking should raise suspicion of a bed bug infestation.

Over the past 30 years, reports have increased of bed bug infestations in homes, hotel rooms, apartments, dormitories, and hospitals. Bed bugs can be carried on suitcases, furniture, clothing, and other personal items. Clothing and luggage can spread bed bugs from one infested room to another because they can be carried on suitcases, furniture, clothing, and other personal items. Bed bugs may also travel short distances (i.e. room to room or apartment to apartment) by migrating along pipes or ventilation ducts.

Bed bug bites often result in itchy red bumps that look similar to or slightly larger than mosquito bites. They usually appear on parts of the body exposed during sleeping. Not all people bitten by bed bugs develop a skin reaction, which is an allergic response.

Bed bugs have not been proven to transmit infectious diseases but occasionally skin that has been scratched will become secondarily infected with bacteria that normally live on the skin. Individuals with bed bug bites are not contagious.

Practical guidance exists for prevention and management of bed bugs in group living facilities. Guidelines by Gangloff-Kaufmann et al include photos of bed bugs at different life stages and detailed instructions for carrying out inspections.

Successful eradication of bed bugs is best accomplished by professionals who perform a thorough inspection and, if indicated, apply an insecticide. More than one treatment with insecticide may be required.

### Collaborative strategy on bed bugs [^7ddddf4c]. CDC (2015). Medium credibility.

Bed bug biology and inspection targets for integrated pest management (IPM) highlight that research into basic bed bug biology and behavior shows certain characteristics are common to all bed bugs and that focusing detection efforts on these characteristics can help reduce costs, including that the majority of bed bugs are found in or near sleeping and resting areas and as an infestation grows within an apartment or home, bed bugs will travel to other locations, making it more difficult, time consuming and expensive to pinpoint every infested area; because bed bugs can move between housing units, the best IPM practice is to inspect adjacent areas or units, units above and below the infested unit, and units across the hall, and if a unit is vacant, bed bugs may behave differently (for example, by becoming inactive or more active during the day) while waiting for a new host to arrive; although not preferred hosts, pets and rodents serve as alternate hosts in some circumstances and having these additional hosts can greatly increase the chances of the bugs' survival.

IPM and community efforts — coordinated involvement and organization: communities cannot expect to effectively manage bed bugs without coordinated community involvement using the principles of Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and IPM is an effective and safe approach to pest management that relies on a combination of common-sense practices that present the least possible hazard to people, property and the environment. An IPM approach is especially critical to control in multifamily housing, lodging and institutional facilities, and to manage bed bugs at the local level, communities need the capacity to coordinate prevention, surveillance, IPM, education, and communication activities. Bed bug action committees made up of recognized and respected leaders can be an effective way to organize collaborative local efforts, and the state's IPM Coordinator may be a source of information about groups doing bed bug work in the state.

To support prevention, the workgroup recognizes the need for increasing general awareness through outreach and education programs, increasing accessibility to bed bug information through a dedicated website (www.epa.gov/bedbugs), and facilitating communities' ability to educate stakeholders about prevention through the website's clearinghouse.

### Bedbugs [^d02786e7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2009). Low credibility.

Cimex lectularius (the "bedbug") is an insect that feeds nocturnally, taking a requisite blood meal from a sleeping human or other parasitized host. Immunological reactions to bedbug saliva vary, but typically, bites yield erythematous and pruritic papules. The face and distal extremities, areas uncovered by sleeping clothes or blankets, are preferentially involved. Until the late 1990s, bedbug infestations in the United States were declining. Resurgence is attributed to increased travel and resistance to insecticides. Although hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus is not effectively transmitted by the bedbug, pruritus and the fear and perceived violation of an infestation can be debilitating. Bedbugs are small but robust, and their ability to remain ensconced in crevices within the bedroom makes eradication difficult. As more patients present with bedbug bites, physicians must possess the knowledge to diagnose, treat, and educate with regard to bedbug bites and bedbug infestations.

### A door-to-door survey of bed bug (cimex lectularius) infestations in row homes in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania [^2baf6ee1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

We conducted a door-to-door survey in a residential census tract of Philadelphia to estimate the prevalence and spatial patterns of recent bed bug infestations. We interviewed 596 residents, of whom 66 (11.1%) reported recent bed bug infestations. We confirmed current infestations in a subset of 15 (68.2%) of 22 inspected households. Most residents reported that their infestation began within the past year (2012–2013). We found no correlation between property value and infestation status. Spatial analyses showed significant clustering of bed bug infestations only at fine scales, suggesting limited active dispersal of the insects. Residents used a large variety of treatment methods to eliminate bed bugs, but only 48.1% reported success. Our results provide a prevalence estimate of recent bed bug infestations and highlight the importance of passive rather than active dispersal of bed bugs even among dense urban row homes.

Impact of bed bugs on public health — disease transmission and classification: Although bed bugs are not known to transmit disease, they are a pest of significant public health importance. Bed bugs fit into a category of blood-sucking ectoparasites similar to head lice and, while they feed on the blood of humans, they are not believed to transmit disease. In contrast, other ectoparasites such as body lice (Pediculus humanus corporis) are known to transmit several serious diseases, and differences in the biology of similar species can greatly impact the ability of pests to transmit disease.

Recommendations

If a family-centered residential facility suspects a bed bug infestation, instruct families to inspect bedding, mattresses, luggage, clothing, and other belongings for the presence of bed bugs.
If bed bugs are present, the facility should: Notify its affiliated healthcare facility to have it assess relevant inpatient rooms for infestation. Wash and dry clothing and bedding at hot temperatures. Seal items that are not amenable to washing and drying in a plastic bag and remove them from the facility. Consider pursuing professional inspection and evaluation for treatment with insecticide. Perform serial room inspections after taking these measures.
If inspection finds one room is infested, the facility should inspect other rooms based on the guidance of a pest-elimination specialist. In some locales, it is typical to inspect rooms above, below, and on either side of a room with a bed bug infestation.
Adjunctive control measures include: Vacuuming (when bed bugs have been identified, use a HEPA-equipped vacuum that is dedicated only to pest control) Reducing clutter where bed bugs could hide Eliminating peeling paint and plaster and caulking cracks and crevices in wall and furniture that could harbor bedbugs Encasing mattresses and box springs in protective covers.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^bdb50a79]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Although bed bugs could theoretically act as a disease vector, as is the case with body lice, which transmit Bartonella quintana (the causal agent of trench fever) among homeless persons, bed bugs have never been shown to transmit disease in vivo. Hepatitis B viral DNA can be detected in bed bugs up to 6 weeks after they feed on infectious blood, but no transmission of hepatitis B infection was found in a chimpanzee model. Transmission of hepatitis C is unlikely, since hepatitis C viral RNA is not detectable in bed bugs after an infectious blood meal. Live HIV can be recovered from bed bugs up to 1 hour after they feed on infected blood, but no epidemiologic evidence for HIV transmission by this route exists.

This study has certain limitations. Shelter data were based on self-reports from staff at affected shelters. Although we obtained data from multiple informants at each shelter when possible, we did not independently verify the accuracy of these reports. Affected shelters represented 30% of shelter beds in Toronto, but our methods did not determine how many rooms or beds within each shelter were affected. Shelter residents' reports of having bed bug bites were not independently confirmed, and some of these persons may have had other types of insect bites or delusions of parasitosis. The method we used to survey pest control operators may have resulted in double-counting locations that obtained treatments for bed bugs from > 1 pest control operator in 2003. As a result, the number of affected locations may be overestimated. Furthermore, the reliability of reports from pest control operators is uncertain. Finally, our results, based on calls to public health and pest control operators, reflect self-initiated complaints from affected locations and therefore do not provide population-based data on the prevalence of bed bug infestations.

In conclusion, our study documents the broad extent of bed bug infestations in an urban environment. This problem could have substantial adverse effect on health and quality of life, particularly among persons who use homeless shelters. Physicians should be aware of the typical dermatologic signs and symptoms of bed bug bites, which may become increasingly common in the future. Further research is needed to determine the geographic extent of the current reemergence of bed bugs in the industrialized world and the prevalence and risk factors for bed bug infestations in the general population, including those living in both congregate and noncongregate housing.

### Pediculosis and scabies: treatment update [^85858496]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Pediculosis and scabies are caused by ectoparasites. Pruritus is the most common presenting symptom. Head and pubic lice infestations are diagnosed by visualization of live lice. Finding nits (louse egg shells) alone indicates a historical infestation. A "no nit" policy for schools and day care centers no longer is recommended because nits can persist after successful treatment with no risk of transmission. First-line pharmacologic treatment of pediculosis is permethrin 1% lotion or shampoo. Multiple novel treatments have shown limited evidence of effectiveness superior to permethrin. Wet combing is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment option. Finding pubic lice should prompt an evaluation for other sexually transmitted infections. Body lice infestation should be suspected when a patient with poor hygiene presents with pruritus. Washing affected clothing and bedding is essential if lice infestation is found, but no other environmental decontamination is necessary. Scabies in adults is recognized as a pruritic, papular rash with excoriations in a typical distribution pattern. In infants, children, and immunocompromised adults, the rash also can be vesicular, pustular, or nodular. First-line treatment of scabies is topical permethrin 5% cream. Clothing and bedding of persons with scabies should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer.

Shelters implemented a number of environmental control measures (Table 2). To control bed bugs, 6 shelters (35%) made substantial building repairs, including removing floorboards, baseboards, or wood trim; replacing carpets; sealing floor cracks; and painting wooden floors. Two shelters (12%) installed additional washers and dryers to deal with increased laundry demands. The total cost incurred for bed bug control efforts at affected shelters was U.S.$150–$15,000, with a mean of U.S.$3,085 per affected shelter.

### Joint statement on bed bug control in the United States from the U.S. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) and the U.S. environmental protection agency (EPA) [^ba91b4b5]. EPA/CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Bed bug biology — description, habitats, signs, and bite characteristics are detailed, noting that bed bugs are small, flat insects that feed on the blood of sleeping people and animals, are reddish-brown, wingless, range from 1 to 7 millimeters in length, and can live several months without a blood meal. Infestations usually occur around or near areas where people sleep, with hiding places including seams of mattresses, box springs, bed frames, headboards, dresser tables, cracks or crevices, behind wallpaper, and clutter; bed bugs can travel over 100 feet in one night but tend to live within 8 feet of where people sleep. They are usually transported as people travel, in the seams and folds of luggage, overnight bags, folded clothes, bedding, furniture, and other hiding places. Identification clues include bite marks that may take as long as 14 days to develop in some people, plus exoskeletons after molting, bed bugs in mattress folds and sheets, a sweet musty odor, and rusty-colored blood spots from blood-filled fecal material on mattresses or nearby furniture. When bed bugs bite, they inject an anesthetic and an anticoagulant, so most people do not realize they have been bitten until marks appear; bite marks are similar to those of a mosquito or a flea, are slightly swollen and red, may itch and be irritating, and may be random or appear in a straight line. Other symptoms of bed bug bites include insomnia, anxiety, and skin problems from profuse scratching. Everyone is at risk when visiting an infested area, and anyone who travels frequently and shares living and sleeping quarters where others have previously slept has an increased risk for being bitten and for spreading an infestation.

### Bed bug detection: current technologies and future directions [^59dfbc5b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2013). Low credibility.

Technologies to detect bed bugs have not kept pace with their global resurgence. Early detection is critical to prevent infestations from spreading. Detection based exclusively on bites is inadequate, because reactions to insect bites are non-specific and often misdiagnosed. Visual inspections are commonly used and depend on identifying live bugs, exuviae, or fecal droplets. Visual inspections are inexpensive, but they are time-consuming and unreliable when only a few bugs are present. Use of a dog to detect bed bugs is gaining in popularity, but it can be expensive, may unintentionally advertise a bed bug problem, and is not foolproof. Passive monitors mimic natural harborages; they are discreet and typically use an adhesive to trap bugs. Active monitors generate carbon dioxide, heat, a pheromone, or a combination to attract bed bugs to a trap. New technologies using DNA analysis, mass spectrometry, and electronic noses are innovative but impractical and expensive for widespread use.

### Recognition and management of common ectoparasitic diseases in travelers [^6b15cea8]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

This review article summarizes the ectoparasitic diseases likely to be seen by a Western dermatologist. The article aims to cover both endemic diseases and those likely to present in the returning traveler. Tungiasis is due to the gravid sand flea (Tunga penetrans) embedding into the stratum corneum of a human host. As the flea is a ground dweller, lesions are usually present on the feet and are classically periungual. The sand flea is eventually shed spontaneously but to reduce the infection risk, early surgical removal is recommended. Infestation by the Diptera species of fly causes myiasis, which may be primary, secondary, or accidental. The botfly (Dermatobia hominis) is one of the causes of primary myiasis covered in this article. Traditionally, botfly larvae are forced to partially emerge by occluding the breathing apparatus, following which manual extraction can occur. Alternatively, the larvae can be surgically removed. The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) has experienced a resurgence over the past 10 years. Bites are typically arranged in clusters or a linear fashion and vary from urticated wheals to hemorrhagic blisters. Treatment is symptomatic with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. In addition, bed bugs need to be eradicated from furniture and soft furnishings. Ticks are part of the Arachnid class of joint-legged animals and can transmit a variety of infections. This article briefly discusses Mediterranean spotted fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease as well as describing tick avoidance measures. Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis) is highly contagious and widely distributed around the world. It is common in the returning traveler and can require a high index of suspicion to diagnose. The treatment of choice in the US, UK, and Australia is permethrin 5% dermal cream, applied on two occasions, 1 week apart.

### Case not closed: arguments for new studies of the interactions between bed bugs and human pathogens [^ab6305df]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Bed bugs (Cimex spp.) are common ectoparasites of humans. Their ubiquity across diverse human environments combined with their blood-feeding behavior creates an ideal interface for the transmission of pathogenic microbes. Despite this potential, the current dogma is that bed bugs are not vectors of any known infectious agents. However, this conclusion is based largely on the results of studies conducted before the advent of modern molecular biology and the resurgence of bed bugs on a global scale. More importantly, a small but compelling body of modern research suggesting that bed bugs can potentially vector some human pathogens exists but is often overlooked. This article critically examines the current classification of the bed bug as an insect that does not transmit disease agents. In doing so, it highlights key knowledge gaps that still exist in understanding the potential of bed bugs as pathogen vectors and outlines several arguments for why new research on the topic is necessary.

### Bed bug (spp.) colonization of human host [^feeabbf4]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The Cimex subspecies, colloquially known as bed bugs, include Cimex lectularius (the common bed bug) and Cimex hemipterus (the tropical bed bug). These nest-dwelling arthropods notoriously colonize mattress seams, cracks in bed frames, and wall crevices of homes and hotels. In contrast to the human louse and scabies mite, which spend nearly their entire life cycle on human skin, bed bugs do not typically colonize humans.

Herein, we present a unique case of a male patient acting as a human host for a colony of bed bugs. Although the patient served as a harborage site, he did not exhibit any visible arthropod bites. We also outline an intervention used to eradicate the infestation.

### Insecticide-treated nets for preventing malaria [^f22e0835]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

A previous version of this Cochrane Review identified that insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are effective at reducing child mortality, parasite prevalence, and uncomplicated and severe malaria episodes. Insecticide-treated nets have since become a core intervention for malaria control and have contributed greatly to the dramatic decline in disease incidence and malaria-related deaths seen since the turn of the millennium. However, this time period has also seen a rise in resistance to pyrethroids (the insecticide used in ITNs), raising questions over whether the evidence from trials conducted before resistance became widespread can be applied to estimate the impact of ITNs on malaria transmission today.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the impact of ITNs on mortality and malaria morbidity, incorporating any evidence published since the previous update into new and existing analyses, and assessing the certainty of the resulting evidence using GRADE.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the ISRCTN registry for new trials published since 2004 and up to 18 April 2018.

Selection Criteria

We included individual randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs comparing bed nets or curtains treated with a synthetic pyrethroid insecticide at a minimum target impregnation dose recommended by the WHO with no nets or untreated nets.

Data Collection and Analysis

One review author assessed the identified trials for eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We compared intervention and control data using risk ratios (RRs), rate ratios, and mean differences, and presented all results with their associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We drew on evidence from a meta-analysis of entomological outcomes stratified by insecticide resistance from 2014 to inform the GRADE assessments.

Main Results

Our updated search identified three new trials. A total of 23 trials met the inclusion criteria, enrolling more than 275,793 adults and children. The included studies were conducted between 1987 and 2001. ITN versus no netsInsecticide-treated nets reduce child mortality from all causes by 17% compared to no nets (rate ratio 0.83, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.89; 5 trials, 200,833 participants, high-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a saving of 5.6 lives (95% CI 3.6 to 7.6) each year for every 1000 children protected with ITNs. Insecticide-treated nets also reduce the incidence of uncomplicated episodes of Plasmodium falciparum malaria by almost a half (rate ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.64; 5 trials, 35,551 participants, high-certainty evidence) and probably reduce the incidence of uncomplicated episodes of Plasmodium vivax malaria (risk ratio (RR) 0.61, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.77; 2 trials, 10,967 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). Insecticide-treated nets were also shown to reduce the prevalence of P falciparum malaria by 17% compared to no nets (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; 6 trials, 18,809 participants, high-certainty evidence) but may have little or no effect on the prevalence of P vivax malaria (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.34; 2 trials, 10,967 participants, low-certainty evidence). A 44% reduction in the incidence of severe malaria episodes was seen in the ITN group (rate ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.82; 2 trials, 31,173 participants, high-certainty evidence), as well as an increase in mean haemoglobin (expressed as mean packed cell volume) compared to the no-net group (mean difference 1.29, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.16; 5 trials, 11,489 participants, high-certainty evidence). ITN versus untreated netsInsecticide-treated nets probably reduce child mortality from all causes by a third compared to untreated nets (rate ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.23; 2 trials, 25,389 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). This corresponds to a saving of 3.5 lives (95% CI -2.4 to 6.8) each year for every 1000 children protected with ITNs. Insecticide-treated nets also reduce the incidence of uncomplicated P falciparum malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.78; 5 trials, 2036 participants, high-certainty evidence) and may also reduce the incidence of uncomplicated P vixax malaria episodes (rate ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.05; 3 trials, 1535 participants, low-certainty evidence). Use of an ITN probably reduces P falciparum prevalence by one-tenth in comparison to use of untreated nets (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.05; 3 trials, 2,259 participants, moderate-certainty evidence). However, based on the current evidence it is unclear whether or not ITNs impact on P vivax prevalence (1 trial, 350 participants, very low certainty evidence) or mean packed cell volume (2 trials, 1,909 participants, low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Although there is some evidence that insecticide resistance frequency has some effects on mosquito mortality, it is unclear how quantitatively important this is. It appeared insufficient to downgrade the strong evidence of benefit on mortality and malaria illness from the trials conducted earlier.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^848ea099]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Toronto Public Health and Pest Control Operators Survey

The log of telephone calls made in 2003 to Toronto Public Health was reviewed to identify calls related to bed bug infestations, the types of locations affected, and the regions of the city where infestations were reported. Toronto is divided into 4 public health regions (north, east, south, and west); the south region includes the downtown core of the city. The population of each region was determined from 2001 census data and ranged from 500,000 to 700,000.

A telephone survey of all pest control operators listed in the Toronto telephone directory was conducted using a structured interview. The survey documented the number of bed bug–related calls received, the number of treatments provided by pest control operators in 2003, and the types of insecticides used to treat bed bug infestations. To protect the confidentiality of persons and establishments affected by bed bugs, we asked each pest control operator to report the number of different locations treated for bed bug infestations by general type (e.g. apartment, single-family dwelling, shelter) and not by specific name or address.

Survey of Homeless Shelter Staff

A telephone interview of the director or supervisor at each homeless shelter in Toronto was conducted to determine which shelters had experienced bed bug infestations. Interviewees were assured that the information they provided would be reported in a way that would not identify their shelter. At affected shelters, follow-up, in-person interviews were conducted with staff from December 2003 to May 2004. A predefined strategy was used to select shelter managers, front-line staff, and healthcare professionals for interviews. The questionnaire included items on time course, manifestations, and extent of the infestation; control measures undertaken; and effects of the infestation on shelter residents and staff. Bed bug infestations were considered confirmed if an entomologist or pest control operator identified a specimen collected at the shelter as C. lectularius. Infestations were considered probable if shelter staff reported resident complaints consistent with bed bug infestations.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^cc31f828]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Results

Calls to Toronto Public Health

In 2003, Toronto Public Health received insect-related calls from 82 different street addresses; 46 were complaints of bed bug infestations, 11 were requests for information about bed bugs, and 25 were unrelated to bed bugs. The 46 separate locations where infestations were reported are shown in Table 1. In response to these calls, public health staff spent a total of 27 hours providing information, and health inspectors spent a total of 78 hours conducting site visits to confirm complaints and offer assistance. More complaints of infestations were received in the last 6 months (31 calls) than in the first 6 months (15 calls) of 2003. In the south region, which includes the downtown core of the city, 4.7 complaint calls were received per 100,000 population; this rate was 6.1 times higher (95% confidence intervals [CI] 3.3–11.4) than the rate in the rest of the city. A total of 32 complaints (70%) were from locations in the south region.

Reports of bed bug infestations in Toronto, 2003

*Figures in this column may reflect some double counting of locations (see details in Methods section).
†Infestation located at the clothing bank in a community center.

Survey of Pest Control Operators

We interviewed 34 (89%) of 38 pest control operators listed in the Toronto phonebook; 20 (59%) had provided treatments for bed bugs in 2003. Among these pest control operators, 17 (85%) of 20 reported that they had received an increased number of calls related to bed bugs and had provided more treatments for bed bugs in 2003 than in 2002. The number of locations treated by pest control operators in 2003 and the number of treatments required are shown in Table 1. The mean number of treatments required per affected location was highest at dormitories, hotels, homeless shelters, and rooming houses.

### Psychological effects of bed bug attacks (cimex lectularius L.) [^a6a3c46e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In some individuals, psychological sequelae resulting from bed bug biting events include nightmares, flashbacks, hypervigilance (to keep the bugs away), insomnia, anxiety, avoidance behaviors, and personal dysfunction. These symptoms are suggestive of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Methods

We used a previously published PTSD checklist to analyze online blogs and other Internet sites where bed bug postings occur to assess postings for evidence of emotional trauma.

Results

One hundred thirty-five postings were read and analyzed, and 110 (81%) of those postings reported psychological effects from bed bug infestations. Scoring with the PTSD checklist revealed a range of 0–52 (mean 13.25; SD 9.38); one met the criteria (≥ 50) considered positive for PTSD.

Conclusions

Based upon our survey of online postings concerning such effects, an as-yet-to-be-determined proportion of individuals who experience bed bug bites develop moderate-to-severe negative emotional symptoms after infestations. These individuals should be identified in the course of their interactions with health professionals so that appropriate mental health care may be provided.

### Interventions for treating headlice [^11630ac1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Infection with head lice is a widespread condition in developed and developing countries. Infection occurs most commonly in children, but also affects adults. If left untreated the condition can become intensely irritating and skin infections may occur if the bites are scratched.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess the effects of interventions for head lice.

Search Strategy

Trials register of The Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group; Medline; Embase; Science Citation Index; Biosis and Toxline; reference lists of relevant articles; pharmaceutical companies producing pediculicides (published and unpublished trials); UK and US Regulatory Authorities.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials (published and unpublished) or trials using alternate allocation were sought which compared pediculicides with the same and different formulations of other pediculicides, and pediculicides with physical methods.

Data Collection and Analysis

Of the 71 identified studies, only four met the inclusion criteria. Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. One reviewer extracted the data.

Main Results

We found no evidence that any one pediculicide has greater effect than another. The two studies comparing malathion and permethrin with their respective vehicles showed a higher cure rate for the active ingredient than the vehicle. Another study comparing synergised pyrethrins with permethrin showed their effects to be equivalent. A comparative trial of malathion lotion vs combing, showed combing to be ineffective for the cureative treatment of head lice infection. Adverse effects were reported in a number of trials and were all minor, although reporting quality varied between trials.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Permethrin, synergised pyrethrin and malathion were effective in the treatment of head lice. However, the emergence of drug resistance since these trials were conducted means there is no direct contemporary evidence of the comparative effectiveness of these products. The 'best' choice will now depend on local resistance patterns. Physical treatment methods(BugBusting) were shown ot be ineffective to treat head lice. No evidence exists regarding other chemical control methods such as the use of herbal treatments, when used in the curative treatment of head lice. Future trials should take into account the methodological recommendations that arise from this review.

### Quantifying the direct and indirect protection provided by insecticide treated bed nets against malaria [^77158476]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) provide both direct and indirect protection against malaria. As pyrethroid resistance evolves in mosquito vectors, it will be useful to understand how the specific benefits LLINs afford individuals and communities may be affected. Here we use modelling to show that there is no minimum LLIN usage needed for users and non-users to benefit from community protection. Modelling results also indicate that pyrethroid resistance in local mosquitoes will likely diminish the direct and indirect benefits from insecticides, leaving the barrier effects intact, but LLINs are still expected to provide enhanced benefit over untreated nets even at high levels of pyrethroid resistance.

### Barrier bednets target malaria vectors and expand the range of usable insecticides [^81dcad4a]. Nature Microbiology (2020). High credibility.

Transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites occurs when nocturnal Anopheles mosquito vectors feed on human blood. In Africa, where malaria burden is highest, bednets treated with pyrethroid insecticide were highly effective in preventing mosquito bites and reducing transmission, and essential to achieving unprecedented reductions in malaria until 2015 (ref. 1). Since then, progress has stalled 2, and with insecticidal bednets losing efficacy against pyrethroid-resistant Anopheles vectors 3,4, methods that restore performance are urgently needed to eliminate any risk of malaria returning to the levels seen before their widespread use throughout sub-Saharan Africa 5. Here, we show that the primary malaria vector Anopheles gambiae is targeted and killed by small insecticidal net barriers positioned above a standard bednet in a spatial region of high mosquito activity but zero contact with sleepers, opening the way for deploying many more insecticides on bednets than is currently possible. Tested against wild pyrethroid-resistant A. gambiae in Burkina Faso, pyrethroid bednets with organophosphate barriers achieved significantly higher killing rates than bednets alone. Treated barriers on untreated bednets were equally effective, without significant loss of personal protection. Mathematical modelling of transmission dynamics predicted reductions in clinical malaria incidence with barrier bednets that matched those of 'next-generation' nets recommended by the World Health Organization against resistant vectors. Mathematical models of mosquito-barrier interactions identified alternative barrier designs to increase performance. Barrier bednets that overcome insecticide resistance are feasible using existing insecticides and production technology, and early implementation of affordable vector control tools is a realistic prospect.

Interrupting the transmission of Chagas' disease using insecticide-treated materials could be a cost-effective option, particularly for sylvatic vectors, which enter houses at night. A randomized trial was undertaken that included all houses in two communities in regions endemic for this disease, one in Venezuela (50 houses) and one in Colombia (47 houses). After a baseline study (including a short questionnaire survey, entomologic assessment, and Chagas' disease serology), each household was randomly allocated to either the intervention group, which used pyrethroid-impregnated bed nets, or the control group, which used unimpregnated bed nets. Serologic analysis of children in the baseline study showed active transmission of Chagas' disease in the Venezuelan community (10.7% of 103 children were positive), but none in the Colombian community (0% of 100 children were positive). Vectors were sylvatic and bugs entered the houses at night in both communities. The efficacy of pyrethroids against triatomine vectors was tested in Venezuela by exposing Rhodnius prolixus to lambdacyhalothrin-impregnated fabrics and in Colombia by residual house spraying with deltamethrin. This randomized trial showed that in both countries users of impregnated bed nets were well protected from vector bites (immediate benefit). The long-term effect on the community was high vector mortality. In Venezuela, all 62 vectors detected (mainly R. robustus) died within 72 hours of contact with impregnated bed nets. In houses that used unimpregnated nets, only 24.5% (13 of 53) of the vectors died (P < 0.001). The vectors most likely came from infested palm trees and they maintained transmission of the disease in this community (28.1% of 629 R. robustus were positive for Trypanosoma cruzi). Bioassays showed that the mortality rate of R. prolixus was 100% on lambda-cyhalothrin-impregnated materials. In addition, in Colombia (the main vector was R. prolixus), the effect of repellent on vectors (driving them away from impregnated nets) was significant. Thus, users of impregnated bed nets are well protected from transmission of Chagas' disease, and vector reduction or elimination can potentially be achieved in areas infested with R. prolixus and R. robustus.

### Bedbugs and infectious diseases [^c69c8a62]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Bedbugs are brown and flat hematophagous insects. The 2 cosmopolite species, Cimex lectularius and Cimex hemipterus, feed on humans and/or domestic animals, and recent outbreaks have been reported in occidental countries. Site assessment for bedbug eradication is complex but can be assured, despite emerging insecticide resistance, by hiring a pest-control manager. The common dermatological presentation of bites is an itchy maculopapular wheal. Urticarial reactions and anaphylaxis can also occur. Bedbugs are suspected of transmitting infectious agents, but no report has yet demonstrated that they are infectious disease vectors. We describe 45 candidate pathogens potentially transmitted by bedbugs, according to their vectorial capacity, in the wild, and vectorial competence, in the laboratory. Because of increasing demands for information about effective control tactics and public health risks of bedbugs, continued research is needed to identify new pathogens in wild Cimex species (spp) and insecticide resistance.

We describe a child with a recurrent pruritic eruption of urticarial, erythematous papules on the face, neck, and extremities. The etiology of her cutaneous lesions was discovered to be a bedbug infestation in the home. The epidemiology, entomology, presentation, and treatment of bedbugs and their bites are discussed.

### Preparedness and response for chikungunya virus introduction in the americas [^5ca827a2]. CDC (2011). Medium credibility.

WHO recommended insecticide products for treatment of mosquito nets — conventional treatment lists the following insecticides and doses: Alpha-cypermethrin (SC 10%, 20–40), Cyfluthrin (EW 5%, 50), Deltamethrin (SC 1%; WT 25%; and WT 25% + Binder, 15–25), Etofenprox (EW 10%, 200), Lambda-cyhalothrin (CS 2.5%, 10–15), and Permethrin (EC 10%, 200–500). Use of IT bednets has the additional benefit of killing mosquitoes that come into contact with the net, which may reduce vector-human contact for other household members. A number of pesticide products may be used to safely treat bednets (Table 6), or long-lasting pretreated nets can be obtained commercially.

### Bed bug (spp.) colonization of human host [^3290c796]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, bed bugs do not spend prolonged periods on their human hosts and retreat to external harborage sites. However, case reports have observed adult bed bugs spending extended periods of time crawling directly on the skin of their human targets and completing life cycles within human clothing. Another case of bed bugs directly colonizing human tissue was reported in a 74-year-old male patient with venous leg ulcers, who exhibited Carex lenticularis nymphs and exuviae within the hyperkeratosis of his right big toe. Chemical nail avulsion successfully eradicated the colony. One month later, the patient's toes remained clear, but bed bugs were found on the patient's clothing, likely indicating reinfection from a heavily infested home. The authors did not indicate whether the patient exhibited cutaneous lesions or received any topical or oral medications.

In our patient, the bed bug infestation was an incidental finding, with regard to his primary reason for hospitalization. Since a lack of sensation alone should not lead to bed bug colonization of human tissue, this finding in a patient lacking independence in activities of daily living raised the concern for potential elder neglect.

Our case describes an unusual finding of bed bug colonization of human tissue. These photophobic arthropods prefer nesting in the dark cracks of the external environment, so it is unclear what prompts human colonization. However, this occurrence likely indicates a mass home infestation and should prompt investigation for neglect.

### Bed bug infestations in an urban environment [^543fd6a2]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) is a wingless, red-brown, blood-sucking insect that grows up to 7 mm in length and has a lifespan from 4 months up to 1 year (Figure 1). Bed bugs hide in cracks and crevices in beds, wooden furniture, floors, and walls during the daytime and emerge at night to feed on their preferred host, humans.

Figure 1
Dorsal and lateral views of a bed bug (Cimex lectularius).

The common bed bug is found worldwide. Infestations are common in the developing world, occurring in settings of unsanitary living conditions and severe crowding. In North America and Western Europe, bed bug infestations became rare during the second half of the 20th century and have been viewed as a condition that occurs in travelers returning from developing countries. However, anecdotal reports suggest that bed bugs are increasingly common in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. This study was conducted to document the magnitude and adverse effects of bed bug infestations in homeless shelters and other locations in Toronto. Ethical and scientific approval was obtained from Toronto Public Health and the St. Michael's Hospital Research Ethics Board. Shelter staff and residents gave informed consent before participation.

### Optimising systemic insecticide use to improve malaria control [^52a62143]. BMJ Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual sprays (IRS) have played significant roles in reducing the burden of malaria. However, several hurdles remain before elimination can be achieved. First, pyrethroids are heavily used in LLINs and, previously, IRS. As a result, the widespread and sustained use of this single class of insecticides has selected for mosquitoes that are resistant to the primary intervention methods. Second, because LLINs and IRS target mosquitoes that feed indoors on humans, mosquitoes have shifted their feeding patterns to avoid exposure. For instance, increasing numbers of mosquitoes have been found to seek their blood meals and/or rest outdoors after a new deployment of bed nets. Some malaria-transmitting mosquitoes avoid indoor interventions by obtaining blood meals from animal hosts. Though livestock cannot act as parasite reservoirs, bites diverted away from human hosts can act as temporary reprieve from insecticide exposure, increasing vector lifespans, and consequently, contributing to perpetuated transmission.

To build on recent gains in malaria vector control, it is critical to develop a method that is effective against pyrethroid resistant, outdoor feeding/resting or plastically zoophagic mosquitoes. A promising solution is systemic insecticides, drugs that render host blood toxic to mosquitoes that take a blood meal. The types of systemic insecticides most relevant to treating mosquitoes are ectoparasiticides, drugs that target ectoparasites (eg, blood-feeding arthropods) and endectocides, drugs that target both endoparasites and ectoparasites. Many of these drugs have a mode of action distinct from pyrethroids, and thus should be effective against mosquitoes regardless of their susceptibility to pyrethroids. These systemic insecticides have been widely used to treat humans, livestock and domestic animals for infections ranging from gastrointestinal and systemic nematodes to blood-feeding parasites.

Head lice infestation is common and mainly affects children of primary school age. Treatments include licensed topical preparations containing conventional chemical insecticides and medical devices. Each of these fail to eradicate head lice in some patients and resistance is a problem with chemical insecticides. Dimeticone 4% lotion (Hedrin - Thornton & Ross) is a new treatment licensed "for the eradication of head lice infestations". Here we consider its place in the context of other options.

### Current treatments for pediculosis capitis [^141ee8b7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Following the increase in prevalence of head lice during the 1990s, research interest in human louse infestation is now greater than at any time since World War I. Problems with treatment, resulting from the selection of populations of lice resistant to insecticides by overuse of some types of product, have triggered an interest in the development of novel therapeutic agents.

Recent Findings

This review first discusses the background to treatment options, basic diagnostic criteria for deciding whether treatment is required and the efficiency of different techniques. Following recent evidence for resistance to insecticides, alternative therapies are examined, including plant-derived essential and fixed oils that are seen by consumers as safer alternatives to pesticides, physically acting preparations and combing options.

Summary

I have found that most diagnostic methods lack evidence of efficacy or effectiveness and the evidence for efficacy of several 'popular' options for alternatives to insecticides in treatment is either scant or missing. Claims related to the activity of some products need to be examined more deeply to determine whether they are of real value.

Bed bug exposure — recommended protective measures include inspecting the premises: Look carefully for bed bugs on mattresses, box springs, bedding, and furniture, particularly built-in furniture with the bed, desk, and closets as a continuous structural unit; bed bug eggs and nymphs are very small and can be easily overlooked. Travelers who observe evidence of bed bug activity — whether it be the bugs themselves or physical signs (e.g., blood spotting on linens) — should seek alternative lodging. Practice luggage precautions: Keep suitcases off the floor at the destination, keep suitcases closed when not in use, remove clothing and needed items (e.g., toiletry bags and shaving kits) from the suitcase only as necessary, and carefully inspect all clothing and other items before returning them to the suitcase.

### Managing head lice in an era of increasing resistance to insecticides [^17c2c823]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Head lice are present in all age groups, however, the peak age for infestation is 7–8 years and the incidence varies throughout the year with higher incidence during the winter. Different insecticides have been used over the past 60 years to manage this condition. There is now strong evidence of insecticide resistance established in many countries to such an extent that some of these chemicals have become obsolete. Resistance to some pediculicides can vary from country to country and region to region within a country. The lack of a local monitoring system of resistance patterns means that parents and pupils are hampered in making an informed decision regarding how to treat head lice. One should no longer assume that treatment failure is due to poor treatment compliance or re-infestation. Clear treatment guidelines drawn up by healthcare professionals with an interest in head lice and taking into account regional/national resistance patterns should be implemented. These guidelines should combine chemical and non-chemical approaches to treatment and be coordinated and regularly reviewed by local public health departments. Drug companies should be made to provide up-to-date efficacy of their products.

### Efficacy of olyset duo, a bednet containing pyriproxyfen and permethrin, versus a permethrin-only net against clinical malaria in an area with highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors in rural burkina faso: a cluster-randomised controlled trial [^031e3bcb]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Substantial reductions in malaria incidence in sub-Saharan Africa have been achieved with massive deployment of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), but pyrethroid resistance threatens control. Burkina Faso is an area with intense malaria transmission and highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors. We assessed the effectiveness of bednets containing permethrin, a pyrethroid, and pyriproxyfen, an insect growth regulator, versus permethrin-only (standard) LLINs against clinical malaria in children younger than 5 years in Banfora, Burkina Faso.

Methods

In this two-group, step-wedge, cluster-randomised, controlled, superiority trial, standard LLINs were incrementally replaced with LLINs treated with permethrin plus pyriproxyfen (PPF) in 40 rural clusters in Burkina Faso. In each cluster, 50 children (aged 6 months to 5 years) were followed up by passive case detection for clinical malaria. Cross-sectional surveys were done at the start and the end of the transmission seasons in 2014 and 2015. We did monthly collections from indoor light traps to estimate vector densities. Primary endpoints were the incidence of clinical malaria, measured by passive case detection, and the entomological inoculation rate. Analyses were adjusted for clustering and for month and health centre. This trial is registered as ISRCTN21853394.

Findings

1980 children were enrolled in the cohort in 2014 and 2157 in 2015. At the end of the study, more than 99% of children slept under a bednet. The incidence of clinical malaria was 2·0 episodes per child-year in the standard LLIN group and 1·5 episodes per child-year in the PPF-treated LLIN group (incidence rate ratio 0·88 [95% CI 0·77–0·99; p = 0·04]). The entomological inoculation rate was 85 (95% CI 63–108) infective bites per transmission season in the standard LLIN group versus 42 (32–52) infective bites per transmission season in the PPF-treated LLIN group (rate ratio 0·49, 95% CI 0·32–0·66; p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

PPF-treated LLINs provide greater protection against clinical malaria than do standard LLINs and could be used as an alternative to standard LLINs in areas with intense transmission of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and highly pyrethroid-resistant vectors.

### House modifications for preventing malaria [^056071c2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Description of the condition

Preventing malaria

Malaria is a life‐threatening parasitic disease caused by Plasmodium species, and is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitoes (WHO 2018). Plasmodium falciparum is responsible for most malaria deaths, and 93% of those deaths occur in Africa. Although malaria can be prevented, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that overall progress in malaria control appears to have plateaued for the first time since the turn of the century (WHO 2017a; WHO 2018). In 2018, there were an estimated 228 million cases worldwide (3 million fewer cases than estimated in 2017), with 85% of cases occurring in 19 sub‐Saharan African countries and India. In sub‐Saharan Africa, malaria primarily affects rural communities, due to the breeding site preferences of the major malaria vectors, Anopheles gambiae sensu lato and Anopheles funestus. These vectors are endophilic (resting and inhabiting indoors), endophagic (indoor‐biting), and night‐biting. These characteristics mean that most malaria transmission occurs indoors (Huho 2013).

Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide‐treated nets (ITNs) have been the most widely used malaria vector control tools to date, and studies have suggested that these tools have made a notable contribution to the reductions in malaria observed in the early 21st century (Bhatt 2015). However, some specialists have commented that these alone will be insufficient to eliminate the disease (Killeen 2014). The current core interventions can fail when few people use the nets, when insecticide spraying coverage is low, or when the vector itself is not amenable to control through these mechanisms (for example, when Anopheles spp. bite outdoors (exophagy) or bite outside the times of bed net use). In addition, widespread insecticide resistance observed across Africa may be contributing to decreased effectiveness of these interventions (Ranson 2016; WHO 2017b).

Box 2
Broadening horizontally delivered options for targeting blood-seeking adult mosquitoes

Improving and extending physical protection of houses and peridomestic spaces :Permanent housing modifications, such as window screening, sealed eaves and closed ceilings, can elicit remarkably high user acceptability, uptake and willingness to pay. Furthermore, mobile mosquito-proofed shelters may extend this approach to migrant lifestyles. In settings where long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and/or indoor residual spraying (IRS) previously performed mosquito population suppression functions, insecticide treatments for such screening materials are readily available. Furthermore, some remarkably simple modifications to houses can turn them into lethal mosquito traps withor withoutinsecticide. Critically, even these new formats that do require insecticide need far less active ingredient per household continuously protected, so implementation of the Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Managementmay actually become affordable in practice.
Extending coverage with solid-phase contact insecticides by treating clothing: Treating even the most basic garments and bed clothes with contact insecticides has long been known to protect against malaria exposure indoors and outdoors. However, this approach can be limited by incomplete body coverage of many clothing practices in tropical climates, as well as restriction to a single pyrethroid insecticide (permethrin) which is safe enough for direct skin contact. While it might be possible to address the former limitation by supplementing with topical repellents applied to exposed skin, these only provide short-lived protection and require frequent reapplications, so they may be too expensive and impractical for effective, continuous, indefinite use in many low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) contexts. Furthermore, their active ingredients are often actually irritants rather than repellents in the strict sense, so they can exacerbate existing inequities by diverting mosquitoes to feed on unprotected non-users nearbyand undermine the impact of existing lethal interventions.
Vapour-phase insecticides for protecting open spaces: Devices which emanate vapour from volatile insecticides or repellents into the air are already widely used in HICs for protection of open spaces where people are usually awake and active. Encouragingly, one of the most widely used of these existing vapour-phase insecticides has recently been reformulated into low-technology emanator formats that provide protection lasting several months, at costs that should be affordable even in LMICs. While transfluthrin, and several similarly volatile pyrethroids, are often described as spatial repellents, they can actually incapacitateor even kill mosquitoes. They are therefore described here as vapour-phase insecticides, to distinguish them from repellents and irritants in the strict sense, which may be associated with considerable limitations, disadvantages and risks.
Odour-baited traps targeting host-seeking mosquitoes: Recent large-scale epidemiological trials have conclusively demonstrated mass suppression of the notoriously efficient African vector Anopheles funestus, and dramatically reduced malaria transmission by this widely distributed mosquito. These solar-powered traps are entirely self-sufficient in terms of electrical power and also provide sufficient surplus to provide household lighting and charge mobile phones. Given these direct benefits at the household level, irrespective of the impact on mosquitoes or malaria transmission, it may therefore be possible to distribute such traps programmatically through horizontal delivery mechanisms. Efficacy against a wider diversity of vector species will, however, require the development of affordable sources of carbon dioxide, or low-bulk substitutes for it.
Veterinary insecticides to target vectors feeding on livestock: Most malaria vector species prefer animals over humansand are particularly dependent on cattle as a source of blood. A diverse range of advanced veterinary insecticide products exist for treating livestock animals, many of which could be readily repurposed for population suppression of malaria vectors through existing LMIC agricultural extension and market subsidy systems. Targeting insecticide treatments to livestock can achieve the same kind of population suppression of mosquitoes which usually feed on animals, in the same way that LLINs and IRS dofor human-specialised vectors. A particularly attractive aspect of targeting malaria vectors when they attack livestock is that there are already strong markets, subsidies, delivery systems and market intervention experience with these products in LMICS.

### Infection does not decrease survival or reproduction of the common bed bug [^da5bd646]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Although not presently implicated as a vector of human pathogens, the common bed bug, Cimex lectularius, has been suspected of carrying human pathogens because of its close association with humans and its obligate hematophagy. Recently, we characterized the vectorial competence of C. lectularius for the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We observed that C. lectularius can acquire T. cruzi infection when fed on T. cruzi -carrying mice, and subsequently transmit T. cruzi to uninfected mice. This led us to ask why has C. lectularius not been implicated in the transmission of T. cruzi outside of the laboratory? We hypothesized that T. cruzi reduces C. lectularius fitness (i.e., survival and/or reproduction) as an explanation for why C. lectularius does not to transmit T. cruzi in natural settings. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the survival and reproduction of uninfected and T. cruzi -infected C. lectularius. We observed that T. cruzi had a variable effect on C. lectularius survival and reproduction. There were negligible differences between treatments in juveniles. Infected adult females tended to live longer and produce more eggs. However, no effect was consistent, and infected bugs showed more variation in survival and reproduction metrics than control bugs. We did not observe any negative effects of T. cruzi infection on C. lectularius survival or reproduction, suggesting that decreased fitness in T. cruzi -infected C. lectularius is not why bed bugs have not been observed to transmit T. cruzi in natural settings.

Resources for Health Professionals Treatment Minimal symptomatic treatment and good hygiene to prevent itching and secondary infections are usually sufficient treatment for most cases of bed bug bites. A wide range of empirical treatments, including antibiotics, antihistamines, topical and oral corticosteroids, and epinephrine have been used for bite reactions with varying results. Treatment options for cutaneous and systemic reactions from bed bug bites have not been evaluated in clinical trials and there is no evidence that outcomes differ significantly from those receiving no treatment. In more extensive or severe cases, topical steroid creams with or without systemic anti-H1 receptor antihistaminics may be given.

### A linkage map and QTL analysis for pyrethroid resistance in the bed bug cimex lectularius [^b4cad036]. G3 (2016). Low credibility.

In addition to multiple resistance mechanisms, bed bug metapopulation structure may further promote the spread of resistance alleles. For example, if an insecticide-resistant individual enters a (usually inbred;) bed bug population, both heterosis, and the introduction of resistance alleles, may lead to the rapid recovery of a population and spread of resistance. Rapid selection to environmental disturbance can be prevalent in metapopulations, and this may also have contributed to the rapid spread of resistance mutations in bed bug populations both in the United States and Europe.

To conclude, our mapping cross identified a QTL in close proximity to a number of candidate genes related to pyrethroid resistance, and thereby provides strong evidence that these candidate genes play a major role in determining survival following pesticide treatment. Functional assays and higher resolution QTL approaches should now investigate the exact mechanism by which these genes convey resistance. The recent availability of the bed bug genome, complete with a full list of potential candidate genes related to insecticide resistance, in addition to the linkage map generated here, will provide an excellent resource for future research on the development and spread of insecticide resistance in the bed bug.

### Caring for patients with bed bug bites… [^2e58b65f]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Most bed bug bites require only minimal symptomatic treatment and good hygiene to prevent secondary infection.
- If needed, use topical steroid creams for severe cases.
- Secondary infections may require antibiotics. Treatment recommendations Minimal symptomatic treatment to prevent itching is usually sufficient treatment for most cases of bed bug bites. Avoiding scratching the bites, and good hygiene, are important to avoid secondary infections. A wide range of empirical treatments, including antibiotics, antihistamines, topical and oral corticosteroids, and epinephrine have been used for bites and their sequelae with varying results. Treatment options for cutaneous and systemic reactions from bed bug bites have not been evaluated in clinical trials. There is no evidence that outcomes differ significantly from those receiving no treatment.

In more extensive or severe bite reactions, topical steroid creams with or without systemic anti-H1 receptor antihistaminics may be helpful in controlling symptoms. Topical or systemic antibiotics may be needed in the case of secondary infection.

### The changes in mosquito vector behaviour and the emerging resistance to insecticides will challenge the decline of malaria [^9901e860]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

The preventive measures against malaria recommended by the WHO include anti-vector procedures such as indoor residual spraying, the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed-nets, and the destruction of larval breeding sites. The presence of insecticide-treated materials inside the mosquito habitat has consequences for the vector's population, reducing density, survival, contact with humans, and feeding frequency. However, the effectiveness of these tools is being challenged by the emergence of insecticide resistance. The evolution of resistance to insecticides in Anopheles threatens to thwart the goal of decreasing malaria transmission, in an arms race between malaria control programmes and the vector populations. Multiple mechanisms of resistance to insecticides have been observed in Anopheles populations, including target site mutation (knockdown resistance), increased metabolic detoxification, and remarkable behavioural adaptation. These disturbing observations all show the capacity of Anopheles to adapt to and circumvent strategies aimed at reducing malaria transmission. Thus, by using nets to protect ourselves, are we providing Anopheles with the entire arsenal needed to hit much harder?

### Comparison of novel sandfly control interventions: a pilot study in Bangladesh [^85156acc]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

IWP containing three insecticides is a new tool for vector control and was the intervention of interest in this study. Although it was developed and had been used for pest control, studies in Africa have demonstrated its usefulness for controlling Anopheles, the malaria vector, a finding that encouraged us to investigate its efficacy on sandflies. Moreover, a recent study from Nepal found IWP effective for sandfly control. In this study, we compared its efficacy against DWL, ITN, and IRS and found IWP to be the most powerful tool for sandfly density control because it maintained a low sandfly density for a longer period and has comparable sandfly killing effects to DWL. The IWP cluster differed from other clusters regarding some covariates (e.g. having a cattle shed in the HH, animals such as a cow or goat in the HH, use of bednets, use of mosquito coil). We minimized their potential impact on sandfly density using the DID regression model during comparison of the relative efficacy of IWP against the other interventions. It will be interesting to have longer term results to determine how the insecticide capacity of the tools evolve with time, and hence how often the intervention must be renewed.

### More than skin deep: severe iron deficiency anemia and eosinophilia associated with pediculosis capitis and corporis infestation [^c04d78ea]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Body lice infestation reflects poor personal hygiene. Infested individuals should be bathed. Clothing/bedding should be discarded or washed in hot water (≥ 130°F) with high-heat machine drying. Although in our case, permethrin was administered before dermatology consultation, pediculicides are generally not required to treat body lice. In contrast, head lice infestation requires use of a topical pediculicide followed by removal of remaining lice with a nit comb every 2 to 3 days to decrease possibility of reinfestation. Depending on the pediculicide used, repeat treatment 7 to 10 days later may be needed to kill hatched lice before new eggs are produced, as many treatments are partially ovicidal.

Pediculosis continues to be a significant ailment on a global scale, including in the United States and Europe, where it is an increasingly relevant health condition because of growing homeless and migrant populations. Health care providers should utilize physical examination findings and clothing inspection to make the diagnosis of pediculosis corporis. In patients with heavy or prolonged pediculosis, health care providers have a potentially critical opportunity to identify iron deficiency anemia that may otherwise remain undetected until end-organ damage has occurred. Clinical relevance of eosinophilia in lice infestation is unclear. Body lice remain key vectors for contemporary B quintana, B recurrentis, and R prowazekii infections.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for scabies, more specifically with respect to decontamination measures, IUSTI 2017 guidelines recommend to decontaminate clothing, bedding, towels and other items with one of the following methods:

- laundering with a washing machine (≥ 50 °C or ≥ 122 °F)

- dry-cleaning

- storing in a sealed plastic bag for 1 week.

### Bedbugs and infectious diseases [^3041a105]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Figure 4.
Hiding places of begbugs (Cimex lecturarius or Cimex hemipterus). An efficient search-and-destroy operation against bedbugs (A) must start by removing the mattress (B) and box springs (C), then by exploring the floor close to the bed (D) and curtains (E, F) to identify and destroy eggs, nymphs, and adults.

Figure 5.
Presentation of bedbug (Cimex lecturarius or Cimex hemipterus) bites: forms vary from asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic to purpuric, vesicular, and bullous lesions. The typical skin lesion is a pruritic erythematous maculopapule that is 5 mm to 2 cm in diameter with a central hemorrhagic crust or vesicle at the bite site, similar to other arthropod bites (A). A series of bites in a line is characteristic of bedbug bites (B). Lesion numbers range from a few to numerous, depending on habitat-infestation intensity, and are preferentially located in unclothed zones (C). In some cases, the eruption mimics urticaria (D).

Bedbugs have been suspected of transmitting infectious agents; over 40 microorganisms have frequently been considered strong candidates. In contrast to that for mosquitoes or ticks, the literature evidence level for disease transmission by bedbugs is very heterogeneous and sometimes incomplete.

Several steps are mandatory to demonstrate the causal relationship between a vector and a disease. The first is vector competence — that is, an attempt must be made to demonstrate by laboratory experiments an arthropod's ability to acquire an infectious agent from another animal or infected blood, to maintain or amplify it, and then to transmit it to another animal. Only successful demonstration of all of these abilities permits consideration of the vector as competent, but this remains insufficient to designate an arthropod as an effective vector for a defined infectious agent. Vector competence is invariable for a defined arthropod–pathogen couple. Location, climate, and entomological, ethological, and/or epidemiological parameters that may interfere in effective transmission must also be considered. This type of study, which is conducted in the wild, enables assessment of the potential vectorial capacity with a mathematical algorithm that includes the number of infected arthropods and the number of bites per night and per person. Vectorial capacity varies for a defined arthropod–microbe couple.

### The efficacy of permethrin-treated bed nets on child mortality and morbidity in Western Kenya II. study design and methods [^e7900b7e]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2003). Low credibility.

This paper describes the study design and methods used in a large community-based, group-randomized, controlled trial of permethrin-treated bed nets (ITNs) in an area with intense, perennial malaria transmission in western Kenya conducted between 1996 and 1999. A multi-disciplinary framework was used to explore the efficacy of ITNs in the reduction of all-cause mortality in children less than five years old, the clinical, entomologic, immunologic, and economic impact of ITNs, the social and behavioral determinants of ITN use, and the use of a geographic information system to allow for spatial analyses of these outcomes. Methodologic difficulties encountered in such large-scale field trials are discussed.

### Bedbugs and healthcare-associated dermatitis, France [^353c9b3d]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Increased worldwide travel and insecticide resistance contribute to the resurgence of bedbug dermatitis. Because the cockroach co-inhabits with bedbugs in the same biotope, as demonstrated by Émile Brumpt in 1936, recent changes in pest-control techniques (i.e. use of selective cockroach-attracting traps that spare bedbugs) could be another factor enabling bedbug reemergence. At this time, healthcare facilities provide a welcoming environment for future bedbug-dermatitis outbreaks.

### Unique features of a global human ectoparasite identified through sequencing of the bed bug genome [^501c32f6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Like blood-feeding ticks and triatomine bugs, but unlike most other blood-feeding insects, bed bugs can survive long periods of starvation between blood meals. This adaptation requires nutrient conservation (for example, lower metabolism) and mechanisms to prevent excessive water loss and dehydration-induced mortality. The latter is specifically dependent on differential expression of aquaporins and heat-shock proteins(Supplementary Notes 3 and 11). In general, genes for heat-shock proteins and autophagy are similar in Cimex and other insect species, suggesting that their differential expression is likely responsible for the extreme dehydration and starvation tolerance noted in bed bugs. These gene sequences will facilitate the discovery of other physiological and behavioural mechanisms underlying the extreme dehydration and starvation tolerance of bed bugs.

The bed bug genome shows strong candidates for the key members of the Toll, Imd and Jak/STAT immune pathways, although the C. lectularius repertoire is arguably more sparse for those pathways than in holometabolous insects. Recognition proteins are under-represented, as are antimicrobial peptides (two recognition proteins and two defensins and a cluster of three diptericin-like peptides; Supplementary Data 29), although the latter are notoriously difficult to identify by sequence similarity. The RNA interference pathway is represented in the C. lectularius genome with multiple paralogues for Dicer, Argonaute and other enzymes required for this defence pathway.
